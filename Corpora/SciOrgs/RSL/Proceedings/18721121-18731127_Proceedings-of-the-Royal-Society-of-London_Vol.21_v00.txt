      Taele I. To show : — First, that in four healthy adults the spirometric
             measurement of the lungs gradually rose and fell four times suc
             cessively in migrating between tropical and temperate climates, and
             we may therefore conclude that it invariably does so ; second, that
             the second rise            and     fall    are    the greater, partly owing to an
             increased range of temperature (3° F.), but chiefly to the freer

      average 23 cubic inches            ; t. e. from 4| to 11, average 8-7 per cent. of the
      spirometric       measurement of the lungs.                        The range might have been
      greater had the thermometric                    range been so ; but it doubtless has its
      healthy physiological limits.                    The tropico-frigid spirometric range is
      probably not much higher, as the bodily temperature in cold regions is
      usually maintained by food, fires, &c. at about the same standard as in
      the temperate zone. This altered spirometric measurement is permanent,
      i. e. lasts as long as the residence in the new zone.
         * This and subsequent facts appear to wan-ant a conclusion formerly expressed, viz.
      that one effect of frequent change of climate is to increase, within certain bounds, the
      vicarious capabilities of excreting organs.

   Table II. shows : — First. That this law prevails between the ages of 14*
and 62, and therefore doubtless at all ages.
   Second. That the rise and fall are greatest at the prime, and decrease
towards either extreme of life.
   Third. That at all ages, and for the same reason, the rise and fall are
greatest in those of largest frame and most full-blooded.
   Fourth. That for the same reason this rise and fall are greater, cceteris
paribus, above than under puberty (marked *), and subsequently in
crease with the growth of the frame.
   Fifth. That the normal expansion of the lungs and chest from growth
only lessens slightly the spirometric reduction under cold, which often
falls below its original standard.
   Sixth. That after mid age the rise and fall, like the spirometric measure
ment itself, diminish with the progressive decay of the frame (cases 68
to 73).
   Seventh. That in extreme old age (case 74) the shrivelling and less
vascular lungs, skin, body, diminishing chest (cases 68, 71), respiratory
and circulatory functions lessen and finally counterbalance the law.
   Eighth. That obesity, i. e. an increased bulk of body, does not interfere
with the last-mentioned effect of advancing age (case 69).
   Ninth. That the rise and fall are not materially interfered with by an
ordinary catarrh (case 55) or asthma (case 56).
   The only exceptions to the law among the 47 cadets were (case 16) a
suspicious chest, which gave no primary increase under heat ; and case
41, which, instead of decreasing under cold, increased by 4 cubic inches
by unusually rapid chest expansion from growth.

      This gives     a difference    of  18 cubic inches     from a 10° F. reduction of
 temperature.           Summer heat and winter cold in temperate latitudes, and
 also the atmosphere of artificially heated or cooled rooms or wards, have
  corresponding results.
     That this spirometric law of climate has little except perhaps a secon
 dary and minor connexion with an increase or decrease in the capacity
 of the bony chest is shown : —
      1 st. By the usual      absence    of any change in the circumference of the
 adult chest when the rise and fall are greatest (Table I., cases 1 and 2).
     2nd. By the slight interference of growth of chest with the manifes
 tations of the law, both in the adult (Table I., cases 3 and 4), and
 especially       the cadets     (Table    II.,  cases  1  to 47)    and junior      officers
 (Table II., cases 48 to 60).
     The spirometric measurement of the lungs is probably occasionally in
 creased by actual chest expansion when an increased respiratory function
 is suddenly required in health or disease.              But this is exceptional ; and
 in emergencies, in cold and warm climates alike, this result is usually
 effected in a more natural and easier way, viz. by increasing the frequency
 of the respiration.
    The only theory that will satisfactorily explain this tropical increase in
the spirometric measurement of the lungs, with its peculiarities, and
correlate it with other apparently opposed respiratory phenomena, such
as slower and gentler inspiration, and also the post mortem lightness of
the lungs observed by Francis and Parkes, is that it arises not from en
largement of the chest, but merely from a change in the relative quantity
of blood and air in the lungs.               The law of the lungs is merely a sequel
of the greater law of the circulation, by which the entire blood-current
is redistributed,         and   either   attracted    surfaceward    by heat or      driven
inward by cold.           The lungs, unaltered in size, contain less blood, actually
and relatively, and more air in the tropics ; they are less vascular, but
more inflated.          The oscillation in the relative proportion of blood and
air follows an inverse ratio, the one rising, for an obvious reason, as the
other falls. It is the rise or fall in the air, and not in the blood, which
corresponds with the rise and fall of temperature.                    Blood is the dis

placing, and air the displaced agent. It is in the blood that the fluc
tuation originates : when heat attracts this surfacewards, the amount
drawn from the lungs is replaced by an equivalent bulk of air ; under cold,
which repels the blood inward, the air is again displaced by an equivalent
of blood*.
    Contrary to previous conviction, based on limited experiment, this
variation in the spirometric measurement of the lungs is no index of the
effect of change of climate on the ordinary breathing.                   Table   III.  shows
that the latter, instead of deepening by heat like the former, does the
reverse, and becomes gentler.            As part of the same general physiological
process, reflection points to this as the more likely sequel, and reconciles
these apparently        conflicting   though allied phenomena.

    * This derivative action of   heated air on the lungs corresponds to that of other deri
vatives, e. g. a hot bath increases their spirometric measurement     by several cubic inches ;
so does a sodorific dose of Dover's powder.       Ordinary slow and prolonged exercise does
 the same by drawing blood to the functionally active muscles; and under violent
exercise and a perspiring skin it rises from 10 to 15 cubic inches, even when the second
 result is taken in the evening, when the reduced temperature should have lessened it in
accordance with the law of climate.       This effect of exercise, however, is not so marked
in the tropics as in temperate regions.
    t This experiment was made by means of an easily inflated bladder, from which the
 air was measured by a graduated glass cylinder.

     Thus in three adults it fell from an average of 17-3 per minute in 56° F.
 to 16-1 in 82° F., and again rose to 17-5 in 53° F. To close observation
it was perceptibly slower and gentler*. However, as in temperate so in
warm regions, the frequency of the respiration varies with the activity
of the skin, purity of the blood, and need of the tissues for oxygen.
Thus my tropical respirations ranged from 11 to 15, average 12-74 per
minute ; the range for the temperate zone being 13£ to 18, average 15-68.
     These three well-marked tropical phenomena, viz. diminished lung
vascularity, slower respiration, and gentler breathing, are closely related,
and together indicate reduced lung work, the reverse for the temperate
zone marking an increased function — thus proving that this varies with
temperature, as with age, sex, height, &c.                     Their aggregate results vary
with individuals, and perhaps races ; but the following is a fair average

 excretion of watery vapour is doubtless correspondingly                             diminished.

 But this and the 1-843          oz. less carbon are perhaps partly excreted by the
 vicariously    active    skin   and   liver ; but how far has yet to be determined.
 But it must be remembered that less carbon has usually to be eliminated
 in the tropics, both from the reduced and often altered ingesta, and
lessened brain and body-tissue waste.
           II.  The Effect of Tropical Climate on            (he  Bodily    Development.
    The following experiments prove that tropical climate, per se, inter
 feres with the normal growth of the body.                   During the voyage forty-eight
cadets, of the impressionable              age of 14£ to 17, were weighed and
measured in height six times at intervals of sixty days, i. e. after four
successive changes of climate, their diet being abundant, fresh, and
healthy.       If lads stop growing, and still more if they lose flesh, it proves
that some unhealthy influence is at work.
Table      VII.   shows   : — First, that tropical heat interferes much with the
       bodily growth and development, as indicated by the weight, retarding
       it in most, and stopping it in some ; second, that temperate climates
       have an opposite influence ; third, that a second exposure to heat
       increases its wasting effect, and also lessens the subsequent building-
       up results of cold.

   As heat thus makes the young shoot rapidly, it might be deemed
favourable       to the bodily development ; but as the results are so different
from those        in Table VII., they cannot be taken as a true index of the
healthiness of tropical climates, and must be studied with those of weight.
    An increasing weight, with either an increasing (Table IX. col. 1) or
even stationary height (col. 2), is a healthy sign; but if youths who
should be       growing in weight and height remain stationary (col. 3), or
remain      of the same height but lose weight (col. 4), or even grow in height
while weight does not increase (col. 5), and still more if height increases
while weight loses (col. 6), their physique must be deteriorating.
 Table    IX.,    with its two columns of averages contrasting these favourable
       and unfavourable signs, gives results similar to Table VII. ; and
       shows : — -first, that tropic heat is unfavourable to the bodily develop
       ment ; second, that cold climates are favourable to it ; third, that
       the   impairing effect of        a second is greater than that                   of  a  first    ex
       posure to heat       ; fourth, that each successive exposure to heat lessens
       still further the bracing influence of cold.

 10             Effects     of Climate  on the Human Economy.         [Nov.    21,
   Both the number who grew and the amount of increase were thus             least
in the tropics.     These     detrimental   fluctuations necessarily affect   both
body and brain.       If, therefore, we would produce strong, healthy, long-
lived officers and seamen, fit for any work or climate, we should not send
them unnecessarily to warm regions while as yet undeveloped lads.
   The following are the chief results and inferences of these experiments      :—
1st. The primary effect of great changes of climate is on the circulation,
      the blood being drawn surfaceward by heat and driven inward by
      cold.
2nd. The secondary and local results are an increase or decrease in             the
      vascularity and function of the various tissues and organs of             the
      entire body — the external increasing under heat, internal under       cold,
      and vice versd.
3rd. Hence in the tropics the vascularity of the adult lungs is reduced          by
      an average of 12 or 13 fluid oz. ; their spirometric measurement           by
      an average of 23 cubic inches ; their function by 18-43 per cent.,       1. 1.
      the use of 36-85 cubic feet less of air daily, excretion of 1-84 oz.     less
      carbon, and 6- 57 per cent. less of watery vapour.
4th. Hence, also, the nephritic vascularity and secretion are reduced in
      the tropics by 17| per cent., and those of the skin increased by 24
      per cent.
5th. In unison with the respiration the circulation is more languid in the
      tropics, as indicated by the reduced (several beats) and perhaps less
      forcible pulse.
6th. Notwithstanding the reduced circulatory and respiratory functions,
     and increased cutaneous exhalation, the temperature of the surface,
     and perhaps that of the blood and body generally, rises about 2° F.
     under tropical heat.
7th. The organs and functions        of animal, like those of vegetable, life are
     affected by great changes of climate, — heat impairing the weight,
      strength, and health, i. e. the physique, at all ages and retarding
     growth in youth      ;  while cold has an opposite effect.
8th. For obvious reasons these results vary with sex, temperament, size,
     &c. ; and are most evident in the adult, decreasing towards either
     extreme of life.
9th. Collectively these changes are salutary, and meant to assimilate the
     various organs, functions, and body of the inhabitants of one zone to
     those of native races, to meet the requirements of the foreign climate,
     for which they     are not, and perhaps never can be altogether, physio
     logically fitted.

II. " On     the Mechanical Conditions of the Respiratory Move
       ments in Man."           By Arthur Ransome.          Communicated
       by Dr. Sanderson, F.R.S. Received June 22, 1872.
                                   (Abstract.)
    The importance of an accurate measurement of the respiratory move
ments has been recognized by numerous physicians, and many different
methods have already been in use for this purpose ; these methods, how
ever, have hitherto only given either simply the gross enlargement of the
circumference of the chest, or the resultants of the motions of the dif
ferent points on the chest-wall.     Now, owing to the shape and mode of
articulation  of the  ribs, the movements  of any point on either side of the
sternum may take place in three planes at right angles to one another,
and need each to be recorded separately ; and, owing to the variations in
healthy breathing, it is further important that all these movements should
be measured during one act of breathing.
    The stethometer used in the following inquiry accomplished all these
tasks, and measured simultaneously the three dimensions of movement
of any point on the chest-wall.      Graphic representations of these dimen
sions could also be obtained.
    It was necessary to observe forced breathing chiefly ; and it was noticed
that when the button of the instrument was applied either to the middle
of the sternum or on the end of one of the sternal ribs, the chief motions
were forward and upward ; that the forward motion was most equable,
and started much more rapidly at first than the upward movement.
    The earliest portion of the expansive act seems to be accomplished by
an increase of the ordinary action of the diaphragm ; then the chest gra
 dually swells outwards and forwards, the ribs are raised, commencing
 usually at the lower ribs, the costal cartilages are straightened out, the
 head and shoulders are fixed, and the spinal column is curved backwards.
 In expiration after this effort the operation is reversed : variations in
this action may be brought about by disturbing emotions, habit, sugges
 tions from others, or antecedent ideas. Possibly, in consequence of this
fact, the above account differs from that given by Haller, Sabatier, Ma-
jendie, Hutchinson, Sibson, and others. Care was therefore taken to ascer
 tain its correctness, and it was tested, — 1, by fastening tapes of paper
 round the chest, and noticing the order in which they were torn on deep
 inspiration; 2, by simultaneous tracings of the action of the 2nd and
 5th or 6th ribs made, by means of Dr. Burdon Sanderson's stetho-cardic-
 graph, on both males and females.        The curves so produced were then
 carefully examined, and conclusions drawn from them as to the differ
 ences between male and female respiratory movements.          In the Tables
 giving the dimensions of the motions of different points on the chest in
 healthy adult males, amongst other facts certain cases were noticed in
  which  the parallelism    of the movements of the sternum    was  interfered

12          Mr. A. Ransome               on the Mechanical          Conditions        [Nov.        21,
with. Traube's observation as to the influence of the diaphragm on the lower
end of the bone was confirmed.      The clavicles were shown to have more
upward  than forward motion,  and  to move less than either sternum or ribs.
  The ribs move upward more decidedly than the sternum, their rotation
outwards permitting greater freedom.       Their forward push is very con
siderable, greater than that of the sternum, often equalling or exceeding
their upward rise. The upper ribs have sometimes greater forward
thrust than the lower       there is no regular series in this respect in the
                                     ;
different     ribs, but, on the contrary, much evidence of the independent
action of the several ribs.
  The greatest amount of outward motion takes place on the rib about
midway between the vertebral column and the sternum.
  The measurements obtained by means of the stethometer show : —
  1. That the upward dimensions of the movement are sufficiently
accounted for by the upward rise of the ribs, their chord-length being
taken as radius, their vertebral attachments as centres.
   It may be shown also mathematically that the curving of the dorsal
and lumbar regions of the spine in natural respiration would usually in
terfere but slightly with this " upward
                                        "
                                          reading.
  2. The outward                        are also probably to be accounted for by
                                indications
the simple radial           rise of the costal ends of the costal cartilages, the
sternal articulation            being taken as centre.
       The " forward
                      "                           is,
                                        however, much more complex.                                    It
  3.                      movement
could not arise from any simple alteration in the obliquity of the ribs —                        :
  a. Because there       no constant relation to be discovered between the
                                is
             "         "

                                                                ;          itis
tarily, at one time to produce an excess of forward, at another of upward
motion.
  6. Because the angles made by the ribs with the spine are not such as
to permit of the amount of forward movement recorded by the stetho
meter.      This fact
                    proved by measurements of these angles as found
                         is                                                                            in
anatomical drawings, in skeletons, and in the living subject.
  In the latter the amount of forward push not accounted for by the
simple rise of the rib was found to be often as great as 05 in. for the
fifth rib, and 0-7 in. for the third rib. One example out of many                                      of

    4. The excess of forward motion is found not to be explained (a)
by the <7«nou-lever action    of the costal cartilages with the ribs, (6) by the
curvature of the spine, (c) by the backward thrust of the angles of the
ribs.
    5. It  may be concluded, therefore, that the mechanical conditions of the
thoracic    machinery would prevent any forward motion to the extent
observed, unless it was possible for the ribs themselves either to be inbent
or straightened    out.
    6. It  may   be proved that    the ribs are capable of being bent (a) by
experiments upon freshly separated ribs, (6) upon dead subjects, (c) upon
living subjects, (d) by pathological facts.
    7. The means by which an alteration in the chord-lengths of the ribs
could be brought about may be discovered in several directions, especially
in the intrinsic thoracic muscles.
    8. It may be shown that the hypothesis of either the straightening
of the ribs in inspiration, or their previous inbending in expiration, (a)
accounts for the extent of the forward indications of the stethometer, (b)
their varying amount in the same individual in relation to the upward
motion, (c) for the extraordinary extent of these forward indications in
 women and young children as compared with those of strong men and
 old people ; (d) it explains the comparatively         large extent of forward
 movement of the upper as compared with the lower ribs ; (e) it is sup
 ported by the peculiar stethometric measurements obtained in various
 diseases of the lungs ; (/) by the fact that the excess of forward move
 ment is found to increase from the middle to the anterior end of the
 rib.
     On the Respiratory  Motive Powers. — By what means may the inbending
 or straightening of the ribs be accomplished ?
     That the forces concerned in respiration are sufficiently powerful is
 proved by several considerations,    notably by Hutchinson and Haughton's
 calculations  of muscular power.
     The purely mechanical forces are probably not often brought into
 action.    The effect of the extraordinary or external muscles of respira

  14  Mr. W. H.L.Russell on Linear Differential Equations.         [Nov.21,
 tion was not examined by means of the stethometer; but from Mr.
 Le Gros Clark's experiments it would appear that they have but little
 influence in forced inspiration.
    With the intrinsic thoracic muscles the case is different. It is pro
 bable that, with the exception of the levatores costarum, each of these
 muscles has some further power beyond that of simply raising or de
 pressing the ribs.
    The triangularis sterni is more especially a constrictor of the anterior
 part of the thorax.
    The intercostals have very various actions assigned to them ; but when
 all the evidence of Traube, Sibson, and others is considered, it seems
 most probable that the six upper ribs are raised by the external inter
 costals, and depressed by the internal muscles ; but the ribs are not rigid
 bars, and hence these muscles have a further action upon them. From
 careful   experiments upon a model with elastic vulcanite ribs, and
elastic bands stretched between them in the direction of (a) the external
 intercostals, (6) the internal intercostals, and (c) with now the upper ribs
 fixed, now the lower, it was concluded that whilst modifications were in
 troduced into their action by the last-named condition, yet that without
 doubt the tendency of the external intercostals was, 1st, to draw the ribs
 upwards ; 2nd, to separate their anterior ends ; 3rd, to straighten them.
 On the other hand, the action of the internal intercostals was, 1st, to
 draw the ribs downwards ; 2nd, to bring their anterior extremities nearer
together ; 3rd, to bend them inwards. These results were explained by
 resolving the forces of these muscles in the directions (a) along the ribs,
 (6) at right angles to them.
    The diaphragm may also be considered to have an important action        in
 bending the lower ribs.
    Evidence can be adduced showing the value of the stethometer used       in
these inquiries, both in physiological studies and in medical practice.
          III. " On   Linear Differential Equations." —No. VI.
       By W. H. L. Russell, F.R.S.            Received  July  30, 1872.
    We now consider linear differential equations which are satisfied  by the
roots of an algebraical equation admitting of explicit solution.      To  de
termine in what cases the linear differential equation
is satisfied by assuming
when    X, Y,  Z are rational   functions   of (.r).  We shall commence   by

 1872.]        Mr. W. H. L. Russell     on  Linear Differential Equations.            15
supposing them also entire functions of (x).             At present we shall confine
ourselves to the linear differential equation of the second order,
The most general form of solution which this equation will admit                will  be
y={X + v/Y}"-            For if we put y={K + \/Y\", we should have three
particular integrals corresponding to the three cube roots of Y, n being
supposed fractional.
    Substituting in the proposed equation, we shall find, after making some
reductions,

             F=a + Px+yx" + hr; Q=a' + P'x+y'x',                K=a"+/3"a?.
    This will give    us
            ~X.=p-\-qx,   Y=r-\-x.
    For    if we   assumed     either  X   or  Y  to be of higher dimensions, we
 should obtain, on equating the coefficients of the powers of (x) in 2 and 3
 to zero, more equations than the total number of constants in the dif
 ferential     equation and assumed solution.           The number of disposable
 constants is eleven. If we          assumed    X   of two dimensions or Y of two
 dimensions, we should have more than eleven equations.
    Now equate the coefficient of the highest power of (x) in (2) to zero,
 and we have
                                »sa+n(y-a)+i3"=o,
 which determines n independently           of the constants in   X and   Y.
     Similarly, from (3),
                        „(n-l)a-p + !^ + ny+2,3"=0.
  This of course becomes an equation of condition between the coefficients
  of the given differential equation, when we substitute the value of
                                                                                    (n)
  we have     found from the last equation.
     To determine     p, q, r, we proceed as follows : —In equation (3) put x
  successively equal to the three roots of the equation
                                 a+fix+yxt + lxs=0.
  Then we have three equations,         linear in   ii  r, r, from which   these quan

   16   Mr. W. H. L. Russell       on  Linear Differential Equations.            [Nov.    21,
  tities may be determined.           But putting x=0 in equation (1),             the equa
  tion   becomes
             n(n-\)aq*r + na'rpq       +  ^+      a' Vp' +
                                                             ^-^ + a V=0.
  Hence, substituting     for  2-  and   r the values we have just obtained,         we have
  a  linear equation to determine p1 ; hence p, q, r are determined.
      Now, suppose P, Q, R to be such that we may assume
                         H=p+q.v+x", Y=m-\-rx+sx*                    ;
  then the terms of equation (2), which contain the two highest powers                     of
 x, are linear in Y, or we may divide it out in equating their coefficients to
 zero. Hence we may determine q at once.
      Put for x successively in (2) four roots of the equation P=0; then we
 have four equations linear in p', p, m, r, s, whence we have a quadratic
 equation to determine p, and then m, r, s are known. We have beside
 a number of equations of condition.
      Now suppose P, Q, S to be such that we may have
                            ~X.=p    + qx+x3,       Y=r+sx;
 then we      shall find that the terms         which       contained the three highest
 powers of (x) are linear in Y ; consequently p, q, and therefore X, may
 be determined at once.           X being known, we may obtain a series of
 equations easily by which the constants in               Y  may be determined*.         But
 we may adopt a somewhat different method, which will be useful in
 many cases of this nature.          Resuming the equation
          (a+/3*+y*3+te,)0+(a'+/r*+yV)                         J+(a"+/T*)y=0,
 equation (1) shows that       a+(ix+yx*+ Sx' must vanish for every                    quan
 tity which causes X+                to vanish, and equation (3) that the same
 quantity    must  also vanish    for  every" quantity which causes Y to vanish.

every    quantity which makes         X+V/Y-f-v/'Z—      . • - to vanish will make
P vanish; every quantity which makes              T            + . . . to  vanish    will
make P vanish ; every quantity which makes Z + . . . to                    vanish will
make P vanish.         This principle is of course of the greatest           use in de
termining the form of this function.
    The most general form of irrational solution for a linear               differential
equation   of the third order will be {X +        VY}" or {X+J/¥}n-, for             one
of the   fourth order we shall have

where    (n) is supposed to     be fractional.
    In all these cases the determination of (») will be independent of the
constants in X, Y, Z.         For if we expand the proposed forms of solution
in descending powers of (x), substitute in the differential equation, and
equate the coefficient of the highest power of (.r) to zero, we obtain an
equation to determine (n) not involving these constants.
    If X, Y,   Z,  . . . are rational fractions, this method    will not apply     ; but
since the factors      of the denominators of these fractions, not regarding
their powers, must also be factors of P, we may proceed as follows : —
Let x— a=z be one of the factors of P, substitute x=a+z in the given
 differential equation, and let — m be the greatest negative value of fi,
 obtained   by substituting y=di + ~Bz>l+l      ...  in the differential equation,
 and equating the lowest term of the result to zero.            Again, let x—b=z,
 and let — r be the greatest negative value of p, obtained by substituting
 x=b+z in like manner. Then, if we put v=(x— a)m(x— by                       ...  y, we
 may   obtain an equation whose irrational solution will         be free  from nega

of the form           V X,

particular integrals.   Moreover the factors of X must be factors of

finite terms, must be either algebraical, exponential, or logarithmic.                          If
algebraical, they must be either rational or irrational.   The method of
finding the rational algebraical solutions has long been known. We have
endeavoured in the present paper to show how the irrational solutions may
be found for equations of the second order.        We have proved that a
linear differential equation will not admit of a solution of the form /(e1) ;
still less will it admit of a solution of the form/(e"), when u is a function
of (x).  The exponential solution must therefore be of the form Pe",
where  u is an invariant, that       is,
                                       function which remains unchanged
                                           a
whatever algebraical value we may be able to assign to P.    This invariant
enables us to reduce linear differential equations containing exponential
functions to other linear equations involving algebraical functions only.
We have, moreover, shown that logarithmic solutions of linear differen
tial equations must in general be of the form PlogeQ, when               an            P   is
algebraical function satisfying the proposed linear equation, and  can                 Q
 be
   deduced from another linear equation, which we have shown how to
construct.   A great deal remains to be done nevertheless think we see
                                                         ;                    I
not obscurely the true foundations on which the solution of linear dif
ferential equations in finite terms must of necessity rest.

          IV. " On Linear Differential Equations."— No. VII.
    By W. H. L. Russell, F.R.S. Received October 24, 1872.
   I am desirous        to conclude this series of papers with some remarks on the
solutions     of differential        equations considered as transcendents.             I  shall
take the linear differential           equation of the second order,
       (a + £r+ y.v»)         g+     (a + /3'*+ y    V) g + (a" + fl"x + y"a*)y =0,
which   will     be sufficient, as     it will   be seen at once that        similar investiga
tions apply generally.
   Let
                          y=u0+ulx+u2x' + .             . .  +« „.r"+
We propose to investigate the general law of the convergence of this
series.     The general term of the series is given by the equation
                         +(n+lVM„+,4-n/3'u.+(n-l)y'«._,
                         +  aX +0X-1 + y"«-t=0.
As (n) increases without limit, this equation                    becomes
                (n+ 2)(« + l>rt^+(n + 1>/3«.+1 +n(n- l)yu.=0,
or more simply,
This may      be    written
                                a^      _ !5s±!+/j    . !Vf! + y==0.
   Now let         "?±1   converge, as (n) increases without limit, to a certain
quantity    p, then             will also converge toward the           same   quantity  p, and
p will  be given by the equation
                                          apa+/3p    + y=0.
Let pj,  pa be the roots of this equation, p,the greatest root; then the series
uQ+ulx+u3x' + .           . . .  will be convergent         if       is in the limit less than
unity, or    if   #  is less than     -.     For large values of (x) we must proceed
as follows     : —

As (n) increases without limit, this equation may          be written
or
                          a+/3.^=J+y.^.-!^=0.

Let pl be the greatest root of this equation       ;  then the series  will be con
vergent   if   —    is less than unity, or if # be   greater than pr
    It appears   from my last paper that in certain      cases  a  quantity of the
form
                                   a+bx+ V c+ex
may be regarded as a solution of a differential        equation of the form here
considered.       Hence we are able, by means of the principles given in
this paper,   to represent, under these circumstances,
                              f dxs/ a+bx+ V c+ex
by a converging series when (x) does not exceed an ascertainable value.
 This method evidently admits of a great variety of applications.

  1872.]                           President's Address.                            23
     The President then addressed the Society           as follows : —
         Gektlescen,
      commencing the Annual Address which is customary at the Society's
Anniversary Meeting,             I  will first allude to our local position. The
Society's Officers have reason to believe that, before the next Anniversary
Meeting, we may be established in the new apartments now in prepara
tion for us in this Palace.             We hope to find in them rooms for our
Meetings       and    for our  Books    more  convenient than those which we at
present occupy, and to be placed in advantageous proximity to the other
Scientific Societies of the Metropolis.
    On the personnel of the Society, the proper accounts will soon be
placed before you, drawn up under the superintendence of your Secre
taries. But        I  must allude to one loss, the accidental death of our Foreign
Member, M. Delaunay.               Science has,  I fear, sustained a serious injury
by    this  calamity.     It  is  known to all   who   have given attention to the
progress of Gravitational Astronomy, that M. Delaunay had, with incre
dible labour (well exhibited in several ponderous volumes), produced a
work on the lunar motions which was never surpassed in order, and,                  I
believe, never equalled in exactitude.           We were looking for the comple
tion of this undertaking, by careful investigations of the secular equa
tions and equations of very long period on which Chronology in par
 ticular depends, and also by the formation of Lunar Tables in a con
venient form.          There is reason to hope that these works have been far
 advanced and may yet be recovered ; but            I have no positive information
 to that effect.       M. Delaunay, adopting and extending in the Paris Ob
 servatory     all  the labours of his distinguished predecessor, had advanced
 far with an admirable series of systematic records of topographical
 meteorology and other local measures in France.
     I  regret to announce that Dr. Sharpey finds it necessary, in justice not
 only to his own health, but also to his estimate of the powers which he
 is able   to devote to the service of the Society, to resign the office of Secre
 tary    which he has long held with so much advantage to the Society.
 Every Fellow of the Society, but more especially those who have had the
 pleasure of serving on Council with Dr. Sharpey, will,           I  am sure, sympa
  thize with me in regret that we lose his services, and still more that it is
 from the cause which        I have mentioned.      If, however,  the Society should
  see  fit to confirm the Council's recommendation of appointment of Pro
 fessor Huxley in his place,         I  am confident that Dr. Sharpey will be one
  of the first to acknowledge that he transmits his office to no unworthy
  successor.
     Among the labours distributed among Fellows of the Society of which
  the results      do not appear in the Philosophical Transactions are the

24                         Anniversary Meeting.                    [Nov. 30,
following : — The Government-Grant Committee, the Library Committee,
the Donation Committee, and the Scientific Relief Committee have all
been active in their several functions.   The Catalogue of Scientific Papers
to the year 1863 is completed, and will long remain as a testimonial to
the judgment and care of those who have superintended and completed
it. So strong is the sense of the Council on its value (a value to which
I   can personally testify), that they have determined to carry it on to
1873.
    Of the subjects which have been referred by the Government to the
Eoyal Society, and on which the President and Council, assisted by Com
mittees of the Society, have made Eeports, the first in importance is
undoubtedly the course and employment of the Expedition which is now
leaving our shores, for an almost complete circumnavigation            of the
globe, and for a very extensive series of observations, bearing principally
upon natural history, but partly also on ocean-currents, ocean-depths,
and progressive geology.     It is not too much to anticipate that the series
of suggestions offered by the Committee which has given its attention to
these subjects will long be studied by the promoters of future expedi
tions as guides for their own conduct. — Next is to be mentioned the con
sideration of an application, from the German Scientific Bodies, for the
establishment of a self-registering tide-gauge on the island of Heligoland,
to serve for the definition of a zero of elevation for the continent of
Europe with supposed greater accuracy than any that can be obtained on
the continental shores. The President and Council offer their tribute of
respect to the long-sighted view, and the breadth of the considerations,
which, as might be expected, have distinguished the enterprise desired by
their German brethren.       At the same time they have felt it their duty
to indicate a point of tidal theory on which their opinions do not harmo
nize with those that     suggested the observations in question ; and they
 have also alluded to the very great practical difficulties in carrying out
 the proposed construction.    In this state they have submitted the ques
 tion to the British Government. — It is known that an International
 Commission has been sitting in Paris, for the purpose of establishing
 with accuracy the length of the Metre, and for the distribution of accu
 rate copies ; and, with the concurrence of the British Government, your
 Foreign Secretary and the Warden of Standards have taken an active
 part in the deliberations ; and your President would probably have joined
 them if his official employments had permitted it.     I think it imperative
 on me to state that the British Government gave their assent only on the
 express understanding that they could take no part in the Commission if
 it displayed any propagandist intention. Speaking as the representative
 of the body who had best considered this subject, namely the Standards'
 Commission now dormant,      I  can say, as their unanimous opinion, that
 they deprecate the slightest interference with national usages ; but they

                             President's Address.                             25
 recognize the great importance    of an accurate international system which,
 like the Latin of the middle ages, enables men of science in all countries
to speak the same language ; and for this international character they
 think the Metrical system singularly well adapted. — In connexion with
this subject  I  may state that the
                                     " Parliamentary Copy " of the National
 Standard of Length, which is intrusted to the care of the Koyal Society,
 has been examined and found to be in excellent condition:                a very
small modification has been made in its supports, to meet the suggestion
of a possible cause of minute injury in the contacts of the bar with its
bearing-rollers. — As connected with the general science of the country,
I ought not to omit to remind you that your Home Secretaries hold im
portant posts in the Official Scientific Commission which has not yet
terminated its labours.
    I would  next allude to the scientific subjects which within the last
year have    been introduced    at your public meetings, and of which the
                                                      '                '
greater part will be further published in your          Transactions     or your
'
   Proceedings.'   And   as  demanding my     first notice in  every point of
view, whether as referring to the name of the writer or to the subject of
which he treats,   I cite the paper by Sir Edward Sabine on the measures
of the Magnetic Elements in the northern regions of our globe ; a worthy
termination to an unequalled series of arranged results of observation,
which must be adopted as the foundation for all future theoretical inves
tigations of terrestrial magnetism.                                  I
                                         In connexion with this, mention
Captain Evans's collection of the values of magnetic declination on nu
merous points of the British coasts, the magnetic survey of the eastern
districts of France by Messrs. Perry and Sidgreaves, and Mr. Chambers's
determination of the magnetic elements and their changes, and of the
lunar inequalities of magnetic declination, at Bombay.             At the last
Anniversary of the Society attention was called by my predecessor to a
paper by Dr. Hornstein on the existence of a magnetical inequality
whose period is sensibly the same as the length of the sun's synodical
revolution, and which therefore seems to show that different parts of the
sun's surface produce different effects on the magnet.      The examinations
of observations and the discussions of them within this Society have
confirmed Dr. Hornstein's observations for the year in which he ob
served ; and they have added this remarkable result, that in each year a
species of inequality appears to have been sufficiently recurrent with the
 sun's revolution to show itself clearly through accidental irregularities,
but that the law of the inequality varies greatly from year to year. — In
 Chemistry we have various communications, rather on details than on
 principles.  Mr. Schuster's paper on the spectrum of nitrogen points out
 a cause of occasional errors in spectroscopic inferences.     A late commu
 nication from Sir B. C. Brodie appears to prove that ozone is an allo-
 tropic form of oxygen     in which three volumes of oxygen are condensed

  2G                         Anniversary    Meeting.                  [Nov. 30,
  into two, and which may exhibit three forms of action. — In Palaeontology
  we have Professor Owen's paper on the earlier Australian traces of that
  wonderful class of animals (the marsupials) which connect ancient
  Oxfordshire with modern Australia ; Professor Williamson on the or
  ganization of certain fossil plants ; and the Eeport by Mr. Prestwich on
  the exploration of Brixham Cave, referring in some measure to the
  habits of former man as well as former wild beasts. — In Oceanic science,
  the Report by Dr. Carpenter on the currents in the neighbourhood of
  the Straits of Gibraltar (in sequence of preceding papers) embodies im
 portant facts, and has raised some discussions.            Alluding only by a
 word to the discoveries of deep channels in the bottom of the sea and of
 water of different temperatures in them,      I  think it right to state, as my
 opinion,  that the flow  of  surface-water   from   the places of high tempe
 rature, and the return of deep water to the same, are certain in theory
 and are supported by observation. — Mr. Stone's determination             of the
 velocity of sound is free from the effects of a long-prevailing error (the
 combination of two senses), and is probably one of the best yet made. —
 In Astronomy our communications are rich : Mr. De La Sue and his
 fellow labourers have continued their researches upon the influence of
 Planets on the Sun ; Mr. Huggins has employed the telescope, wisely
 provided by a former Council of the Society, and the spectroscope, on the
 spectra of Encke's Comet and of the nebula of Orion (leading us more
 and more distinctly to the idea that these bodies are gaseous and in some
 measure self-luminous), and on that astonishing result of modern science,
 the measure of the approach or recess of the " fixed stars.             It
                                                                "
                                                                             is a
 striking thing to see the stars of a constellation so well known to every
                              "
one as is " Charles's Wain       separated into two classes, of approaching
 and receding ; and also to find that the same separation is indicated by
the characters of their proper motions.        An investigation of the value
of the coefficient of aberration, when the star is viewed through a tele
 scope whose tube is filled with water, may have served to remove some
 doubts on the optical theory of aberration, and to allay some anxieties on
 the reduction of astronomical observations.
    I  think that the opinion of the scientific world would be, that the
proceedings of the Society during the past year will bear comparison with
those of any other year.
    Before closing my Address,     I             I
                                     think that may employ a few sentences
in noticing   some of the steps which have been made in science in the
world exterior to the Society.       In  Geography, the most exciting      of all
is Mr. Stanley's discovery of Livingstone, and the intelligence           of the
explorations made by him and other travellers in South Africa.               But
they tend greatly     to sharpen our curiosity      on  other points.   Are   the
lakes which have been visited so many independent lakes, or are several
of them portions of one great lake      ?   Do these mighty waters reach the

sea by the    Nile or by the Congo     ?   Opinion is advancing fast in the
direction that they are tributaries of the Congo ; that we have, in fact,
" rounded " the basin of the Nile-heads, and perhaps those of some other
rivers.    The observations of Dr. Schweinfurth in a more northerly
district appear to support this idea.       But, however strong may be the
reasons for this conclusion, the world will scarcely be satisfied without
local verification. — Some additions have been made to our knowledge of
the coasts and seas of Novai Zemlai and other polar regions by Ame
rican and other expeditions, especially that of Eosenthal ; but nothing
of striking character has been discovered. — The German Association
for the Europaische Gradmessung continues its labours actively ; its last
Eeports contain details of Geodesy from Norway to Italy, and exhibit the
comparison of various standards of length. —French geodetists have pro
posed the extension of the great French meridional        arc to Algeria, em
ploying a triangulation with sides of about 200 miles.   —  In the progress of
our great Indian Survey, Major Montgomerie (charged with the superin
tendence in Colonel Walker's absence) proposed to himself the problem
of surveying     "the triangular space lying between the Indus and its
great Caubul tributary, which is bounded on the north by the Hindoo-
Koosh and Mustagh ranges."           This has been generally accomplished,
and appears to have opened up the geography of an almost unknown
and difficult country.    It is understood that Russian surveys, though yet
distant, are advancing from the opposite side. — The melancholy account
of the death of Captain Basevi, while engaged in pendulum-experiments
among the Himalaya Mountains, was given by my predecessor to the
last Annual Meeting.       An officer has been named to continue the obser
vations, but the actual work is not yet begun. — Much attention has been
 called to a strange error in the measure of the elevation above the
 sea assigned to the centre of gravity of continents and islands.       Colonel
 Sir Henry James has given probably the first accurate measure of
 surface-height (from which that of the centre of gravity may be inferred)
 on a portion of Scotland. — Perhaps        I may consider it not wholly un
 connected with this subject to state that the galvanic telegraph now
 extends (accidents only excepted) to the south of Australia.      I have some
 pleasure in remarking that the gentleman who has attached the last and
 most difficult link to this chain was Supernumerary Computer and Junior
  Assistant at the Observatory of Greenwich, and was nominated by mo
 for construction of the first telegraph at Adelaide.
     The year's progress in Geology     has consisted principally, I believe, in
  increasing the number and the      accuracy  of the observations of special
  facts, and in giving careful attention to the details of palaeontology.
     Magnetism continues to advance with slow but,     I believe, certain steps.
  Twice in this year it has happened that unusual outbursts on the sun's

surface have been observed (by Father Secchi in Italy, and by Professor
Young in America), and that on each occasion there has been a sudden
magnetic disturbance registered on the Greenwich photographic sheets,
suspiciously near in time.        It may ultimately be necessary to establish
the proper means for sun-observations in Australia or New Zealand, in
order to ascertain whether similar agreements of time occur during the
hours of European night.
   Meteorology, if we could judge only from the number of observatories
and the activity with which their observations are carried on, is making
prodigious    strides.    But  I  doubt greatly whether science really gains
any thing   from   millions  of  observations  which are published with very
few steps of reduction.
   The principal works of the Meteorological Office, the examination of
ships' logs and the deduction of inferences from them, are incessantly
continued   ; the results    are classified by degree-squares, and a specimen
of a ten-degree square has been circulated for public opinion ; also a
detailed exhibition of the state of the North Atlantic for eleven days.
Much light is thrown on the shift of the trade-wind zones.               Daily
weather-charts     are issued, exchanged, and sold to a considerable number,
and the   " drum " signals are exhibited at 128 stations.
   Astronomy      has  made great advances. Adverting, first, to the instru
ments. — It   appears to be certain that in the Great Melbourne Telescope
the principal difficulties are overcome, and the instrument is actually well
and successfully employed on the objects for which it is especially
intended. —The 25-inch refractor at Gateshead, the property of Mr.
E.  S. Newall, has been examined carefully by the most distinguished of
northern astronomers, and its definition has been pronounced to be per
fect. — The spectroscope has undergone various changes of form, all in
the direction of increasing its prismatic separation without injuring its
practical application in other respects. — Adverting, secondly, to the obser
vations and reductions, such as preceded the introduction of the spectro
scope. — The too long-delayed reduction of observations at the Cape of
Good Hope has been urged vigorously by the present Astronomer, Mr.
Stone ; those for 1858 have lately appeared, and others will probably follow
soon, the current work of the present time being still maintained.      In the
mean time observations have been actively made and reduced by Mr.
Ellery at Melbourne.       There is now good prospect of the promotion of ac
curate astronomy in the Southern Hemisphere. — But it is principally in the
results of spectroscopic observations that the great steps have been made.
Much has been done in the examination of Nebulae, Comets, and Auroral
and Zodiacal light     ; but the greatest share of attention has been directed
to the constitution      of the Sun, chiefly as revealed by the observations
made   in total eclipses.    (It would be wrong to omit to mention that Mr.

 1872.]                      President's Address.                               29
Pogson has shown that an annular eclipse is equally available.)         I  cannot
pretend now to describe all the characteristics of the four strata of the
Sun's atmosphere, or the evidence      of their containing various terrestrial
components, or the proofs that they are in different states of temperature ;
nor can    I  describe the phenomena of the corona, or those in the neigh
bourhood of the solar maculae.      Much also has been done by spectroscopic
examination of the sun without eclipse ; and a spectroscopic society in
Italy has employed itself principally on that object. The Lords Com
missioners of the Treasury have sanctioned the establishment, at the Eoyal
Observatory of Greenwich,          of photoheliographic observations (to be
made, during the Transit-of- Venus Expedition, with the Kew Instru
ment, by permission of your Council) and of spectroscopic observations :
the former system, it may be expected, will be in regular                   action
within a few months ; the latter scarcely admits of being carried on
in official routine, but will be occasionally active. — Preparations are
far advanced for publishing a nearly complete report of the Eclipse of
1870; the observations of that of 1871 are not yet entirely collected. —
Nearly all the Governments of the civilized world are engaged in arrange
ments for observation of the Transit of Venus in 1874.           As regards the
British preparations, the original scheme of observations was confined to
eye-observation of the entry and the departure of Venus at the sun's
limb, which      I  regard as the most accurate of all; but, considering
especially   the  risk of weather or accident, it appeared desirable to be pre
pared with a method for utilizing the whole duration of Transit ; and,
at the instance of the Board of Visitors of the Greenwich Observatory,
the Treasury have sanctioned the fitting up of a photoheliograph of the
best class at each of the five British stations.        We are indebted to Mr.
De La Eue for the superintendence of the construction and verification
of these instruments. Several foreign astronomers have turned their
attention to the employment of the heliometer for the same purpose.
   In Chemistry,     there has been much work on details, but scarcely leading
to any great principle.        The theories which have mainly guided the
 observations appear to be those of isomerism, chemical structure, thermo-
 chemical research, and physiological     chemistry.
    The attention given to Botany has been in some measure differently
 apportioned to different states.       In those which contain within their
 own   limits no very great variety        of terrestrial  or  climatic   circum
 stances,   accurate    examination   and   classification have   been studied;
 but in the more extended countries, and most of all in our own territory,
 with its enormous colonial extension, the questions of plant-distribution
 and general biology have been examined, and attention to the structure
 of fossil plants has increased.      The theory of fertilization of plants by
 insects has gained some assent, and the necessity of observing entomology
 in connexion with plant-distribution is partially recognized.

30                                 Anniversary        Meeting.                             [Nov. 30,
     In Medicine,      I learn
                          that researches on the injurious effects of ab
normal    temperature  of  the body (as in fevers), and on the way of
neutralizing them, have been prosecuted with favourable results. The
Sphygmograph has, 1 believe, been successfully employed as an instru
ment of diagnosis.    The alteration of the form of blood-corpuscles under
special circumstances appears to have attracted attention.
     I
    may well appeal to the enumeration which                     I have       made    for proof of
the assertion that science is not standing still.
    For convenience,         I will take the present        opportunity of making            a state
ment, of personal character, which in strictness ought to be offered at a
later stage of this day's proceedings.
   The Council of the Society, in their circulated house-list of Officers
proposed for the Session now commencing, have done me the honour
again to offer my name as President.          Should this be confirmed,
Gentlemen, by your votes,             I
                              will, to the best of my powers, endeavour
to discharge for a period the duties of the office. But experience has
convinced me that      it was no unfounded fear which expressed to the        I
deputation    of the Council who first conveyed to me the flattering invita
tion to the Presidency, that official and other circumstances might make
it difficult for me to give proper attention to the interests of the Society.
I  will therefore ask you, Gentlemen, to permit me in any case to lay
down my office at the next Anniversary Meeting. It may be possible, if
business threatens to press me with the same severity in the autumn of
1873 as in 1872, that          I
                        may desire to be liberated from my engagement
at an earlier date       ;   this, however,       I shall   not contemplate
                                                              long as                 so               I
can avoid doing so.                           I
                        Meantime will express to the Society my feeling
that the position in which they have placed me is the proudest which a
man of science in this country can occupy ; and that the labour which
accompanies      it,
                 so far as  am able to support
                                  I                            it,

I        proceed now to announce the award of the Medals.
   The Copley Medal has been awarded to Professor Friedrich Wohler,
of Gottingen, For. Memb. U.S., for his numerous contributions to the
Science of Chemistry  and more especially for his researches on the pro
                              ;
ducts of the decomposition of Cyanogen by Ammonia on the Derivatives      ;
of Uric Acid    on the Benzoyl Series on Aluminium (discovered by
                 ;                                    ;
him), Yttrium, and Beryllium    on Boron, Silicon, and their compounds
                                          ;                                                        ;
on Titanium    and on Meteoric Stones.
                ;
         Peofessor Miller,
    In    the name of the Council,            I   request that you            will transmit this

Medal to Professor "Wohler, and that you will assure him that his long-
continued     services to the science of Chemistry command our deep
respect.
   A Eoyal Medal        has been awarded to    Mr. Henry John Carter, F.E.S.,
for his researches     in Palaeontology and Zoology, on the Infusoria and
Rhizopoda,     and  the  root-cell of the Cham • but more particularly for his
inquiries into the Natural History of the Spongiadae.
      Professor      Stokes,
   In   the absence of Mr. Carter,       I have much pleasure in delivering to
you,  for  transmission    to him, the Medal awarded to him by the Council
of the Eoyal Society, in acknowledgment             of his long-continued and
valuable    services to Physiology, and more particularly of his creating an
almost   new science     as regards the Spongiada>.
   A Eoyal Medal has       been awarded to Professor Thomas Anderson,    M.D.,
for his investigations on the Organic Bases of Dippel's Animal Oil ; on
Codeine ; on     the Crystallized Constituents of Opium ; on Piperin and on
Papaverin; and for his researches in Physiological and Agricultural
Chemistry.
      Peofxssoe Stokes,
   In Dr. Anderson's        absence,  I request you to state to him that  I am
happy to deliver to him,          through your hands, the Medal which       the
Council has awarded to him, in recognition of his numerous and valuable
contributions to Physiological Chemistry.
   The    Eumford Medal has been awarded to Anders Jonas Angstrom,
For. Memb. E.S., for his researches on Spectral Analysis. The limitation
in time attached to the adjudication        of the Eumford Medal compels the
Council to connect this award with the latest of M. Angstrom's pub
lished memoirs ; but they are not insensible to the circumstance that this
is but the termination of a long and valuable series.
    M. Angstrom's researches generally are described with great clearness
in the late President's      Address at the Anniversary Meeting of 1870. To
 the subjects there mentioned       I have only to add a mathematical theory of
 the Conduction of Heat.
       Professor Miller,
    Have the goodness to transmit this Medal to M. Angstrom, with the
 assurance of our regard for himself and of the great value which we place
 on his researches.

                       ending October 31, 1872.
The Kew Observatory was handed over to the President and Council of
the Eoyal Society by the General Committee of the British Association
at the Edinburgh Meeting in 1871.            Since that time the operations of
the establishment have been conducted under the directions           of the Com
mittee nominated by the President and Council of the Royal Society.
   The most important modifications which have been made in the staff
of the Observatory have     been  : — first,  the appointment of Mr. Samuel
Jeffery as Superintendent,   in the place of Dr. Balfour Stewart, F.E.S.,
who had resigned his office previous to the severance of the connexion
between the Observatory and the British Association ; and, secondly,
the resignation of Mr. Eobert Beckley, who had been for nearly eighteen
years Mechanician, such an official being no longer required.            His con
nexion with the Observatory is not, however, entirely at an end, for he
has  been  appointed Consulting Mechanician        with  a retaining  fee of Ten
Pounds per annum.
   Mr. Eobert H. Scott, F.R.S., has consented, at the request of the
Committee, to act as their Honorary Secretary.
   Magnetic Work. — The series of automatic records of the several Mag-
netographs, viz. Declinometer, Horizontal Force, and Vertical Force instru
ments, have been continued, and the independent absolute determinations
have been, as usual, made monthly.        This latter duty has been, as hereto
fore, performed by Mr. G. M. Whipple, B.Sc., first Assistant, who also
takes charge of the General Magnetic Work, in which he has the assist
ance of Mr. Cullum.      The salaries of these two gentlemen, whose time
is chiefly devoted to magnetic work, amounted during the period under
consideration to £308 2s. 6d., leaving a balance of about £300 out of the
sum of £000 received from the Eoyal Society to meet the general
expenses (£2084 12s. 9d.) of the Observatory.            £767 18s. 5d. of this
amount has been defrayed by the Meteorological                Office and other
sources, such as the £300 received for the payment of arrears from the

                         Report   of the Kew   Committee.                   11
 British Association (the greater part of which has been already ex
pended), fees for verification of instruments,         and payments for new
instruments for foreign observatories, leaving a balance in hand of
£85 5s. 6d. on the 31st of October.
    The state of the Magnetic Eeductions, as exhibited in the Eeport of
the British Association for 1871, remains unaltered, with the exception
of the Tabulations of Declination, which have been extended to the end
of the year 1871.          The discussion of the results has been undertaken
by the Chairman of the Committee, Sir E. Sabine, who has made arrange
ments for the constant attendance at Kew since November 1871 of two
sergeants of the Eoyal Artillery who were formerly located in his office at
Woolwich.         Accommodation     has been provided for them at Kew by
partitioning     off a portion of the Transit Eoom.
    Metcorological Work. — The several self-recording instruments, register
ing respectively the Pressure, Temperature, Vapour-tension, Rain fall, and
Wind, have been maintained in constant action under the superintendence
of   Mr. T. W. Baker, second Assistant, aided by Mr. Foster          ; and the
daily standard eye observations        for control of the photographic records
have been made regularly.
    The instrumental traces with hourly tabulated values are sent monthly
to the Meteorological Office as in former years. The Barograms and Ther
mograms are printed off in duplicate, and one copy is preserved at Kew.
As regards the Anemograms and Rain-records, the copy has been ob
tained by the method of tracing.
     In addition to the regular work of     Kew   as a Magnetical and Meteoro
 logical Observatory,     the duty of examining and checking the work of all
 the seven Self-recording Observatories in connexion with the Meteoro
 logical Office has been carried on in accordance with the method described
 in the Report of the British Association for 1869. This portion of the
 work has been performed by Messrs. Page and Rigby.
     The only change as regards the Meteorological Instruments has been
 the repair    of the shafts which connected the Anemograph on the Dome
 with the registering apparatus.         About the middle of June it was dis
 covered     that the old tubular shafts were split, and they were therefore
  replaced by new ones.
      Pliotoheliograph. — This instrument was regularly worked, as in former
  years, up to the end of February 1872, at which epoch the period expired
  which was originally fixed by Mr. De La Rue for the continuance of the
  observations     at the expense of the Eoyal Society Government-Grant
  Fund.      The observations were afterwards carried on up to the end of
  March, with the object of fully including ten years.      The measurements
  and reductions of the sun-pictures have been continued at the expense
  of Mr. De La Rue, and will be completed during the ensuing year.
   A   scale of equal parts, 15 feet in length, has, with the sanction of Her
   Majesty's Office of Works, been erected temporarily on the Pagoda at

 of determining the optical distortion         any) of that instrument,
                                                            (if                                                in
 order to furnish the final corrections to the reductions of the sun-pictures
 made       with it.
   A  Heliograph for Pulkowa has been placed in the Dome, and photo
graphs have been taken of the scale in order to determine its optical
character.    This instrument has since been removed; but the stages and
preparations for future instruments remain in situ, and will be used for
testing the other instruments to be employed for the observations of the
transit of Venus.
   Since March, when the sun-photograms were discontinued, eye obser
vations of the sun, after the method of Hofrath Schwabe, have been made
with    telescope of
        a                 inches aperture (lent

Foster, in order    that the  observations for connecting sun-spots with
magnetic phenomena might not drop through until photographic records
are taken up on          a   permanent footing.

                                                                   Sir W. Thomson, F.R.S..
was provided           by the Meteorological              Committee in 1869, but has never
been systematically             in operation.        It   was dismounted       early in the year,
in order to be removed to another position.                           Previous to its re-erection
some modifications are required; and accordingly, on     recent visit to         a
London of the maker, Mr. White, of Glasgow, that gentleman came
down to Kew (September 28) and removed      considerable portion of the
                                                                  a

    In  addition  a considerable   number of Instruments have been ordered
on commission        for several foreign and other observatories, and trans
mitted to their respective destinations after verification at Kew. The
list is as follows : —
    A complete set of Magnetographs, on the pattern of the Kew instru
       ments, for Prof. C. Jelinek, Director of the Central-Anstalt fur
       Meteorologie und Erdmagnetismus, Hohe Warte, Vienna.

44                        Report  of the Kew  Committee.
to the Meteorological        Committee, but modified by Mr. Beckley, on the
suggestion    of  Mr.    De  La  Rue, so as to express the velocity by hourly
traces, the pencil returning at the expiration of each hour to the zero-
line, and also to admit of a range to the extent of 100 miles in the hour,
has been tested and found to work satisfactorily.
   Various other Anemometers of different constructions have been under
experiment    ; but from the limitation of the space forming the Observatory
garden, by trees, &c., it was not practicable to test thoroughly their re
spective merits.
   Waxed paper for photographic purposes has been supplied to the India
Office (2£ reams), the Meteorological Office (5 reams), and the Lisbon
Observatory         ream).
   Instruction in the use of Magnetical or Meteorological Instruments has
been given to the      following gentlemen : —
   Prof. H. F. Blanford, Meteorological Reporter to the Government of
Bengal, in Meteorological work.
   The Right Eev. the Bishop of Rupert's Land, in Meteorological work.
   Charles Carpmael, Esq., B.A., Assistant to Mr. Kingston, Magnetic
Observatory, Toronto, Canada, in both Magnetical and Meteorological
work.
   Three Officers of the North- American Boundary Commission, in Mag
netical work.
   Three Officers of H.M.S. ' Challenger,' in Magnetical work.
   Instruments and Apparatus. — The several pieces of Apparatus &c.
enumerated in the Inventory (Appendix II. of the Eeport of the British
Association,    1871) have been handed over to the Kew Committee, and
are in their charge.
   In the month of July instructions were received from the Foreign
Office to deliver       to Capt. Anderson,   R.E., an officer attached to  the
North-American Boundary Commission, the Magnetic Instruments             used
by the previous      Commission, which had been deposited at Kew by the
late Major R.     W. Haig, R.A.        Accordingly the following instruments
were given up to Capt. Anderson : —A portable Unifilar, a Dip-circle,
and an Azimuth Compass.
   The last-named instrument, although deposited by Major Haig, was
not mentioned in the letter from the Foreign Office, and it was therefore
issued to Capt. Anderson on loan.
   The Dip-circle mentioned in the last         Kew Report of the British
Association     has   been   lent to His Excellency Major-General     Lefroy,
Governor of Bermuda.
   A   portable Dip-instrument, which had been lent to the Astronomer
Eoyal for a brief period, has been returned by him.
   Buildings. — Some slight alterations have been made in the main
buildings in order to afford additional accommodation.
   A small closet in the Testing-room has been converted into a Lavatory.

                         Report of the Kew Committee.                       43
    An office has been provided for the two Sergeants, R.A., who attend
at Kew, as already reported, by the subdivision of the old Transit Eoom
about midway with a panel partition. The expense of this alteration
has been defrayed by Sir E. Sabine.
    The roofs of the two outer Magnetic houses have been re-covered with
felt, as it was found that they could not be kept perfectly water-tight by
a coating of tar.
    Early in the year, on the application of the Committee, H.M.'s Office
of Woods and Forests sent workmen to clean and paint the interior of the
Observatory, as far as the ground-floor.         This work has been finished,
and the Office has undertaken to complete the basement story in the
course of the next year.
    Library. — The Books enumerated in Appendix III. to the Report of
the Kew Committee of the British Association for 1871 have been left
at Kew.
    A most valuable donation was received in July from the Committee of
the Athenaeum Club, consisting of 77 volumes of books, chiefly Green
wich Observations.
    From Sir E. Sabine a number of volumes of the 4to Magnetical
and Meteorological Eesults from the Colonial Observatories have been
received ; and also a very considerable amount of MS. documents, in
cluding, among others, the original observations       from which the printed
 results above mentioned have been derived.
    A large number of valuable books have been deposited at Kew by Sir
 E. Sabine, who has intimated his intention to present them ultimately to
 the Observatory as a foundation of a Library.

     The last-named gentleman was substituted in May for T. Hill, who
 had resigned in April.
     Visitors. —The Observatory has been honoured during the year by the
  presence of several scientific men of eminence ; amongst these may be
  mentioned    : —

I. " Synthesis of Aromatic       Monamines         by Intramolecular Atomic
       Interchange."      By A. W. Hofmann, M.D., LL.D., F.R.S.
       Received August 22, 1872.
    In  a paper submitted to the German Chemical Society about a year
ago, we proved (Dr. Martius and myself*) that the action of methylic
alcohol on aniline chlorhydrate at a high temperature and under pressure,
far from yielding exclusively methyl- and dimethylaniline, as had been
formerly believed, is capable of causing methylation of the phenyl group,
and thus producing quite a series of higher homologues of dimethylaniline.
    If we endeavour to gain an insight into the mechanism of this reaction,
we are led to assume that in the first instance the chlorhydric acid of the
aniline salt gives rise to the formation of methylic chloride, which in its
turn induces substitution, first in the ammonia fragment, and ultimately
 in the phenyl group itself. If, on the other hand, we remember that a
 tertiary monamine, such as must be formed by the final methylation of the
 ammonia fragment in aniline, when submitted to the action of an alcohol
 chloride, is invariably converted into an ammonium compound, it must
 appear rather strange that, in the process above alluded to, only tertiary,
 and never any quartary bases are observed.
     Under these circumstances the idea very naturally suggested itself of
  submitting the behaviour of quartary compounds at a high temperature
  under pressure to an experimental investigation.
     The simplest compound that could be selected for such an inquiry
  appeared to be trimethylphenylammonium        iodide.

 inquiry, will limit myself for the present to a brief statement of the
 principal results obtained.
    Leaving secondary reactions out of consideration, the transformation
 of the trimethylated        phenylammonium      iodide is represented by the
 following equations   : —

    Accordingly trimethylated phenylammonium iodide, when submitted
 to the action of heat, is transformed, in the first place, into iodhydrate of
 dimethylated methylophenylamine or dimethyltoluidine ; this, in a second
 phase of the reaction, becomes          iodhydrate of monomethylated dhne-
 thylophenylamine or methyl xylidine, which in its turn is ultimately con
 verted into iodhydrate of trimethylophenylamine,        i. e. of cumidine.    The
essential character of the reaction is thus seen to be an intramolecular
 change in the position of the methyl groups.         According to the duration
of the process, there are incorporated in the benzol nucleus, first the methyl
group    of the alcohol iodide, and then successively the two methylic
groups which are stationed in the ammonia fragment.                  The action of
heat on the quartary ammonium compound thus places at our disposal a
simple means of rising from the benzol series itself to the toluol, xylol,
and cumol series, or, generally (for the reaction may probably be utilized in
many other cases), of passing from a less carbonated to a more carbonated
series of compounds.
   In  carrying out the researches, the general results of which are sketched
in the preceding paragraphs, rather considerable quantities of trimethy
lated phenylammonium iodide were consumed.              This    I obtained partly
by methylating pure aniline with methyl iodide, partly by starting from
commercial dimethylaniline, which was most liberally supplied to me by
my friends Drs. Martius and Mendelssohn Bartholdy, having been spe
cially purified for this purpose by Mr. G. Krell, by fractional distillation
in the laboratory of the factory. This purified material was found to boil
between 192° and 200° ; and only few rectifications were necessary in order
to obtain from it dimethyaniline in a state of perfect purity, identical in
every respect with the base prepared by submitting trimethylated phenyl
ammonium hydrate to distillation.           Pure dimethylaniline is a liquid of
0-9553 volume weight, solidifying to a crystalline mass at + 0o,5,and boiling

at 192°.      The boiling-point was repeatedly determined, since it had been
erroneously stated by M. Lauth* to be 202°. The nature of the com
pound was ascertained by the analysis of the beautiful platinum salt

crystallizing in well-formed tables of considerable solubility.
    In the early experiments trimethylated phenylammonium                    iodide was
employed     in the pure state, such as is obtained by crystallization ; sub
sequently, however, it was found to be quite sufficient if 1 mol. of di-
methylaniline was mixed with 1 mol. of methyl iodide, and the compound
thus produced at once submitted to the action of heat.
    The quartary iodide may be exposed to a temperature of 200° for a
considerable     time without undergoing any alteration ; but when heated
for a day to from 220° to 230°, the salt is changed, the whole crystalline
compound being transformed into an amber-yellow viscid mass, exhibit
ing no longer a trace of crystalline structure.                 If   the temperature be
then raised to the melting-point of lead (335°), a further change is mani
fested by the amorphous resinous substance having solidified again to a
hard mass of large radiated, generally rather coloured crystals.                      On
opening the digestion-tubes,        appreciable quantities of uninflammable          gas
are evolved.
    The products formed at moderate and extreme temperatures essen
tially differ from one another.             This is seen at once when the iod-
 hydrates produced in both casjs are decomposed by alkali, and the bases
thus liberated are submitted to distillation in a current of steam. The
volatility of these bases shows the absence of quartary compounds ; but
 whilst the monamines formed at moderate temperatures unite with acids
to extremely soluble salts, which are scarcely to be crystallized, those
 which are produced at high temperatures are found to solidify to rather
 difficultly  soluble,   readily crystallizable salts with acids.           The former
 bases exhibit the characters of tertiary and secondary, the latter ones those
 of primary monamines.          Under these circumstances, it appeared desirable
 separately to examine the products formed in different conditions of
 temperature.

     On submitting the iodhydrates formed at 220°-230° to distillation with
 alkali, a basic oil is obtained which, when rectified after drying over
  hydrate of potassium, boils between 200° and 280°.                By repeated distilla
  tion the boiling-point is considerably lowered, small quantities of sub
  stances boiling beyond the range of the thermometer being separated.
  Finally, by far the greater portion of the bases is found to pass between
  186° and 220°.        This liquid consists of two varieties of dimethyltolui-

at 186° ; the other has the vol. w. 0-9368, and boils at 205°, i. e. 19° higher
than the former one. The nature of these two bases was fixed by the
analysis of their platinum salts,

The two dimethylated toluidines here described obviously correspond
to two of the three modifications of toluidine, and very probably to the
 two liquid modifications.        Dimethyltoluidine, obtained by converting
 solid toluidine into the trimethylated toluylammonium           iodide, and then
 submitting the corresponding hydrate to distillation, has a vol. w. 0-988,
 and boils at 210°. The substance thus obtained, the composition of which
 was likewise established by analysis of the platinum salt, essentially differs
 from the isomeric base boiling at 186° ; it is less easily distinguished from
 the base boiling at 205°, with which more particularly it agrees in odour ;
 in fact these two compounds exhibit only a slight difference of 5° in
 their boiling-points.    Still I believe them to be isomeric, not identical.
    It deserves to be noticed that while the boiling-point of solid toluidine
 (202°), by the introduction of two methyl groups, is raised by 8°, the
 boiling temperature of one of the liquid modifications (198°) is lowered
 by not less than 12°.     Phenomena of this kind have been observed re
 peatedly in the course of this inquiry.
    It has been already mentioned that, in addition to the two dimethylated
 toluidines, the product of the action of heat on trimethylated phenyl-
 ammonium      iodide contains    methylxylidine.     I  have not been able to
 isolate this compound ; but it was not difficult to prove its presence by
 the action of methyl iodide on the mixed bases.          The two dimethylated
 toluidines   are thus converted into quartary iodides ; but, together with
 these compounds, there is formed a tertiary iodhydrate, the base of which
 is readily separated by distillation of the product with an alkali.          The
 base thus liberated has the vol. w. 0-9293, and boils at 196°.           Analysis
 of the platinum salt proved it to be dimethylated xylidine,

of the dimethylated base, it appeared desirable to establish the nature of
the latter by additional experiments.                For this purpose the tertiary
monamine was converted, by means of methyl iodide, into the quartary
compound, the characters of which could not be mistaken, its composition
being moreover established by analysis of the beautiful platinum salt,
                       2[C.              J

    In performing these experiments             I  was astonished     to observe how
difficultly  dimethylxylidine combined with methyl iodide. Digestion at
100° produced       no effect, and only by heating the mixture for many hours
to a  temperature of 150° combination took place, but even then only to a
very small extent.
    It was this indifference of dimethylxylidine towards methyl iodide
which enabled me to discover that small quantities of this compound are
always formed, together with the monomethylated xylidine, when tri-
methylated phenylammonium              iodide is submitted     to the action of heat.
On treating the liquid, chiefly consisting of the two dimethylated toluidines
and of monomethylated           xylidine, with methyl iodide, these bases, as        I
have pointed out, are converted into iodine compounds ; the small quan
tity of dimethylxylidine which as such exists in the liquid remains behind
with the excess of methylic iodide, from which it may easily be sepa
rated by means of hydrochloric acid.
    The formation of dimethylated toluidines and of monomethylated xyli
dine requires     no special explanation      ;  it is due to intramolecular atomic
interchange.

    For the generation of dimethylxylidine it is necessary to supply a
methyl group from without.            I  have, however, already pointed out that,
along with the principal transformation,             several secondary reactions are
taking place    ;  those  I  hope to examine more minutely by-and-by.             Di
methylxylidine, which occurs in comparatively small quantity, obviously
belongs to such a secondary change.             The complementary product is pro
bably monomethyltoluidine,

    Whilst engaged with these experiments,             I have, for the sake of com
 parison, converted a specimen of xylidine obtained from aniline-oil of
 high boiling-point     into dimethylxylidine.        The xylidine employed had a
 constant boiling-point     at 216°. The tertiary base procured from it was ob
  served to boil at 203°, i. e. 7° higher than the compound derived from tri-
  methylated phenylammonium iodide ; from this last derivative it differed,
  moreover, by combining much more readily with methyl iodide.                   The

quartary compound thus formed often remains liquid for days, and then
suddenly solidifies into a beautiful mass of crystals.
         Examination     of the Monamines formed at High Temperatures.
    It has   been  already stated that the bases into which trimethylated
phenylammonium iodide is converted at very high temperatures (melting-
point of lead) unmistakably exhibit the character of primary monamines.
The only primary         base   which  can arise    from   trimethylated phenyl
ammonium iodide by intramolecular atomic interchange              is a trimethylo-
phenylated monamine, i. e. a cumidine.
                  C.  H, (CH,), NI=[C, H, (CH,),] H, N . HI.
This,  I may at    once observe, is indeed the principal product of the re
action.    It cannot, however, be wondered at that, under the influence of
such extreme temperatures, many collateral changes must take place.
The presence of by-products is at once perceived when the crystalline
contents of the digestion-tube are submitted to distillation in a current
of steam. Together with the vapour of water, a colourless oil is volati
lized, consisting of hydrocarbons partly solid, partly liquid, the examina
tion of which will form the subject of a future communication.              Addi
tion of an alkali to the liquid in the retort liberates considerable quan
tities of monamines, which, when dried over sodium hydrate, are observed
to boil between 225° and 260°.           By repeated distillation this range of
boiling is still considerably expanded ; at the same time, by far the largest
portion of the liquid is found to pass between 217° and 230°. The primary
nature not only of this main fraction, but also of the bases having both a
lower and higher boiling-point, is at once manifested by the crystallizing
power and insolubility of the salts which they produce.              At whatever
stage of the distillation a drop of the liquid passing be mixed with dilute
hydrochloric or nitric acid, invariably splendid needles of chlorhydrates or
nitrates are formed, the solutions of which, even when considerably di
luted, solidify with platinum perchloride to double salts generally well
crystallized.   Another experiment rapidly indicating the primary character
of these monamines may here be mentioned.              On adding benzoyl chloride
to the several basic fractions, much heat is evolved ; and after cooling
crystalline masses are produced, which are separated by water into soluble
chlorhydrates and insoluble benzoyl compounds which may be crystallized
from alcohol.      None of the many secondary and tertiary monamines
which have passed through my hands in the course of this inquiry exhibit
this deportment     ;  and accordingly benzoyl chloride may be recommended
as a valuable reagent, readily applicable for primary bases.          The method
of recognizing primary monamines which                I  pointed out some time
ago*,   and which      consists in converting     them,   by means of alcoholic

potash and chloroform, into the powerfully smelling isonitriles, may also
with advantage be resorted to.
     The liquid boiling between 217° and 230° was separated by distillation
into four fractions, each of which was then converted into a magnificently
crystalline chlorhydrate.      These several salts, after recrystallization, were
all found to contain
                            [C,Ha(CH,)3]HaN.HCl,
and to    yield platinum salt of the composition
                      2[[C, H, (CHs)JHa N . H CI] . Pt      Clt.
     I was  thus led to believe that the fraction boiling between 217° and
230° consisted of several isomeric cumidines ; but on separating the bases
from the several chlorhydrates, it was found that they all exhibited very
nearly the same boiling-point. The liquid thus obtained boiled between
225° and 227°, and had the vol. w. 0- 9633 ; it did not solidify when ex
posed to a temperature of — 10°.          I am therefore inclined to assume that
only one cumidine is formed by the action of heat on trimethylated
phenylammonium iodide, and that the irregularities in the boiling-point
of the original fraction must be due to the presence of small quantities of
impurities.
     It deserves to be noticed     that cumidine     obtained from aniline, when
heated    with corrosive sublimate, yields no trace of red colouring-matter,
whilst a splendid crimson is at once produced if a mixture of this base
with pure aniline be treated.        I reserve for a future communication the
study of the colouring-matter thus obtained.
     Taking into consideration the general observations recorded in the pre
ceding paragraphs,      the compound here designated as cumidine was natu
rally assumed to be a primary monamine. Little doubt as this conception
 appeared to present, it had nevertheless to be proved by experiment ;
 for this purpose the base was submitted to methylation.              Cumidine is
 readily acted upon by methylic iodide at the common temperature.            Since
 it  was only necessary to establish the degree of substitution, the first
 product of methylation was at once submitted to a second treatment ;
 this second methylation likewise commenced at the common temperature,
 but had to be finished in the water-bath.          The dimethylated base thus
 obtained had the vol.    w. 0-9076  : it boiled between 213° and 214° ; hence,
  in this case also, the insertion of two methyl groups had lowered the
  boiling-point.    Dimethylcumidine may be cooled to — 10° without solidi
  fying : like all tertiary monamines, it forms very soluble salts, but gives a
  very beautiful   platinum salt, containing
                    2[[C, Ha (CH,),] (CH,)a    N . H CI] . Pt CI,.
      Eemarkably enough, dimethylated cumidine exhibits the same reluctance
   to form a quartary    compound with methyl iodide that has already been
   pointed out as a peculiarity of the tertiary xylidine.   But whilst in the case
   of dimethylxylidine,   though difficultly and sparingly,      combination  after

all took place ; all attempts with dimethylated cumidine have hitherto
failed.    The base was heated with methylic iodide for days in the water-
bath, and ultimately even to 150° without any result.              This inability of
forming quartary compounds must, in one way or another, depend upon
the arrangement of the material within the molecule.                At all events, it
deserves to be noticed        that there are dimethylated xylidines and cumi-
dines which      readily   combine with     methyl iodide.       The dimethylated
bases existing    in the less volatile  fractions of commercial dimethylaniline
all form quartary compounds without difficulty, and must therefore cor
respond to xylidines and cumidines which differ from those derived
from trimethylated phenylammonium iodide.
    In  what relation stands the cumidine above described to the cumidines
already known?          Of the several purely methylic cumidines which are
possible, two only are somewhat accurately known ; these are the two bases
which are derived, the one from so-called pseudocumol (obtained by treating
xylylic bromide and methylic iodide with sodium), the other from mesitylol.
The former cumidine is a solid fusing at 62°, and need not therefore be
further considered here.          Most probably the cumidine above described
will prove    identical  with   the primary monamine corresponding to mesi
tylol. Unfortunately mesitylamine has been hitherto so little studied,
that even its boiling-point is not known.          I hope next winter to examine
more minutely this group of compounds.
    In conclusion,    I  have great pleasure in expressing my best thanks to
Mr. E. Mylius, Assistant in the Berlin Laboratory, for the zeal and care
with which he has furthered the progress of these researches.
II. " Transformation          of Aniline into Toluidine."         By A. W. Hof
        mann, M.D., Ph.D., F.R.S.             Received August 22, 1872.
    Whilst engaged with the experiments described in the previous paper,
I have made some        observations which    I may be allowed    briefly to mention
to the Society, since the coming autumnal            vacation   will suspend work
for a time.
    In  reviewing the experience collected as to the action of high tempe
ratures      upon trimethylated       phenylammonium         iodide, the question
naturally suggested itself whether the transposition of methyl groups,
such as it occurs in the quartary compound, would take place also on
heating tertiary or secondary ammonium salts.            Experiment has answered
this question in the affirmative.
    Generally speaking the phenomena          are exactly what,   from the results
of former observations, might have been expected. It is my intention to
study next winter more soundly the reactions here sketched out ; for the
present    I  may be permitted just to allude to the happy solution of a
problem      with  which during the last few years          I  had repeatedly, but
always unsuccessfully,       been engaged.

and iodhydrate) may be heated to 220° or 230° for hours without under
going any alteration ; but if the temperature be raised to the melting-
point of lead (335°), the methyl group in the ammonia fragment passes

1 molecule of methylic alcohol be heated for some hours to 230°-250°,                   a

    After   a day's exposure         to  a temperature  of 335° the contents of the
digestion-tubes are perfectly altered.             In place of a transparent viscous
resin, they now contain a solid beautifully crystalline mass ; the secon
dary salt has been converted into a primary one.                   The crystalline mass,
unless    the temperature has been too high, dissolves                 in water almost
without a residue ; on addition of alkali to this solution               an oily base is
separated,      which     rises as a    brownish layer to the surface of the liquid.
If   this oily layer be       distilled in a current of steam, a colourless liquid
passes,   which, partly in the cooler, partly in the receiver, solidifies to a
white crystalline mass of toluidine.              There are but few secondary pro
ducts formed in this reaction.
    Toluidine thus obtained, when recrystallized from water, has the
melting-point 45°. Though scarcely necessary, it was identified by a
platinum        determination,        which   gave the value corresponding        to  the
formula

    It deserves to be noticed that methylaniline iodhydrate, when heated
like the chlorhydrate, yielded no solid, but liquid toluidine.              I  must leave
it undecided which of the two liquid toluidines was formed in this case.
    The observations          rapidly sketched in this note invite to new experi
ments in a variety of directions.              Is it possible to obtain by similar pro
cesses homologues of the monamines of other classes, perhaps even
 of some of the bases contained in the organism 'of plants and animals ?
 Already      I have commenced the study of naphthylamine, the behaviour of
 which will be particularly interesting in more than one respect. According
 to some observations published upon this subject, the preparation of
 methylated naphthylamines would appear to present some difficulty ; but
 by working at moderate temperatures,               mono- and dimethylated naphthyl
 amine, as well as the quartary ammonium base, are readily procured.
 The salts of these compounds are remarkable for their power of crys
 tallization    ; I have not     yet found     time to examine their behaviour under
  the influence of heat.

   In  conclusion    I may observe    also that the secondary products of the
action of heat upon trimethylated phenylammonium iodide appear to be
of interest.    A small fraction of the bases, generated at 335°, boils at a
very high temperature     ; when allowed to stand for some time this frac
tion deposits splendid crystals of a monamine which, according to the
analysis of the well-crystallized chlorhydrate and platinum salt, contains
                                   CnHnN;
and the constitution      of which, after   a more   minute  examination,  will
probably prove to be expressed by the formula

   Finally, there is found among these secondary products a beautifully
crystallized hydrocarbon, melting at 13G°, and boiling between 230° and
240°.     Some combustions of this body, which require confirmation, lead
to the simple formula
which determination     of the  gas volume weight   will probably raise to
                               ClaH19

   May     this hydrocarbon     actually be looked upon as sexmethylated
benzol ?    If so, its oxidation promises results which will deserve minute
investigation.

      By A. W. Hofmann, Ph.D., F.R.S., and A. Geygeb, Ph.D.
      Received     July  10, 1872.
                                  II.  Safranine.
   Whilst we were engaged with the study of the blue colouring-matter
produced by the action of aromatic monamines on azodiphenyldiamine
our attention became directed to a beautiful red tar-pigment, which has
been known for some time by the commercial name of Saf ranine, being
extensively used as a substitute for safflower in dyeing silk and cotton.
Safranine has not as yet been minutely examined ; but, as far as can be
judged from the scanty information we possess regarding its production,
it is scarcely doubtful that this important dye must be looked upon as
being the derivative of an azodiamine.          The analysis of safranine thus
promised to throw considerable light upon the nature of the compounds
under examination.
   The starting-point of our studies was the dye such as it occurs in com
merce.      The greater portion of it was supplied to us by Messrs.
Tillmanns, of Crefeld.      Another specimen was received from Dr. J. Wolf,
and for a third one we are indebted to our friend M. Charles Girard,
of Paris. Both the first-mentioned specimens were assigned to us as

1872.]       Colouring-matters from Aromatic Azodiamines                .        57
produced on      the large    scale;   the last was prepared        by    M. Girard
himself.
    Safranine occurs in commerce either        as a solid     body or en pdte. In
the solid state    it forms   a yellowish-red    powder,   in  which, together with
considerable quantities of chalk and common salt, the chlorhydrate of
a tinctorial base may be recognized.              The pure dye is easily sepa
rated from crude safranine.          It is only necessary to exhaust the com
mercial product with boiling water ; on cooling, the filtrate deposits
a   slightly crystalline substance which, after several recrystallizations
from boiling water, leaves no residue on ignition. During these opera
tions, however, the salt undergoes perceptible alteration ; with every
recrystallization it becomes more soluble and less crystalline.               These
alterations depend upon the separation of chlorhydric acid from the salt.
In fact the percentage of chlorine is found to diminish in the product of
successive crystallizations ; thus the product of the third contained 8-48
per cent., that of the fourth crystallization only 7-46 per cent.             Addi
tion of chlorhydric acid to the mother-liquors               at once reproduces a
crystalline precipitate.     This instability of the chlorhydrate, and in fact,
as may even now be stated, of the salts of safranine in general, has very
considerably impeded the study of this body, and often materially affected
the accuracy of the analytical results.          In order to obtain the normal
salt, the boiling liquid during the       last  crystallization had always to be
acidified with chlorhydric acid.
     Safranine chlorhydrate separates in fine reddish crystals from the acid
 solution on cooling ; an appreciable quantity of the compound, however,
 remains in solution.      The salt dissolves both in water and alcohol, more
 readily   when  hot than  when   cold ; it is insoluble in ether, as also in con
 centrated saline solutions.     The alcoholic solution, like the aqueous, is of
 a deep reddish-yellow colour ; it exhibits a peculiar fluorescence, which in
 a measure recalls that of Magdala-red.          Ether precipitates the salt from
 the alcoholic solution.      Numerous analyses which we have made of
 this salt lead to the following two formulae : —
                          C^N.ClandC^H^Cl,
 the theoretical values of which agree almost equally well with the averages
  of the experimental numbers.         We were doubtful at first to which of
  these   two formulae preference should be given. Indeed the assumption
  of  twenty atoms of carbon in the molecule of safranine had its seductions ;
  however, the values of the second formula agree perhaps somewhat better
  with the results of analysis.     Indeed we found invariably somewhat less
  nitrogen than the quantity required by the former formula, whilst it is
  well known that the volumetric method invariably gives an excess ; so that
  we should have adopted the second formula,         even if later experiments on
  the preparation   of safranine had not altogether excluded the former one.
      Platinum salt of safranine. —The numbers obtained in the analysis of

 the chlorhydrate     are confirmed by the investigation of the platinum salt.
 This compound is obtained by precipitating a solution of the chlorhydrate
  by excess of platinum perchloride ; dilute hydrochloric acid must be used
 to wash this precipitate, as pure water appears to decompose it. The
 platinum salt forms a yellowish-red crystalline powder, nearly insoluble in
 water, alcohol, and ether.
    If the  salt suspended in boiling water be treated with sulphhydric acid,
 sulphide of platinum is slowly formed, whilst unaltered chlorhydrate of
 saf ranine remains in solution.     The analysis of the salt, dried at 100°, gave
 numbers corresponding       to the formula
                           2(CaH,,N4.HCl).Pt€l4.
    Free base. — In order to prepare some other salts of saf ranine it was
 necessary to obtain the free base.         Remembering, when first we com
 menced the study of this new compound, the properties of the tinctorial
 ammonias in general, we endeavoured to precipitate the base from the
 chlorhydrate by alkalies.      Ammonia, however, is without any action what
 ever on salts of saf ranine    ; and only in the most concentrated solutions
 does soda produce a precipitate which immediately redissolves on addition
 of water. This precipitate is obviously nothing but chlorhydrate rendered
 insoluble   by the sodium chloride formed, or by the concentrated soda
 solution.    Free safranine being soluble in water, there remained no other
 process for liberating the base than treatment of the chlorhydrate with
 silver oxide. On evaporating the deep yellowish-red coloured liquid ob
 tained in this way, a deposit of red-brown crystals is formed on cooling,
 which while moist scarcely differ from those of the chlorhydrate, but when
 dried at 100° assume a greenish metallic lustre.         Free safranine easily
 dissolves in water and alcohol, but is insoluble in ether.           Addition of
 chlorhydric acid to the aqueous solution at once reproduces the crystal
line chlorhydrate.       We have not been fortunate enough to obtain free
safranine in a state of perfect purity ; the solution invariably retains a
small quantity of silver chloride,       which separates with the crystallizing
product ; it may be recognized by burning the base, when a small incom
bustible residue is left.     If the chlorhydrate be reproduced from the free
base, so much      silver chloride is mixed with the salt, that the percentage
of chlorine, found on analysis, is appreciably raised. An estimation of
chlorine in the chlorhydrate thus prepared gave 10-8 per cent. instead
of 9- 74. Free safranine, however, may be used without difficulty in the
preparation of other salts, the nitrate for instance.
    Safranine nitrate is easily obtained when an excess of dilute nitric acid
is added to a hot aqueous solution of the free base.             On cooling the
salt crystallizes in red-brown needles, which are very insoluble in cold,
but readily dissolve in boiling water.       They are considerably more soluble
in alcohol than in water. The nitrate is decidedly less soluble than the
chlorhydrate ; a solution from which the latter salt has been thrown down
by chlorhydric acid still gives a precipitate with nitric acid.

    The analysis of the nitrate, dried at 100°, leads to the formula

    Safranine picrate.
                       — We have finally investigated the picrate.         It  is
obtained by simply adding an aqueous solution of picric acid to the
mother-liquors of the chlorhydrate or nitrate, and washing the precipitate
thus formed with water.         The picrate forms red-brown needles, which
are insoluble in water, alcohol, and ether.
   Analysis gave results corresponding to those obtained in the in
vestigation of the chlorhydrate, the platinum salt, and the nitrate, and
leading to the formula
                  C„ H„ N7 07=C31 HM N4      . C, H, (NO,), O.
We    have  no further analytical data to offer at present. A brief notice of
several   other salts we have prepared may, however, still be appended.
   Safranine bromhydrate is deposited on addition of bromhydric acid to a
solution of the base as a crystalline powder, consisting of microscopic
needles, which are so insoluble in water that the liquid from which they
have been precipitated appears almost colourless.        The salt is soluble in
boiling water, from which it crystallizes on cooling.        It is worth men
tioning   that, on adding bromine water to a solution of the chlorhydrate,
a red crystalline precipitate is formed, which is difficultly soluble in cold
water, but may recrystallize from boiling water.          In this way needle-
shaped crystals are obtained which, when pure, possess a green metallic
lustre.    They have not yet been analyzed.
   The iodhydrate, as regards      preparation    and properties,  is perfectly
similar to the bromhydrate.
   The sulphate of safranine is a rather soluble salt ; only in the most
concentrated aqueous solution of the base is a precipitate produced on
addition of dilute sulphuric acid ; the salt dissolves on heating the liquid,
and is again deposited on cooling in the form of fine needles.
   The oxalate behaves very similarly, but is a little less soluble than the
sulphate ; with acetic acid the base gives no precipitate ; by spontaneous
evaporation the acetate separates in rather indistinct crystals.
    All  the salts of safranine exhibit a very characteristic reaction ; on
adding chlorhydric or sulphuric acid to the solution of the salt, the
 red-brown colour of the liquid changes to a beautiful violet, which, on
 addition of more acid, becomes a deep blue, then a dark green, and finally
 a bright green ; if the acid liquid be slowly diluted with water, these
 changes   of colour may be observed   in inverse order.
    It need scarcely be mentioned that in the course of this investigation
 our attention has been repeatedly directed towards the preparation of
 safranine ; it may, however, at once be stated that our experiments on
 this subject have yielded but scanty results.      As yet but little is known
 regarding the preparation of safranine on a large scale.      According to a

  60         Colouring-matters from Aromatic Azodiamines.                   [Dec. 5,
 brief notice published by Mene *, saf ranine is obtained by treating aniline
 successively with nitrous and arsenic acids ; this process very closely
 agrees with the method by which M. Girard, as he informs us, has pre
 pared the specimen transmitted to us. We have, moreover, to thank M.
  Girard for pointing out that aniline of a very high boiling-point is
 especially adapted to the preparation of safranine.
    After some practice we have been able, by working according to these
 indications, to obtain safranine with all the properties of the commercial
 product.     The yield, however, was always very small, an exceedingly
 large quantity of but little attractive by-products being invariably formed.
 Somewhat      more satisfactory results were obtained when chromic instead
 of arsenic acid was used        as oxidizing  agent.   Our experiments, though
 unsuccessful    as regards the discovery of a        good method for preparing
 safranine,   nevertheless appear to supply some            welcome      indications
 as to the real source of the colouring-matter.             Neither from pure
 aniline nor     from    solid toluidine      have we been able to obtain safra
 nine by the above-mentioned process; nor did a mixture of pure
 aniline and solid toluidine yield a better result.                       We have,
 however, invariably obtained safranine when liquid toluidine, boiling
at 198°, was used for the experiment.         This colouring-matter    thus appears
to become a pure derivative of toluidine, and the formula
to which analysis had led, is corroborated, as far, at all events, as the
number of carbon-atoms in the molecule of safranine is concerned, in a
most satisfactory manner by the formation of this body.             In this forma
tion, as in that of rosaniline       and of the allied tinctorial ammonias, 3
mols. of monamine associate with a complex molecule, 3 atoms of hydrogen
in which are displaced by one of nitrogen, 4 atoms of hydrogen being,
moreover, removed by oxidation.

   A   glance at the safranine formula with its four nitrogen-atoms           recalls

In   fact safranine     salts yield a violet colouring-matter when boiled for
some time with aniline ; again, safranine and mauveine exhibit nearly the
same     changes of colour under the influence of concentrated acids.

 Further, from a short notice published some years ago by Mr. Perkin *,
 safranine appears to be a by-product in the preparation of mauveine.
   Belations such as suggested by the above formulae must, however, be
received  with great caution. The violet colouring-matter derived from
safranine by phenylation has not as yet been further characterized.
No great stress can be laid on the similar colour-reactions with acids
exhibited by both bases, since the methylated rosanilines, on treatment
with acids, also become first blue and then green.           Moreover it is doubtful
whether the base obtained by Mr. Perkin as a secondary product in the
manufacture of mauveine really is the same safranine which we have
investigated, inasmuch as some preliminary analyses have led him to a
very different   composition,    which appears to be expressed by the formula
                                      C18H„N4.
Finally, the composition of mauveine itself cannot be looked upon as
established above all question ; at least Mr. Perkin t seems still to hesitate
between the formula
which appears to result from more recent experiments, and the formula
                                      C„HMN4,
previously announced by him.
   The relations here pointed out are, however, well worthy of a thorough
experimental investigation.        As we intend to continue this inquiry, an
opportunity may present itself for their further elucidation.

analogous to that observed with the phenyl mustard-oil, it was to be
expected that 1 molecule of this body would react with 3 molecules of
acetic acid to produce 1 molecule of potassium acetate and 1 molecule of
diacetamide, carbonic anhydride and sulphuretted hydrogen being evolved.
  KCNS + 3(0, H, 0 . OH) = Ca H, O . OK + (C, H3 0)aHN + CO, + H, 8.
The reaction, however, takes a different course.
    In my first experiments the acetic acid was allowed to react on the
sulphocyanate under pressure ; but it soon became evident that this was
unnecessary, simple digestion of the two bodies in a flask provided with
an upright condenser being amply sufficient.
    The powdered salt dissolves readily in the boiling acid, and an imme
diate and copious disengagement of gas ensues, in which carbonic an
hydride and sulphuretted hydrogen may be readily recognized.                     Con
siderable time, however, elapses before the sulphocyanate is completely
decomposed, some three or four days being required for a mixture of
100 grms. of potassium sulphocyanate and 180 grms. of acetic acid. At the
end of this time the products of the reaction were submitted to distilla
tion and commenced boiling at 170°-180°; the thermometer, however,
rose rapidly to 216° ; and between this temperature and 220° the distil
late solidified in the receiver to a radiating crystalline mass, which ana
lysis showed to be pure acetamide*. Above 220° nothing further distilled,
the residue in the retort consisting wholly of potassium acetate. In
what manner had acetamide been formed, instead of diacetamide ex
pected in the reaction ? It appeared not unlikely that the acetic acid
employed contained some water, and that the diacetamide produced in
 the first instance was thus converted into the monocompound            —

     To remove any water which might possibly have been present, the
 acetic acid was treated with phosphoric anhydride, and the experiment
 with the sulphocyanate repeated ; but even now acetamide was exclusively
 obtained.
     On submitting, however, the          gases  evolved during the reaction to a
closer examination, the formation of acetamide became at once intelligible.
 It  was found       that a large       proportion of these consisted of carbonic
oxysulphide (COS).            To prove the presence of this compound, it was
only necessary to pass the evolved gases through a bottle containing a

  This is the characteristic behaviour of carbonic oxysulphide, which was
  further identified by its odour, great density, and inflammability.
     The principal reaction that rakes place when acetic acid is treated with
 potassium sulphocyanate accordingly          is as follows    : —•
              (1)  KCNS+Ca H3 O . OH=Ca H, 0 . OK+HCNS,
              (2)  HCNS+Q,      H3 O . OH=Ca H, O . NHa+COS.
    The sulphuretted     hydrogen and carbonic anhydride, produced simulta
neously with the carbonic oxysulphide,           are the complements of a second
 reaction, the principal product of which         I have no doubt is acetonitrile :
                 HCNS + C3 H3 O . OH= C3 H, N + Hs S + CO,.
 I must   remark, however,     that   I  have not actually proved the formation
of this body by experiment.           My investigations in the acetic series were
 completed before     this phase of the reaction was thoroughly understood ;
 and thus probably,     owing to its low boiling-point (77°), the acetonitrile
 had been carried off with the stream of disengaged gases, and had escaped
detection.     I  have not repeated the experiment, because in other series it
 has been easy to demonstrate the formation of the nitrile.
             Action of Isobutyric Acid on Potassium Sulphocyanate.
    If potassium    sulphocyanate be heated with isobutyric acid (which may
now be readily obtained in a state of purity by oxidation of isobutylic
alcohol separated from fusel-oil), the salt melts under the acid to an oily
layer, from    the surface of which        bubbles of gas        are plentifully disen
gaged, consisting, as in the preceding case, of carbonic oxysulphide,
carbonic anhydride, and          sulphuretted hydrogen.            In consequence of
the higher boiling-point of isobutyric          acid (154°), the reaction proceeds
more rapidly than with acetic acid.                If  the mixture be submitted
to distillation when    all disengagement of      gas has ceased,     it begins boiling
a few    degrees     above 100°,   the thermometer           rapidly rising to 216°;
during this time an aromatic        liquid  passes    over, possessing the odour of
butyric acid.
    Between 216° and 220° the thermometer             remains tolerably stationary,
the  distillate solidifying in the receiver to a white crystalline mass. On
fractionating the liquid portion passing over before 200°, no product can
be obtained showing a constant boiling-point ; but on treating it with a
solution of caustic soda, an   oily aromatic liquid of characteristic odour float s
 on the surface,    which, separated by a tap-funnel and dried over calcium
 chloride, boils constantly between 107° and 108°.               Its composition and
 reactions characterize this substance as isobutyronitrile :

Btrongly heated ; they melt, boil, and yield a semisolid distillate. The distil
lation is carried on as far as possible without charring the residue, which
consists of potassium benzoate (from which half the benzoic acid employed
may be recovered).        By addition of ammonia to the semisolid distillate
any benzoic acid that has passed over is retained, whilst the nitrile distils
with the water, from which it is afterwards separated, dried, and re
distilled.     A roughly carried out experiment yielded 50 per cent, of the
 theoretical quantity of nitrile in a perfectly pure condition ; the loss owing
 to secondary reactions is amply compensated by the ease and rapidity of
 the operation.
               Action of Cuminic Acid on Potassium Sulpliocyanate.
      An   experiment with cuminic acid yielded very satisfactory results :
 cumonitrile was obtained in about the same proportions as the benzo-
 nitrile. The temperature at which the reaction commenced was here about
 210°; the nitrile was purified as in the preceding case.
      Finally, an experiment was made with cinnamic acid          ; but although
 sulphuretted hydrogen was evolved, and the reaction appeared to proceed
 exactly as in the foregoing cases, no cinnamonitrile was obtained in the
  liquid disillate.   The cinnamic acid seemed to be decomposed into carbonic
  anhydride     and cinnamol     before being acted upon by the sulphocyanic
  acid.
      The ease with which nitriles and amides are obtained in this manner,
  both in the aromatic and fatty series, induces me to hope that the new
  method may be of use in many cases, and perhaps, by its application
   to other series, give rise to bodies hitherto uninvestigated.
      The tediousness of preparing the acid chloride and subsequent treat
   ment with ammonia (for the amide), or of the amide with phosphoric
   anhydride (for the nitrile), in the ordinary method for producing these
   nitrogen compounds, is here replaced by simple digestion of the acid with
   sulphocyanate of potassium, bodies generally readily procurable.

    These expressions forX and Y will be converging for all points situated
 at a greater distance than b + c from any point of the axis A B, inasmuch
 as they are composed by adding together corresponding terms of series
 which are then all convergent.              Among other points, these expressions
 hold for such as are situated on the axis external to the bobbin, and not
 nearer A or B than by the distance (b + c).                   For such points, however,
 the expressions become illusory, assuming the form 5.                      They may, how

the expression for U. From that expression we find that for a single

tissues and its presence in others, with the accompanying conditions and
activities belonging to the particular organisms, to arrive at some data
bearing upon its physiological significance.             Such a comparative method
has already yielded results as to the activities of many organs and tissues,
and is in all probability destined in the future, when applied to the more
minute problems of the functions of structures and tissue-components,
to give new impulse to the science of physiology.
     Before communicating some newly observed facts with regard to the
occurrence of Haemoglobin in animal organisms,                I  may briefly state what
is the present condition of the subject.
     After Hoppe Seyler* and Stokes           t had   shown that the red colouring-
matter of the blood of Vertebrata could be recognized by its peculiar
absorption-spectrum,        KuhneJ discovered that the          same colouring-matter,
the oxygen-carrying          properties of which were known from other re
searches, was diffused in the voluntary muscular tissue of mammals, and
imparted to them their red tint. Eollett § then obtained from the red
vascular fluid of the earthworm            crystals which were identical with those
of Haemoglobin, and Nawrocki || at the same time as myself % confirmed
the supposition that Haemoglobin is the cause of the red coloration of
the blood of Lumbricus, by careful spectroscopic observation of the fluid
 and the derivatives yielded by it (Haematin).             I  also established by spec
troscopic analysis** the existence of Haemoglobin in the blood of the
mollusk Planorbis, in that of the larva of the insect Cheironomus, in that
 of the Crustaceans Cheirocephalus and Daphnia, and in the vascular fluids
 of the marine Annelids Eunice, Nereis, Terebella, and others.                  I  found
 also that in the Annelids of the family            " Chloremiens
                                                                     "
                                                                       of Audouin and
 Edwards, as well as in some species of Sabella, the Haemoglobin was re
 placed by a body having similar properties, giving a dark red colour to
 the vascular fluid when seen in sufficient thickness, and a bright green in
 thinner layers. This body gave a very sharply marked and characteristic
 pair of absorption-bands in the oxidized condition, which were changed to
 a single one in the reduced condition, as in the case of Haemoglobin, the
 bands,    however,     having    a relative   intensity and      a position  altogether
 differing from those of Haemoglobin.             By the action of cyanide of potas-

sium, followed by that of a reducing agent (sulphide of ammonium), this
body, to which the name Chlorocruorin was given, furnished two absorp
tion-bands identical with those exhibited by Haemoglobin when similarly
treated.                  I
               Last year found that the red colour of the pharyngeal muscles
of the Gasteropoda         Lymnceus   and Pahtdina* was due to the presence of
Haemoglobin diffused in the muscular tissue ; and at the Meeting of the
British Association at Edinburgh            I  demonstrated its occurrence in the
pharyngeal muscular mass of Littorina, where it is in sufficient quantity
to give a very intense blood-red colour.             The interest of this fact con
sists in this, that in no other part, not even in the blood of these mol-
lusks, does Haemoglobin occur ; hence the doubts which Brozeit t had
attempted to throw upon Kuhne's conclusions with regard to the red
colour of mammalian voluntary muscular tissue were rendered of less
significance than before.        It was also mentioned that whilst Haemoglobin
is absent from the unstriped muscular tissue of mammalia generally, it
occurs in that tissue in the rectum of man, and probably of other
mammals.
    Some observations made during the past winter at Naples will tend to
enlarge the basis of facts sketched above, upon which               I  have ventured to
make some generalizations          with   regard   to   the   mode    of  occurrence of
Haemoglobin in the animal economy.
     1. Occurrence    of Hcemoglobin in corpuscles in the perivisceral fluid of the
Annelids Glycera and Capitella, and of the Gephyrean Phoronis. — Many
of the marine Chaetopodous Annelids are devoid of that closed vascular
system which in others contains a fluid impregnated with Haemoglobin
or Chlorocruorin. Glycera is one of these anangian forms ; but, as an
exception to the general rule, has peculiar corpuscles in its perivisceral
fluid which are of a red colour, as was observed by De Quatrefages and
confirmed by Claparede.          These corpuscles     I  find, when submitted to the
microspectroscope, give an absorption-spectrum                 identical with that of
Haemoglobin,       as  proved by  the superposition     of  the  spectra.   The Haemo
globin of these corpuscles was readily obtained in both the oxidized and
the reduced conditions.        The corpuscles (PI. I. figs. 1, 2, & 3) which con
tain the Haemoglobin are round, somewhat flattened, cheese-shaped bodies
T J^- of     an inch in diameter, possessing a very delicate wall, which often
becomes      irregularly puckered by increased density of the fluid in which
the corpuscles float, and a scarcely visible nucleus about t^ViJ °f an ulcn
in diameter eccentrically placed, which is brought into sharp definition by
the action of weak acids, and exhibits granulation of its contents. These
corpuscles exhibit a tendency to run into rouleaux, and form aggregations
similar to those known in the case of mammalian                   and other vertebrate
red corpuscles.        They are by no means so numerous in the perivisceral
fluid as are the red corpuscles in vertebrate blood, and are accompanied

1872.]               Mr. E. Ray Lankester          on Hemoglobin.                       73
 by amoeboid corpuscles, which are colourless, and by the genital products.
 When a Glycera is irritated so as to cause it frequently to extrude its
 large pharyngeal tube and jaws, a red line is noticed running along the
 whole of the ventral surface. This appears to be caused by the pressure of
 the fluid containing the red corpuscles into the cavity of the outer sheath
 of the nerve-chord, and may have some functional importance.                     The cor
 puscles    enter  this  sheath  at its anterior  termination*.
     2. Occurrence of Hamoglobin in the vascular fluid of Turbellarians. —
 Quatrefages observed that the fluid in the vessels of the Nemertean worm
 Polia sanguirubra was coloured red. In a species examined at Naples,                      I
 have found that this colour is due to Haemoglobin diffused in the liquid.
 In by far the majority of cases the vascular fluid of the Turbellaria is
 colourless.      My friend Mr. H. N. Moseley last year observed Haemo
 globin with the spectroscope in a small Planarian at Suez.
     3. Occurrence of I/amioglobin in corpuscles in the blood of a Lamelli-
 branchiate Molluslc. — Solen legumen, which is known to the Neapolitan
 fishermen as " Canolicca femina," has a reddish tint ; and this was found
to be due to the red colour of the blood, which could be seen very beau-
 fully, like a natural injection, in the blood-sinuses and vessels of the
 mollusk. When one of the shell-valves was partially removed so as to
obtain a clearer view of the underlying parts, the red-coloured fluid
 could be seen passing from one of the large sinuses to another, as the
animal expanded and retracted its long worm-like foot.                      I  would par
 ticularly   draw   attention    to the fact that   though,   when   thus    irritated, an
 increased amount of liquid appeared to be exuded from the mollusk, yet
 this liquid was entirely colourless and devoid of corpuscles — a fact which
 must qualify existing notions as to the escape of the organized blood-
 fluid of Mollusca, based upon the well-ascertained existence of apertures
communicating with the exterior in their vascular system.                   If the liquor
sanguinis escapes, it is clear that at any rate the corpuscles, in which, as
will    be mentioned,      the red colouring-matter resides, do not.                A very
slight injury to the tissue of the mantle is sufficient to cause an escape of
the red-coloured fluid ; and this when placed under the microscope is found
to consist of a plasma in which float abundant oval, sharply contoured cells
of a red colour (figs. 4 & 5). The red colour was definitely proved to be
due to Haemoglobin byexamiuation with the microspectroscope, giving the
two bands identical with those of O, Hb from human blood, and furnishing
    * To  the case here recorded, of Haemoglobin occurring in corpuscles among Vermes.
I can   now add that of the annelid Capiiella, the corpuscles of which    I  found similar
to those of Glycera. and further, the remarkablo Gepbyrean Phoronis kippocreina
(fig. 6). In the annelids Cirrhatulus and Ophelia, corpuscles occur in the closed vasculnr
system, which contains a liquid in which Haemoglobin is diffused. Such avascular fluid
is common among the Chaetopoda; but these arc the only cases known in which it
contains corpuscles.     On examining these corpuscles, which are very small in number,
I find them to be not special Hitmoglobin-bearing corpuscles, but small amoeboid
particles which are impregnated with Hb, just as the surrounding fluid ib.

also the single band of reduced         Hb when treated with reducing agents.
The corpuscles measure about              of an inch in length and 8 fa 0 in
 breadth.    They are by far the most abundant, but not the only corpuscles
 in the liquid. Colourless amoeboid corpuscles are also present.         Acetic
 acid brings out a clearly emarginated nucleus in the red corpuscles. Ace
 tate of rosaniline, both with these corpuscles and the red corpuscles of
 Glycera and of Phoronis, stains the nucleus intensely, and gives one or
 two eccentrically placed maculae, as was observed by Dr. Eoberts in
 human and vertebrate blood generally.           I
                                              have not obtained these maculae
 in corpuscles devoid of Haemoglobin ; and since, in the cases of Glycera, of
 Phoronis, and Solen legumen, where this body is present, as in the verte
 brate red corpuscles, the Eobertsian macula is obtained, there is some
ground for believing that the substance which is thus rendered evident by
coloration with magenta is connected with the Haemoglobin, being either
a part of its decomposition-product, due to the action of the rosaniline, or a
necessary concomitant of it in the blood-corpuscle.           Since the other
species of Solen accompanying Solen legumen in the Gulf of Naples have
colourless blood,    I
                     was anxious to see whether the corpuscles which bear
the Haemoglobin in that species are represented in any way in the others.
I  therefore examined the blood of Solen ensis.         I
                                                      found but few corpuscles
present  ; and these were  all perfectly colourless, and  exhibited very active
amoeboid movements, throwing out processes in various directions with
great rapidity, and running together into adherent masses on the glass
slip ; whilst under the microscope magenta brought a large nucleus in
them, with brilliant staining, but gave no trace of an eccentric macula, such
as that which characterizes Haemoglobin-bearing corpuscles under similar
treatment.
    4. Absence of Hcemoglobin from the blood of the fish Leptocephalus, with
presence of corpuscles corresponding to the red corpuscles. — The beautiful
little fish Leptocephalus     is,
                              with the exception of the black-pigmented
eyes, perfectly  colourless and glass-like. am not aware of traces of red

colour in its blood having been carefully sought for but there certainly
                                                            ;
are none. The blood-vessels possess no tint whatever, and the gills,
moreover, are perfectly free from colour.            Notwithstanding this absence
of Haemoglobin, the blood of Leptocephalus         presents, as observed by Kol-
liker, both the colourless        amoeboid   corpuscles of vertebrate blood and
elliptic nucleated corpuscles, also colourless, exactly comparable to those
which bear the Haemoglobin in other fish.     This fact   remarkable when
                                                                is
put side by side with the observation that the perivisceral fluid of Anne
lids generally           no corpuscles comparable to those which bear
                   presents
Haemoglobin in Glycera, Capitelki, and Phoronis.   The ordinary amoeboid
corpuscles are present in both series and in the latter the Haemoglobin-
                                             ;
bearing corpuscles appear as   special addition.
                                    a
    In   Amphioxus I     may mention that   have not succeeded, after trials,
                                             I
in obtaining      spectroscopic evidence of Haemoglobin, though Wilhelm

1872.]           Mr. E. Ray Lankester      on Hamoglobin.                    75
Miiller, of Jena, states that this vertebrate has corpuscles of a pale red
tint. If Amphioxus should prove not to, it is yet certain that Leptoce-
pludus does form an exception to Prof. Preyer's recent statement in his
valuable monograph, ' Die Blutkrystalle,' that Haemoglobin is found
                                                                           " bei
alien Vertebraten."
    The statements in the present notice will be found to extend consider
ably the area of distribution of Haemoglobin, as given in Prof. Preyer's
work, which is the latest (1871) on the subject.
    5. Presence of Haemoglobin in the tissue of the chain of nerve-ganglia of
 Aphrodite aculeata. — The chain of nerve-ganglia of the Annelid Aphro
 dite aculeata possesses a bright crimson tint. This colour is particularly
 marked in the ganglia themselves, and is most intense in the supraoeso-
 phageal ganglion, which has as intense a colour as a drop of fresh human
 blood.    When examined with the microscope, the colour is found to im
 pregnate the nerve-tissue itself, and not to be held in any liquid bathing
 the tissue.
    The vessels of A. aculeata, which are not represented in closely allied
 species (which are anangian according to the researches of Claparede),
 contain   a pale lemon-coloured fluid, which gives no bands with the spec
 troscope, and is certainly free from Haemoglobin.
    The perivisceral fluid is colourless, and also the muscular tissue through
 out the animal, with the single exception of the great muscular pharynx.
 This has a pale pink tint ; and it and the nerve-chain, when examined
 with the microspectroscope, gave abundant evidence of the presence of
 Haemoglobin.      The quantity in the pharyngeal muscular tissue is very
 small indeed ; but, on the contrary, excessive in the nerve-ganglia, corre
 sponding with their brilliant crimson colour.
    I   may mention here that the orange or yellow colour of the nerve-
 ganglia of many Mollusca is not due to Haemoglobin.
     6. Presence of Haemoglobin in the muscles of the dorsal fin of Hippo
 campus. — The abundance of the little fish Hippocampus in the Gulf of
 Naples has enabled     me to confirm an observation made three years ago
 on specimens     which died in the aquarium in Regent's Park.       Whilst the
 other locomotive muscles of this and other fish are quite free from colour,
 the muscles attached to the base of the dorsal fin are seen to have a pale
 red colour ; and on examination with the spectroscope this colour is
 found to be due to Haemoglobin.          Microscopic examination proves the
 colouring-matter to be diffused in the muscular tissue, and not to be due
 to a special vascularity of the part in question.     Probably other specially
  active muscles of other fishes may be found to be in the same case as those
                                            I
  of the dorsal fin of Hippocampus ; but have not made any extended ob
  servations on this point.
     The deep red coloration of the heart in Vertebrate generally is readil y
  proved by the spectroscope to be due to the presence of Haemoglobin ; but
  owing to the great vascularity of the tissue in some cases, or to its

cavernous structure        in others, and its consequent close association with
the Haemoglobin of the blood, this does not seem remarkable.           I have not
attempted thoroughly to remove the blood from the heart by injection of
salt-solution, as was done by Kuhne with the voluntary muscular tissue
of Mammals.
   The facts ascertained as to the distribution of Haemoglobin may now be
summarized as follows : —
   1.  In    special corpuscles.
          a.   In the blood of all vertebrates,      excepting Leptocepludus and
      Amphioxus (?).
          b. In the perivisceral fluid of some species of the Vermian genera
      Glycera, Capitella, and Phoronis.
          c.  In  the blood of the Lamellibranchiate    Mollusk Solen  legumen.
   2.  Diffused in     a vascular or ambient liquid.
          a.   In  the peculiar vascular system of the Chaetopodous Annelids
      very generally, but with apparently arbitrary exceptions.
          6. In the vascular system (which represents a reduced peri
      visceral cavity) of certain leeches, but not of all (Nephtlis, Hirudo).
          c. In the vascular system of certain Turbellarians as an exception
      (Folia).
          d.   In  a special vascular system   (distinct from the general blood-
      system) of a marine parasitic Crustacean (undescribed)         observed by
      Professor Edouard van Beneden.
          e.  In  the general blood-system of the larva of the Dipterous insect
      Cheironomus.
         f. In     the general blood-system     of the pulmonate    mollusk  Pla-
      norbis.
         g.   In  the general blood-system      of the Crustaceans Daphnia and
      C lieirocephalus .
   3. Diffused in the substance of muscular tissue.
         a. In the voluntary muscles generally of Mammalia, and probably
      of birds, and in some muscles of reptiles.
          6. In the muscles of the dorsal fin of the fish Hippocampus, being
      generally absent from the voluntary muscular tissue of fish.
         c. In the muscular tissue of the heart of Vertebrata generally.
         d. In the unstriped muscular tissue of the rectum of man, being
      absent from the unstriped muscular tissue of the alimentary canal
      generally.
         e. In the muscles of the pharynx and odontophor of Gasteropodous
      Mollusks (observed in Lymnaut, Palvdina, Littorina, Patella, Chiton,
      Aplysia), and of the pharyngeal         gizzard of Aplysia, being entirely
      absent from the rest of the muscular and other tissues and the blood
      of these mollusks.       See as to Planorbis above (2/).

     dite aadeata, being absent from the muscular tissue and from the
      blood in this animal, and absent from the muscular tissue generally
      in all other Annelids as far as yet examined.
   4. Diffused in the substance of nervous tissue.
         a. In the chain of nerve-ganglia of Aphrodite aculeata.
   The significance of       these observations depends to a large extent on the
negative results given by very numerous observations not recorded here.
I have taken every opportunity, during some years past, of examining
coloured animal matters with the spectroscope, and especially w here there
could be a suspicion of the presence of Hemoglobin *. Thus, where the
absence of Hemoglobin is generally stated above, it must be understood
that examination        has been     made for   it in such   cases as have been acces
sible.    I have   found that many cases of red coloration of a tissue or liquid,
which might      be supposed to be due to Haemoglobin, are certainly                not so,
such red-coloured        matter failing to give the characteristic bands of that
body,   and,  as  a rule, giving no detached characteristic bands.               Such are
the red pigments occurring in the blood-corpuscles of Sipunculus, in the
tissues of many Annelids, in Echinodermata, in compound Tunicata, sur
rounding the intestine of Salpa, in the foot and mantle of many Mollusca,
also in their nerve-ganglia and other parts, in the chromatophores of
Cephalopoda, in certain Infusoria.              On the other hand, among coloured
bodies not suggesting Haemoglobin,            I  have found an equally large number
devoid of characteristic         spectra, but some few which exhibit the remark
able phenomenon of detached definite bands of absorption, which enables
them to be certainly characterized and recorded. Such are : — a chlorophyl-
like body occurring in Spongilla, in Hydra viridis, and in Mesostomum viride;
Chlorocruorin, which takes the place of Haemoglobin in the vascular fluid
of the Chloremiens and some species of Sobella ; Stentorin, giving the in
tense blue colour to the         Inf usorian Stentor ccerulens, and possessing a very
marked and peculiar pair of absorption-bands.               With one single exception,
it appears, from the examination of a great number of cases, both among
Vertebrates    and Invertebrates,       that coloured bodies which may be supposed
to be purely pigmentary in their function do not give detached absorption-
bands.      The exception is the red colouring-matter                named Turacin by
Professor Church, discovered by him in the feathers of birds of the family
Musophagidae, which has other properties quite unusual in pigmentary
bodies.     In an examination of a large number of birds' feathers, red, yel
low, blue, and green,          I  failed to obtain detached absorption-bands,             as
   * I  may state that I have not hitherto made any observations on the colouring-
matters of the biliary secretion in Invertebrata and the lower Vertebrates, excepting in
their fresh condition.    The use of the spectroscope, combined with chemical reagents,
would   no  doubt   lead to interesting results in that field, since a variety of substances
giving  characteristic   absorption-spectra have been obtained from the manipulation of
mammalian bile-pigment.

  the pigments of many Crustaceans, Annelids, Insects, Tunicates, and
  Sponges *.
     From a consideration of the facts stated above with regard to the mode
  of occurrence and distribution of Haemoglobin in animal organisms, the
  following general statements may be made, which are in accordance with
  the now thorough establishment, by chemical investigation, of its peculiar
  oxygen-carrying       property.
     Hemoglobin       is irregularly distributed throughout the animal kingdom,
  being absent entirely only in the lowest groupst.              It may be present in all
 the representatives of large group,
                              a                with   but one or two exceptions, or it
 may be present in one only out of the numerous members of such a
 group ; or, again, it may be present in one and absent in another species
  of the same genus.         It may occur in corpuscles in the blood, or diffused
 in the liquor sanguinis, or in the muscular tissue, or in the nerve-tissue.
 The same apparent capriciousness characterizes its occurrence in tissues
 as in specific forms.       It may be present in one small group of muscles and
 absent from all the rest of the tissues of the body, or it may occur in one
 part only of a tissue, histologically identical throughout its distribution in
 the organism.        The apparently arbitrary character of this distribution is
 to be explained (though only partially) by a reference to the chemical
 activity of Haemoglobin.          Wherever increased facilities for oxidation are
 requisite, Haemoglobin may make its appearance in response ; where such
 facilities can be dispensed with, or are otherwise supplied, Haemoglobin
 may cease to be developed.
    The Vertebrata and the Annelida possess a blood containing Haemo
 globin in correlation with their greater activity as contrasted with the
 Mollusca, which do not possess such blood.                     The actively burrowing
Solen legumen alone amongst Lamellibranchiate Mollusks, and amongst
 Gasteropods only Planorbis, respiring the air of stagnant marshes, possess
blood containing Haemoglobin.             In the former the activity, in the latter
the deficiency of respirable gases are correlated with the exceptional de
velopment of Haemoglobin.             But we cannot as yet offer an explanation of
the absence of Haemoglobin from the closely allied species of Solen,
and from the Lymrwei which accompany Planorbis.                        The Crustaceans
 Cheirocephalus      and Daphnia, and the larva of Cheironomvs, possessing,
as exceptions      in their  classes. Haemoglobin     in their blood, inhabit stations
where the amount of accessible oxygen must be small (that is to say,
stagnant ponds), the last living in putrescent mud ; whilst the possession

   t                            — It is perhaps of some significance that Haemoglobin has
      [Kotc. Dec. 24th, 1872.]
only been found in that great group of the animal kingdom which in the course of its
development    gives rise to a middle layer of blastodermic cells or mesoderm, and in
examples from nearly every great branch of this stem.

1872.]                Mr. E. Ray Lankester          on Hamoglobin.                    79
of abundant Haemoglobin in its vascular fluid may be supposed to be one
of the chief properties which enables the oligochaet Annelid Tubifex to
hold its ground in the foul, and therefore much deoxygenated, water of
the Thames at London.
    The known chemical properties of Haemoglobin furnish a more com
plete explanation of its peculiar distribution in tissues.             That it should
occur in a circulating fluid, which is the medium of respiration, is
obviously related to those properties.             Its occurrence in the voluntary
muscles of the most active of Vertebrata, and in the most active muscles
of some others (as in the case of the dorsal-fin muscles of Hippocampus),
is equally so ; so also its occurrence in the most powerfully acting part
of the intestinal muscles, those of the rectum, and in the only rapidly and
constantly acting muscles of the Gasteropods, namely those used in
biting and rasping.
    To connect its occurrence in the nervous chain of Aphrodite aculeata
with its properties is more difficult, since we have no knowledge that this
Annelid is remarkable for nervous energy. The large bulk of the animal
in proportion to the size of the nervous system, and the deficient respira
tion, indicated by the very slightly developed vascular system and the
total absence of Haemoglobin from the fluids of the worm, may be a rea
son for the endowment of the nervous centre which has to control such
a large and complicated organism with a special facility for appropriating
what little oxygen may come in its way.
    The complete absence of Haemoglobin from Leptocephalus is an example
of the submission of an auxiliary, but not an essential, structural attribute
to an all-powerful necessity — that of transparency. The absence of Haemo
globin from the transparent Annelid Alciope may be similarly correlated.
     From what has been stated above as to the Haemoglobin-bearing cor
puscles of Olycera, Solen, and the Vertebrata, it appears that when Hae
 moglobin is present in the blood in corpuscles, these corpuscles are of a
peculiar character, and are specially related to the presence of the Haemo
globin.       When that is absent, other things remaining the same (as with
the blood of Solen ensis and the perivisceral fluid of most Annelids), the
peculiar      corpuscles are absent.         Such things as colourless corpuscles,
representative of the Haemoglobin-bearing corpuscles, do, however, appear
to exist in the case of the fish Leptocephalus.                In connexion with the
relation      of the colourless corpuscles of vertebrate blood to the red cor
 puscles, and of the corpuscles of the vascular fluids of Invertebrata to
 one another and to those of Vertebrates, these facts seem to be important :
 the colourless corpuscles in one case are only comparable to the colour
 less   in another ; the red corpuscles are something apart, which may or
 may not be superadded*.

 Alexander Brandt, in recent memoir, very rightly insists on the similarity
                                    a
 between these pink corpuscles of Sipunetilus and the red corpuscles
 of the blood of Vertebrata: they are something quite distinct from
 the amoeboid corpuscles found in the fluid corresponding to blood
in nearly all Invertebrata, and are to be compared to the red cor
puscles of Ohjcera, SoUn, and Vertebrates.                The amoeboid corpuscles are
otherwise represented      in  the  perivisceral    fluid  of Sipunculus by numerous
active amoeboid cells.       Dr. Brandt, naturally enough, regarded the pink
colour  of these   corpuscles as favouring their assimilation to vertebrate red
corpuscles.      The colour en masse is, however, obviously different from that
of dilute Haemoglobin        and    ; was not therefore surprised to find that
                                            I                                                                it

     The occurrence of colourless corpuscles in Leptocephalus identical in
 form and character with the Haemoglobin-bearing corpuscles of the blood
 of other fish, and the apparently capricious distribution of Haemoglobin
 among Invertebrata, together with the existence of the green oxygen-
 carrier Chlorocruorin and the pink colouring-matter of the corpuscles of
 Sipunculus nudiis, suggest the hypothesis of the existence of various bodies
 not necessarily red, possibly colourless, which act the same physiological
 part in relation to oxygen            as does Haemoglobin.

     Having occasion during his late residence in Western India to remove
 numerous urinary calculi from persons belonging to the indigenous popu
 lation, the author was enabled to pursue an inquiry into the character of
 these concretions which he had begun in the year 1859 by the chemical
 analysis of a large number of such calculi ; it remained then to make use
 of the microscope as a means of investigation ; and since no record of a
 similar systematic inquiry to that now undertaken has been published, so
 far as known to the author, it was thought desirable that this hiatus in
 medical literature should, however imperfectly, be forthwith filled up.
    The plan adopted was to submit minute fragments taken from the real
 or apparent nuclei, and from succeeding layers and crust, of the calculi
 examined to the scrutiny of average optical powers, the highest available
 magnifying about 300 diameters.                    Distilled water was the ordinary
medium employed ; and in all cases chemical tests were conjointly used
for the purposes of detection or confirmation.                  After sufficient practice,
it became apparent that the microscopic analysis of calculi, thus carried
                                                                                G 53

82 Dr.      H. V. Carter on  the Composition   of Urinary Calculi.     [Dec. 12,
out, is not only valuable, but that it is even more delicate than the
simply chemical method ; by it will be seen more clearly than before that
no urinary deposit long retains an unmixed character, and besides will
be gained a more accurate conception of the true character and structure
of  these   hurtful concretions.
    Particular attention has been given to the nature of their nuclei or
first-formed ingredients, for it was obviously desirable to ascertain the
material and mode of commencement of calculi ; and the author re
gards it as not the least interesting of his results to have determined the
very frequent presence of urates in a globular form at their very earliest
beginnings.      Stones removed from adults as well as from        children    may
possess a nucleus       thus formed,   and   to  such   origin may    succeed   all
varieties of calculous deposit.     The next most common ingredient of the
nucleus is the oxalate of lime, and this, too, in a form not generally re
cognized, viz. as large rhombic crystals ; frequently, however, octahedral,
oval, and dumb-bell forms are seen, as well as spheroidal bodies origi
nating from the latter ; these last-named structures are very charac
 teristic.   The nucleus of a calculus was comparatively seldom found to
 consist of uric-acid crystals.              _
    Next in importance to the observation          that globular and granular
 urates very frequently compose     the  nucleus  of all varieties of calculi, and
 have commonly associated with them the oxalate of lime, is the evidence
 elicited of the operation of known physical influences in determining the
 form which     these salts assume in connexion with stone.         Reference is
 made to    the  modifying influence of a colloid medium upon the process of
 crystallization (as so admirably illustrated in Mr. Eainey's well-known re
 searches) ; and it is here found that both urates and oxalates may present the
 various stages of globular particles, complex globules, or spheroids, either
 separate or blended, and laminae of varying thickness : there are evident
 signs, too, that these structures undergo, at times, more or less disinte
 gration, which may be followed by a rearrangement of their molecules ;
 and more especially does the calcic oxalate seem disposed to undergo
 these changes, the resulting forms being highly characteristic.          Neither
  uric acid nor the phosphates were found otherwise than in a simpler
  crystalline form ; the former, however, when liquor potass® is added, may
  in combination be noticed to pass into minute globular particles, the
  urate of potash being seen in the field of the microscope to assume some
  of the characters of ordinary urates ; and phosphate of lime artificially
  produced was also observed in the shape of dumb-bells and spheres.
     The author refers to the structure      of Raphides,    agates, some shells,
  Ac., and concludes that urinary calculi should not be classed with ordi
  nary concretions or mere mineral masses ; it is not, however, evident that
  the animal basis of calculous matter, essential ingredient though it be,
  presents or retains a strictly cellular character.

   submitted to examination are added, with a Table specifying the sex, age,
   Ac. of patients, weight and composition of the specimens, &c.
      A second Table shows an arrangement of the ascertained ingredients
  in a form which, if not complete, may yet be useful ; in it the rarer sub
   stances belonging to urinary calculi are not included.
      Next follows a description of each well-known ingredient as it was ob
  served to occur : — Uric acid is here crystalline, but not in the shapes pre
  valent in urinary deposits ; free crystals (1) are comparatively rare, and
  open columns (2), or else compact laminae (3), are most frequent ; amidst
  these the very general occurrence of simple oxalate-of-lime forms is men
  tioned.       The Urates are present in calculi, as (1) granules, (2) acicular
  crystals, (3) globules, (4) laminae : the relation of the two latter forms
  is described, and the apparent character of their animal basis.             Oxalate of
  lime would seem to be the most prevalent             of all ingredients, and it exists
  as  (1) granules,     if the particles  were   really shapeless, as they appeared to
 be ; (2) crystals     —   octahedral (often of enormous size), ovoid, and dumb
  bell shaped ; (3) spheroids, or large composite globular particles of very
  characteristic appearance, and originating from the last-named form ;
 (4) laminae, also characteristic.           Some remarks are added on crystals of
 the oxalate artificially produced.           Certain crystals, styled peculiar, are de
 scribed   ;   they are frequently admixed with the urates, and, upon grounds
 specified in detail, are judged to be a form of the calcic oxalate.                Phos
phate of     lime  : free crystals   of this  salt have  not  been seen  in calculi ; and
 compact layers, authoritatively             recognized, have varied in appearance
 either as the result of disintegration, or possibly in consequence of some
 difference in chemical composition — a point amongst others needing
 further investigation.          Respecting the triple phosphate and the fusible
 calculus, details of their microscopic appearance are submitted in the
 communication         under notice.
     In  conclusion, figures arranged          in four Plates, with descriptions, are
 appended.

     The author, after referring to the researches in which he has been
engaged since January 1869 in conjunction with Dr. Frankland, refers to
the evidence obtained by them as to the thickening and thinning of spec
tral lines by variations of pressure, and to the disappearance of certain
lines when the method employed by them since 1869 is used. This method
consists of throwing an image of the light-source to be examined on to the
slit of the spectroscope.

84                Mr. J. N. Lockyer    on Spectrum- Analysis.          [Dec. 12,
    It is  pointed out that the phenomena observed are of the same nature as
those already described by Stokes, W. A. Miller, Eobinson, and Thalen, but
that the application of this method enables them to be better studied, the
metallic spectra being clearly separated from that of the gaseous medium
through which the spark passes.        Photographs of the spark, taken in air
between zinc and cadmium and zinc and tin, accompany the paper, show
ing that when spectra of the vapours given off by electrodes are studied
in this manner, the vapours close to the electrode give lines which dis
appear from the spectrum of the vapour at a greater distance from
the electrode, so that there appear to be long and short lines in the
spectrum.
     The following     elements have been mapped on this method            : — Na,
Li, Mg, Al, Mn, Co, Ni, Zn, Sr, Cd, Sn, 8b, Ba, and Pb, the lines
being laid down from Thalen's         maps, and the various characters and
lengths of the lines shown.
    In   some cases the spectra of the metals, enclosed in tubes and subjected
to a continually decreasing pressure, have been       observed.      In all these
experiments the lines gradually disappear as the pressure is reduced, the
shortest lines disappearing first, and the longest lines remaining longest
visible.
     Since  it appeared that the purest and densest vapour alone        gave   the
greatest number of lines, it became of interest to examine the spectra of
compounds consisting of a metal combined with a non-metallic element.
Experiments with chlorides are recorded. It was found in all cases that
the difference between the spectrum of the chloride and the spectrum of
the metal was that under the same spark-conditions            all the short lines
were obliterated.      Changing the spark-conditions,  the final result was that
only the very longest lines in the spectrum of the metallic vapour re
mained.        It was observed that in the case of elements with low atomic
weights, combined with one equivalent of chlorine, the numbers of lines
which remain in the chloride is large, 60 per cent., e. g., in the case of Li,
and 40 per cent. in the case of Na ; while in the case of elements with
greater atomic weights, combined with two equivalents of chlorine, a much
smaller number of lines remain — 8 per cent. in the case of barium, and
3 per cent. in the case of Pb.
     The application of these observations to the solar spectrum, to elucidate
 which they were undertaken, is then given.
     It is well known that all the known lines of the metallic elements on
 the solar atmosphere are not reversed.       Mr. Lockyer states what Kirch-
hoff and Angstrom have written on this subject, and what substances,
 according to each, exist in the solar atmosphere.      He next announces the
 discovery that, with no exception whatever, the lines which are reversed are
 the longest lines.   With this additional key  he does  not hesitate to add, on
the strength of a small number of lines reversed, zinc and aluminium (and
possibly strontium) to the last list of solar elements given by Thalen, who

  1872.]       The Astronomer Royal's Magnetical Observations.               85
  rejected zinc from KirchhofF s list, and agreed with him in rejecting alu
  minium. It need scarcely be added that these lines are in each case the
  longest lines in the spectrum of the metal.
     The help which these determinations afford to the study of the various
  cyclical changes in the solar spectra is then referred to.

        P.R.S., Astronomer Royal. Received October 12, 1872.
                                   (Abstract.)
     The author states that he was first induced to make these experiments
 by consideration of the perpetual tremor to which the iron of these struc
 tures is subjected, and which appeared likely to have made them unusu
ally sensitive to the production of induced and perhaps subpermanent
maguetism.       The experiments were actually conducted by Mr. James
Carpenter (then Assistant at the Royal Observatory), with the friendly
cooperation of Captain Tupmin, B.M.A.           Permissioa was given by the
Directors of the London and North-Western Railway Company, and
every possible assistance was given by the resident Officers of the Com
pany, with a degree of zeal and liberality which cannot be too highly
appreciated.      The observations  were made in the axis of each tube, a
large    step-ladder and stage adapted to the circumstances having been
provided ; the observations made were those of disturbed magnetic azi
muth, disturbed time of vibration of a horizontal needle, and disturbed
 dip. The places of observation were : — in each line of the Britannia Bridge,
a station on each of its five supporting towers and a station in the
 middle of each of the four sections of the continuous tube, and also stations
in the prolongations of the axis of the bridge to a considerable distance in
 each direction, making in all twenty stations ; and in the Conway bridge,
 stations in each line at the piers and in the middle of the tube, and also

 eight stations in all.
    The means of the results at each station are given in a Table.         For
further treatment, the means of those means for collateral stations are
used ; and the means of those for the two distant stations at each bridge
are adopted as giving undisturbed        local constants.    By treatment of

these in steps exhibited in several successive Tables, results are found
for the magnetic disturbance in the three directions, longitudinal, trans
versal, and vertical  ; and these are compared with the terrestrial forces in
the same directions.     The principal results are, that the transversal and
vertical parts of terrestrial magnetism are absolutely neutralized, and the
 terrestrial longitudinal force is diminished by about one fourth part.
     An anomaly presented itself in the results for the station at the middle
of the Anglesey Wate-tube, which induced the author to inquire of
Edwin Clark, Esq. (the actual Superintendent of the construction of the
bridges), whether any peculiarity of material could explain it. Mr. Clark
immediately remarked that this was the tube which, in the act of raising
the sections of the tube, sustained a fall of several inches, undoubtedly
straining the tube very greatly.    It appears almost beyond doubt that this
 accident is the cause of the anomalous magnetic condition of that section
of the tube. Mr. Clark remarks that it is an interesting fact, if esta
blished, that the result of an accident which occurred about a quarter of a
 century ago can still be traced in the magnetic condition of the tube.
     The results in the Conway bridge, for transversal and vertical action,
 are  in perfect agreement with those for the Britannia bridge ; but the
 results for longitudinal disturbance do not present the same agreement.
 The Conway bridge, however, is nearly at right angles to the magnetic
 meridian ; and it appears probable that its magnetical state depends on
 the circumstances of its construction, when its Holyhead end was in a di
 rection about 48° 50' west of north, in which position it would receive
 much magnetism, which the forces subsequently acting on it could not
 remove.

        1872.
                                   (Abstract.)
     In 1866 Mr. Binney gave the name of Dadoxylon Oldhamium to a fossil
  stem of a plant from the Lower Coal-measures of Lancashire, believing
  it to belong to the same class of Gymnospermous Exogens as the Pinitts
  of Witham and the Dadoxylon of Endlicher. In 1869 the author pointed
  out that the reticulated markings upon the surface of its vessels were
  modifications of the spiral fibre of fibro-vascular tissue, and not the disks
  of what is often designated glandular fibre. He consequently separated
  the plant from the Dadoxylons under the name of Dictyoxylon Oldhamium.
  At the Edinburgh Meeting of the British Association in 1871 he gave a
  brief account of the structure of this plant, as also of what appeared to be
  a second species from the Lower Coal-measures of Burntisland in Fife

shire, which he called D. Gfrievii, after its discoverer, D. Grieve, Esq. A
detailed exposition of the organization of these two plants is given in the
memoir.
   Dictyoxylon Oldhamium. — This was a stem composed of the three divi
sions of pith, wood, and bark.     The pith consisted of regular parenchyma
without divisions or cavities of any kind. In very young plants it was
surrounded by an irregular ring or medullary cylinder of reticulated
vessels, not arranged in radiating laminae.       This cylinder broke up at an
early period into several detached vascular bundles, which, as the stem
enlarged, became widely separated from each other, the intervening space
being occupied by medullary parenchyma.           But before this change was
completed, the true ligneous zone appeared as a thin ring of vessels
arranged in radiating vertical laminae, separated from each other by large
and conspicuous medullary rays, composed of mural cellular tissue.
Additions were made to the exterior surface of this zone by the agency
of a delicate cellular layer of cells, which constituted the innermost
layer of the bark.    These additions demonstrate their exogenous nature
in several specimens in which the vessels of the outermost zone have
not attained to half their normal     size, resembling  in this respect some of
the Lepidodendroid plants described in the author's last memoir (Part III.).
Through these successive exogenous growths the vascular axis of the stem
ultimately became arborescent.        One specimen is described in which
such a vascular axis, though imperfect and waterworn, is fully six inches
in diameter, independent of the bark ; other specimens have been ob
tained   intermediate  in size   between the above example and the small
stems more usually met with. The vascular laminae increased in thick
ness as they proceeded from within outwards, and then subdivided, in
the ordinary exogenous manner, through the intercalation of new medul
lary rays.    These rays are remarkable for the great vertical range of each
one, as well as for the large number of cells which enter into their com
position.    In tangential sections they appear as elongated lenticular
masses   of parenchyma.
    The Bark. — This organ is separable into three, if not four layers. The
innermost one is a delicate parenchyma closely investing the ligneous zone,
its cells being continuous with those of the medullary rays.        At its outer
surface this tissue passes gradually into another parenchymatous layer of
greater thickness than the inner one. Both of them have patches of
dark-coloured cells scattered through their tissues.         But the most re
markable part of the    bark   is the  third  or prosenchymatous layer, which
presents very different features according to the aspect in which it is
regarded.     In the transverse section it consists of radiating bands of
 parenchyma alternating with narrower and very dark-coloured ones of
woody prosenchyma, the latter looking very like the Soman numerals
upon the face of a clock.     Tangential sections show that the black bands
 are fibrous laminae, which pursue an undulatory course as they ascend

88                 Prof. W. C. Williamson on the Fossil               [Dec. 19,
through the stem, and which, as they alternately approach and recede
from one another, divide this part of the bark into a series of lenticular
or rhomboidal   areas, occupied by various forms of parenchyma.          No
vascular bundles enter these areolae ; hence they are something altogether
different from the leaf-scars of the Lepidodendra.   Externally to this pro-
senchymatous layer some specimens exhibit detached traces of a very thin
external layer of parenchyma, apparently derived from the cells of the
rhomboidal areolae, which have extended beyond the fibrous laminae and
spread themselves over the surface of the bark as a continuous layer ;
but this condition appears to be confined to very young stems.
   Vascular bundles of large size ascend vertically through the two
inner parenchymatous layers of the bark. In some instances each of
these bundles exhibits, in the transverse section, an oval outline, with faint
traces of a vertical division into t wo parts. But ordinarily the two halves
of the bundle have separated, forming two distinct bundles, which are
some distance apart.   They exhibit little or no tendency to diverge from
the ligneous cylinder as they ascend, and in some instances actually
become incorporated with it.   It is remarkable that the position of each
of these double bundles, at the exterior of the ligneous zone, corresponds
with the spaces intervening between the detached masses of the medullary
cylinder within    it,
                   as     the former were designed to act as buttresses
                         if
strengthening these weaker points in the vascular axis.      It not unfre-
quently happens that exogenous additions are made to such of these
bundles as are encompassed by the innermost layer of the bark, in the
shape of  afew radiating laminae of vessels developed on their outer or
peripheral surfaces.
   One specimen of the vascular axis is, as already mentioned, so large as
to demonstrate that the plant became arborescent.
  Though Dictyoxylon was not      dichotomizing plant, like Lepidodendron,
                                   a
itgave off lateral bundles of vessels.  Some of these are simple bundles,
consisting of numerous vessels intermingled with some cellular tissue.
Others have this central bundle invested by thin ring of radiating laminae
                                              a
with intervening   medullary rays     this exogenous ring sometimes be
                                       ;
comes developed into   relatively large and distinct woody zone, like that
                         a
of the parent axis. The vessels of these lateral growths appear to be
wholly derived from the radiating woody zone.
     A
     second form of lateral appendage appears to spring from the me
dullary rays, and consists of cylindrical mass of reticulated cells, which
                               a
are chiefly prosenchymatous, but of an elongated type.    It suggested
                                                                 is
that this structure may have been prolonged into an adventitious root.
   The structure of the central or medullary vascular axis of the former
of these two kinds of lateral appendages seems to indicate that the history
of the development -of the medullary vascular cylinder in these plants
corresponds with what the author described in his preceding memoir
(Part III.) as taking place in the similar parts of the Lepidodewlra, viz. that

 1572.]                  Plants of the Coal-measures.                       89
some   of the cells of the central part of the axis underwent rapid fission,
and thus developed a distinct cellular medulla, which forced the medullary
vessels outwards where at first they constituted a ring, but which ring
soon broke up into the detached vascular masses already referred to as
adhering to the inner surface of the exogenous zones.
   The enlargement of the exogenous woody cylinder by the peripheral
intercalation of new radiating vascular laminae, and the repeated sub
division of these laminae by a corresponding intercalation of new medul
lary rays, demonstrates the close resemblance between the growth of the
ligneous zone in these plants and that of ordinary exogenous stems. A
fine series of specimens collected by the Bev.H. Iliggins, of Kainhill, near
Liverpool, and which exhibit various modifications of the type figured
by the late Mr. Gourlie under the name of Lyginodendron Landsburyhii,
are shown to be merely casts of the exterior surface of the bark of some
species  of Dicti/oxijlon.   They may actually belong to D. Old/iamium   ; but
this is not   yet proven.
   Dictyoxylon Orievii. — This plant has many points of affinity with D.
 Oldhamium ; nevertheless it has very distinct features of its own.        Its
central or medullary axis is very large in proportion to the thickness of
its exogenous ring ; the former consists of cellular parenchyma, through
out which are scattered numerous bundles of exquisitely reticulated
vessels unprovided       with any special sheaths.    The largest vessels are
nearest the centre of the axis, the peripheral ones becoming smaller, more
numerous, and grouped in more continuous masses.            Immediately sur
rounding this vasculo-cellular axis is a thin ring of similar vessels, but
arranged in radiating laminae, separated by well-defined medullary rays.
This zone is generally of unequal thickness on opposite sides of the plant,
and    contains some barred vessels amongst its reticulated ones; the
medullary rays are composed of mural cells.
   The bark consists of three very distinct layers.    The innermost one is
very thin, consisting of delicate parenchyma, but which nevertheless has
formed a very clearly defined flexible layer; outside this is a thick
stratum of coarser but regular parenchyma subdivided in the transverse
section into vaguely defined areas by thick wavy lines of condensed cells.
The peripheral outline of this zone is very irregular, frequently projecting
outwards in large angular masses.       It is bounded by a prosenchymatous
 external layer, which is a dwarfed representative of the corresponding one
 of D. Oldhamium. In the transverse section it exhibits dark radiating
bands of fibres, longitudinally disposed, alternating with similar bands of
 parenchyma ; but it differs from D. Oldhamium in the narrowness of the
latter, and consequently in the more linear form of the cellular areolae of
the outer bark.      In longitudinal sections of the bark its innermost layer
appears    as  in transverse   ones. The middle parenchyma, on the other
 hand, exhibits remarkable differences from its aspect in the transverse
 section : its cells are arranged in vertical columns ; but these are inter

     90         On the Fossil Plants of the Coal-measures.                      [Dec. 19,
     8ected at intervals of nearly -fa of an inch by horizontal and parallel
     bands of very dark-coloured cells of a special nature.
       Seven or eight large vasculo-cellular bundles exist in each transverse
    section of the bark.         Some of these are located within the exogenous
    layer of the wood, being obviously detached portions of the cells and vessels
    of the medullary axis ; others occur, in various specimens, at every point
    between the wood and the outer bark.                   The author finds that these
    bundles remained for a time in the immediate neighbourhood of the inner
    most bark, but that they successively became detached and moved more
    rapidly outwards, until each one emerged at the periphery of the bark in
   one of the prominent angles of the latter, already referred to ; when one
   bundle has thus reached the periphery, another begins to follow the same
   centrifugal  course.      The inference is, that       these are  foliar bundles, sup
   plying  large leaves or petioles, sparsely grouped round the stem.            A single
   example of a similar         centrifugal     bundle   was found     in D. Oldhamium.
   The seemingly irregular projections of the bark of D. Orievii thus appear
   to represent angular petioles, and are not the result of merely accidental
  pressures.     A second kind of cylindrical bundle is noticed, consisting of
  reticulated   prosenchymatous cells.             It is connected at its central extre
  mity with the medullary parenchyma, whilst its peripheral end passes out
  wards through the bark.           It appears to have had the same character as
  the similar one of D. Oldhamium, having probably                 been an adventitious
  root-bundle.
      Somewhat triangular twigs or petioles of the above plant are numerous.
 They consist of a single vascular bundle, located excentrically near the
 cordate base of the triangular transverse section, and surrounded by the
 three bark-layers seen in the older stems. The structure of these layers,
 as seen in the longitudinal sections, is identical with, though less com
 plex than, that of the matured stems ; but no cortical vascular bundles
 are seen in them.
      Having identified his Dictyoxylon Oldhamium with the older genus Ly
 ginodendron, the author abandons his own generic name, and proposes that
 the plant shall henceforth be designated Lyginodendron Oldhamium.                   He
 establishes in the same way the generic identity of Dictyoxylon Orievii
with the Heterangium of Corda ; hence that plant must now take the name
 of Heterangium Orievii. Whilst having no doubt that the above were two
Cryptogamic plants, it appears impossible for the present to determine to
what class of Cryptogams they belong.                  Many of their features indicate
Lycopodiaceous       affinities  ; but  this  point   can  scarcely be determined until
the actual fronds are discovered.                This has not yet been done. The
Lyginodendron     is from    the   horizon   of  the Ganister beds of Lancashire and
Yorkshire ; the Burntisland deposit belongs to the middle portion of
the calciferous sandstones of the Burdiehouse Carboniferous strata.

       the neighbourhood of Spitzbergen."            By John C. Wells,
       Capt. B.N.      Communicated by Dr. Carpenter, F.B.S.              Be-
       ceived November 28, 1872.
    While almost every other nation is making its effort to promote scien
tific discoveries in the high latitudes of the north, England remains
inactive.
    My object in addressing the following remarks to the Eoyal Society is
                                              '        '
to bring to its notice the voyages of the       Samson   yacht, and to direct
attention to some points on the temperature of the Arctic Sea, to which
access is obtained through the broadest gateway to the north, i. t. that
between Greenland and Norway, the portal of which is guarded by
Spitzbergen.     In the western portion, along the coast of Greenland, it is
more or less blocked with ice, and the water is cold. In the eastern part,
in the vicinity of Spitzbergen, there is warm water and an open sea at
certain seasons of the year as far north as 81°, and in some years one or
two degrees further. Nearly all the discoveries in these regions have
been made by persons engaged in commercial enterprise ; so that, even
when favourable opportunities offered, their interests restrained them from
taking advantage of the    same.
   In  1871  Mr. B.Leigh Smith made a cruise in his schooner yacht ' Samson,'
and reached 81° 24' N., with an open sea before him, comparatively free
from ice.     The pack-ice was drifting southwards, and the water at the sur
face was 33°    F., while at 300 fathoms it was 42° F. This fact was ob
served by Capt. Scoresby in lat. 78° N., O'-IOW., surface 32° F., and at a
depth of 760 fathoms 38° F.         In 1872 a second cruise was undertaken,
            I
in which had the pleasure of accompanying Mr. Smith. On this occa
sion the sea was crowded with ice, and the ship was beset.       The ice had
evidently required more than one year for its formation ; its surface was
covered with opaque snow, and was generally flat, and in no case rose
higher than the gangway of the little schooner.
    Owing to the floes presenting a comparatively smooth surface, with a
total absence of icebergs, we were led to form the opinion that no land
can exist in the vicinity immediately north of Spitzbergen, as the southerly
drift would be sure to bring down floating bergs, which are always formed
in the valleys of northern land.
    On this occasion observation with the Miller-Casella thermometer
confirmed the result of the previous year, viz. gradual increase of tempe
rature at great depth.     On July 12th, when in 80° 17' N., and when the
 vessel was fixed in the ice, the temperature gradually increased to 64° F.
at a depth of 600 fathoms.       These facts indicate the southward flow of
a vast body of warm water.        It  cannot be said that the heat is derived
from the Gulf-stream, because       nowhere in its course, even in such lati

 tudes as 50° or 60°, does                it acquire so high a temperature, even at the
 surface        ;   and     it is highly improbable that the general warmth of the ocean
 along the west coasts of North Europe, on the shores of Norway, could
 possibly be supplied by the limited body of warm water which leaves the
 Gulf of Florida.                 If the
                           whole of the Gulf-stream water were spread over
 the warm-water area in the north, its depth, even allowing the most
 liberal estimate for its volume, would not exceed 10 fathoms ; whereas
warm water of 42°   F. occurs to the depth of 400 fathoms in this region,
 and north of Spitzbergen it is found as high as 64° F. at 600 fathoms.
If  it be said that this temperature is due to the northward drifting
 of the Atlantic from warmer            we are met by two difficulties,
                                                  localities,
of which one                is,
               that the soundings obtained by Carpenter and others gave
temperatures much below 64°, and the other                       is,
                                              that the waters flow south,
not north. Volcanic action, or warm mineral spring rising from the
                                                   a
ocean-bottom, may by some be imagined to be the cause of the tempera
ture of 64° but there  no evidence of either of these agencies, and
                        ;               is                                                  it   is
quite reasonable to suppose any other feasible cause.     Passing over the
discovery of 64° F. at this depth, we still have to account for the water
of 42° F. flowing southwards, as evidenced                      by
                                               the increase of its tempera
ture as we proceeded northwards.
   It clear that this question of temperature requires further investiga
          is
tion and
      ;         also clear that whatever the result may be,
                    it   is                                 will materially   it
affect all the prevailing theories respecting oceanic currents.   It not                 is
improbable that this warm water flows from the circumpolar                         region   ;   and
ifso,  would indicate a circumpolar sea.
          it
  Many facts are known which are consistent with this view.      Every year
the edge of the pack-ice, and the ice-fields themselves, break up and drift
south, at   rate sometimes equal to thirteen miles
                    a                                day, as found by Capt.
                                                                         a
Parry.    This does not occur when   the  northern ocean     wholly covered  is
with     ice,       in the winter       season.    The drifting of the ice (as also currents)
implies     a       sea free of ice somewhere          in the north, occupying an area at
least as extensive as                  the drift-ice. As has been seen, some of the ice          is
the result                 one year's growth

for the space left                by
                      the ice during the summer.     The great abundance of
animal life in the waters of the highest latitudes reached indicates that the

even by ships which have been beset by ice in the highest latitudes.     Ice
bergs, it is well known, waste more rapidly below the surface than in the
air, causing them to topple over frequently, obviously the effect of the
warm current.
    The question, then, is, from whence do the warm waters come ? and
how do they acquire their heat ? And this is one of the questions which
a polar voyage by way of Spitzbergen would almost certainly elucidate.
Another important subject of investigation would be the conditions under
which the prevalent north winds of high latitudes originate.        There is
one argument bearing upon the temperature of the circumpolar seas which
should not be overlooked. During six months of the year the sun is above
the horizon ; and although the rays may be oblique, still the waters may
acquire a higher temperature than under similar conditions further south,
owing to there being little or no cooling from nocturnal radiation, and
probably to the constant dryness of the air allowing the sun to strike
with full power. During the winter these causes would intensify the cold.
    The occurrence of warm water is by no means confined to the sea around
Spitzbergen ; but, before referring to other regions, we may mention that
a set of instruments for taking soundings and deep-sea temperatures was
supplied this year by Mr. Smith to Capt. David Grey, of the whaler Eclipse,'
                                                                   '
whose father, in the year 1855, supplied the valuable information and
survey of the extension of Pond's Bay, now called Eclipse Sound.          His
observations were made in the middle of the sea, between Greenland and
Norway, and along a line running north-easterly from Iceland.           They
coincide with Dr. Carpenter's observations, proving the termination of the
Gulf-stream. In June 1854 Morton advanced beyond Kennedy Channel,
and saw open water as far as the horizon, visible from a hill 500 feet high.
The wind was from the north-west, and a rain-cloud was seen in the
distance above the open sea.      The water was setting in a strong current
south, and the ice along the shores was in a rapid state of dissolution.
The water was found in the several places tried to be well above the
freezing-point ; and in one place, some distance from the ice-foot, and at a
depth of 5 feet, the temperature was 40° F. There was a strong tide
from the north.      Kane's vessel wintered in Renselaer Harbour ; the strait
was bridged across by ice, with a current running south flowing beneath
it.    Although the open waters above alluded to may not be direct evidence
of   a comparat ively mild circumpolar region, yet the stream of warm water
coming from the north seems to indicate it.
    Where can this water acquire its warmth ? Sir John Richardson sug
gests that it is derived from the warm area near Spitzbergen ; but this is
not supported by evidence, which indicates that in both areas the water
comes from the north. It has been suggested that it is a continuation of
the Gulf-stream, apparently because it is supposed to supply all the warm
 water in the Arctic seas ; but if there is no reason for believing that the
warm sea around Spitzbergen derives its heat from this source, it is still

less credible  in the   case   of the Kennedy-Strait water.       It has been sug
gested that the source of warmth is the northward flow of the general mass
of the North Atlantic.          If this did account for the warmth of the Spitz
bergen area, although this view would be with difficulty reconciled with
a southward flow of Arctic water, it would be quite inapplicable to the
Kennedy-Channel        area.

   Among the many advantages that would result from circumpolar
research and the following up of this warm current, not the least im
portant would be the insight which it would probably afford as to the
regulating influences of the weather of North Europe, or generally of the
northern hemisphere.       Meteorologists      have long suspected that the
weather in Western Europe depends in some way upon what has hap
pened in the vicinity of the pole.      The many advantages to be gained to
science  by circumpolar navigation cannot be doubted.           Among them
would be careful observations of the currents and temperatures of the
surface and at various depths, and organisms which doubtless would be
obtained by dredging, as far as practicable, in the bed of the Arctic Sea, in
the highest latitude, and the probable extension of the whale-fisheries, as
well as the discovery of new land, should such exist.
   June 1. — The edge of the ice was 170 miles distant, and the warm
water was found at the surface, and cold water, which is of greater
density, below.
   June  13. — The sounding was taken        at the edge of the pack.  If the
experiments    had been continued,       increasing temperature would pro
bably have been found at a lower depth, as was the case further north.
   June 15. — To-day we were well in the ice, and had only time to sound
in 50 fathoms ; but even here we found an increasing temperature.
   June 17. — Being far in the ice, we only found a slight increase.
   June 18. — A second sounding, 50 fathoms deeper than yesterday, when
sailing among large pieces    of floe-ice, gave an increasing temperature up
to48°F.
   June  19. —To-day we had an increase of 7° above the surface-tempera
ture at 250 fathoms deep, although but 10 miles distant from yesterday's
soundings ; but the ice was more open : probably evaporation occurred
here, owing to the surface not being so closely covered with ice.
   June 20. — The first sounding shows the water to be coldest at the ice
foot ; the second and third prove the increasing temperature, which, as
we were somewhat more closely packed in the ice, increased more quickly,
and 39°  F. is obtained at 150 fathoms deep.
   June 22. — Here we were more closely packed. The surface was a degree
colder than yesterday, and the water at the ice-foot had also gone down
half a degree ; but the warm stream below was the same.         If we had had
time to sound at greater depths, the temperature of the water would in
all probability have been found still on the increase.
   June 27. — In this case we have the warm current clearly defined at 250
fathoms depth, being kept below by the lighter ice-water, which is nearly
fresh and of less specific gravity.
   July 1. — We were clear of the ice, and had a lower temperature than
before obtained.     If the flow of warm water came from the south, the
surface-temperature would have been greater than any temperature           as
yet obtained, because of the absence of ice.

   July   6. — This observation    shows a gradual increase as far down as
200 fathoms.       We were well in the ice, and were prevented from con
tinuing our sounding-operations.          Little evaporation has taken place,
owing to the closeness of the ice and the gradual increase of the tem
perature, with one exception, which occurred on the 18th of June, when
a temperature of 48° was obtained, — showing that the temperatures are
materially affected by local causes, the closeness of the pack or the opening
of the ice allowing evaporation to take place.
    July 7. — Here, where the ice is close, there is a great difference be
tween the surface temperature and that at the ice-foot.         We pulled up a
very beautiful description of starfish, which would not be likely to inhabit
this warm current were it of volcanic origin.
    July 10. — The crew being required elsewhere, we could not continue
our sounding-experiments.         The sounding    shows a decrease of tempera
ture, owing to the ice-water.
    July   12. — This remarkable    sounding was carefully registered specially
by Mr. Smith, who saw the index before it was immersed and immediately
on its coming up. This shows a gradual increase of temperature towards
the north, proving the current to come from the north ; and its tempera
 ture being above that of the Gulf-stream, where         it disperses itself, is a
 proof it is in no way connected with it.
    The thermometer       has since been examined by Mr. L. P. Casella, who
 certifies that  it " has been tested   in the hydraulic press, as well as care
 fully compared with my standard, and found correct in every way, no
 change whatever having taken place in the instrument."

  I. "On a new Method of viewing the Chromosphere."                                   By J.
        N. Lockyer, F.R.S., and G. M. Searkoke.                          Received No         •
        vember 6, 1872.
     The observations made by slitless spectroscopes during the eclipse of
 Dec. 11, 1871, led one of us early this year to the conclusion that the
  most convenient and labour-saving contrivance for the daily observation
  of the chromosphere would            be to photograph     daily the image of a ring-
 slit, which should be coincident with an image of the chromosphere itself.
     The same idea has since occurred to the other.
     We therefore beg leave to send in a joint communication to the Eoyal
 Society on the subject, showing the manner in which this kind of observa
 tion can be carried out, remarking that, although the method still requires
 some     instrumental details, which will make its working more perfect,
 images of the chromosphere, almost in its entirety, have already been seen on
 several days during the present month and the latter part of last mouth.
    The adaptation of this method to a telespectroscope will be seen at a
                                         o
 glance from the accompanying drawing.

                                             the air.
The annulus is viewed and brought to toons by looking through         apertures in the side
                                          of the tubes.

The chromosphere is afterwards brought to a focus again at the position
usually occupied by the slit of the spectroscope; and in the eyepiece is
seen the chromosphere in circles corresponding to the
                                                                 " C " or other lines.
The lens D is used to reduce the size of the sun's image, and keep it of
the same size as the diaphragm at different times of the year ; and the
lenses F are used in order to reduce the size of the annulus of light to
about \ inch, so that the pencils of light from either side of the annulus
may not be too divergent to pass through the prisms at the same time,
and that the image of the whole annulus may be seen at once.                There are
mechanical difficulties in producing a perfect annulus of the required
size, so one     \  inch in diameter is used, and can be reduced virtually to
any size at pleasure.
    The proposed photographic arrangements are            as follows : —
    A large Steinheil spectroscope is used, its usual slit being replaced by
the ring one.
    A solar beam is thrown along the axis of the collimator by a heliostat,
and the sun's image is brought to focus on the ring-slit by a 3f-inch
object-glass, the solar image being made to fit the slit by a suitable lens.
    By this method the image of the chromosphere received on the photo
graphic plate can be obtained of a convenient size, as a telescope of any
dimensions may be used for focusing the parallel beam which passes
 through the prisms on to the plate.
    The size of the image of the chromosphere obtained by the method
 adopted will be seen from the accompanying photograph, taken when the
 ring-slit was illuminated with the vapours of copper and cadmium.
    As this photograph is not reproduced, it may be stated that the ring-
 images have an internal diameter of nearly £ of an inch.

II. "Further Remarks         on the Sense of Sight in Birds." By Robert
       James     Lee,   M.A., M.D. Communicated by Robert Lee,
      M.D., F.R.S.        Received October 14, 1872.
   It was the object of my last communication to show the necessity for
more extensive researches into the differences of certain structures in the
eyes of birds in order to arrive at satisfactory conclusions regarding their
functions, which     are still undecided by anatomists.    It also appeared to
me to be desirable and interesting       to examine the different degrees of
development which characterize those structures in different species of
birds, as they seemed to afford an explanation of the remarkable powers
of vision which most birds possess.
   It would    be premature to enter upon general deductions     until the data
we possess are more numerous and the anatomical details are generally
allowed to be correct.
   Since my last communication it has been my privilege to receive much
assistance and valuable information from Mr. Hulke, who has directed
considerable attention to the structure of the ciliary muscle in birds.
   It appears to me impossible to reconcile the various opinions which
Briicke, Cramer, Donders, and particularly Heinrich Miiller entertain on
anatomical details, except on the supposition that the exact species of
bird has not been considered of sufficient importance to the question, also
that the particular method of dissection or preparation may have been
the cause of a different appearance in the minute structures.       In my own
experience     I have often found that singular differences are produced by
the method of preparation ; and it has usually been necessary, where there
was any doubt, from the eye having been preserved for some time, to
wait till  a fresh specimen could be obtained.
   In order to show the different degrees of development of the ciliary
muscle, a short Table has been drawn up, containing those specimens
which have been examined with most attention.                            I
                                                       For the present shall
consider the ciliary muscle as a simple structure for the production of
one effect, whatever minute differences may exist in the internal arrange
ment of its fibres.
   The second Table may         be regarded   as a continuation  of that com
menced    in my last communication, and is intended to furnish certain data
which are necessary for the determination of the visual powers in various
species of birds.

         Edward Divers, M.D. Communicated by Professor Odling,
         M.B., P.R.S. Received October 29, 1872.
                                      (Abstract.)
      Ammonia nitrate deliquesces in ammonia gas at ordinary temperatures
  and pressures, forming a solution of the salt in liquefied ammonia.            To
  prepare the product, it is only requisite to pass dry ammonia gas into a
  flask containing the dry nitrate ; but the condensation            proceeds more
 rapidly if the flask is surrounded with ice.
      The liquid obtained varies in composition according to the temperature
 and pressure.       At a temperature of 23° and the pressure of the atmo
 sphere, it consists of about four parts of nitrate to one of ammonia by
 weight ; but under greater pressure, or at lower temperatures, much more
 ammonia can be condensed by the nitrate.             At 0° and the pressure of
 the atmosphere, two parts of nitrate can condense one part of ammonia.
 Like an aqueous solution, the liquid boils when heated, and, when
 nearly saturated with the nitrate, deposits crystals of it when cooled. It
 can also, like an aqueous solution, be heated above its boiling-point
 without boiling, and become supersaturated with the salt without crys
 tallizing.    When poured out into an open vessel, it becomes almost
 instantly gelatinous in appearance — may, indeed, become so as it falls in
 a stream from the flask containing it.          This effect is due to evaporation
 of   ammonia    and solidification of nitrate at the surface of the liquid : on
 breaking the crust of nitrate, the compound flows out as liquid as ever.
 It is not caustic to the dry skin. During its decomposition cold is
 manifested, and during its formation heat is evolved, but not to a great
 extent, because the heat given out by the liquefaction of the ammonia is
 nearly all used up in the liquefaction of the nitrate.
     The specific gravity of the liquid varies, of course, with its composition.
 When it consists of two of nitrate to one of ammonia, it has a specific
 gravity of 1072-5    ; when   it consists of four of nitrate to one of ammonia,
it    has   a specific gravity of nearly 1200. Its specific gravity can
be calculated from its composition, by taking for the purpose 1524-5 as
the specific gravity of the nitrate, and 671 as that of the ammonia.           The
number 1524-5 is much less than that expressing the actual density of
the nitrate in the solid state, but       it does  not differ very much from its
apparent specific gravity in aqueous solution.
     In its rate of expansion by heat, the liquid resembles others that exist
as such at ordinary temperatures, rather than those that, like ammonia
itself, are only retained as such by great pressure.               Its expansivity
increases with the quantity of ammonia present.
     The volume of a mixture of the liquid with water is much less than the
sum of the volumes of the liquid and the water,                and yet a marked

absorption of heat occurs during the admixture.          The same thing happens
when a concentrated aqueous solution of the nitrate is poured into water,
as   was   first pointed     out   by Gay-Lussac.      Other examples of this
remarkable phenomenon           have been observed by different chemists, and
have received various explanations.         F. Mohr considers that heat is used
up in the depression of the freezing-point of the water which the salt
produces.      As this depression of the freezing-point is probably attended
by an increase in the latent heat of the water, his explanation appears to
be the correct      one.   Thomsen finds the specific heat of the mixture to
be less than the mean of the specific heats of its components.
    Its action      upon a great number of substances, principally in
organic, has been tried, and found to be for the most part like the
actions of dry ammonia and ammonia nitrate conjoined.                 The nitrate
appears to undergo double decomposition with most salts, and the
ammonia to unite with nearly all, including the salt of magnesium,
aluminium,       iron, and manganese. The ammoniated chromium salts
possess considerable stability.         The ammoniated mercuric iodide is re
solved by washing into ammonia and mercuric iodide again.                The am
moniated compounds which do not dissolve in the liquid are very bulky,
as observed by Gore in his experiments upon ammonia liquefied by
pressure.      Nitrates, chlorides, iodides, and bromides are either soluble, as
 Gore has found them to be, in ammonia alone, or else are decomposed
into soluble chlorides &c. of ammonium, and insoluble ammoniated
compounds of the metals.           Sulphates, oxalates, chromates, and arsenites
are insoluble,      and phosphates are nearly so.       Phosphoric and chromic
anhydrides     do not act upon the liquid with the energy that might be
expected, but combine with the ammonia.              Iodine dissolves freely,  as it
  joes  in ammonia       alone (Gore). Bromine generates nitrogen.            Lead
 <alts, including sulphate, chloride, iodide, and oxide, are freely soluble as
ammoniated compounds.             Platinous chloride dissolves freely as tetra-
ammonio-platinous chloride.          Potassium salts are very sparingly soluble.
Alkalis and their carbonates decompose the nitrate ; so do litharge, lime,
 and baryta.       Calomel is converted into metallic mercury and a soluble
ammoniated mercuric compound.             Potassium,   sodium, zinc, and cadmium
dissolve without liberating gas,          by reducing the nitrate to nitrite,
 potassium inflaming.       Magnesium slowly dissolves, liberating a little hy
 drogen, reducing      the nitrate, and becoming partly converted into Beetz's
 black suboxide of magnesium.            Methyl iodide is decomposed ; butyric
 ether and chloroform are sparingly soluble without decomposition.            Ether
is insoluble, but by its contact causes the liquid to break up into its two
 constituents.
    It  is a good electrolyte, ammonia and hydrogen appearing at the
 negative electrode, and nitrogen and ammonia nitrate at the positive
 electrode.     Its decomposition may be thus represented : —

 I. " A     new Formula for a Microscope Object-glass."               By F. H.
         Wenham.        Communicated        by W. B. Carpenter, M.D.,
         F.R.S.    Received October 31, 1872.
     A pencil of rays exceeding an angle of 40° from a luminous point can
 not be secured with less than three superposed lenses of increasing focus
 and diameter, by the use of which combination rays beyond this angle are
 transmitted, with successive refractions in their course, towards the posterior
 conjugate focus : until quite recently, each of these separate lenses has been
 partly achromatized by its own concave lens of flint glass, the surfaces in
 contact with the crown glass being of the same radius, united with Canada
 balsam ; the front lens has been made a triple, the middle a double, and
 the back again a triple achromatic.      This combination therefore consists
 of eight lenses, and the rays in their passage are subject to errors arising
from sixteen surfaces of glass.
     In  the new form there are but ten surfaces, and only one concave lens
of dense flint is employed for correcting four convex lenses of    crown glass  :
as this might at first sight be considered inconsistent with theory, a brief
retrospect of the early improvements of the microscope object-glass
will help to define the conditions.        The knowledge of its construction
has been entirely in the hands of working opticians ; and the information
published on the subject being scanty, this has probably prevented the
scientific analyst from giving that aid which might have been expected.
    Previous to the year 1829 a few microscopic object-glasses were made,
composed of three superposed achromatic lenses ; but this combination

112               Mr. F. H. Wenham on           a new  Formula         [Jan.  16,
appears to have been used merely with the intention of gaining an
increase of power, in ignorance of any principle, and without even a
knowledge of the value of angular aperture.
    At this time the late    J.J.   Lister tried a number of experiments, and
discovered the law of the aplanatic focus, and proved that, by separating
lenses suitably corrected, there were one or two positions in which the
spherical aberration was balanced.         This was explained in a paper read
before the Koyal Society in 1829. In the year 1831 Mr. Boss was em
ployed to construct the first achromatic object-glass in accordance with
this principle,  which   performed with
                                             " a degree of success  never antici
pated."
    Mr. Ross then discovered that, after he had adjusted the interval of his
lenses for the aplanatic focus, that position would no longer be correct if
a plate  of thin glass was placed above the object ; this focus had then to
be sought in a different plane, and the lenses brought closer together, in
order to neutralize the negative aberration caused by covering-glass of
                                                                "
various thickness.      From this period the " adjustment          with which all
our best object-glasses are now provided became established.            Fig. 1 is
the form of object-glass used at this time, consisting of three plano
concave achromatics, whose foci were nearly in the proportion of 1, 2, 3.
    No greater angle than       60°  could be obtained with this system in a
J-inch objective (the highest power then made), for reasons apparent in
the diagram.     The excessive depth of curvature of the contact-surfaces
of the front pair is unfavourable for the passage of the marginal rays ;
the softness of the flint glass forming the first plane was also objection
able. In the year 1837 Mr. Lister gave Mr. Eoss a diagram for an im
          " eighth,"
proved                 having a triple front lens in the form shown in fig. 2.
 By this the passage of extreme rays was facilitated ; and in order to
diminish the depth of curvature, a very dense glass was used, having a
specific gravity of 4-351.       Faraday's glass, having a density of 6-4, had
 been previously tried, but was abandoned on account of a difficulty in
 working it. The polished surfaces of both these qualities of dense glass
speedily became tarnished by exposure to the air ; and thus the dense
 flint concave could only be employed in a triple combination, that is,
 when cemented between two lenses of crown glass : this form of front
 was kept a trade secret, and was not published in any work treating of
 the optics of the microscope.        The front incident surface of the flint of
 the middle pair was made concave, in order to reduce the depth of the
 contact ; and for this reason only, as that surface has but little influence
 in correcting the oblique pencils, or in producing flatness of field, and
 may be a plane with an equally good or better result.
                                                              " Eighths " of this
 form with angles of 80° were made, and remained unaltered till the year
 1850, when larger apertures were called for, and Mr. Lister introduced
 the triple back lens.      . .
     The necessity for this will be seen by the diagram (fig. 2), which shows

that the contact-surfaces   of the back achromatic     are too deep, thus
giving great thickness to the lens and limiting its diameter    : dense flint
would  have  remedied this   to some  extent  ; but its liability to tarnish

  114               Mr. P. H. Wenliam          on a new Formula            [Jan. 16,
  rendered its use in a   pair objectionable.      The highest density at this time
  known, quite free from this defect, was 3-686.            By means of the triple
  back, the final corrections    were  rendered less abrupt, a greater portion of
  the marginal rays could be collected, and the aperture of an " eighth
                                                                                   "
  was at once brought up to 130° or more.
     At this time the author had been making             some experiments in the
  construction of an object-glass in the form of fig. 2. Mr. Lister having
  favoured his "eighth"' with an examination, was good enough to com
  municate his late improvement of the triple back.           No time was lost in
  giving  this a  trial, the  result  of  which   proved   that  excessive negative
 aberration or over-correction       could readily be commanded with lenses of
  shallow contact-curves.      During these trials all chromatic correction wus
 obtained by alterations in the triple back ; for it was found that the
 colour-correction    could not be controlled by a change in the concave
 surface of the triple front, as the negative power of the flint here ap
 peared to be feeble, requiring a great difference in radius to give a trifling
 result.   For this reason the front concaves were formed of very dense
 and highly dispersive flint ; the cause of this was analyzed by a large
 diagram, with the passage of the rays projected through the combination,
 starting from the longest conjugate focus at the back. This proved that
 the rays from that focus passed through the concave flint of the front
 nearly as a radius from its centre, or in such a direction that its negative
influence was almost neutralized.          It is well known that a lens may be
acliromatic for parallel rays, and under-corrected for divergent ones.
The utmost extent of this condition was apparent in the object-glass
under consideration.
    This led the author to the idea of the single front lens of crown glass,
which gave a fine result at the first attempt, as the back combinations to
which it was applied happened to have a suitable excess of negative or
over-correction    existing in the triple back alone, the middle being neutral
or nearly achromatic.        Still there was a defect remaining as positive
spherical aberration ; and this was afterwards cured by giving additional
thickness to the  front lens, which is now recognized as a most essential
element of correction.        In a " fifteenth," for instance, a difference of
thickness of only •002 of an inch will determine the quality between a
good and an indifferent glass. Fig. 3 represents a front lens suitable for
bringing the back rays to a focus. The dotted lines indicate the effect
of this difference, showing that with a lens of less thickness the marginal
rays fall within the central, producing positive aberration as the result.
    The single front introduced by the author is now used by every maker ;
for several years he could not induce the leading opticians to change
their system, though challenged by a series of high powers constructed
on this formula, for the purpose of proving its superiority.             Fig. 4 re
presents the curves of the first successful
                                                 " eighth " on this system, having
an aperture of 130°, enlarged ten times.              On tracing the passage of

  1873.]                  for   a Microscope     Object-glass.                  115
  the marginal rays through the combination, it will be seen that, though
  the successive refractions are nearly equalized, the contact-surfaces of the
  middle pair are somewhat deep, though no over-correction existed or
  was needed here, for this would have required a shorter radius still (the
  density of the flint in this was 3-686).         If  this pair of lenses were not
  cemented with Canada balsam, total reflection would take place near the
  circumference of the contact flint surface, cutting off the marginal rays
  at a, and limiting the aperture.         It might be argued that practically this
 would be no disadvantage, as these surfaces are united with Canada
  balsam, whose refraction is higher than the crown ; so that the rays in this
  case must proceed with very little deviation.          But incidences beyond the
  angle  of total   reflection may be considered detrimental, as they imply
  excessive depth of curvature; this can be discovered by looking through
 the front of an object-glass held close to the eye, any air-films in the
 balsam near the edge of the lens appearing as opaque black spots.
     At the commencement of the present year the author caused a few
 object-glasses to be made, with a middle of the form of fig. 5, the per
 formance of which was very satisfactory.             In this the extreme rays pass
 at more favourable incidences, and within the angle of total reflection.
 The upper lens is of dense flint.
     When the experiments on the single front were concluded, and the re
 markable corrective power of the triple back in conjunction therewith
 had been proved, the next attempt was to make the middle also a single
 lens, leaving the entire colour-correction to be performed by the one bi
 concave flint in the back. After numerous trials it was found that though
 something like over-correction or negative aberration could be obtained
 with the back, in the degree requisite for balancing the under-correction
 of the single middle and front when set at the prescribed distance of the
 aplan at ic focus, yet by trial on the mercury globule all the results in
 variably displayed two separated colour-rings : these could not be com
 bined by any alteration in the radius of the lenses. By projecting the
 blue and red, or visible rays of greatest and least refrangibility through
 the system, the cause became apparent.              The left-hand section of this
 object-glass   is   shown    in  fig. 6.   The  rays from the focus are slightly
 divided by the first front surface. On emerging from the back the sepa
ration is increased ; the red ray (r) is outwards, and the more refran
gible or blue ray (b) inwards.          Next, the divergence of these two rays is
 extended by the middle single lens.           The following crown lens extends
the angle of divergence so far that the flint lens of the back triple cannot
recombine them ; and they emerge at two distinct zones, shown by the
 practical test of the
                              " artificial star " or light-spot reflected from a
mercury globule, viewed within and without the focus.
     It might be supposed that these rays at their final emergence can be
so refracted    as to project      the blue outwards.       A crossing point would
then occur at     a fixed conjugate      focus in the body of the microscope, at

that of the eyepiece, achromatism and final correction would be the

result. But to meet the various conditions occurring in the use of
the microscope, the conjugate focus constantly alters in position, this

being affected by every change of eyepiece, length of tube, or adjustment
 for thickness of cover ; therefore a correction for a fixed point cannot be
 maintained.    Achromatism in the microscopic object-glass, like that of
 other perfectly corrected optical combinations, must be the reunion of
 the rays of the spectrum close to the final emergent surface of the
system. The remedy suggested by these experiments appeared to be in
a transposition, that is, in placing the over-corrected triple in the middle
of the entire object-glass ; this would at once cause a convergence of the
blue and red rays. A single lens of longer focus at the back would then
bring these rays parallel at the point of final emergence.
   By projection in a diagram this condition was apparently realized. The
dispersive power of the flint (density 3*686) was taken by the refractive
index 1*76 of line H in the blue ray of the spectrum, and l-70 of line B
in the red ray. The refraction of the corresponding rays in the crown
(density 2-44) was 1-53 H and 1/51 B. With these indices the rays are
traced in fig. 6. The radii in the right-hand half section are those of an
" eighth " of the new form drawn twenty times the size of the original.
The single front is of the usual form, as this is much alike in all cases.
The radius or focus of the single plano-convex back is about four and a
half times that of the front, and the focus of the middle (triple) three
times. The passage of the blue and red rays at the extreme of the pencil is
shown in contrast with the preceding, the separation from the same front
being alike.
   The inner and outer, or blue and red rays, after passing the first sur
face of the triple middle, meet the concaves of the flint, which refract
the blue rays to a greater extent than the red, and cause them to con
verge (instead of diverging, as in the opposing half diagram), so that at
their exit from the triple they meet and would cross, effecting what is
known as " over-correction ;" but this is so balanced and readjusted by
the single back of crown glass, that the rays are finally united, and
emerge in a state of parallelism.       This form of object-glass is suitable
for the high powers, or such as have a cover adjustment, viz. from the
" i-inch "   upwards ;  perfect  colour-correction is  equally to be obtained
in all of them.
   It  may be asked by some who have devoted their attention to the
higher branches of optical mathematics, why the above result should
have been worked out entirely by diagrams.            But it has been found
such a difficult task to calculate   the passage  of the two rays of greatest
and least refrangibility through a combination having sixteen surfaces of
glass of three different densities and refractions, that even first-class
mathematicians have hitherto shrunk from the attempt.
   Diagrams, however, are surprisingly accurate in their capability of in
dicating causes and results in the microscope and object-glass ; for these
lenses   are minute, with deep curves and abrupt refractions ; so that if
the projection is worked out some fifty times the size of the original,

 118     On a new Formula       for a Microscope Object-glass.     [Jan. 16,
small errors can be detected.       The work should    be commenced at     the
back from a long conjugate focus, which, not being a constant distance,
may be taken as very near to parallelism.      The high powers all have the
means of correction within this distance, and perform better with a long
posterior focus than with a very short one. The relative indices for the
two or more rays should be marked on a large pair of proportional com
passes, the long limb representing the sine of the angle of incidence, and
the short one that of refraction.     Both the sines ought to be set off in
the diagram behind, and neither of them in front of the ray in course of
projection ; this leaves the way clear, with the least confusion of lines.
    At the same time a second or counterpart diagram should be at hand,
to which the rays only are transferred as soon as their direction is ascer
tained  ; with these precautions a mistake is scarcely possible.
    Now it is hoped that some improvements may be effected by this in
vestigation, on account of the simplicity attained in the combination, in
which we have two single lenses of crown, whose foci bear a definite pro
portion to each other; while all the corrections are performed by on?
concave  of dense flint, the acting condition of which is not altered by the
influence of any other concaves acting in the combination, and hitherto
taking a share of the duty. This one flint is now to be considered
singly as the heart and centre of the system in reference to the correction
of the rays entering and leaving.
   This memoir is of necessity incomplete, for want of definite informa
tion concerning the optical properties of various kinds of glass. Data
obtained from working them into small lenses furnish only a rough ap
proximation to the mean dispersive power of the combined flint and
crown having the best apparent effect.        Of the intermediate rays, little
can be known beyond the mere appearance of more or less of a secondary
spectrum.
   Nothing of importance       has been published since   Fraunhofer's Table,
containing the refractive indices for each     of the  seven primary colour-
lines of the spectrum for ten kinds of glass : great advance has been
effected since that date in the manufacture of optical glass, a most com
plete collection of which of every variety has been made by the Bosses up
to the present date.      Selected specimens from this will be worked into
prisms, and the relative spectra mapped out by the Fraunhofer lines,
leading, it is hoped, to the discovery of a combination of crown and
flint glass which shall be free from secondary spectrum or absolutely
achromatic.    The result of this investigation will be the subject of a
future communication.

   II. " Note      on an Erroneous Extension of Jacobi's Theorem."              By
      Isaac Todhunter, M.A., F.R.S. Received October 25,                  1872.
      1.  It is well known that Jacobi discovered the possibility of the relative
  equilibrium of a mass of homogeneous fluid which is in the form of an
  ellipsoid and rotates with uniform angular velocity round the least prin
  cipal axis. A few days since, in reading over for the press a manuscript
  which had been written last year,       I  observed   I   had drawn attention to
  the circumstance that such relative equilibrium would be impossible if the
  ellipsoid rotated round any other straight line.             Almost immediately
  afterwards     I was accidentally glancing for the first time at the elaborate
  treatise on Mechanics published in 1870 by Dr. W. Schell, under the
                                                               I
 title of " Theorie der Bewegung und der Krafte," and noticed an account
 of Jacobi's theorem. Dr. Schell records that Jacobi was led to the dis
 covery of his theorem by reason of an erroneous statement, made by Pon-
 tecoulant, that such a result was impossible ; Jacobi undertook the
 inquiry, as he said, by virtue of a " certain spirit of contradiction to
                                                          "
 which he owed his most important            discoveries     (see page  966 of Dr.
 Schell's volume).       It  should be remarked, however, that as to the error,
 Pontecoulant merely followed Lagrange.
     2.   I was much surprised to find that on the    same page    Dr. Schell made
 the following assertion : — " It has been lately shown by Dahlander that
the relative equilibrium of the rotating ellipsoid will subsist even when
 the axis of rotation does not coincide with a principal axis of the ellip
 soid." A reference is supplied to a memoir by Dahlander in PoggendorfE's
 ' Annalen,'     vol. cxxix. (1866) p. 443. Notwithstanding this combination
of    authority the assertion is incorrect, as   I shall now show.
     3.   I assume that when a mass of fluid is rotating with uniform angular
velocity round a fixed axis, the problem of determining the pressure of
the fluid and the form of the free surface may be changed from a dyna
mical form to a statical in the following manner :— Suppose the rotation
stopped, and supply at every point an acceleration at right angles to the
axis outwards from the axis, equal to ru>*, where m is the angular velocity,
and r is the distance of the point from the axis of rotation. This can be
easily demonstrated, and is, in fact, always taken for granted by writers
on the subject.
     4.   I will confine myself for simplicity to the case in which the assumed
axis     of rotation passes through the centre of the ellipsoid ; but it will be
easily seen that the process is applicable when this condition is not ful
filled. Suppose that an ellipsoid, of which the axes are 2a, 2b, 2c, rotates
about a diameter which makes with the principal axes angles whose direc
tion     cosines are I, m, n.   Take for the equation to the ellipsoid

Let O denote the centre of the ellipsoid, M any poiut of the mass whose
coordinates are x, y, z, and N the point where the perpendicular from
M on the axis of rotation meets that axis. Let £, ij, £ be the coordinates
of   N.
     Then the acceleration m'MN, when resolved parallel to the                        axes, gives
rise to the components
                               »'(*-£),        o,\y-n),       m\z-()
respectively.           We must now determine            £, n,   f.
     We know that
                                     cosMON^+y"*;
                                            OM
hence      OMcos MON, that is ON=tr+my + nz.                          Denote this by v       ;   then
we have
                                     j!=Zt/,     n=mv,    (=nv.
The attractions of the ellipsoid at (x, y, z) parallel to the                  axes   will   be   re

where P, Q, E are certain constants, in the form of definite integrals,
which depend on the ratios of the axes of the ellipsoid.
  Hence if p denote the pressure, and p the density of the fluid, we have
                                     d£=P{*Xx-iv)-Vx\,

Therefore the form of the free surface will be determined by the equation
  uXx,+y*+zt)-uXlx+my + nzy— Par*— Qy'—Ri?= constant. . (2)
   By supposition, (1) and (2) must represent the same surface. But this
is obviously impossible, unless two out of the three I, m, n vanish.  Thus
the axis of rotation must coincide with one of the principal axes ; and
then it follows in the known way that this must be the least principal axis.
   5. Now let us turn to the memoir by Dahlander in PoggendorfF s
'
  Annalen.' The process is this. Dahlander supposes that there are
three simultaneous angular velocities, w, u', u", round the axes of x, y, z
respectively       ;   and then he assumes the equation
       d£=-(V-u'*-w',')xdx-(Q-u,i-u,'1)ydy—(n-u,'1-u1)zdz.
       P
This equation, however, is unjustifiable.    Dahlander does not say how he
obtained     it,
            so that          it is
                        impossible   to point out exactly where his error lies.
Perhaps the equation was supposed to hold in virtue of some unwarranted
extension       of the principle in article 3.             To show that the equation               is
                                                                       dp

variable      x ; but the three angular velocities are equivalent to                 a single an-
gular velocity, and then, as we see in article 4, we shall have                      -jr   involving
also    y   and z.

    Sir, —  I am directed to acquaint you that on the 13th of November
                                                                            '
last, at 2 a.m., a meteor burst against the ' Seven Stones light-vessel
belonging to this Corporation, and moored about 9^ miles E. by N. of the
Scilly Islands ; and that it has been reported that the watch were struck
senseless for a short period, seeing nothing before the shock, but that, on
recovery, balls of fire like large stars were falling in the water like splendid
fireworks, and that the decks were covered with cinders, which crushed
under the sailors' feet as they walked.              It appeared, the men said, as if
something was passing swiftly and met with the obstruction of the vessel
and burst.
    The superintendent reports that the men say there was a very decided
smell of brimstone, but add that they did not mention that until he asked
them.      There is reason to fear that the cinders were all washed off the
decks by the rain and sea before daylight ; and it happened also unfortu
nately that the men did not think to observe the compasses.
    The Elder Brethren have great doubts whether any more accurate
account of the phenomenon than the foregoing is obtainable ; at the same
time they direct me to report t he matter to you, conjoined with the assurance
that if any important or interesting scientific question is likely to be
elucidated by further inquiry, they will have great pleasure in causing
special questions to be put to the men, or in affording any member of the
Royal Society facilities for investigation.

 rrirutro-resorcinic acid ; but as Dr. Schreder* has since published an ac
 count of some of the amido-derivatives of the latter substance,          I have not
 pursued my investigations further in that direction, but confined myself
 to an examination of the products obtained from trinitro-orcinic acid.
   Amido-diimido-orcin, C7 Hs (NHa)(NH)2 02. —This compound, which has
 the properties of a base, is formed by the oxidation of triamido-orcin, and
 is most conveniently obtained in a pure state by decomposing a solution
 of the acetate with a slight excess of ammonia.
    The most advantageous method of preparing the base is to reduce tri-
 nitro-orcin with sodium-amalgam, and to oxidize the alkaline solution of
 triamido-orcin by exposure to the air. The details of the process are as
 follows : — One part of trinitro-orcin and forty or fifty parts of water are
 placed in a bottle furnished with a caoutchouc cork, and fragments of
 sodium-amalgam containing about 3 per cent. of sodium are gradually
introduced and agitated with the solution, which first acquires a brown
colour from the formation of an intermediate amido-product, probably
analogous to picramic acid, but becomes colourless as soon as the trinitro-
orcin is completely reduced. The solution should be cooled from time to
time, as considerable heat is generated during the reaction.             When the
solution containing triamido-orcin and sodic hydrate has become cold, it
is poured into a large flask and agitated briskly ; by this means the tri
amido-orcin     is oxidized to ainido-diimido-orcin      and the solution   assumes
a magnificent blue colour      :
             C7  H5 (NH2)3   0,+0=CrH, (NHJ (NH)2 0,+ 0Ha.
A   few seconds' agitation is sufficient, as   if it  be continued after the blue
colour is fully developed, the amido-diimido-orcin            in the strongly alka
line solution undergoes further oxidation and is destroyed. On strongly
acidulating the blue solution with sulphuric or hydrochloric acid, the cor
responding salt of amido-diimido-orcin is precipitated. Instead of directly
agitating the colourless solution with air, it may be first neutralized or
rendered very slightly acid with hydrochloric acid, cooled, and then ren
dered alkaline with ammonia.         If this solution be now agitated in the
manner before described it becomes filled with minute green needles of
amido-diimido-orcin.       Although the first method gives the best results
when carefully conducted, it requires considerable experience to stop the
oxidation at the precise point when the whole of the triamido-orcin is
oxidized to amido-diimido-orcin, and before the latter becomes destroyed.
With the ammoniacal solution there is far less danger of over oxidation.
    Trinitro-orcin is also reduced by treatment with tin and hydro
chloric acid, or zinc and hydrochloric or sulphuric acid.                  One part
of trinitro-orcin and four parts of granulated tin are heated in a capacious
flask with eight measures of concentrated hydrochloric acid diluted with
sixteen measures of water.         In a short time a powerful reaction takes

place, so that it is advisable to remove the flask from the source of heat in
order to prevent the contents from boiling over. When the action has
become somewhat moderate, the solution is boiled until it is colourless,
then diluted with water and the tin precipitated by hydrosulphuric acid.
The clear solution acquires      a purple tint on standing, and deposits large
dark-coloured    prisms of amido-diimido-orcin hydrochlorate, or the amido-
diimido-orcin may be obtained directly by adding a slight excess of am
monia to the filtrate from the tin sulphide and oxidizing by agitation in
the presence of air, when the base immediately separates in minute green
needles. Trinitro-orcin and granulated zinc are boiled in a flask with
twenty or thirty parts of water, and hydrochloric acid added in small
 quantities at a time until the solution becomes almost colourless.        The
clear liquid, poured from the excess of zinc and allowed to cool, is ren
 dered slightly alkaline by ammonia and exposed to the air.        As soon as
 the triamido-orcin   is oxidized, which may be known by the brown colour
 of the product, an   excess of hydrochloric acid is added to dissolve the zinc
 oxide and precipitate the amido-diimido-orcin as hydrochloride. The yield
 is, however, considerably less than when sodium-amalgam is employed as
 the reducing agent.
     The amido-diimido-orcin     sulphate or hydrochlorate obtained by any of
 the above processes is readily decomposed by treatment with a slight ex
 cess of dilute ammonia, leaving the free base in an impure state.         This
 should then be dissolved in warm dilute acetic acid, filtered, and precipi
 tated by a slight excess of ammonia.       Two or three solutions and repre-
 cipitations are sufficient to render it pure.
     Pure amido-diimido-orcin crystallizes in small needles, which have a dark
 green metallic lustre by reflected light. They are insoluble in alcohol,
 ether, and benzol, and almost insoluble       in water and dilute ammonia.
 Strong ammonia only dissolves the base in small quantity, yielding a pale
 blue solution, but it is readily soluble in a solution of sodic hydrate, with
 a fine deep blue colour ; the solution, however, when boiled, loses its
 colour, ammonia being at the same time evolved.        The base gives off am
 monia when heated, and leaves a carbonaceous residue very difficult of
  combustion.    As might be expected, when amido-diimido-orcin is treated
 with sodium-amalgam, it is reconverted into triamido-orcin.

       Triamido-orcin. —The colourless solution obtained by the reduction of
   trinitro-orcin with tin and hydrochloric acid, after removal of the tin by
   sulphydric acid, appears to contain triamido-orcin hydrochloride along with
  excess of hydrochloric acid.       On concentrating the solution at 100° much
  of the triamido-orcin is decomposed and a considerable amount of ammo
  nium chloride formed ; whilst, although long needles of triamido-orcin
  hydrochloride     are obtained by evaporating it in a vacuum, yet, owing to
  their great solubility and the readiness with which they absorb water and
  deliquesce, the salt has not yet been obtained in a state fit for analysis.
  On moistening the crystals of this hydrochloride with ammonia, they be
  come almost instantaneously converted into the metallic green needles of
  the amido-diimido-orcin.
      If a current of sulphuretted hydrogen be passed through a solution of
 ammonium sulphydrate in which amido-diimido-orcin is suspended, the
 latter rapidly loses its colour and      becomes  converted into a sandy deposit
 consisting    of colourless   crystals.   These   are  apparently triamido-orcin,
 and may be washed by decantation with a dilute solution of ammonium
 sulphydrate, in which they are but slightly soluble.        These crystals rapidly
 acquire the metallic green lustre of amido-diimido-orcin when exposed to
 the air, and are readily soluble in dilute acids. The hydrochloric-acid
 solution behaves in a manner precisely similar to that obtained by the
 reduction of trinitro-orcin with tin and hydrochloric acid, becoming deep
red, and depositing        crystals of amido-diimido-orcin     hydrochloride  when
 exposed to the air.
     Amido-diimido-orcin     hydrochloride. — The hydrochloride obtained in the
preparation      of amido-diimido-orcin, as described in the earlier part of this
communication,       may be purified by crystallization from hot water ; but as
heat decomposes solutions of the salts of this base, it is better to precipi
tate a cold solution of the acetate by a slight excess of hydrochloric acid,
in which the hydrochloride is but slightly soluble : the precipitate should
be thoroughly      washed with alcohol, pressed, and dried.
     Pure amido-diimido-orcin hydrochloride crystallizes in different ways,
according to the circumstances under which the crystals are formed.             As

 acid yields a mixture of these needles with rhomboidal plates ; the latter
 are purple by reflected light, and of an olive-green colour by transmitted
 light.    The slow oxidation of the hydrochloric-acid solution of triamido-
 orcin obtained by means of tin and hydrochloric acid yields dark-coloured
 short thick prisms.       The hydrochloride is insoluble in alcohol and ether,
 moderately soluble in cold water, and readily in boiling water, although
 the latter causes partial decomposition.         Its aqueous solution is precipi
 tated almost entirely on acidulating it with hydrochloric acid ; but the
 salt is soluble in concentrated hydrochloric acid, especially when warm,
 forming    a purple solution.   On boiling this the salt is rapidly decomposed
 and the colour changes to a dirty green.

   In   the present Part of the series of papers on the Fossil Mammals of

two transverse ridges for the chief character of their grinding-surface,

                               January 30, 1873.
         GEORGE BUSK,            Esq., Vice-President, in the Chair.
   The following communications were read         : —
I. " Note on the Origin of Bacteria, and on their Relation to the
       Process of Putrefaction."         By H. Charlton Bastian, M.D.,
       F.R.S. Received November 20, 1872.
   In  his now celebrated memoir of 1862,      M. Pasteur asserted and claimed
to have proved     (1) that the putrefaction occurring in certain previously
boiled fluids after exposure to the air was due to the contamination of
the fluids by Bacteria, or their germs, which had before existed in the at
mosphere, and (2) that all the organisms found in such fluids have been
derived more or less immediately from the reproduction of germs which
formerly existed in the atmosphere.
   The results of a long series of experiments have convinced me that both
these views are untenable.
   In   the first place, it can be easily shown that living Bacteria, or their
germs, exist very sparingly in the atmosphere, and that solutions capable
of putrefying are not commonly infected from this source.
   It   has  now been very definitely     ascertained that certain     fluids exist
which, after they have been boiled, are incapable of giving birth to Bac
teria, although they continue to be quite suitable for the support and
active multiplication of any such organisms as may have been purposely
added to them.       Amongst such fluids     I may name that now commonly
             "
known as Pasteur's solution," and also one which            I  have myself more
commonly used, consisting of a simple aqueous solution of neutral am
nionic tartrate and neutral sodic sulphate *. "When portions of either
of these fluids are boiled and poured into superheated flasks, they will
continue quite clear for many days, or even for weeks —that is to say,
although the short and rather narrow neck of the flask remains open the
fluids will not    become turbid, and no Bacteria are to be discovered when
they   are  submitted   to microscopical examination.
    But in order to show that such fluids are still thoroughly favourable
media for the multiplication of Bacteria, all that is necessary is to bring
either of them into contact with a glass rod previously dipped into a fluid
containing such organisms.        In about thirty-six hours after this has been
done (the temperature being about 80° P.), the fluid, which had hitherto
remained clear, becomes quite turbid, and is found, on examination with
the microscope, to be swarming with Bacteria f.
    Facts of the same kind have also been shown by Dr. Burdon Sander-
   * In the proportion of 10 grains of the former and 3 of the latter to  1 ounce of
distilled water.

son* to hold good for portions of boiled " Pasteur's solution." Air was
even drawn through such a fluid daily for a time, and yet it continued
free from Bacteria.
    Evidence of this kind has already been widely accepted as justifying
the conclusion that living Bacteria or their germs are either wholly absent
from or, at most, only very sparingly distributed through the atmo
sphere. The danger of infection from the atmosphere having thus been
got rid of and shown to be delusive,         I am now able to bring forward other
evidence tending to show that the first Bacteria which appear in many
boiled infusions (when they subsequently undergo putrefactive changes)
are evolved de novo in the fluids themselves.                 These experiments are
moreover so simple, and may be so easily repeated, that the evidence
which they are capable of supplying lies within the reach of all.
    That boiling the experimental fluid destroys the life of any Bacteria or
.Bacteria-germs preexisting therein is now almost universally admitted ;
it may, moreover, be easily demonstrated.              If a portion of " Pasteur's so
         "
lution be purposely infected with living Bacteria and subsequently boiled
for two or three minutes, it will continue (if left in the same flask) clear for
an indefinite period ; whilst a similarly infected portion of the same fluid,
not subsequently boiled, will rapidly become turbid. Precisely similar
phenomena occur when we operate with the neutral fluid which                     I have
previously    mentioned    ; and  yet  M.  Pasteur     has ventured  to assert that the
germs of Bacteria are not destroyed in neutral or slightly alkaline fluids
which have been merely raised to the boiling-point t.
    Even M. Pasteur, however, admits that the germs of Bacteria and other
allied organisms are killed in slightly acid fluids which have been boiled
for a few minutes ; so that there is a perfect unanimity of opinion
(amongst those best qualified to judge) as to the destructive effects of a
heat of 212° F. upon any Bacteria or .Bacteria-germs which such fluids
may contain.
    Taking such a fluid, therefore, in the form of a strong filtered infusion
of turnip, we may place it after ebullition in a superheated flask with the
assurance that it contains no living organisms.              Having ascertained also
by our previous experiments with the boiled saline fluids that there is
no danger of infection by Bacteria from the atmosphere, we may leave
the rather narrow mouth of the flask open, as we did in these experiments.
But when this is done, the previously clear turnip-infusion invariably
becomes turbid in one or two days (the temperature being about 70° F.),
owing to the presence of myriads of Bacteria.
    Thus if we take two similar flasks, one of which contains a boiled
" Pasteur's solution " and the other a boiled turnip-infusion, and if we

to show.   See ' Beginnings of Life,' 1872, vol. i. pp. 326-333, 372-399.

place them beneath the same bell-jar, it will be found that the first fluid
remains clear and free from Bacteria for an indefinite period, whilst the
second invariably becomes turbid in one or two days.
    What is the explanation of these discordant results ? We have a right
to   infer that all preexisting life has been destroyed in each of the fluids * ;
we have proved also that such fluids are not usually infected by Bacteria
derived from the air ; in this very case, in fact, the putrescible saline
fluid remains pure, although the organic infusion standing by its side
rapidly putrifies.      We can only infer, therefore, that whilst the boiled
saline solution is quite incapable of engendering Bacteria f, such organisms
are able to arise de novo in the boiled organic infusion.
    Although this inference may be legitimately drawn from such experi
ments as     I  have here referred to, fortunately it is confirmed and strength
ened by the labours of many investigators who have worked under the
influence of much more stringent conditions, and in which closed vessels
of various kinds have been employed J.
    Whilst we may therefore infer (1) that the putrefaction which occurs
in many previously boiled fluids when exposed to the air is not due to a
contamination by germs derived from the atmosphere, we have also the
same right to conclude (2) that in many cases the first organisms which
appear in such fluids have arisen de novo, rather than by any process of
reproduction from preexisting forms of life.
    Admitting, therefore, that Bacteria are ferments capable of initiating
                            I
putrefactive changes, am a firm believer also in the existence of not-
living ferments under the influence of which putrefactive changes may be
initiated in certain fluids — changes which are almost invariably accom
panied by a new birth of living particles capable of rapidly developing
 into Bacteria.

    A notation is described, adapted to use with ordinary written music,
by which the notes to be performed are clearly distinguished.
    The design of a key-board is described, by which any system of tuning,
except the ordinary equal temperament, can be controlled, if only the
fifths   of the system    be  all equal.   The design is on a symmetrical
principle,   so that all passages  and combinations of notes are performed
with the same handling, in whatever key they occur.
    The theory of the construction of scales is then developed, and a
diagram is given, from which the characteristics of any required system
can be ascertained by inspection.
    An account is then given of the application of such systems to the new
key-board, and particularly of an harmonium which has been constructed
and contains at present the division of the octave into fifty-three equal
intervals in a complete form.     Rules for tuning are given.

     * The amount of ctesium appears to be very small. On adding chloride of platinum
 to a rather dilute solution of the alkaline chlorides obtained from this water, a slight
 yellow precipitate was deposited ; this, after re-solution and the removal of the platinum
 by sulphuretted hydrogen, afforded by the spectroscope somewhat faint indications of
 the presence of caesium.
    t  As the state of combination in which the various substances present in mineral
 waters exist cannot be accurately determined, the system of grouping adopted in the

     A consideration of the various phenomena connected with the occur
  rence of this and other apparently similar springs which have at different
  times been discovered in the district, would seem to lead to the inference
  that they all have some more or less direct communication with the sea,
  and that they are either the result of infiltration of sea-water through
 faults, or are true and independent sources which, before being tapped
 below the sea-level, had found their way to the ocean through faults or
  channels.
     The following would appear, in the present state of our knowledge, a
 not improbable explanation of the origin of the Huel Seton spring.
     The cross course is believed to extend through both granite and clay-
 slate to the sea.        From the    close contact   of its surfaces, the presence of
 clay, and from other causes, this fault may be supposed not to be
 uniformly permeable by water, which can only follow a circuitous passage.
 In this way it penetrates to depths where reactions take place, which,
 although not entirely in accordance with the results of daily experience
 in our laboratories, can, after the investigations of M. Daubree, M. de
 Senarmont, and others, be readily understood.
     By the action of sea-water on silicates of calcium, silicates of sodium and
chloride of calcium may be produced.              The sulphate of sodium of the sea-
water will be decomposed by this chloride of calcium, with the production
of    sulphate  of    calcium   and chloride of sodium. The decomposition of
clayey matter by common salt may produce chloride of aluminium and
silicates of sodium, while the magnesium of the chloride of magnesium may
be replaced by calcium ; lastly, a portion          of the potassium in the sea-water
appears to have been replaced by the            lithium  of the granite.

 HO                  Mr. G. Gore      on tome Properties
 " On   some   Properties    of Anhydrous Liquefied Ammonia."                   By
              G. Gore, F.R.S. Received May 15, 1872*.
    To examine the general       solvent properties of anhydrous liquefied
 ammonia, and to detect any manifest chemical reactions between it and
                     I
 various substances, employed precisely the same kind of method as that
 I used in examining   liquid cyanogen (see Proc. Eoy. Soc. vol. xx. p. 67).
    It was desirable in these experiments not to use flint-glass tubes,
 because the tenacity of that substance is so feeble the tubes burst by the
 pressure of the gutta-percha stoppers ; when such tubes were employed,
the mouths of them had to be closed by fusion.            The tubes require to be
 somewhat stronger than those used with liquid cyanogen, because the
 pressure exerted by the vapour is so much greater.              The length of the
horizontal portion of the tubes was 7| inches ; by having this part of
the tube very much longer, a much lower degree of heat is necessary in
the experiments, and a greater quantity of the liquid may be obtained.
    To procure the anhydrous liquid, chloride of calcium was heated to
redness, reduced to fine powder, and perfectly saturated with well-dried
ammonia in a current of that vapour, the flask containing the powder
being immersed in broken ice during the latter part of the process, and
occasionally shaken to prevent formation of lumps.             During this process
the powder evolved much heat and swelled considerably.                  Every pre
caution was taken to prevent the powder absorbing moisture from the
atmosphere.
   The temperature     employed to expel the vapour from the salt, with
tubes of the dimensions given, was much below that of visible redness.
On allowing the tubes to become quite cold, the vapour was reabsorbed
and the liquid disappeared ; the pressure having also ceased, enabled the
stopper to be removed and the products further examined.                   By this
means   some of the tubes could also be employed         for fresh substances.
   250 substances, including solids and liquids, and a great variety of
simple and compound bodies, were subjected to the action of the liquefied
vapour.    Except when otherwise stated, the substances were in nearly all
cases as free from moisture as    it was convenient to obtain them ; never
theless in some instances the effects were evidently due in a slight degree
to traces of water.    The substances were also generally very pure, many
of them having been carefully prepared by myself. The following is a
statement of the results : —
   Water mixed perfectly with the liquid. After the reabsorption of the
ammonia by the chloride of calcium and the tube had become perfectly
cold, the water   had become about twice its original bulk by retention of
ammonia.
   Iodine first liquefied to the appearance of thin treacle, then entirely
dissolved to a clear and slightly yellow liquid.          On evaporation of the
               * Read  June 20, 1872.  See abstract, vol. xx. p. 441.

                       of Anhydrous Liquefied Ammonia.                          141
 ammonia,    reddish-black   crystals separated, apparently consisting of un
 altered  iodine.    I  did not examine whether the residue contained any of
 the explosive compound, "iodide of nitrogen."              Iodic acid did not dis
 solve or show any change in the liquid.
    Wood-charcoal,     also Brodie's intumescent graphite, did not dissolve or
change.     Ca Cla  would    not mix with the ammonia ; but a little of it
dissolved, and the ammonia became slightly brown.               Liquid C, Cl4 mixed
perfectly,   and  after the evaporation of the ammonia it was left behind.
Solid Ca Cl8 did not dissolve or suffer any change. Liquid CC14 behaved
like Cj Cl,.    Solid CBr, * dissolved rapidly and very copiously, and did
not recrystallize until nearly all the liquid had evaporated.
    Boron crystals, boracic anhydride, silicon crystals, and precipitated
silica were all unaffected.
    Sulphur dissolved sparingly, and formed a deeply coloured purplish-red
solution,  and on evaporation of the- liquid a yellow film of it was left.
Liquid chloride of sulphur became dark red and solid in the gas,
and purple     in  the liquid, apparently with chemical action ; a portion of
the solid dissolved and formed a deeply purple liquid, on evaporation of
which the red solid was left behind.          Bisulphide of carbon became yellow
and opaque     in the gas, and changed in the liquid to a yellow bulky solid.
Selenium was unaffected.         Selenious acid prevented the formation of the
liquid, probably by uniting with the ammonia, but did not enlarge in
bulk, or show any visible change.          Bright tellurium was unaffected.
    Red phosphorus showed no change. White phosphorus dissolved to a
yellow liquid, and separated again on evaporation of the ammonia.
Phosphoric anhydride contracted in bulk in the gas, dissolved but very
slightly in the liquid, and exhibited no other change. Glacial phosphoric
acid was not visibly affected.      Terchloride of phosphorus produced strong
chemical    action,  and formed a colourless bulky solid.          Pentachloride of
phosphorus dissolved freely, and crystals formed on evaporation of the
liquid.
    Metallic arsenic was unaffected. Arsenious anhydride enlarged some
what in bulk, but did not dissolve.          Arsenic-acid crystals dissolved to a
very minute extent only.          Terchloride of arsenic was converted into a
white solid with manifest chemical action.           Teriodide of arsenic became
white and      swelled    considerably.     Realgar became yellow, and partly
dissolved to a yellow solution, which on evaporation left an orange-yellow
residue.     Orpiment turned dark brown in the gas, and dissolved slightly
in the liquid, producing a faintly yellow solution, which left a yellow film
on evaporation.
    Metallic antimony, sesquioxide of antimony, and antimonious acid were
not   visibly affected. Hydrated antimonic acid was slightly dissolved.
Fused fluoride of antimony swelled very greatly in the liquid, but did not
dissolve ; it retained its enlarged bulk after evaporation of all the
              * Given to me                      Messrs. Groves and Bolas.

142                     Mr. G. Gore      on some Properties
ammonia.       Crystalline hydrated terchloride of antimony swelled con
siderably, but did not dissolve.        Oxychloride of antimony was not visibly
affected.     Terbromide of antimony dissolved freely.              Oxybromide      of
antimony was very slightly dissolved.             Teriodide of antimony became
yellow   with   apparent   chemical  action, and   a portion dissolved and formed
a dense layer beneath the colourless liquid ammonia.                  Black and red
sesquisulphides     of  antimony    were  not  visibly affected,  but  each imparted
a faint purplish-blue colour to the liquid.          Orange sulphide of antimony
dissolved    to  some   extent,  forming    an  opaque brownish-green solution,
and separated again on evaporation of the liquid. Vanadic acid and
nitride of vanadium produced no visible effect*. " Molybdenum
                                                                             "
                                                                               (in the
state of a fine black powder) imparted a weak cobalt-blue colour to the
liquid, but did not visibly diminish in bulk.          Molybdic acid became quite
white, but did not dissolve.         Native sulphide of molybdenum, " tung
      "
sten     (in the state of a black powder), and tungstic acid produced no
visible effect.
    Metallic bismuth, hydrated oxide of bismuth,           and fluoride of bismuth
were not visibly affected.         Chloride of bismuth     (not anhydrous) swelled
greatly, and dissolved rather freely, but partly           returned to its original
bulk after the liquid had evaporated.          Carbonate    of bismuth and sulphide
of bismuth were not visibly altered.
    Metallic osmium was not visibly affected.           Osmic acid was chemically
altered, and produced first a yellow, then a red, and finally a brownish-
black opaque mixture, consisting of solid particles suspended in a com
 paratively colourless liquid : on evaporation of the liquid, the solid
 substance remained behind.         Black oxide of iridium, also scales of osmi-
 iridium, produced no visible effect. Metallic palladium was not affected.
 Bichloride of palladium became white, and enlarged in bulk, and slightly
 dissolved to a clear yellow liquid ; the residue remained white and of
 enlarged bulk after evaporation of the liquid.          Sulphide of palladium was
 unaffected. Black oxide of platinum was not visibly affected. Bichloride
 of platinum      became    nearly white, and slightly dissolved, forming a
 slightly yellow     solution.   Tetrachloride     of platinum behaved like the
 bichloride.     Tetraiodide of platinum turned red, dissolved freely to a
 reddish-yellow liquid, crystallized in red needles on evaporation of the
 solution, and finally left a black residue.       Terchloride of gold was decom
 posed, and the product very slightly dissolved.
     Bright silver was unaffected.       Oxide of silver swelled considerably, but
 did not dissolve     ;  it contracted again after evaporation of the liquid.
 Peroxide of silver (formed by electrolysis of a pure solution of argentic
 fluoride with platinum electrodes) became brown, and made the liquid
 slightly yellow, but did not visibly alter in bulk. Argentic nitrate
  dissolved freely, and on evaporation of the liquid long crystalline needles
  separated.     Brown argentic fluoride swelled a little, became somewhat
                              * Given to me by Dr. Roscoe.

white,   dissolved sparingly, and separated in needles on evaporation.
Chloride of silver in powder swelled considerably, but did not dissolve ; it
remained enlarged in bulk after evaporation of the liquid. Fused argentic
bromide lost its transparency, swelled and became white, dissolved
slightly, and crystallized on evaporation.           Argentic iodide dissolved
rapidly   and  freely, and  formed   a  dense colourless  solution which mixed
with the excess of liquefied ammonia ; colourless crystals separated, but
not until nearly all the liquid had evaporated : this salt is extremely
soluble in the liquid. Argentic iodate showed no effect. Carbonate of
silver turned dark brown and swelled considerably, but did not dissolve,
and on evaporation of the liquid returned to its original volume and
colour. Argentic sulphate swelled greatly, and disintegrated to a fine
white powder, which returned partly to its orignal bulk after evaporation
of all the liquid. Phosphate of silver and argentic arseniate were nearly
insoluble, and suffered no chemical change. Vanadate of silver was
insoluble.
    Mercury was unaffected.           Yellow mercuric oxide, also red-brown
 mercuric oxide (both obtained by precipitation), did not dissolve or alter.
 Mercurous nitrate turned black in the gas, and dissolved to some extent
 in the liquid; the residue left after evaporation of the liquid was a
 blackish-grey powder, apparently consisting of minute particles of metallic
 mercury. Mercurous chloride became brown in the gas, and dissolved
 copiously to a dense solution in the liquid ; but its solution would not mix
 with the excess of liquefied ammonia : by evaporation of the ammonia it
 was left in a crystalline state. Mercuric chloride dissolved freely, forming
 a colourless dense solution, which would not mix or dissolve in the
 slightest degree in the excess of liquid : by evaporation the excess of
 liquid separated first, then that containing the chloride, and left the salt
 in a crystalline state. Mercuric bromide fell to powder with apparent
 chemical action, and dissolved to a small extent.       Scarlet mercuric iodide
 first became yellow, then dark brown, and dissolved freely : on evapora
 tion of the liquid, the salt separated in a crystalline state. Mercuric
 sulphide was unaffected. Anhydrous mercuric sulphate was very little
 affected.    Hydrated mercuric sulphate swelled greatly, imparted a violet
 colour to the liquid, and partly returned to its former bulk after
 evaporation of the ammonia.
    Copper lost its brightness, and imparted a slightly brown colour to the
 ammonia : when nearly all the liquid had evaporated, the residuary
  portion was deep blue in colour. Copper filings produced no additional
 effect.    Suboxide of copper was nearly insoluble, and but little affected.
  Protoxide of copper was also insoluble and unaffected. White anhydrous
 cupric fluoride became deep blue in colour, but imparted scarcely any
 colour to the liquid.        Anhydrous cupric chloride became deep blue,
 swelled greatly,   did not  dissolve  nor impart colour to the liquid. Cuprous
 iodide (not perfectly anhydrous) became partly green, and imparted a

  faint blue colour to the liquid, but did not otherwise dissolve. Cupric
 carbonate produced no effect.        Cupric sulphide was superficially changed
 to a deep blue colour. White anhydrous cupric sulphate turned deep
  blue and swelled greatly, but did not impart any colour to the liquid ; it
  remained enlarged in bulk after evaporation          of the ammonia.     Cupric
  phosphate produced no visible effect.
     Nickel filings were unaffected.    Anhydrous oxide of nickel and hydrated
 oxide of nickel were also unaffected.       Fluoride of nickel suffered no great
 visible change, and did not dissolve.      Nearly anhydrous chloride of nickel
 swelled and became of a purplish-blue           colour, but did not dissolve :
 after evaporation of the liquid, the salt remained enlarged in bulk.
     Oxide of cobalt, also fluoride of cobalt, was unaffected.        Anhydrous
 chloride of cobalt swelled to about ten times its original volume and fell
 to powder, but was quite insoluble ; it partly contracted in bulk again
 on evaporation of the ammonia.           Carbonate of cobalt was unaffected.
 Sulphate of cobalt (not perfectly anhydrous) swelled, but did not dissolve;
 it remained expanded after evaporation of the liquid.
    Electro-deposited iron was unaffected.       Anhydrous persulphate of iron
 absorbed much of the liquid, swelled considerably, and showed signs of
 decomposition, but did not dissolve ; it remained enlarged in bulk after
 evaporation of the liquid.
    Metallic manganese, fluoride of manganese, chloride of manganese, and
 manganic sulphate were all unaffected.
    Chromic acid turned yellow, absorbed ammonia, swelled greatly, dis
 solved slightly, forming a yellow solution, and retained its enlarged bulk
 after evaporation of the liquid. Solid green fluoride of chromium was
 not affected. Violet chloride of chromium swelled considerably and
 dissolved slightly, forming a purplish solution ; it did not contract to its
 original bulk after evaporation of the liquid.       Chromate of silver turned
 bright yellow at its     edges,   and nearly  black  in its mass, but did not
dissolve.    Chromate of copper was not dissolved, but was converted
externally into a substance having the colour of sesquioxide of chromium.
Metallic aluminium was unaffected. Yellow oxide of uranium and nitrate
of uranium produced but little effect. Fluoride of uranium was slightly
dissolved, forming a yellowish solution.
    Metallic thallium, peroxide of thallium, and fluoride of thallium were
not visibly altered. Bright metallic lead and red oxide of lead were
unaffected.      Nitrate of lead dissolved, and was apparently partly decom
posed ; crystals separated on evaporation of the last portions only of the
liquid. Fluoride of lead produced no effect. Chloride of lead swelled
considerably, but did not dissolve ; it did not diminish in bulk on
evaporation of the liquid.       Iodide of lead turned white, dissolved slightly,
and colourless crystals were left on evaporation of the liquid.        Iodate of
lead produced no effect.      Yellow chromate of lead behaved in all respects
like the iodide.

    Metallic tin, stannous oxide, and stannic oxide were not affected.
Fused bichloride of tin was partly dissolved. Liquid tetrachloride of tin
was first converted into a solid substance with strong chemical action ;
the solid then dissolved freely, and separated again on evaporation of the
liquid. Metallic indium was unaffected.
    Fluoride of cadmium was not affected. Chloride of cadmium swelled,
but did not dissolve ; it contracted again on evaporation of the liquid.
Bromide of cadmium swelled somewhat, but did not dissolve.                       Iodide of
cadmium swelled greatly, and absorbed a large quantity of ammonia, but
did not dissolve ; it remained enlarged in bulk after evaporation of the
liquid. Carbonate of cadmium produced no effect. Sulphide of cadmium
was not visibly affected, but it imparted to the liquid a faint cobalt-blue
colour.
    Fluoride of zinc produced no effect.             Chloride of zinc fell to powder,
swelled greatly, and did not contract after evaporation of the liquid ; it did
 not dissolve. Bromide of zinc and iodide of zinc behaved like the chloride.
    Nitrocyanide of titanium, black oxide of titanium, titanic acid, zir
conium scales, oxide of zirconium, sulphate of thorinum, glucina, chloride
of glucinum, carbonate of glucinum, sulphate of glucinum, sulphate of
lanthanum,       and niobic acid produced no visible effect.
     Oxide of cerium and fluoride of cerium were unaffected.                   Nitrate of
cerium dissolved slightly.            Chloride of cerium swelled slightly, but did
 not dissolve. Metallic magnesium was unaffected.                     Basic chloride of
 magnesium dissolved slightly.
     Metallic calcium became covered with an insoluble white                 powder, but
 did not dissolve nor exhibit any other effect.              Fused chloride of calcium
 fell to powder, swelled greatly, but did not dissolve. Bromide of calcium
 swelled a little, but did not dissolve.             Metallic strontium behaved like
 calcium.      Metallic barium lost its metallic appearance, but showed no
 signs of solution or other effect. Caustic anhydrous baryta was unaffected.
 Nitrate of barium dissolved freely, and crystallized on evaporation of the
 liquid. Chloride of barium swelled considerably, but did not dissolve ; it
 remained enlarged in bulk after evaporation of the liquid. Baric sulphate
 was not visibly affected.
     Metallic lithium produced strong action, and formed a deep indigo-blue
 coloured fluid : as the liquid evaporated the metal separated, and ex
 hibited successive colours, first that of bronze, then of brass, and ulti
 mately colourless and brilliant like silver.            Metallic sodium swelled, and
 then behaved very much like lithium. Chloride of sodium dissolved
 sparingly, and did not enlarge in bulk.              Metallic potassium behaved like
 lithium and sodium*.             Nitrate of potassium was soluble, but not freely
     * These   results   agree with those previously obtained by C. A. Seely (see
                                                                                   '

 146                      Mr. G. Gore     on some Properties
 so.   Fluoride of potassium was very slightly soluble. Chloride of potas
 sium was not visibly affected.         Potassic bromide dissolved sparingly, and
 crystallized   on  evaporation    of the  liquid. Iodide of potassium was freely
 soluble.    Silico-fluoride    of potassium was insoluble.           Chloriridiate of
 potassium crystals were superficially changed to a brown colour, but did
 not dissolve.      Permanganate of potassium dissolved very freely to a deep
 purple-red     solution,  and was left behind on evaporation of the liquid.
 Chromate of potassium dissolved to a minute extent.              Potassic bichromate
 dissolved somewhat, and formed            a yellow    solution.    Chrome-alum     was
 only superficially changed.        Fluozirconate of potassium was not visibly
affected. Metallic rubidium behaved like sodium and potassium.                Fluoride
 of rubidium was insoluble.
    Nitrate of ammonium dissolved very freely.                Chloride of ammonium
 also dissolved very freely, and did not crystallize until nearly all the
liquid had evaporated. Carbonate of ammonium, ammonium vanadate,
 and ammonium metavanadate produced no visible effect.
    Uric acid and paracyanogen were unaffected. Argentic cyanide dis
 solved very freely and rapidly, and crystallized in scales on evaporation of
the liquid.      Cyanide of mercury dissolved freely, and crystallized only on
 evaporation of the last portions of the liquid. Cupric cyanide turned
 deep blue, and dissolved to some extent.                  Cupric ferrocyanide was
 converted     into   a  dark   green solid.       Cyanide of zinc was very little
affected.     Potassic cyanide was insoluble.            Potassic sulphocyanide dis
solved to some extent.          Ferrocyanide      of potassium produced no effect.
 Fusel-oil, ether, alcohol, aldehyde, and chloroform mixed freely and
perfectly.      Alloxan became of a deep purple-red colour, and dissolved
freely, and left a purple-red            solid after evaporation of the liquid.
 Succinic   acid was insoluble.        Indigo dissolved sparingly, and formed a
reddish-brown       solution.    Sulphate of quinine dissolved to some extent.
Gutta percha imparted a brown colour to the liquid, and a sticky residue
was left on evaporation.          Paraffin, anthracene, and naphthalin were not
visibly affected.      Amylene would not mix with the liquid. Mesitylene
behaved similarly.         Starch swelled and mixed as it does with water, out
did not form a clear solution.          Glycerine mixed perfectly.       White sugar
dissolved freely,     and  left gummy
                                a            residue  on  evaporation   of the liquid.
Isinglass rapidly became semifluid.              Camphor dissolved copiously, and
crystallized when the liquid evaporated.             Gum-copal dissolved only to a
minute extent.        Gun-cotton dissolved sparingly, and the solution left a
film on evaporation.        Bengal silk was quite insoluble.
    A few experiments were made for the purpose of examining the
chemical properties of the solution of potassium by placing other sub
stances inside the tubes with that metal, and then distilling the ammonia
into contact with them. C, Cl6 prevented the production of the blue
colour.     C3 Cl4 produced chemical action, and prevented the blue colour ;
the residue was a white solid, exhibiting no signs of free carbon.                CBr4

        ceived December 19, 1872.

     The paper laid before the Society is intended to fill a certain deficiency
in our knowledge of the extinct creation by giving a complete osteology
of a family of Paridigitate Ungulata, which, by the completeness of its
skeleton, unreduced number of digits, and rich development in generic
     TOL. XJtl.                                                        o

148                        Dr. W. Kowalevsky on the                             [Feb. 6,
and specific forms,    I deem to be of great importance in our speculations
on the pedigree of living Ungulata Paridigitata.
   On theoretical grounds, as well as from the consideration of rudiment&l
parts in living Paridigitata, anatomists have always supposed that fossil
representatives of this family, which could be regarded as the progenitors
of the recent Paridigitata, would certainly exhibit a much less reduced
skeleton and a more complete number of digits than the recent genera
do. Yet, strange to say, such complete forms were not forthcoming,
and,  if assumed on the evidence of their teeth, very little was known about
the structure    of their bony frame. My statement will sound like an
exaggeration ; but still it is true, that since the time of Cuvier, who
shortly noticed the tetradactyle Dichobune, and Blainville, who gave a very
imperfect description of Cainotherium, we have absolutely not a single
paper in which the osteology of an extinct genus of Paridigitata has been
fully given *. This may partly be the reason that the pedigree of living
genera has hitherto been so obscure.
    The Paridigitata of the Paris gypsum, described in a masterly way by
Cuvier (the Anoplotherium and Xiphodon), were clearly extremely reduced
descendants of some earlier more complete forms ; their feet presented,
in fact, nearly the same degree of reduction which we find in our recent
Ruminantia, save the confluence in a cannonbone.                   Seeing the reduced
state of their skeleton, how could they be taken as progenitors of the very
rich family of Ruminants, some of which have retained, even till our
times, a tetradactyle limb ? However, so great was the want of some
form from which the living Ruminantia could be assumed to be derived,
that nearly all comparative anatomists and palaeontologists who speculated
on these questions of descent, placed the Anoplotherium and Xiphodon
at the head of the series, as the fons et origo wherefrom all living Eumi
nantia have descended.
   The present paper is an attempt to introduce to palaeontologists a new
form, which, though known by its dental system more than twenty-five
years ago, has remained totally unknown, so far as its skeleton is con
cerned.    This skeleton, by its completeness, has proved to be a very inter
esting one, not only in a concrete way, but as furnishing a clue to the
understanding of the skeletons of those forms which, though totally un
known, must    have preceded AnoploOierium and Xiphodon               in time, and from
which these two may have descended.
    Besides, the greater importance of the Hyopotamid<e in comparison with
Anoplotherium and Xiphodon lies in the fact, that, while these two last
were but poorly differentiated, presenting only two or three distinct spe
cific forms, the Hyopotamida, on the contrary, strike us by the extreme
diversity and richness of their specific and generic forms. Beginning
  * No doubt we have excellent memoirs, like the works of Gaudry, Kutimeyer, Frsas.
and H. v. Meyer ; bat the Paridigitata described in all these do not materially differ
from those now living, at least so far as the skeleton is concerned.

  in the Middle or Lower Eocene of Mauremont, they existed until the
  Lower Miocene period ; and judging by the great number of species
  and genera, they must have filled in the fauna of this period the same
  important place which the greatly diversified Buminantia fill in the fauna
  of our own times. Indeed the differentiation of Hyopotamida may be
  said to be even greater, in point of size, as they range from the Hyopota-
  imts Henevieri, not larger than a rabbit, to the great Anthracotherium of
  Bochette, which is as big as our Hippopotamus — all the intermediate stages
  between these two extremes being represented by different genera, sub
  genera, and species of the same family.
     I hope that the rich development of this much neglected family will
  arouse the attention of palaeontologists, and that the skeletons of the dif
  ferent members will be more thoroughly investigated.         For my own part,
  though fully convinced that many of the Eocene Hyopotamidce from
  Mauremont and Egerkingen present, even in their teeth, characters
  enough to separate them into distinct genera,      I shall not do this, as the
  multiplication of fossil genera, founded solely on dental characters, with
  out adequate knowledge of the skeleton, is more an obstruction than a
  help to the progress of palaeontology.
     This refers to the Eocene Hyopotamidce of Mauremont and Egerkingen ;
  for having found that among the Eocene members of this family there is one
 which   has lost its lateral digits and acquired a didactyle foot, very like an
 Anoplotherium,    I was obliged to separate this reduced   form from its tetra-
  dactyle congeners under the name of Diplopus (double foot), while the
 tetradactyle species of the same family will form the genus Hyopotamus.
  This diversity among the representatives of the same family is very inter
 esting ; something of the same kind is, however, to be found in our own
 times in the Hyomoschus, subsisting side by side with the more reduced ru
 minants, though this is not an entirely parallel case. Moreover, as we have
 in  the Hyopotamidce, so to say, father and son existing together (the com
  plete form together with the reduced), and as, besides, this son bears a
 great likeness in the typical structure of his limbs to the Anoplotherium,
 we may infer that the fathers of both reduced forms bore also a general
 likeness ; and this gives us a clue to the skeletons of the ancestors of
 the Anoploiheridce, which is still further strengthened by many other
 considerations, of which     I speak more fully in my paper.

                                    I
 of the extinct Paridigitata, became convinced that we must make
 some change in our zoological classification of the Ungulata in order to
 admit the great quantity of genera which have no place in the pre
 sent system. After the breaking up of the Pachydermata (a name
that has long enough obstructed science and really checked progress by
holding together the most heterogeneous assemblage of animal forms), all
the Paridigitata    came to be divided   into Suina and Euminantia. This in
troduction of    a physiological   function into a system based on the struc
                                                                   o2

ture of the skeleton is objectionable in the highest degree ; besides, in
this classification there is no room for those fossil genera which are cer
tainly not Suina, and most probably did not ruminate.                       The greater the
number of such genera, the better their organization and history are known,
the more pressing the necessity to give them some adequate place in our
zoological system. As an instance that such a necessity is keenly felt, we may
cite Professor Leidy, who, in describing the Oreodontida, Agriocheerida, &c.
of Nebraska, says that they were " ruminating hogs ;" but in reality they
were not hogs at all, and most probably did not ruminate ; what is, then, to
be done   with them ?
   The introduction of Professor Owen's* strict division between Paridi
gitata and Imparidigitata was a great gain to science ; it radically sepa
rated two groups that previously were always hopelessly mixed together ;
but now the same principle must be carried further. The separation of the
two groups of Paridigitata and Imparidigitata took place in very ancient
time, not nearer than the Cretaceous period, and the striking diversity
exhibited by both groups from the lowest Eocene is a proof of their ancient
separation.     But one of the branches, the Paridigitata, in its turn, split
very anciently again into two distinct groups, one with tubercular, the
other with crescentic teeth. This occurred at nearest in the Lower Eocene,
perhaps even     in the Cretaceous period.                 These groups, once separated,
kept entirely apart and followed different lines of descent, although the
modifications which both undergo along the descending lines are parallel
and analogous even to the greatest details.                Following these two divergent
lines of descent, both groups culminate in the recent fauna in such forms
as the Phacochoerus and Dicotyles        for one group, and the Bovidce for the other.

Links between them we discover none                  ;   and to discover their parentage,
we must pass along the ascending lines to the point at which they diverge, as
the linking genera, which doubtless existed at the time of separation, are long
 ago  extinct, and both groups are now widely separated.                         I  suggested
this view, whilst studying in the           British     Museum       the remains  of Hyopota-
 midas, to Professor Owen, and he finds no objection to it.                     He   aided me

   in finding for the two groups convenient names ; and by his suggestion                    I
   should call the Paridigitata with crescentic teeth Par. selenodonta, and
   those with tubercular teeth Par. bunodonta.
      To the first group would belong all the ancient and living Paridigitata
  having crescentic teeth, as the Anoplotherium, Xiphodon, Diehobune,                     An-
  thracotherium, Bothriodan, Hyopotamus, Rliagaiherium, and the living                    Bu-
  minantia.
      The second would embrace all the Suina, Hippopotamina, and Entelodon.
      Each one of these two groups may be again subdivided on the prin
  ciples adopted in this paper.
      By such division, we shall gain the advantage of having the Paridigitata
  arranged into two distinct lines of descent ; every new discovered form
  will at once have its place along one of the lines, and the true pedigree of
  both will be ascertained much sooner and with greater accuracy.                      Whilst
  now making no such clear division, palaeontologists, in projecting their
  genealogical tables, mix both groups together; and, according to the
  need of the moment, they place forms belonging to one line of descent
  in the other, and vice versd. Thus, for instance, all the Hyopotamoids
 and ArUhracoiherium are constantly moved about from one line to the
 other *, while their true place is along the line of Selenodont Paridigitata;
 and they have nothing to do with the Bunodont Suina, although groups
 quite parallel with them may be found on the descending line of Bunodont
  Paridigitata.      Such parallelism, however, does not imply direct links

 links are to be found only by climbing along the ascending lines to near
the point of separation.          For instance, Dicotyles and Hyomoschus occupy
 analogous positions ; but there is no link between them along the dotted
 parallel. Links will be found only by going up to the point near their
 separation.
     There are, no doubt, to be found around the points of divergence many
forms of which it is difficult to say whether their teeth are tubercular or

 crescentic, so thick are the lobes      ;  but once this uncertain stage is passed,
 both groups keep unmistakably distinct.
     Having once become convinced that these two groups of crescent-toothed
 and tubercular-toothed        Paridigitata, after branching off from a common
 progenitor in the early Eocene (perhaps the Cretaceous) period, followed
 diverging lines of descent, never mixing together,            I  tried to ascertain ac
 curately, by such data as were furnished by fossil remains and by lawful
 induction, what are the exact modifications          of the skeleton exhibited by
 each group along the ascending and descending lines.                 As these modifica
 tions were most clearly given by greater or less reduction of the manus and
 pes,  I  subjected these to a detailed comparison.
     In  tracing the Paridigitata in time, we cannot mistake the tendency
 clearly manifested by them to a gradual reduction of the manus and pes
 in such a way that each descendant is always somewhat more reduced
 than its immediate predecessor.           The limbs in the Ungulata serving only
 for the support of the body, and not for prehension, the organism seems
 to derive a great advantage from their reduction and simplification.
     By a comparative study of the least reduced representatives on both
 lines,  I  tried to ascertain the probable structure of the manus and pes in
 the progenitor that has given rise to both groups, or to the whole assem
 blage of Ungulata ; and this led me to construct a typical manus and
 pes.     On the correctness of this scheme we may to a certain extent rely,
 as it is exhibited in nearly all its details by the living Hippopotamus, the
 most complete form of the living, and by the Hyopotamm and Anthraco-
 therium, the most complete of the extinct, Paridigitata. Though such typical
foot may be supposed to have been pentadactyle, still, as not a single
 living or fossil form has ever shown a trace or a rudiment * of the first
 digit (still less this first digit in a developed state),          I  thought it more
 convenient to adhere to facts, and give the foot as it is found in the most
 complete types, the first digit being always lost, and its carpal and tarsal
 bone helping to support the second digit. This fundamental                        typical
 structure of the manus and pes may be stated, in a few words, to be as
follows : —
     Supposing the foot to be pentadactyle, the two outer digits (the fourth
 and fifth) are always supported in the manus and pes by one single bone
— -the unciform in the manus, the cuboid in the pes ; the three succeeding
inner digits are supported each by a separate bone— the third, second,
and first cuneiform in the pes, and the os magnum, trapezoideum, and
trapezium in the manus.          Besides, in the manus, the third digit, being
supported       by the magnum, also touches the unciform by a small ulnar
projection, and the second, supported by the trapezoides, goes to touch the
    * Prof. Huxley noticed this absence of rudiments of the first digit in his Anniversary
Address of 1870 (Quart. Journ. Geol. Soo.). Such rudiments of the first digit, described
in many cases, have proved always, on examination, to have been mistaken, the trapezium
or the first cuneiform being taken as the rudiment of the first digit.

     os magniun ; the second digit of the pes is supported by the second cunei
    form, and by its fibular projection is connected with the third cuneiform.
    The first digit is lost in all Ungulata, and its typical bone, the trapezium,
    or first cuneiform, helps to support the second digit.

       Beginning from this typical structure of the manus and pes, which was
   probably exhibited by the progenitors of the Paridigitata, we may fol
   low its gradual reduction along both lines of descent in the crescent-
   toothed     (Selenodont) and tubercular-toothed          (Bunodont) Paridigitata.
   Both lines present a series of parallel modifications, and the parallelism is
   often carried to the minutest details. The only difference is, that along
   the crescent-toothed line (Selenodonta) the reduction is proceeding at a
  much quicker rate than along the tubercular-toothed (Bunodonta). The rea
  son of this may consist perhaps in the commencing faculty of rumination
  in the former group, which faculty gave it an immense advantage over the
  latter. For the comparative anatomist this slow rate of change in the
  Suina is exceedingly welcome, as it brings the modification of the Suil-
  line foot to our own time, and allows us to discover all the intermediate
  stages of modification, which, being passed over very rapidly, and in
  ancient periods, by the crescent-toothed group, have left none or but few
  traces of their existence.
                                                             I
      By the reduction of the foot in Paridigitata, simply mean that the
 function of locomotion which has been performed primitively by all the
 four (or five) digits begins to be carried on chiefly by the middle two, the
 lateral digits undergoing a gradual decrease.                     I
                                                        This, as have said before,
 seems to be of great advantage to the organism, and is manifested by
 all descending lines of Ungulata.
      In trying to ascertain the exact method of this reduction and its final
results in recent and fossil genera, we come to very interesting facts that
have not been duly noticed before, and which furnish us with the expla
nation of the presence of so many very reduced forms even in old Eocene
and Miocene deposits. In both groups, the crescent-toothed (Selenodonta)
and the tubercular-toothed Paridigitata (Bunodonta), we meet with a two-

 154                        Dr. W. Kowalevsky      on the               [Feb. 6,
fold mode of reduction of the manus and       pes, — a simple or inadaptive, and
 an elaborate or adaptive mode.
     Following the first or inadaptive     mode of reduction,   the foot, whilst
 losing   its lateral  digits, acquires no better adaptation to altered con
 ditions   of locomotion and support of the body than that which is de
 rived from     the   mere    thickening of the remaining    digits.   The rela
 tion between the carpal and tarsal bones and the remaining two middle
 metacarpals and metatarsals remains just the same as it was in the
 tetradactyle ancestor.       The remaining digits do not exhibit any modifi
 cation by which they receive more ample support from the carpal
 and tarsal bones, by taking the place formerly occupied by the now re
 duced and lost lateral digits.       This mode of reduction   I call inadaptive,
 or reduction in which inheritance is stronger than modification. As an
  instance of this inadaptive mode of reduction,     I may point out the foot of
  Anoplotherium     and  Xiphodon.    The  annexed   diagram  clearly illustrates

1873.]                  Osteology     of the Hyopotamidse.                             155
this mode of reduction.  The fourth digit does not even take the whole of
the unciform, and a part of this bone is still occupied by the useless
rudiment of the fifth digit ; the third has not extended over the whole
os magnum ; and the useless rudiment of the second digit occupies
its typical place on the trapezoid, touching the os magnum, and being
additionally supported by the trapezium.
   Following the second or adaptive mode of reduction, the middle digits
grow larger and thicker than in the first mode ; but whilst broadening
transversally they do not adhere to the ancestral pattern, but tend to
gain a better support on all the bones of the carpus and tarsus ; they de
viate from the ancestral type, push the lateral digits (while these are yet
completely developed) to the side, and usurp their typical carpal and tarsal
bones for their (the middle digits) own use, thus gaining a better and
more complete support for the body.        The lateral digits, deprived of
their typical carpal and tarsal bones, and taking henceforth no active part
in locomotion, tend to disappear ; and every millimetre that is lost by the
lateral digits is immediately taken possession of by the enlarged middle
ones ; so that even before the entire disappearance of the lateral digits the
two middle digits have usurped the whole of the distal surface of the carpus
and tarsus, the fourth digit has spread over the whole unciform (manus)
and cuboid (pes), and the third has taken possession of the trapezoid
(manus) and second cuneiform (pes).    This once attained, the two middle
digits, being pressed from both sides by the carpal and tarsal bones,
begin to coalesce, forming the so-called cannon of the recent Buminantia,
or of the hind foot of Dicotyles. This mode of reduction             I
                                                          call the adaptive,
or reduction in which such modification keeps pace with inheritance.
    As an instance of this mode,           I
                                       may cite the foot of Sus, Dicotyles,
Ihjomoschus,  Buminantia. Every anatomist will acknowledge that this
second mode of reduction is much more useful to the organism than the
first.
   Ifwe inquire further what are the genera which follow the first or
inadaptive mode of reduction, we find that all extinct genera of Paridigitata
follow   it,   while all living * genera follow the second or adaptive mode of
reduction.
  This being the state of the case, the questions arise, Did they not be
come extinct because of their incapacity to adapt themselves completely
to altered circumstances    and did not the others survive because they
                                ?
adapted themselves more fully to these circumstances             will try to

consider both cases in reference to the living and fossil Paridigitata.
I    said before that early in the Eocene period the group of Paridigitata
split dichotomously into two secondary groups, one with crescentic teeth,
the other with tubercular        ;   the first I   have called the Selenodonta,         the
second Bunodonta        (or Suina).      Now     each of these secondary groups        fol-

    We must briefly consider    each of these groups.
    The Paridigitata with crescentic teeth following the inadaptive mode of
reduction,   and whose skeletons are known, are the Anoplotherium, Xipho-
don, Anthracotheridce, and Hyopotamidce. If it should be asked why they fol
lowed this mode of reduction, the reason is obvious. Admitting that an
advantage is gained by the simplification of the foot and the reduction of
the number of digits, this mode of reduction is the most simple course to
be taken.     We must imagine the enlargement of the middle digits to be
accompanied by a broadening of their correspondent bones in the carpus
and tarsus ; the trapezoideum and the second cuneiform were simply
pushed aside (not made use of) by the enlargement of the third digit, and
their reduction kept pace with the reduction of the second digit. If we
think how the process must have gone on " in naturd," we shall find that
it required quite an unusual occurrence, some happy chance, for the third
digit to go over the separating line between the magnum and trapezoideum,
or the third and second cuneiform, and get a footing on these last bones,
which typically belonged to the second digits. This was evidently the most
advantageous mode, but it did not occur at once ; and the organism has
taken the more simple and obvious inadaptive mode, which, once fairly set
in, could not be changed. This branch of the Paridigitata then, starting
from their tetra- (or penta-)dactyle progenitors in the Cretaceous or earliest
Eocene, arrived at the close of the Eocene (from which strata alone we have
Paridigitata whose skeletons are known) to the reduced didactyle forms,
known as the Anoplotherium and Xiphodon.            That these last had tetra-
dactyle ancestors is supposed, on theoretical grounds, by the evolutionists ;
besides, their rudimental second and fifth digits point clearly to some
form in which these rudiments were completely developed and used for
 locomotion.
    Whilst trying to ascertain the structure of the skeleton of an extinct
family {Hyopotamida) allied to the Anoplotheridce, but which was sup
posed to be chiefly Miocene,     I found that the Miocene genera could be
regarded only    as the last  representatives of this exceedingly numerous
family, whose chief development fell in the Eocene times, when it was
represented    by numerous subgeneric and even generic forms.             I  was
fortunate enough to find, in the collection of M. Aymard, at Puy, a
large assemblage of bones belonging to the oldest Miocene representative
of this family, the Hyopotamus      ; indeed so much, that   I could  completely
restore the limbs and nearly the whole skeleton.         The limbs prove to be
tetradactyle,  with well-developed lateral digits.      The   same  family is so
richly developed in the Eocene, that we have      a  full right to suppose that
the older genera had even a more completely developed manus and pes.
               I
    From Puy came to London to complete my study, as teeth which were
not to be distinguished from the Hyopotamus of Puy were known to be
numerous in England ; and whilst studying the bones found in England,
I  was struck by the fact that some of these belonged to a didactyle genus

  158                       Dr. W. Kowalevsky on the                         [Feb.  6,
 of the  same   family, which in England proved to be associated with the tetra
 dactyle genus.       To this new genus of the Hyopotamoid family         I   gave the
  name Diplopia.       This was indeed a welcome discovery — ancestor and de
 scendant existing together, the complete with the reduced form living
 about the same period*.       Moreover, the didactyle form bore a great general
 likeness in the structure of the limbs to Anoplotherium and Xiphodon,
 being perhaps only a little more elaborate and better adapted than these
 first experiments of the Eocene times.
     The likeness of the descendants allowed me to make inferences as to
 the likeness of the ancestors ; and, taking into consideration the structure
 of the limbs in the tetradactyle Hyopotamus, and the rudimental second
 and fifth digit still existing in Anoplothenum, Xiphodon, and Hyopotamus,
 I  feel confident that the supposed ancestor of the first two did really
 possess a manus and pes very like the projected typical diagram ; indeed
 we may be nearly as confident of this as if we had found the actual thing
 imbedded complete in some early Eocene or even Cretaceous rock.
    This, then, was the state of things in the earliest Eocene ; large numbers
of Paridigitata with tetradactyle feet like our Hyopotamus, and the
 supposed progenitors of Anoplotherium and Xiphodon, represented the
group of Paridigitates with crescentic teeth (Selenodonta).            Eeduction in
the number of digits, being an advantage to the organism, was steadily
going on.       But, be it observed, we follow now the inadaptive line of
descent ; and while the whole weight of the body was, by gradual steps,
entirely transferred to the two middle digits, these thickened and grew
larger, but entered into no special adaptation by means of which they
should better perform the work which had fallen to their share ; they
did not enlarge so as to gain additional support from all bones of the
second row of the carpus and tarsus ; the reduction was inadaptive :
inheritance is in them stronger than modification.
    Seeing that old Paridigitata present only two free metacarpals and
metatarsals, and that recent Ruminantia have the same two metacarpals
and metatarsals coalesced into a single cannonbone, evolutionists generally
rush at the seemingly obvious conclusion that once the tetradactyle foot
reached the reduced state of two digits, these coalesced together, and were
transformed into the cannonbone of Ruminants. No such thing, however,
happened ; nor could it have happened with the old didactyle Paridigitata,
as the Anoplotherium, Xiphodon, and Diplopus ; and the reason why it
could not is clearly indicated by the structure of their feet.             We have
already shown that, following this inadaptive reduction, the two middle
digits, whilst growing larger, continue to occupy only the inner half or
more of the unciform and the greater part of the os magnum ; so that
from the outer as well as from the inner side the carpal bones which sup
port useless rudiments overhang the two middle functional digits.             In con-
   * Such  eases are numerous.  In the Sewalik Hills the Hippnrion is associated with
the horse.

 sequence of this, the distal surface of the carpus was much broader than
the proximal surface of the two functional digits — an arrangement not
calculated for firm equilibrium.           Now the confluence of the two middle
digits    is always followed by a considerable contraction ; and if this
coalescence should occur in the imperfectly adapted foot of Anoplotherium,
and especially Xiphodon, all equilibrium would be lost. If ever such conflu
ence occurred, by reason of the tendency to the greatest possible reduction,
the resulting form had not the least chance of being propagated and of hold
ing its ground against the competing genera. The broadening of the middle
digits could not occur after the entire loss of the laterals ; and we shall see
that, in genera which have left immediate successors (Sus, Hyomoschus),
the lateral digits are not allowed to go until the middle ones have obtained
a secure footing on the entire distal surface of the carpus and tarsus.
However, these inadaptively reduced genera of the Eocene could perhaps
have lived    till our own days ; but the development of the competing and
better adapted forms pressing them on all sides, they had no chance to
stand their ground against them, and became extinct without any direct
posterity, while the succession of the Paridigitata Selenodonta was carried
by a side branch, and reached its culminating point in the Miocene,
continuing from thence to our own days.
    We turn now to the      same mode     of inadaptive reduction as manifested by
the tubercular-toothed      Paridigitata (Bunodonta), or Suina.         The old repre
sentatives of this group are very little known. The Chceropotamus is a
very doubtful genus, and may be inclining towards the crescentic-toothed
Paridigitata, being supposed to be the progenitor of the Anthracotheridoi
and Hyopotamidce.        Besides it we have the Acotherulum saturninum, Ger., a
truly tubercular-toothed Paridigitate from the Upper Eocene, Acotherulum
 Campichii (Dichobmie, Camp. Pictet) from the Lower Eocene of Mauremont,
and a larger pig-like animal from the same deposit not yet described or
named. These are undoubtedly the oldest tubercular-toothed Paridigitates
we know ; but unfortunately our knowledge is based only on dental
characters.      However, considering that even the recent Suina have not
yet completely lost their two lateral digits, it may, with the greatest pro
bability, be inferred that these old Eocene forms were tetradactyle.                 Our
knowledge     of  the  development    of this  group   is very  incomplete    ; but there
can be no doubt that, though not nearly so rich as the Selenodont group,
they were still numerous, as may be inferred from the great quantity of
the Suina in the Miocene, and such forms as the Listriodon splendens *.
We are so accustomed to look on the Suina as a group of tubercular-
toothed tetradactyle Paridigitata, that no one ever thought of the possibility
of a didactyle hog ; but, strange as it may seem, such a Suilline animal
   * I  have not been §o fortunate as to see any bones of the Listriodon ; but as this
mioccne hog died without any successors,    I  Bhould not be astonished if it proves to be
didactyle,  thus  being a parallel to  Mt/opotamus   in the same sense as Entelodon is
parallel to Anoplotherium.

existed ; stranger still, it existed in such an ancient period as the close of
the Eocene in the lowest strata of Eonzon at Puy.          This is the Entelodon,
Aym. (Elotherium, Pom., Archaotherium, Leidy). The Suilline characters
are so striking in this form, that it was at once placed among the Suina,
and pronounced tetradactyle, though the confluent tibia and fibula (men
tioned by Leidy) might have been taken as a warning against rash
conclusions.    I  have found in the cabinet of     M. Avmard, in Puy, some
bones of this animal ; few      it must be acknowledged, but still leaving no
doubt as to the didactyly of Entelodon. Of this      I  shall try to adduce more
extensive proofs in a forthcoming memoir on         this  genus.     How can the
presence of a hog with such reduced limbs be explained in such ancient
deposits, when even the living Suidce have not yet reached this stage of
reduction ? The fact, however, is intelligible when we consider that the
Entelodon is the final result of the inadaptive development and reduction
along the line of tubercular-toothed Paridigitata ; it is the culmination
point of this group, and in this sense quite parallel to the Anoplotherium in
the other group.     Thus the Paridigitata, which split dichotomously in the
earliest Eocene (?) into two groups, the tubercular-toothed (Bunodonta)
and the crescent-toothed (Selenodonta), following the inadaptive mode of
reduction, reached their culmination point in the Upper Eocene or just
above it, in such forms as Entelodon for the first group, and Anoplotherium,
Xiphodon, Hyopotamm for the second group, which all became extinct
without any direct posterity.       The living Suina and Euminantia are not
directly connected with them, but are the issue of lateral branches which
followed the adaptive mode of development and reduction.
    We may now consider the results of the adaptive mode of reduc
tion.       I
        As said before, the rate of this reduction is much slower in the
tubercular-toothed    Paridigitata, or Suina  ; and this gives us the means of
following more closely all the stages of reduction.            I  propose, there
fore, in the first place, to consider these.
    Though the published materials, as far as the skeleton is concerned, are
very poor, we have the means of giving nearly all the intermediate stages
between those genera in which the manus and pes are conformable to the
true tetradactyle type, every digit (except the fourth and fifth, which are
always borne by one) being carried by' a separate carpal and tarsal bone,
and those in which the entire distal surface of the carpus or tarsus is
taken by the enlarged two middle digits.
   The adaptation of these two middle digits on the adaptive line forms a
striking contrast to their rigidity exhibited by the other mode of re
duction  ; and we shall briefly indicate     the stages by which the typical
Suilline foot actually passed to reach the    stage exhibited now by Dicotyles.
   We are at a total loss to indicate the precise time when the adaptive
branch separated from the inadaptive ; it was certainly somewhere in the
lowest Miocene, as in the Middle Miocene we find already a large quantity
of Suinae in which the adaptative reduction has fairly set in.        As the first

 stage   I must
              consider a small Suilline animal, though not the oldest, but
perhaps  a remnant   of the older type ; this is the Choerotherium, Lart.,
from Sansans.    The primitiveness of this small pig is indicated by the
fact that the carpal and tarsal bones retain their typical relation to the
four metacarpals and metatarsals ; the humerus is very Anoplotherium-]ike,
and the distal extremity of the metapodium is smooth anteriorly, the
phalangeal articular ridge being limited only to the palmar side, as in all
ancient Paridigitata.
   First Stage,                  Lart., Sansans. — The middle digits are en
                      Cfwerotlierium,
larged, but the laterals still retain their typical relation to the supporting
bones of the carpus and tarsus*.       Distal end of humerus Amphtherium-
like (ancient) ; the proximal end of the radius, in correspondence with the
humerus, is also Anaplotherium-]ihe.       The distal end of metapodium is
smooth, the phalangeal ridge being limited to the palmar side.
  Second Stage, PalceocJwerus (AHier). —The adaptive reduction of the
manus and pes has fairly set in, its first indication being that the radial
margin of the third digit (in the manus and pes) is raised in such a way
as to exclude the second digit from going to its typical facet on the os
magnum and third cuneiform, though leaving it still in the full pos
session of the trapezoid and second cuneiform.      The phalangeal arti
cular ridge is passing from the palmar side round the distal extremity to
the anterior face of the metapodium.
   Third Stage,        Snidce.   — Adaptive reduction is proceeding further, the
middle digits are greatly enlarged, and the third digits of the manus and
pes spread over one half the trapezoideum and nearly the whole of the
second cuneiform.   The lateral digits touch the ground only very slightly,
and are not important for locomotion.
  Fourth Stage, Dicotyles. — The middle digits are so enlarged and adapted
that the entire distal surface of the carpus and tarsus is taken by them ;
the lateral digits have no distinct facets on the distal surface of the
carpus, and are merely hanging to the enlarged middle digits.   The fifth
digit of the pes  is lost, and the two metatarsals are  coalesced into a
cannonbone       ;   the metacarpals are also so closely pressed together that
their confluence is imminent.   The complication of the stomach, which is
divided into three chambers, shows a beginning of rumination, slight traces
of which are even exhibited by the common hog      the premolars become
                                                           ;
complicated, and begin to assume the shape of molars t, the first premolar
is lost (as in all Ruminants), the incisors reduced to four, the canines
are small.
   Fifth Stage. — The culminating point is not yet reached by the tubercular-
   * That  is,the second digit    is
                                 supported   by
                                              the trapezoideum, and has besides a facet
on the os magnum, as in Hippopotamus, or in the typical tetradactyle foot generally.
t   A   very important circumstance, considering that we meet the same fact in other
groups where the premolars assume the shape of molars, as in PalaothericUe, horses
rhinoceros, &c.

as the parallel group       of crescent-toothed Paridigitata, whose reduction is
going at a quicker rate, has already reached             it,
                                                         there can be no doubt
that the Suina are tending also to the same      culminating point. In
reaching it the lateral digits will be entirely lost, the trapezium will
coalesce with the magnum, and the second cuneiform with the third;
the middle metacarpals and metatarsals will coalesce into       complete    a
cannonbone,  and probably the stomach will become                    still more compli
cated, and they will ruminate.   That this state                is   the   goal towards
which the Suina tend      have little doubt
                            I                but ;     more than probable

that man by his influence will prevent them from ever reaching it.
  Our task     more difficult when we come to inquire into the line of de
              is
scent which has given rise to the Ruminantia.    As stated before, cannot    I
put the Arwplotherium, nor the Xiphodon, in their pedigree.        In my
opinion, the line which ends in Ruminantia branched off from the small
tetradactyle Hyopotamidce, which were so numerous in the Eocene period.
I find in the Eocene of Mauremont all stages of transition between the
five-lobed upper molars of these Hyopotamidae and teeth having a true
 ruminant four-lobed pattern    these last have belonged to some small
                                   ;
 species  of Dichodon. Unfortunately we have no clue to the skeleton,
though, seeing the tetradactyle living Hyomoschus,     may fairly be it
assumed that these early progenitors of Euminantia were also tetra
dactyle. The small tetradactyle Cainotherium     very tempting genus

                                                           ;        I                   it
for many reasons, though        I cannot here give them in full.      Some of
these are as follows    —
                        :  the Cainotherium retained till the Middle Miocene
five-lobed teeth on the Dichobune pattern (with the three lobes on the
posterior half of the tooth), while we have truly ruminant teeth already
in the Eocene  ;   itretained its upper incisors and free metatarsals, while
the much older Gelacus, Aym., which          already
                                            is          true ruminant, had no

upper   incisors and   the  metapodials were  confluent  in the adult. Caino-
tlierium seems to be    adirect descendant of Dichobune, and to have become
extinct, without leaving any successors.
  Supposing that the Dichodon had        foot true to the tetradactyle type,

adaptation of the two middle digits could not be obtained at one leap                   ;

  few traces of this passage remain. From the tetradactyle Dichodon, the
  group of adaptive Selenodonts may be said to have split in two sub
  ordinate groups.       In one of these, represented by the Hyomoschw, the
  lateral digits are retained, and only the metatarsals become confluent,
  while the two middle metacarpals continue to be free *. In the Tragvlidas
  the two middle digits coalesce, in both fore and hind limbs, into a complete
  cannonbone, but the lateral digits are still retained in their whole length
  as useless, nearly filiform appendages.          The distal surface of the meta-
  p odium remains smooth ; the rumination is incomplete.
     In the other group, as the representative of which we may cite the
  Gelocus,   Aym., the lateral digits were soon lost, and the remaining two
  middle    digits  have taken     the entire distal    surface  of the carpus and
  tarsus ; still they remain separate, perhaps through life, in some of the
  Eocene Qeloci whose remains         I  have seen from the phosphatic limestone
 deposits in the south of France, near Cahors, in a locality called Caylux.
  In this deposit the bones of Gelocus are found, together with large
 Anoplotheria and Palaoiheria, and even the completely ossified and not
 epiphysed metatarsals are found entirely free.           In the lowest Miocene of
 Puy, however, we find a Gelocus whose metacarpals and metatarsals are
 free only in the young, and coalesce in the adult ; but, even after their
 coalescence, the distal end of the metapodium is smooth, and the articular
 ridge is limited to the palmar side. In the somewhat newer (about the
 upper part of the Lower Miocene) deposits of Allier, in Auvergne, we
 meet at last with metatarsals and metacarpals entirely coalesced into a
 complete cannonbone, and the articular ridge taking the whole distal
 extremity of the metapodium.               Small rudiments of the lateral digits
 (second and fifth) still remain as styliform appendages on both sides of
 the cannonbone, in the fore and hind limbs.
     Such true ruminant forms are exceedingly numerous in the Miocene of
 Allier ; they are all hornless, and some retain seven molars in the lower
jaw, as in all ancient Selenodonts.             In most, however, of these newer
Miocene forms the first premolar of the lower jaw is lost, and they
exhibit the same dental formula as the living Puminantia, from which
they seem not to differ in any of the essential characters. These true
ruminant forms of the Lower Miocene may be considered to have reached
the culmination point of their reduction, and we shall consider them as
such.     Thus the Selenodont Paridigitata, after branching off from the
common stock in the Lower Eocene, reach the utmost stage of re
duction on the adaptive mode a little below the Middle Miocene ; this
we consider to be the fifth stage, or the culmination.

following the adaptive mode of reduction, means that the reduction of
the manus and pes was carried so far that it could not proceed further ;
this point was attained already in the Lower Miocene.       When once the
metapodium was reduced to one bone, and this one had taken the whole
distal surface of the carpus and tarsus, any further reduction or improve
ment was quite impossible.    Besides, the completely developed faculty of
rumination gave these forms an enormous advantage over the other, non-
ruminant, Paridigitata occurring in the same strata.   They could live on
such matters as twigs, bark of trees, mosses, lichens, on which no other
Ungulata can subsist ; such food is found everywhere, requires no cunning
and very little struggle to get it. All essential modifications were attained
very early, and the chief of these are the confluence of the two middle digits
in a complete cannonbone and rumination.           Then began the luxury of      all
sorts of appendages   —  excrescences  on the   frontal  bones covered with skin,
uncovered by skin in the form of prickly simple horns (Pudu), or double
(Dicroceras of Sansan, Muntjac), then branched and palmated.             In other
groups these bony cores were covered with horny sheaths, which at first
differed but little from agglutinated hairs (Antilocapra amerirana), then
became more compact, as in the smooth and hard horny sheath                 ofthe
hollow-honied Ruminantia. These secondary characters were all acquired,
thanks to abundant time, after the essential characters of the type had
been assumed   ;   ifman had come on earth          alittle later than he did, he
certainly  would   have  found  nearly  parallel  cases   in the group of Suina,
monodactyle (with cannonbone) hogs with different appendages. As
it  is, he stopped the course of events all further improvement
                                            ;                               is out
of the question, or only possible in such groups as the Rodentia, who
prey on man's food, being at the same time independent of him.
    It may be asked, How stands the matter in the Imparidigitate Ungulata'?
 And though I    cannot enter fully into the case,  I     may state that the same
 course of events       observable in them
                        is                      ; only there could be no in-
adaptive reduction, as the body could not, under any circumstances,               be
held in equilibrium upon one single third digit,      this one had not
                                                            if
taken the whole distal surface of the carpus and tarsus.       But the
task in this group was much more difficult    to get one middle digit to
                                                    ;
perform    the work shared in the ancestors by five, and in the immediate
 progenitor by three, required time.  To accomplish this, two geological
 periods were needed but still, by the incessant tendency to reduction,
                             ;
 the work was done, and the monodactyle horse spread over the surface             of
 the globe, superseding all other Imparidigitata, which are evidently
 rapidly dying out. The only two genera which remain still, the Rhino
 ceros and the Tapir, cannot last long. But this spreading and multipli
 cation of the Equidce was also accompanied by       total change of diet

  II.  "Magnetic      Survey of Belgium in 1871."             By the Rev. S. J.
        Perry. Communicated             by Sir Edward Sabine, K.C.B., F.R.S.
        Received January 24, 1873.
                                       (Abstract.)
     The magnetic observations which furnished the results contained in
 this paper were made during the autumn months of 1871.
     The instruments used and the methods adopted were almost identical
 with those employed in previous magnetic surveys of France.
    The dip was observed by Mr. W. Carlisle, magnetic assistant of Stony-
 hurst Observatory, and the rest of the observations were taken by the
 Rev. S. J. Perry.
    This new series of determinations of the terrestrial magnetic elements
 was rendered the more necessary, as preceding observers had chosen very
 few stations in Belgium, and as the curvature of the isodynamics and
isoclinals   in Dr. Lamont's maps of Belgium, Holland, and North-west
 Germany indicated a very considerable disturbing cause in the first-
named country.
    The values obtained in 1871 are a strong confirmation of the suspicions
of irregularity to which former observations had given rise ; for although
the lines of equal dip, declination, and horizontal force bear a sufficiently
close resemblance to those of neighbouring countries, there is evidence of
much disturbance ; and when the values of the dip and horizontal force
are combined, the isodynamics show clearly that the coal-measures, which
stretch completely across the south-east portion of Belgium, exercise a
strong disturbing influence.         This local magnetism might be incapable of
producing more than a decided curvature of the isodynamics of an ex
tended tract of country ; but when all the stations of observation are
situated within narrow limits, the perturbation completely masks the
normal direction of the lines.

the different stations, and reduced to the common epoch of January 1,

   The principal object of the present Memoir is the establishment of the
partial differential equation of the third order satisfied by the parameter
of a family of surfaces belonging to a triple orthogonal system.      It was
first remarked by Bouquet that a given family of surfaces does not in
general belong to an orthogonal system, but that (in order to its doing
so) a condition must be satisfied : it was afterwards shown by Serret that
the condition is that the parameter considered as a function of the coor
dinates must satisfy a partial differential equation of the third order ;
this equation was not obtained by him or the other French geometers                        en
gaged on the subject, although methods of obtaining     essentially equi  it,
valent but differing in form, were given by Darboux and Levy; the
last-named writer even found a particular form of the equation, viz. what
the general equation becomes on writing therein X=0, Y=0 (X, T,                                Z

                            Using Levy's method,      obtained the general        I
equation, and communicated it to the French Academy.         My result was,
however, of a very complicated form, owing, as      afterwards discovered,    I

168       On a new Relation between Heat and Electricity.          [Feb. 13,
       II. " On    a new Relation between Heat and Electricity."
      By Frederick Guthrie.            Received January 10, 1873.
                                  (Abstract.)
   It is found that the reaction between an electrified body and a neigh
bouring neutral one, whereby the electricity in the neutral body is induc
tively decomposed and attraction       produced, undergoes a modification
when the neutral body is considerably heated.
   Under many circumstances it is found that the electrified body is
rapidly and completely discharged.      The action of discharge is shown to
depend mainly upon the following conditions : — (1) the temperature of
the discharging body and its distance from the electrified one ; (2) the
nature ( + or — ) of the latter's electricity.
   With egard to (1), it is shown that the discharging power of a hot body
diminishes as its distance increases, and increases with its temperature ;
but, concerning the temperature, it is proved that the discharging power
of  a hot body does    not depend upon the quantity of heat radiated from
it to the electrified body, but chiefly upon its quality.  Thus a white-hot
platinum wire connected with the earth may exercise an indefinitely
greater discharging power, at the same distance, than a large mass of
iron at 100° C, though the latter may impart more heat to the electrified
body.
   Neither the mere reception of heat, however intense, by the electrified
body, unless the latter have such small capacity as to be itself intensely
heated, discharges the electricity if the source of heat be distant ; nor is
discharge effected when the electrified body and a neighbouring cold one
are surrounded by air through which intense heat is passing.         But, for
the discharge, it is necessary that heat of intensity pass to the electrified
body from a neutral body, within inductive range.
   White- and red-hot metallic neutral bodies exercise this discharging
power even when isolated from the earth, but always with less facility
than when earth-connected.
   The hotter the discharging body, whether isolated or earth-connected,
the more nearly alike do + or — electricities behave in being discharged ;
but at certain temperatures distinct differences are noticed.        The —
electricity, in all cases of difference, is discharged with greater facility
than the + .
   Attempts are made to measure the critical temperatures at which
earth-connected hot iron (1) discharges + and — electricity with nearly
the same facility, (2) begins, as it cools, to show a preferential power of
discharging — , and (3) ceases to discharge — .         The temperatures so
obtained are measured by the number of heat-units, measured from 0° ft,
in 1 gram of iron of the respective temperature, represented by the value
of the expression Ft 2Jw.

    It   is shown    that various    flames, both earth-connected   and isolated,
 have an exceedingly       great power of discharging both kinds of electricity.
    The effects in regard to discharge are shown to be similar when plati
num wire, rendered hot by a galvanic current, is used, and also when the
condensed     electricity of a Leyden jar is experimented on.
    As hot iron shows a preferential power of discharging — over +
electricity, so it is found that white-hot but isolated iron refuses to be
charged either with + or — electricity.           As the iron cools, it acquires
first the power of receiving — and afterwards of receiving + . Further,
while white-hot iron in contact with an electrified body prevents that
body from retaining a charge of either kind of electricity, as it cools it
permits a + charge to be received, and subsequently a — one.
    A   suggestion    is made as to the existence of an electrical     coercitive
force, the presence      of which together with its diminution by heat would
explain    much of what has been described.

    The writer commences by expressing his great obligations to Professor
 Eolleston, whose pupil he formerly was.           Professor Eolleston first in
formed him of the existence of Land-Planarians in Ceylon, and of the
 importance of investigating them.         The paper was at first intended to be
 a joint one, and Professor Eolleston himself made a number of prepara
 tions of Bhynehodemus,       one of which is figured.    He likewise rendered
 great aid   in the bibliography, and by constant suggestions and assistance
  during the progress of the work.
    Two new species of Land-Planarians from Ceylon are described, — one
 belonging to the genus Bipalium (Stimpson), B. Ceres, the other to that
  of Bhynehodemus, R. Thwaitesii, so called after Mr. G. H. K. Thwaites,
  F.E.S., the illustrious curator of the Peradeniya Gardens, by whose
  assistance the specimens made use of were procured.

170             Mr. H. N. Moseley        on the Anatomy and         [Feb. 20,
   Lists are given of all the known species of Bipalium and Bhtjnchodemus,
and also a map to show the distribution of Bipalium in space.
   With regard to the habits of Bipalium, the most interesting facts
noted are that these animals use a thread of their body-slime for
suspension in air, as aquatic Planarians were observed to do for their
suspension in water by Sir J. Dalyell, and the cellar-slug does for its
suspension in air.      The projection of small portions of the anterior
margin of the head in the form of tentacles, originally observed by M.
Humbert, becomes interesting in connexion with the discovery of a row
of papillae and ciliated pits in that region. The anatomy of the Planarians
was studied by means of vertical and longitudinal sections from hardened
specimens.     The skin in Bipalium and BJitpieJwdemus closely conforms to
the Planarian type, but is more perfectly differentiated histologically
than in aquatic species, and approaches that of the leech in the distribu
tion, colour, and structure of its pigment, and especially in the arrange
ment of the glandular system.           The superficial and deep glandular
system    of the leech  are  both  here   represented.  In B. Ceres peculiar
glandular structures exist, which may foreshadow the segmental organs of
Annelids, it being remembered that these segmental organs are solid in an
early stage of development.       Bod-like bodies (Stabchen or stiibchenfor-
mige Korper) are present in abundance, though, singularly enough, Max
Schultze failed to find any in Geoplana. These rod-like bodies are pro
bably homologous with the nail-like bodies of Nemertines ; and it is pos
sible that the sette of Annelids are modifications of them.         No light is
thrown by the structure of these bodies in Bipalium on the question
whether they are homologous with the urticating organs of Coelenterata.
   The muscular arrangement in Bipalium, which is very complex, throws
great light on the homologies between the muscular layers of Turbellaria
and those of other Vermes.       It is commonly said that whilst in all other
Vermes the external muscular layer is circular, and the longitudinal internal,
in Turbellarians the reverse is the case. A wide gulf is thus apparently
placed between these groups.        In Bipalium there is an external circular
muscular coat, which even presents the same imbricated structure which is
found in it in leeches and other worms.        In Dendrocoelum lacteum there
is also an external circular coat. In cases where a distinct external
circular muscular coat is absent, it is represented by a thick membrane,
which is very probably contractile.        The question resolves itself simply
into a more or less perfect fibrillar differentiation of that membrane. All
Turbellarians are built on the same essential type, as regards muscular
arrangement, as are other worms.         The general muscular arrangements
in the bodies of the Bipalium and Bhynclwdemus have become much
modified from those of flat Planarians by the pinching together and
condensation of the body, but they are nevertheless referable to the
same type.
   The digestive tract consists of three tubes (one anterior, two posterior),

  1873.]       Histology of the Land-Planarians        of Ceylon.          171
 as in other Planarians, and     as in the embryo leech before the formation
 of the anus.    Characteristic of land-Planarians, and consequent on the
 condensation   of the body, is the absence of all diverticulae from the inner
 aspects of the two posterior digestive tubes.       This is found to be the
 case in Geoplana, Bipalium, Rhynchodemus,        and  Geodesmus.    The close
 approximation of the intestinal diverticula in Bipalium and Rhynchodemus,
 and the reduction of the intervening tissue to a mere membranous
 septum, is very striking, and seems to foreshadow the condition of things
 in Annelids. The great difference in the form of the mouth in Rhyncho
 demus and Bipalium is also remarkable, considering the many points in
 which these forms are closely allied.
    A pair of large water-vascular trunks, or, as they are here termed,
 primitive vascular trunks, are conspicuous objects in transverse sections
 of the bodies of Bipalium and Rhynchodemus. A peculiar network of
 connective tissue is characteristic of these vascular canals on section, and
 is shown to present exactly similar features in Leptoplana tremellaris,
 Dendroccelum   lacteum, and Bothriocephalus latus.    The close agreement in
 the relative position of the oviducts to the vascular canals in Dendroccelum
 and our land-Planarians is very remarkable.          This primitive vascular
 system   is homologous   with  the  body-cavity present in the embryo leech
 and in Branchiobdella throughout life. It is not necessarily an excretory
 system, though the term water-vascular          system has been generally
 considered to imply such a function for it. The nerves and ganglia of
Planarians lie within the primitive vascular system, as do the corre
sponding structures within the primitive body-cavity of the leech.
    Branches from the primitive vascular system in Bipalium serve to
erect the penis, and probably supply the glandular tissue with fluid for
secretion ; others possibly proceed to the ciliated sacs in the head, and
perform an excretory function. A small marine Planarian was found to
contain haemoglobin. In Bipalium there are a series of separate testes
disposed in pairs, as in the leech. In Rhynchodemus the testicular cavities
are more closely packed, and follow no such definite arrangement.          The
ovaries are simple sacs in both Bipalium and Rhynchodemus, and are
placed very far forwards in the head, a long distance from the uterus.
In Bipalium short branches given off from the posterior positions of the
oviduct are the rudiments of a ramified ovary, such as exists in Dendro
ccelum lacteum.     There are also glands present, which probably represent
the yelk-glands and shell-making glands of aquatic Planarians in a more
or less rudimentary condition.        There is a comparatively simple penis
and female receptive cavity in both Bipalium and Rhynchodemus. In
Bipalium there is, further, a glandular cavity at the base of the penis
(prostate).    The organs described as nervous ganglia by Blanchard in
Polycladus are almost certainly its testes and ovaries ; and therefore the
arrangement of these bodies in Polycladus is the same as that in
Bipalium.

172              Mr. H. N. Moseley      on the Anatomy and            [Feb. 20,
   The   chain   of nervous ganglia described as existing in Bipalium
(Sphyrocephalus) by Schmarda, and which has been referred to by so
many authors, does not exist.  There is no doubt that Schmarda mistook
the ovaries and testes for ganglia. The real nervous system is ill-defined,
but appears to consist of a network of fibres without ganglion-cells,
which lies within the primitive vascular canals.   In Leptoplana tremel-
laris the structure of the ganglionic   masses is remarkablycomplex in the
arrangement of the fibres ; and well-defined ganglion-cells of various sizes
are present and have a definite arrangement.
   Numerous       eye-spots are present in Bipalium, most of them being
grouped     in  certain  regions in the head, but some few being found all
over the upper surface of the body, even down to the tail. The eye-
spots appear to be formed by modification of single cells.           In llhyncho-
dernus two eyes only are present.         All gradations would appear to exist
between the simple unicellular eye-spot of Bipalium and the more
complex eye of Leptoplana or Geodesmus, where the lens is split up into
a series of rod-like bodies, forming apparently a stage towards the
compound eyes of Articulata.          It is quite probable that these compound
eyes   have  arisen  by such  a splitting up into separate elements of a single
eye, and not by fusion of a group of unicellular eyes, such as those of
Bipalium. A peculiar papillary band runs along the lower portion of the
margin of the head of Bipalium.            The delicate papillae are in the form
of half cylinders, ranged vertically side by side. Between the upper ex
tremities of the papillae are the apertures of peculiar ciliated sacs.        The
papillae, from the mode in which the animal makes use of them, are pro
bably endowed with a special sense-function.         The sacs may have a similar
office, or they may be in connexion with the primitive vascular system,
and have an excretory function ; they may further be homologous with
the ciliated tubes in Nemertines.
   In considering the general anatomy of Bipalium, it is impossible to
help being struck by the many points of resemblance between this animal
and a leech. Mr. Herbert Spencer has, in his ' Principles of Biology,'
placed a gulf between Planarians and Leeches by denoting the former as
secondary, the latter as tertiary aggregates, so called because consisting
of a series of secondary aggregates formed one behind the other by a
process of budding. It is obvious, however, that a single leech is directly
comparable to a single Bipalium. The successive pairs of testes, the posi
tion of the intromittent generative organs, the septa of the digestive tract,
and, most of all, the pair of posterior ctcea, are evidently homologous in
the two animals. Further, were leeches really tertiary aggregates, the fact
would surely come out in their development, or at least some indication
of the mode of their genesis would survive in the development of some
annelid.   Such, however, is not the case.     The young worm or leech is
at first unsegmented, like  a  Planarian,  and  the traces of segmentation
appear subsequently in     it,
                             just as do the protovertebrae in vertebrates

  1873.]          Histology  of the Land-Planarians of    Ceylon.           173
 ,which   Mr. Spencer calls secondary aggregates.      If Mr. Spencer's hypo
  thesis was correct, we should expect to find at least some Annelid deve
 loping its segments in the egg as a series of buds. It is not, of course,
 here meant       to be concluded     that Annelids are not sometimes in a
 condition of tertiary aggregation, as Nais certainly is when in a budding
 condition, but that ordinarily they are secondary and not tertiary aggre
 gates ; and if so, then so also are Arthropoda.
    Much more information concerning the anatomy of Planarians will be
 required before it will be possible to trace the line of descent of Bipalium
 and Rhynchodemus, and determine what was the form of their aquatic
 ancestors.      In the absence of accurate accounts of the structure of the
 American      Land-Planarians,    and even of the European Ehyncliodemus
 terrestris, the question is very puzzling.     The formation of either one of
 the two forms Bipalium or RJiyndiodemus might be accounted for with
 comparative ease, from the arrangement of parts in the flat head of
 Bipalium.       From the tree-like branching of the digestive tract in that
 region, the corresponding ramification of the vascular system, and general
 muscular arrangement, it might be imagined that Bipalium had come
 from a flattened parent of the common Planarian form, and that all the
 body except the head had become rounded and endowed with an
ambulacral      line.   In nearly all points, except the eyes and the absence
of branches to the oviduct, Bipalium seems more highly specialized than
Ehynchodernus. We might imagine that Ehyncliodemus and Bipalium had a
common parent, and that when an ambulacral line was just beginning to
be developed, the two forms took different lines —Rhynchodemus losing all
traces of the original flatness of its ancestor, and never developing any
ciliated sacs or papillae, but cherishing a single pair of large eyes at the
expense of all the rest which it possessed, its testes, moreover, remaining
in a comparatively primitive condition.         But then comes the difficulty
about the great difference in shape in the pharynxes of the two forms ;
and if it be suggested that, as is highly probable, several or many aquatic
 Planarians have taken to terrestrial habits, and that Bipalium has been
derived from a form like Leptoplana, with a folded pharynx, whilst
Rhynchodemus came from an ancestor with a tubular one, it is difficult
to account for the many points of close resemblance between these two
forms, and especially their similarity in external colouring, though this
latter may perhaps be explained by mimicry.         On the whole, it is evident
that a close study of the anatomy of Land-Planarians cannot fail to lead
to interesting results, and it is hoped that this memoir may lead to
further work of the same kind. It would be of especial value to have a
good account of the anatomy of Gcodesmus and Rhynchodemus sylvaticus.

                                     (Abstract.)
    A   mineral found in 1802 at Hebron, Maine, IT. S. A., after a mere
 tentative examination by Professor Brush, who announced the presence
 in it of lithia in considerable quantity, resembled the amblygonite of Penig
 bo  closely as to lead to its being looked on as amblygonite.          The crys
 talline system and birefringent optical characters of this mineral were
 determined by the author in 1863.         In 1870 a mineral found in the tin
 vein of Montebras (Creuse), though resembling the amblygonite of Hebron,
 appeared to the author to differ from it so far as to justify his designation
 of it under the name of Montebrasite.            Towards the close of 1871 he
 received another specimen from Montebras, which presented all the cha
 racters of the American amblygonite, and which consequently was easily
 distinguished from the montebrasite.        Subsequently, analyses by Pisani,
 v. Kobell, and Rammelsberg, and optical observations by the author,
 proved the identity of the montebrasite of Montebras with the ambly
 gonite from Penig.       But this is not the case with the amblygonite from
 Hebron, nor with that from Montebras, which had been analyzed by Pisani.
These differ from the amblygonites of Saxony and Montebras (which last he
 had previously named montebrasite) by the absence of soda, by the pre
 ponderance of lithia, and the presence of a notable amount of water, while
at the same time they contain almost equal proportions        of phosphoric acid
 and alumina.
    The differences which these two minerals present in their physical and
 chemical characters are sufficiently decided to compel our treating them
as distinct species.      The name amblygonite should be retained for the
sodolithic    species first discovered at Penig by Breithaupt, and the white
 or violet-tinted   lamellar masses   abundant at Montebras      will be included
under    it ; the hydrated and entirely lithic   species  comprising  the laminar
specimens and the crystals from Maine, as well as some greenish masses
from Montebras, should be embraced under the name montebrasite.
    The amblygonite of Montebras has only been met with in laminar
masses with a faint tinge of violet.       These masses exhibit two cleavages
presenting nearly the same degree of facility, making with one another
an angle of 105° 44'. Close observation shows that the sharpness of the
reflected images is generally a little greater on one of the cleavages
than on the other ; and this induces one to suppose that they do not both
belong to equivalent crystallographic planes.         The study of some of their
optical properties, though presenting certain special difficulties, arising
from the small extent of the transparent portions and the presence of

 1873.]                   Amblygonite and Montebrasite.                        175
 numerous twin plates, even in the specimens that to all appearance are
 the most homogeneous, has proved that the laminar masses of montebrasite
 must be referred to the triclinic system.       The optic axes are situated in
 a plane which      divides  into two very unequal parts the acute angle of
 74° 16' of the two cleavages.      This direction is entirely different from
that found for montebrasite of Hebron and of Montebras, in which the
 plane of the axes lies in the obtuse angle of 105° formed by the two prin
 cipal cleavages.
    The appearance of the bars traversing the central ring of each system
indicates very distinctly a twisted dispersion, as well as a small amount of
inclined dispersion, which is characteristic      of a crystal  belonging to the
 triclinic system.
    In 'November     1871 the author received a specimen     from the middle of
a mass      of amblygonite     from Montebras     resembling the mineral from
 Hebron. It has three principal cleavages, p, m, t, which the author
recognized in the mass from Hebron, the angles between which are
p ro = 105°, m<=135° to 136°, p <=89° to 89° 15'.
    By means of artificial twins formed of two plates, each of which had
been worked perpendicular to the two cleavages p and m, and which were
united by their faces p, it appeared that the plane of the optic axes is
situated in the obtuse angle      p m, and traverses the edge     , but that it is
                                                                m
not quite normal to m, since it gives angles of about 82° with m and 23°
with p. The character of the coloured rings shows that in montebrasite
of Montebras,     as  in that from Hebron, there coexists with the horizontal
a well-marked     inclined dispersion ; and these are peculiar to crystals of
the triclinic system.

" On Leaf-Arrangement." By Hubert Airy, M.A., M.D. Com
       municated by Charles Darwin, F.R.S. Received January 21,
       1873.
                                   (Abstract.)
   Assuming, as generally known, the main facts of leaf-arrangement,—
the division into the whorled and spiral types, and in the latter more
especially the establishment of the convergent series of fractions, ^. i.
!,  h»     TV H,    f h tJ' f¥v-      as representatives   of a  corresponding
series of spiral leaf-orders among plants,     — we  have  to ask, what is     the
meaning that lies hidden in this law ?
   Mr. Darwin     has taught us to regard   the different species of plants as
descended from some common ancestor ; and therefore we must suppose
that the different leaf-orders now existing have been derived by different
degrees  of modification from some common ancestral leaf-order.
   One spiral order may be made to pass into another by a twist of             the
axis that carries the leaves. This fact indicates the way in which all         the
spiral orders may have been derived from one original order, namely             by
means of different degrees of twist in the axis.
   We naturally look to the simplest of existing leaf-orders,           the two-
ranked alternate order i, as standing nearest to the original ; for it is
manifest that the orders at the other extreme of the series (the condensed
arrangement of scales on fir-cones, of florets in heads of Composite, of
leaves in close-lying plantains, &c.) are special and highly developed
instances, to meet special needs of protection and congregation : they
are, without doubt, the latest feat of phyllotactic development ; and we
may be sure that the course of change has been from the simple to the
complex, not the reverse.      This point will be illustrated by experiment
below.

 1673.]              Dr. H. Airy on Leaf- Arrangement.                         177
    But first, what are the uses of these orders ? and at what period of the
leaf s life does the advantage of leaf Harder operate ? The period must be
that at which the leaf-order is most perfect : not, therefore, when the
twig is mature, with long internodes between the leaves, but while the
twig and its leaves are yet in the bud ; for it is in the bud (and similar
crowded forms) that the leaf-order is in perfection, undisturbed by con
tortions or inequalities of growth ; but, as the bud developes into the
twig, the leaves become     separated, the stem often gets a twist, the leaf
stalks are curved and wrung to present the blades favourably to the light,
and thus the leaf-order that was perfect in the bud is disguised in the
grown twig.
    In lateral shoots of  yew and box and silver     fir  we see how leaves    will
get   their stalks twisted to obtain more favourable exposure to light ; and
if  general distribution round the stem were useful to the adult leaves, we
should expect the leaves     of  a vertical   «Zm-shoot  (for example) to secure
such    distribution by various twists of stalk and stem ; but the leaf-blades
of the elm keep     their two ranks with very great regularity.         This goes
to  show that it is not in the mature twig that the leaf-order is specially
advantageous.
    In  the bud we see at once what       must be the use of leaf-order.      It is
for economy    of space, whereby the bud is enabled to retire into itself and
present the least surface to outward danger and vicissitudes of tempera
ture.     The fact that the order     £ does   not exhibit this advantage in any
marked degree, supports       the idea that this order is the original from
which all    the more complex    spiral orders have been derived.
    The long duration of the     bud-life as compared with the open-air life
 of the leaf gives importance     to the conditions of the former.      The open-
 air life of the bud is twelve   months, and adding the embryo life of the
 bud, we have about a year and a half for the whole life of the bud ; and
 for the twelve months of its open-air life it is in a state of siege, against
 which a compact arrangement of its embryo-leaves within must be of
 great value.     But the open-air life of the unfolded leaves is (except in
 evergreens)    not more than six months.
     That the order   | would   under   different   degrees  of contraction (with
 twist) assume successively the various spiral orders that exist in nature,
 in the order of their complexity, ^,           §,    &c., may be shown by the
 following experiment : —
     Take a number of spheres (say oak-galls) to represent embryo leaves,
 and attach them in two rows in alternate order (|) along opposite sides
  of a stretched india-rubber band.      Give the band a slight twist, to deter
 mine the direction of twist in the subsequent contraction, and then relax
  tension.    The two rows of spheres will roll up with       a strong   twist into
  a tight complex order, which, if the spheres are attached in close contact
  with the axis, will be nearly the order     \, with  three steep spirals.  If the

spheres are set a little away from the axis, the order becomes condensed
into (nearly) £, with great precision and stability.  And it appears that
further contraction, with increased distance of the spheres from the axis,
will necessarily produce the orders (nearly) |, -fe, fa, &c. in succession,
and that these successive orders represent successive maxima of stability
in the process of change from the simple to the complex.
  It also appears that the necessary sequence of these successive steps of
condensation, thus determined by the geometry of the case, does neces
sarily exclude the non-existent orders, |,                         ij-,   ^,   J,   \,    &c.
   Numbering the spheres from       upwards,            0                 it   appears that, under con
traction,         the following numbers are brought                            successively into contact
with        0,   alternately to right and left :—                  1,     2,   3,   5,   8,   13, 21, 34, 55, 89,

                                                 a     and so far the results of
this experiment fall short of the perfect fractions              -fa &c. but in      ^,       §,            :
this very failure the results   of  the experiment are more closely in agree
ment with nature than are those perfect fractions themselves for those                               ;
fractions give the angular divergence only in round numbers (so to
speak), and lose account of the little more, or the little less, which makes
all the difference between        vertical rank and
                                               a         spiral.    In the largea

variation in that group and in elm, beech, Ac., support the view that this
order is the original of the spiral orders.
   In many plants we find actual transition from the order \ to an order
more complex, as, for instance, in Spanish chestnut, laurels, nut, ivy;
and these instances agree in presenting the complex order in the buds
that occupy the most exposed situations, while they retain the simple          i
in the less exposed lateral buds. Several kinds of aloe have the order         |
in their basal leaves and    a higher order in the remainder.     A  species of
cactus often contains a   complete epitome of phyllotaxy in     a single   plant
or even in   a single shoot.
    Shoots of acacia often present a zigzag disposition of their leaves, on
either side of the branch, which seems unintelligible except as a distortion
of an original two-ranked order.
   The prevalent two-ranked arrangement of rootlets or roots seems to be
a survival underground of an order which originally prevailed through
the whole plant, root, stem, and branch.
   In the whole Monocotyledonous class the first leaves in the seed have
the order
   In   the Dicotyledonous     class the first leaves in the seed have the
simplest   order  of the whorled  type.
   As the spiral orders have probably been derived from          a two-ranked
alternate arrangement, so the whorled orders have probably been derived
from a two-ranked collateral (two abreast) arrangement.          This is illus
trated by an experiment similar to the former ; and it is seen that suc
cessive parallel horizontal pairs of spheres are compelled under contraction
to take position at right angles to one another, exactly in the well-known
crucial   or decussate order.     These whorls of two contain potentially
whorls of three and four, as is seen in variations of the same plant ; but the
experiment does not show the change.
   The reason of the non-survival of the (supposed) two-ranked collateral
order lies in its manifest instability ; for under lateral pressure it would
assume the alternate, and under vertical the crucial order.
   The bud presents in its shape a state of equilibrium between          a force
of contraction, a force of constriction, and a force of growth.
   To sum up, we are led to suppose that the original of all existing leaf-
orders was a two-ranked arrangement, somewhat irregular, admitting of
two regular modifications, the alternate and the collateral ; and that the
alternate has given rise to all the spiral orders, and the collateral to all the
whorled orders, by means of advantageous condensation in the course of
ages.

" On    the Combined         Action of Heat and Pressure upon the Pa
      raffins."    By   T.  E.   Thorpe and John Young, of the Ander-
      sonian University, Glasgow.                Communicated by Prof. H. E.
      Roscoe,     F.R.S.     Received       June    5, 1872*.
   1. In  a preliminary communication read before the Eoyal Society on
March    9th, 18711", we described the combined effect of heat and pressure
upon the solid paraffins.         We showed that when these substances are
exposed to a high temperature in a closed vessel they are almost com
pletely resolved, with the evolution of but little gas, into hydrocarbons,
which remain liquid at the ordinary temperature.                   This transformation
may be easily effected on the small scale.                A few grms. of ordinary
paraffin are  sealed  up  in  a piece of strong combustion-tubing bent in the
form of the letter y : the tube is securely surrounded by stout wire
gauze, and the limb containing the paraffin is gently heated along its
entire length in a gas combustion-furnace.                If the heat is properly re
gulated, the paraffin rapidly distils over and solidifies in the cold portion
of the tube. The gas-flames are then turned down, the tube reversed,
and the paraffin again distilled. After a very few repetitions of this
process the paraffin    acquires the consistency of butter, and the warmth
                * Read June   20, 1872.   See abstract,  vol. xx. p. 488.

                      of Heat and Pressure upon the Paraffins.                         185
of the hand is sufficient to liquefy           it,
                                     and after about   dozen distillations
                                                                      a
it remains permanently liquid. Although there        no difficulty in thus
                                                                 is
ultimately effecting the resolution of the solid paraffin into liquid pro
ducts, the rapidity of the transformation seems to be dependent upon
conditions which we cannot yet say we have satisfactorily determined.
On one occasion, after all the paraffin had been distilled over and had
solidified in the colder limb of the tube, the empty portion in contact
with the flame became softened and blew out, when instantly, on the
removal of the pressure, the solid matter became liquid, and slightly
effervesced as       if                    in the substance by the pressure
                          gas had been condensed
to which       it    had been
                        subjected.   It seems to be absolutely necessary
that the paraffin should be thus distilled over and condensed    by merely     ;
heating   in the tube in such manner that the condensed vapours flow
           it                         a
back again upon the heated portion, the liquefaction of the paraffin                    is
never accomplished.    About     grms. of
                                      6     pure paraffin, melting at
                                                     a
41°-5 C. (see section 12), were heated in sealed tube to about 200° for
                                                     a
twelve hours, but the melting-point remained unchanged.      The same
portion of paraffin was then transferred to        y-tube surrounded by
                                                             a
wire gauze, and distilled backwards and forwards in the combustion-
furnace.   After six distillations was rendered completely liquid. The
                                          it
total quantity of liquid obtained was about      cub. centims.
                                                         6      On gently
warming       bubbles of gas were evolved, and the liquid was in full
               it,
ebullition at 40°, but only about one sixth came over below 100° about             ;
2£ cub. centims. distilled between 100° and 200°, and nearly the whole
of the remainder below 300°; the small quantity remaining solidified
when the bulb was plunged into cold water.
   2. It appears that only paraffins boiling at an extremely high tempe
rature, and those usually solid under ordinary conditions, are thus sus
ceptible of decomposition.      The readiness with which they yield liquid
hydrocarbons appears    to depend upon the complexity of their constitu
tion.   We have not determined with certainty the limits of the decom
position   but we find that the paraffin (and olefine) boiling at about 255°
           ;
(see section 11) may be repeatedly distilled backwards and forwards in
                                                                                         a
sealed y-tube without suffering the slightest change. 6-7 grms. of the
mixture of hydrocarbons were distilled backwards and forwards twenty-
one times   but on opening the tube no gas was evolved, and the boiling-
               ;
point (252°-255° uncorrected) remained unaltered.        A further proof of
its unalterability on repeated distillation under pressure   afforded by its
                                                                          is
reaction with bromine (see section 5).
      9*38 grms. of the mixed hydrocarbons before distillation required
     I.
2-95 grms. of bromine before the liquid became permanently reddened                      ;
100 parts by weight would require 31-4.
     II.
     8-605 grms. hydrocarbon before distillation required 2-672 grms. of
bromine, or 100 grms. would require 31 of bromine.      Mean amount of
bromine needed 31-2 per cent.

 186          Messrs. Thorpe and Young on the Combined Action
    III.    5-13 grms. of the hydrocarbon after repeated distillation (21 times)
 required 1-54 grm. of bromine, or 100 grms. would require 30 grms.
    3. In the hope of throwing some light upon the constitution of the
 solid   paraffins,        we have repeated this process of transformation                  into
liquid products upon               a large scale.         The paraffin employed   was  obtained
from shale        ;   it melted at 46° and solidified at 43°,              and had    a specific
gravity of 0-906 at 13°, when solidified under an extra pressure of
0-75 millim. of mercury*.
    It was burnt with copper oxide in a stream of oxygen, with the follow
ing results       : —
    I. 0-2980 grm. paraffin gave 0-9293 grm. carbon dioxide and                    0-3980 grm.
water.
    II.   An unknown quantity                 gave 1-4245 grm. carbon dioxide and         0-6060

   * Considerable discordances exist in the state
ments by various observers of the specific gravities
of the solid paraffins.         These differences are doubt
less due more to the difficulty of obtaining the bodies
perfectly homogeneous after melting than to any
great variations in their true specific gravity. When
a piece of ordinary paraffin is examined, it is seen to
be made up of an infinite number of small cavities ;
and however carefully it may be cooled after melting,
the interstices are invariably present.                 From this
circumstance       it is obvious    that  any attempt to deter
mine   the  real   specific  gravity   of  this body would give
too low a result.         By solidifying the paraffin under
pressure, the formation of the cavities may be, to a
great extent, obviated.          We have effected the solidi
fication in the apparatus figured in the margin.
Mercury was first poured into the tube up to the
level  A B, the bottom end of the tube being securely
plugged by a cork C. The wider portion D of the
tube was then filled with the melted paraffin, and
a well-fitting caoutchouc cork fastened down by wire
into the opening, care being taken to exclude all
bubbles of air.         Mercury was now quickly poured
into the longer limb of the tube until it stood about
08 m. above the level of the metal in the wider tube,
and under the pressure of this mercury the paraffin
was allowed to solidify slowly.             By withdrawing the
cork C, the mercury         could  flow   out, and on warming
the sides of     the   tube  the plug    of  paraffin was easily
detached.     Thus     solidified,  the  body was almost entirely free from cavities, and  portion."
perfectly homogeneous were easily found ; these had a specific gravity of O906              at 13'

                of Heat and Pressure       upon the Paraffins.              187

years ago* from analysis of a paraffin identical in origin and melting-

   In the process of conversion we replaced the bent glass tube above
described by an apparatus consisting of two cast-iron mercury bottles
connected together by a bent iron pipe, in which were fixed a stopcock
and pressure-gauge.      One of the bottles was charged with the paraffin,
and was heated over an ordinary coal fire, the heat being so regulated
that a pressure of 20 to 25 lbs. was maintained in the apparatus through
out the operation.       The volatilized products distilled over into the
second bottle, which acted as a condenser.           In about four or five hours
the operation was concluded, and the distillate had the appearance of a
magma of oil, and of apparently unaltered paraffin. This mixture melted
at a comparatively low temperature, the warmth of the hand being suffi
cient to render it completely liquid.
   Three and a half kilograms of the paraffin yielded about 4 litres of
liquid hydrocarbons.      On distillation the mixture commenced to boil at
18°, but  the quantity coming over below 100° was comparatively small;
by far the greater portion boiled between 200° and 300°. A preliminary
separation showed that the 4 litres were approximately made up of
hydrocarbons boiling   : —

   A considerable quantity of substance, which could not be distilled
within the range of the mercurial thermometer, remained in the retort,

   4. Fraction hailing lehw 100°. — After repeated distillations over sodium
this portion was almost completely resolved into three fractions, boiling
constantly at (1) 32-38°, (2) 65-70°, and (3) 94-97°. The quantity
of liquid boiling below 30° did not amount to 5 cub. centims.     Although
the distillation was   conducted   in  winter, and   freezing-mixtures   of
snow and salt were employed for the condensation, the greater portion
of the product boiling at 32-3S0 came over at about 35° ; this boiling-
point would indicate that the liquid is probably either quintane or amy-
lene, or a mixture of these hydrocarbons.                  In    order to decide the point,
the distillate was treated with bromine.                        The liquid was violently
attacked, and each drop of bromine combined with the hydrocarbon with
a hissing noise ; so energetic was the reaction, that, in order to moderate
it,
it    was necessary to immerse the hydrocarbon in          freezing-mixture.
                                                                         a
When proper care was taken to cool the liquid, scarcely       trace of hydro-a
bromic acid was evolved.   In order to prevent the possible formation of
higher brominated products, the addition of the bromine was from time
to time interrupted, and the liquid submitted to distillation  invariably        ;   it
commenced to boil at about 32°, and the distillation was maintained until
the thermometer        stood at 50°. The distillate was again treated with
bromine        in the cold, and again distilled, the process being repeated
until     it   was without visible action upon the hydrocarbon, — that is,
until the liquid was permanently reddened.           It was then washed
with dilute potash solution, and rectified over sodium             boiled con;   it
stantly at 35-37°   the;liquid was evidently quintane,  and in all probability
normal quintane, the boiling-point of which      given by Schorlemmer at

attempt the preparation of any derivatives from it. The brominated por

   5. The fraction boiling between 65° and 70°, which was at least fifty
times greater than that boiling at 32-38°, was then treated with bromine                  ;
the bromine was absorbed with the same avidity as in the preceding case                   ;
and    was equally necessary to cool the hydrocarbon in order to moderate

the reaction.  As soon as the liquid appeared permanently reddened,                       it
was distilled.  The portion boiling below 80° was no longer instantly

     Two determinations of its specific gravity made by means of different
  bottles gave    : —
                                   (1) 0-6620 at  19°-5, and
                                   (2) 0-6041 at  18°.
     Compared       with water at the same temperature, Pelouze and Cahours
 found 0-669 at 16° for the hexane boiling at 6S° obtained from American
 petroleum.         Hexane from suberic acid, boiling at 69°-5, according to
 Dale, has a specific gravity of 0-6617 at 17°-5 ; this agrees with that of
 (3  hexane obtained          from   mannite,  viz. 0-0045 at 16°-5.       Schorlemmer
 found 0-678        at 15°-5 for the hydride from cannel coal, which agrees
 perfectly with that obtained by Williams for the same hydride prepared
from boghead coal, viz. 0-6745 at 18°.             On the other hand, Schorlemmer
 has  found that the hexane prepared            from   mannite is probably identical
with that obtained           for secondary hexyl iodide by the action of zinc and
hydrochloric acid, and with the dipropyl obtained from primary hexyl
iodide, for which he found the specific gravity 0-6630 at 17°; and these
are probably identical with the hexane of Pelouze and Cahours obtained
from petroleum, and with the hydride found by Schorlemmer in cannel
oil, all being normal hydrocarbons with the constitution
                          CH,— CH — CH,—CH — CH — CH,.
    The brominated             hydrocarbon left in the flask after removing the
hexane     was then distilled : it commenced to boil at about 190° ; the ther
mometer        gradually rose to 195°, and nearly the whole of the liquid
distilled   over below 205°. As the compound showed signs of decompo
sition on      boiling, hydrobromic        acid being continuously evolved during
the    distillation,   a considerable amount      of tarry matter remaining in the
flask,   it was impossible to fractionate it further. It was purified, how
ever, by distillation in a current of steam ; it was nearly colourless, and
on analysis yielded numbers agreeing with the formula

specific gravity    : —

from which 1-5967 is obtained as the specific gravity of hexylene dibro-
mide at 20° compared with water at the same temperature.
    A second determination with a smaller quantity gave 1-5975 at 18°.
Pelouze and Cahours found the boiling-point of this body to be 192-193°,
and its specific gravity 1-582 at 19°.       These numbers are certainly too
low ; the bromide had probably been slightly decomposed by distillation.
    We have attempted to determine the relative amounts of hydride and
olefine in the fraction boiling at 65-68° by means of the reaction with
 bromine.
    The hydrocarbon was weighed out in a small distillation-flask, and
well cooled by a mixture of ice and salt ; bromine was then slowly added,
and in minute drops, by means of the little apparatus seen in the figure
—a small caoutchouc ball about 5 cub. centims. in diameter, which can be
compressed by the plate movable along the rods by means of                   the
milled head-screw.       The mode of working the instrument is obvious     ;   by
means of it the bromine can be easily transferred from the bottle in
which it is preserved to the hydrocarbon, and the amount added can be
regulated with great nicety.       The bromine was added until the liquid
was permanently reddened, when the flask was again weighed to deter
mine the amount of bromine employed.           13-30 grms. of the mixed hydro
carbons boiling at 65-70° required 13-16 grms. bromine before the red
colour was persistent.      This amount of bromine is equivalent to 6-9 grms.
 of hexylene, and 13-3 — 0-9=0-4 as the amount of hexane present.            Tho
mixturo was now distilled, and all passing over below 110° (at which
point the liquid in the flask commenced to blacken) collected in a weighed
test-tube.     The weight of the distillate was 6-18 grms. From these
numbers it would appear that the product boiling at 05-68° is a mixture
of hexane and hexylene in about equal proportions.
    6.  The fraction boiling at 94-97° was next treated with bromine in
the cold until the liquid was reddened.       The termination of the reaction
was    not so  easily seen in this case ; the mixture blackened slightly, and
more hydrobromic acid was evolved, although the hydrocarbon was care
fully cooled by ice and salt. The brominated mixture on distillation
commenced to boil about 95°, and it was heated to 130°, when the liquid
in the flask commenced to decompose ; at this point, therefore, the distil
lation was interrupted.      The following are the details of a quantitative
determination : —

                   of Heat and Pressure upon the Paraffins.                 191
               Weight of mixed hydrocarbons             14-21 grms.
              Weight of bromine added                   12-9     „
              Equivalent to heptylene                    7-9     „

              Amount of heptane actually obtained    ..   6-15   „
    From this experiment it would appear that the amount of olefinc is
slightly greater than that of the hydride in the fraction boiling at 94-97° ;
but, from the circumstances of the experiment, we have reason to believe
that the amount of heptylene thus indicated is slightly above the truth.
It was difficult to determine the final point of the reaction ; the hydride
was not altogether unacted on by the bromine, and small quantities of
hydrobromic acid were continuously disengaged during the process ;
these circumstances would tend to increase the weight of bromine used,
and consequently the apparent weight of the olefine present.         In extend
ing our research to the determination of the constitution of these hydro
carbons, we have had occasion to repeat this experiment on a far larger
scale and under more favourable conditions.
    900 grms. of the mixed heptane and heptylene required 716 grms. of
bromine ; this would be equivalent to 439 grms. of heptylene. 900 grms.
of a mixture of heptane and heptylene in equivalent proportions would
contain 444 grms. of heptylene.
    The heptylene bromide could not be redistilled under the ordinary
 atmospheric pressure without decomposition ; it commenced to blacken at
 about 150°, and dense fumes of hydrobromic acid were evolved.           When
 distilled in a current of steam, it was obtained nearly colourless.
    It cannot be preserved, however, without slight decomposition ; when
 exposed to light, it slowly darkens in colour and evolves hydrobromic
 acid gas.
     It was analyzed with the following results :—
     0-7470 grm. gave 1-0210 grm. Ag Br and 0-035 grm. reduced silver.

     The heptane, after washing with dilute potash solution, drying, and
  rectification over sodium, boiled constantly at 97-99°.           Its specific

  (2) 0-6915 at 18°. Warren and Storer found for the same hydrocarbon

   These six bodies, quintane and amylene, hexane and hexylene, heptane
and heptylene, are the only liquids we have been able to isolate from the
fraction boiling below 100°. Careful search was made for the other
hydrocarbons, particularly for benzol and for the hexylene of Caventou,
boiling about   80°, but  without   success.     The fractions intermediate be
tween 70° and 90° could be resolved by repeated distillations into pro
ducts boiling at 65-70° and 90-100°.           The amount coming over in the
neighbourhood of 80° was very small ; in fact the entire quantity even
tually obtained between 70° and 90° amounted to only a few grams. About
a gram of the small portion boiling at 80-82° was treated with strong
nitric acid ; the liquid was very slowly acted upon, and when treated with
alcohol, zinc, and hydrochloric acid, after washing and solution in ether,
it failed to give the characteristic reaction for aniline ; nor on treating
the remainder of the hydrocarbon with excess of bromine, and allowing
the mixture to evaporate, could any solid bromide (C„ H10 Br4) bo obtained.
Hence we infer the absence of members of tho Cn H2„_o and C» ll2n-8
groups in the liquid hydrocarbons obtained by the decomposition of solid
paraffins.
   7. Fraction boiling between 100° and 200°. — As this portion amounted
to about a litre, it was thought worth while to attempt a more rigorous
separation of the hydrocarbons than is possible by the ordinary method
of fractionation ; for tins puqwse a small condensing arrangement on
Warren's principle was constructed, and by means of it the hydrocarbons
were separated at first at intervals of 10°, afterwards into portions boil
ing between 5°, and eventually into portions boiling between 2°. The
hydrocarbons were distilled over sodium, and the temperature of the
worm was maintained about 20° lower than that of the vapour in the
flask.   A considerable quantity of liquid was obtained boiling below 100°;
and this could be resolved into hexane and hexylene, heptane and hepty
lene. The amount of liquid eventually obtained between 100° and 120°
was very small.
   About    120  grms.   of liquid   were found      to boil constantly between
122° and 125°.     Bromine was eagerly absorbed by this fraction, indicating

  with bromine yielded the following data : —

     On the addition of bromine the hydrocarbon darkened rapidly in colour,
 and a small quantity of tarry matter collected at the bottom of the flask.
 As it was impossible to distil the mixture under the ordinary atmospheric
 pressure,    the bromide being decomposed by a very slight elevation of
 temperature, it was treated with alcoholic potash, and distilled per ascent
 sum for some hours until a few drops thrown into water floated upon its
 surface.      Water     was then added, the lighted           portion separated, dried,
 and fractionated.         The largest amount       came over between 120° and 140°,
 the next    fraction from 140-160°           being much smaller in quantity, whilst
 scarcely any liquid      distilled over  between     160° and 180°.       After this point
 the thermometer became more stationary, and a fraction almost as large
 as that at   120-140°     came over between 180° and 200°.              This, on renewed
 distillation,    boiled   at 185-190°     ;   it had  a feeble garlic     smell, and was
 heavier    than water. Analysis             showed that    it had approximately the
 composition Cs Hi5 Br.

   According to Rubien*, by whom this compound was first described, its
boiling-point is 185°.
   The fraction boiling between 120° and 140° on repeated distillation was
separated into octane, boiling at 122-125°, and a liquid of an alliaceous
odour    boiling constantly at 130-135°, which absorbed bromine with
avidity.     This in all probability was caprylidene, the boiling-point of
which has already been found by Rubien (loc. cit.) to be 133-134° ; its
formation was doubtless due to the prolonged                    action of the alcoholic
potash on the C8 H15 Br.
   Action of chlorine on mixed hydrocarbons boiling at 122-125°. — 34 grms.
of the hydrocarbons were weighed out into a small distillation-flask,
immersed       in a mixture of ice and salt, and a gentle stream of chlorine
sent through the       liquid in the dark. The chlorine was rapidly absorbed,
and   for the first hour but little hydrochloric acid was disengaged ; during

the second hour and to the close of the operation, the evolution            of this
gas increased largely, and the mixture darkened considerably.
   The chlorinated liquid was then distilled in a current of steam ; as
soon as the distillate appeared to be heavier than water the receiver was
changed, and the heavy liquid separated, dried, and distilled.             It com
menced to boil at about 220°, but showed no constant boiling-point ; but
the greater portion came over between 230° and 240°. At this high tem
perature the product suffered rapid decomposition.         The portion boiling
at 230-240° was redistilled in a current of steam. After drying over
calcium chloride   it was nearly colourless, heavier than water, and of a
plaesant  aromatic  odour. Analysis showed that it was octi/lene dichloride.

   The portions of octane obtained after treatment with chlorine and with
bromine were then mixed and repeatedly distilled over sodium. The mixed
liquid commenced to boil at 118°, and about two fifths came over below
122°, the remainder    distilling between 122° and 125°. Both fractions
were immediately reddened by bromine vapour.            The 122-125° fraction
was analyzed with the following results : —

   Action of nitrogen tetroxide upon ilie mixed octane and octylene boiling
at 122-125°.   — Many years ago Guthrie described a solid crystalline com
pound of amylene and nitrogen tetroxide, C3 H10 (ls"02)2.       So easily is this
compound formed that the reaction of the gas upon amylene constitutes a
very good test for the presence of the olefine, and comparatively small
quantities of amylene may, by means of nitrogen tetroxide, be discovered
and separated from considerable quantities of quintane.
   We have studied the reaction of nitrogen tetroxide upon a mixture of
octane and octylene in the hope of discovering an easier method of sepa
rating the two hydrocarbons.        No solid nitro-compound, however, was

 obtained.     On passing the  gas  into a mixture of the hydrocarbons it was
 rapidly absorbed, and a heavy oil separated out ; this had an odour resem
 bling that of castor-oil ; but the substance could only be preserved in the
 freezing-mixture, and on distillation, even in steam, it was immediately
 decomposed.
    8. The next well-defined    fraction of the original liquid boiling between
 100° and 200° distilled constantlyat 145-148°. It was remarked that as this
fraction increased in bulk, and the neighbouring ones became more free
from octane and octylene, they gradually acquired a very characteristic
and unpleasant smell, quite different from the     fraction boiling at 122-125°.
A port ion of the mixed hydrocarbons was treated with bromine in the cold.
The same darkening was observed as in the case of the 122-125° fraction ;
but it was by no means so marked as in that instance, and there was no
difficulty in perceiving when a decided excess of bromine had been added.
The following are the details of the experiment : —
          Hydrocarbon employed                                18-95 grms.

    As it was impossible to distil off the hydride, even in a current of steam,
without at the same time decomposing the bromine compound, the liquid
was treated with alcoholic potash and distilled upwards for some time.
Water was then added, the dark brown oil separated, dried, and distilled ;
it commenced to boil at 150°, and fractions were collected between every
10°. The largest fractions came over at 160-170° and 200-218°.

    The quantity obtained was too small to admit of purification.
    A second portion of the liquid, boiling between 145° and 148°, was treated
with fuming sulphuric acid.          A considerable rise of temperature was
observed, so that it was necessary to cool the mixture in order to prevent,
as far as possible, the polymerizing action of the strong acid.        The super
natant oil was then decanted, washed with dilute soda solution, dried, and
 distilled over sodium.     About half the liquid came over below 170°,
after which the thermometer rose very rapidly to above 340°, when the
 distillation was stopped.     On cooling, the dense oily liquid in the retort
 solidified.   The fraction boiling below 170° was redistilled over sodium ;
 it boiled almost entirely between 145° and 150°. It was then mixed with
 the hydride obtained after treatment with bromine (see preceding section),
 and the mixed liquids were again distilled over sodium.       The boiling-point

     It should be remarked that no liquid boiling at about 145-148° was
 discovered by Pelouze and Cahours in American petroleum.                       The nonyl
 hydride isolated by these chemists had the boiling-point 136-138°.                     We
 have assured ourselves that         there   is no   liquid boiling at about this tem
 perature in the products obtained from solid paraffin.

     The boiling-point of the nonane isolated by us agrees perfectly with
 that calculated on the assumption that the differences in the boiling-point s
of the simpler members of the C„H:,+2 become continually less by 4°, until
the well-known difference of 19° is obtained. (Schorlemmer.)

    Action of chlorine upon nonane. — About 15-20 grms. of the purified
hydrocarbon were heated in a small flask fitted to an upright condenser,
and a current of well-dried chlorine was sent through the liquid.                      The
apparatus was placed in direct sunlight.                The action appeared to com
mence immediately,       the   liquid    darkened      slightly in colour, and a large
quantity of hydrochloric acid Mas evolved.                 The chlorine on passing into
the heated liquid appeared        to  burn,   a  flash   of  light appearing at the end
of the delivery-tube as each successive bubble of gas passed into the hy
dro 'arbon.      In order to prevent as far as possible the formation of high
chlorinated products, the passage of the chlorine was occasionally inter
rupted and the liquid distilled        ;  the portion       boiling below 200° was      set
aside, and that which came         over below this point was submitted to the

                 of Heat and Pressure upon the Paraffins.                         197
further action of the chlorine.     Ultimately the greater portion of the liquid
was found to boil between 200° and 230°, about | boiling above this point.
By repeated distillation the former portion was divided into two portions —
one boiling at 190-198°, and the other boiling constantly at 240-245°.

   The specific gravity of the nonyl chloride was found to be 0-8962 at
14°. Pelouze and Cahours found the so-called pelargyle chloride to boil
at 196° ; its specific gravity was 0-899 at 16°.             It is highly probable,
however,    in spite of the concordance of these results, that the liquid          ob
tained by us was a mixture of primary        and secondary chlorides ; and the
same    remark is probably applicable to the product obtained by Pelonzo
aud Cahours.        The fraction boiling at about 245° was in all probability
C( Hls CI,, produced by the further action of the chlorine upon the hydride           ;
the quantity, however, was insufficient to purify it for analysis.

boiled at    170-172°.    It was treated with bromine, with the following
results   :—

    The liquid was too strongly reddened by the bromine ; it was evident
that too great an excess had been added.          This would make the amount of
 olefine too large.    The quantity of hydrocarbon taken was too small ; the
 experiment    should have been repeated on a larger scale.                Our object,
 however, was to economize our material, as we could find no ready method
 of separating     the brominated     compound     from   the unattacked       hydride
 without decomposition.       Boiling with alcoholic potash        gave a very   indo-
 fmite result.
    About 37 grms. of the mixed hydrocarbons were cautiously treated with
 nitric and sulphuric acids, and the mixture cooled to moderate the reaction.

  of the liquid had passed over, the remainder        in the flask suddenly decom
  posed, becoming almost solid, and fumes of oxides of nitrogen were abun
  dantly disengaged.     The distillate, which floated on water, was dried and
  distilled; it commenced to boil at 169°, and all came over below 175°,

198        Messrs. Thorpe and Young on the Combined Action
after repeated distillation over sodium, until the metal was no longer
attacked ; it boiled constantly at 166-168°.
   It was   analyzed as under      : —
   0-2090 grm. hydride         gave 0-6460 grm. carbon dioxide and 0-2950
grm. water.

   Its specific gravity was 0-7394 at         13°-5, compared with water at the
same temperature.        Schorlemmer's    amyl (decatyl hydride), obtained by the
action of sodium on amyl iodide, boiled at 158-159°, and had the specific
gravity 0-7275 at 14°.         It is very probable that this hydrocarbon is not
the normal hydride, but stands to the decatyl hydride boiling at 108° in
the same relation that the amyl hydride boiling at 30° does to the isomer
boiling at 39°, or as the ethyl amyl boiling at 90° (sp. gr. 0-6819 at 18°-5)
does to the normal heptane boiling at 99° (sp. gr. 0-6915 at 18°).              The
normal decatyl hydride obtained byPelouze and Cahours from petroleum
had the specific gravity 0-735 at 15°; the hydride found by Greville
Williams in the oil from boghead coal had the specific gravity 0-7365
at 18°.
    A   determination     of the vapour-density      of the decatyl hydride    from
paraffin gave the following data :

between 192° and 197°, the greater portion of the liquid coming over
at about 193-195°.         The fraction boiling at 193-195° was treated with
bromine, with the following results : —

    11. Fraction boiling between 200° and 300°. — By long-continued distilla
tion over sodium the 2£ litres boiling originally between these limits
were resolved into the following fractions : —
                        (1)   212-215°*
                        (2)   230-235° solidifies at — 14°-5t

                        (5)   290-295°
   The portion boiling at 300° (in the neighbourhood of 315°) is solid at
ordinary temperatures.
   The following details of the bromination experiments show that the
fractions were invariably mixtures of olefines and hydrides            : —
    Fraction 212-215°      :
                  4-48 grms. required 2-65 grms. of bromine.
    Fraction 230-235°      :
                  4-23 grms. required 1-92 grm. of bromine.
    Fraction 252-255°     :
                  (1) 9-38 grms. required 2-95 grms. of bromine.
                  (2) 8-605 grms. required 2-67 grms. of bromine.
                  (3) 5-13 grms. required 1-54 grm. of bromine.
    Fraction 273-276°.
                  7-39 grms. hydrocarbon required 2-04 grms. of bromine.
    12.  It has already been mentioned that, on the first distillation of the
oils obtained by splitting up the 3£ kilogs. of paraffin, a considerable
amount of substance (which could not be distilled within the range
of the thermometer) remained in the retort and solidified on cooling.            This
substance in its crude condition melted at 31°, but on recrystallization
 from ether the melting-point became higher.             The whole of the substance
 was therefore cut up into small fragments, and spread upon filter-paper
                 * These boiling-points are uncorrected.
                 t These points of solidification are only approximative.

 200        Messrs. Thorpe and Young on the Combined Action
 to remove adhering oil as far as possible, and repeatedly recrystallized
 from ether until the melting-point was unaltered.
     It melted invariably at 41°-5 and solidified at 40°-5 ; it could not be dis
 tilled within the range of the mercurial thermometer.
     It crystallized from ether in beautifully white satiny scales, and gave
 the following numbers when burnt with oxide of copper in a stream of
 oxygen : —
     0-3035 grm. gave 0-9590 grm. carbon dioxide and 0-419 grm. water.
             Carbon                                                  85-19
             Hydrogen                                                15-34
                                                                   100-53
     Action  of   bromine   upon ilie solid paraffin melting at 41°-5. — A few
grams of the substance were dissolved in bisulphide of carbon, and four
minute drops of bromine added ; this small quantity of bromine sufficed
to colour the liquid strongly.        On standing from 12 to 15 hours, the
colour appeared unaltered, and the solution was not decolorized after
heating from 60-70° for 12 hours.            On heating the liquid to 150°, the
colour disappeared after a few hours ; and on opening the tube hydro-
bromic acid was evolved.          About   10  drops of bromine were again added,
and the liquid reheated to 150°;           but no diminution in the red colour
of the solution was perceptible, although             on opening    the tube hydro-
bromic acid f uines were abundantly disengaged.             This observation would
appear to indicate that the hydrocarbon melting at 41°-5 is a member of
the C. Ho,+2 series.
    Action of heat upon 41°-5 paraffin. — Repeated crystallization from ether
having failed to alter the melting-point of this substance, and the behaviour
with bromine evidently indicating that it belonged to the marsh-gas series,
we considered that it would be interesting to study the combined action
of heat and pressure upon it.           The details of the experiment have been
already given      in section  1.    After  six distillations it was rendered com
pletely liquid.       It began to boil at about 40°, and about one sixth came
over below 100°, about one third between 100° and 200°, and the greater
portion of the remainder below 300°          ; the small quantity remaining in the
retort solidified on cooling.
    In  a second experiment       the action of bromine upon the liquid hydro
carbons was quantitatively determined :
    Weight of liquid hydrocarbon taken                                   5-73 grins.
          „       bromine required before the liquid was reddened        30-7   „
    The action of the bromine was very energetic, and it was necessary to
moderate the reaction by cooling the liquid.
    It is evident from these experiments that the solid paraffin (x C, Hs»+2)
had been split up by heat and pressure into a mixture              of hydrides   and
defines.

      13. This mode of decomposition would appear to             be general, at least
  for the higher terms of the series of normal paraffins.          If these bodies be
  represented     constitutionally    by linking the carbon atoms together       in  a
  single chain,
           GH,— CH— CH,— CHa— CH3                                        CH3,
  then the simultaneous formation of hydride and olefine must be assumed
  to occur from the loosening of the affinities of certain of the groups of
  CHa.    Under the influence of heat these groups become dissociated
  (vibrate without the spheres of their mutual attractions), and recombme
  to form saturated hydrocarbons.           Assuming (for the sake of simplicity)
  that this decomposition      can occur so   low down in the series as in the case
  of butane,  it might   be thus represented      : —
                       H H H H                      H H          H H

    We    can  offer but little direct evidence      as to the exact manner   of this
 decomposition —whether          it is attended by the gradual elimination         of
 ethylene, a    hydride containing a greater number of carbon atoms being
 left behind,   or whether the paraffin is at once split up into the hydride
 and an olefine containing an equal number of carbon atoms as in the above
 equation.     Neither supposition is exactly substantiated by experiment.
 If the action of heat gave rise to the former mode of decomposition, we
 ought to obtain a large quantity of ethylene after prolonged heating,
 especially when the liquid portion is rich in hydrocarbons of low molecular
 weight ; but, as we have already pointed out, the process of liquefaction is
accompanied with the production of comparatively little gas.                  On the
 other hand, an examination        of  the amounts    of bromine required to render
the   hydrocarbons      boiling below 200° permanently red, shows that the
proportion of hydride to olefine in the several mixtures becomes gradually
larger as the molecular weight increases.              It would appear, therefore,
that the liquids boiling between 200° and 300° are not mixtures of hydrides
and olefines     in equal proportions,      as are the fractions  boiling at 65-70°
and 94-97° &c.
    It would   have been doubtless interesting to have determined the relative
amounts of the 12 fractions isolated from the decomposed paraffin ; but
when it is considered that their separation was only effected after several
thousand     distillations, it will be evident that the quantities    obtained after
such tedious treatment can afford no real        indication of the amount present
in the original liquid. We have, however, a distinct impression that the
amounts of liquid boiling at 94-97° and 122-125° were but slightly (if
at all) less than the quantities boiling at 252-255° and 273-276°.

  1873.]             On the Vapour -density of Potassium.                   203
 I. " On     the Vapour-density of Potassium." — Preliminary Notice.
        By   James Dewar and William Dittmar. Communicated
        by  H. E. Roscoe, F.R.S., Professor of Chemistry in Owens
        College, Manchester.         Received January 27, 1873.
    Since the elaborate experiments of Devillo and Troost on the vapour-
 densities of substances at high temperatures, little has been added to
 chemical science in this field of research. Doubtless this is in great part
 owing to the difficulty of any one student manipulating the complex
 apparatus     necessary for the execution of the experiments.          But the
 operations are greatly increased in difficulty when we select bodies that
are readily inflammable in air and attack with facility glass and porcelain
 at the high temperatures to which they are exposed.         This is the reason
why the molecular weights of a most important class of elementary
 bodies, viz. the alkali metals (although these are volatile at moderate
temperatures), have remained to the present time undetermined.           It was
with the view of adding something to our knowledge in this department,
that we recently undertook some experiments with potassium, the results
of which we now beg leave to lay before the Society.          The special diffi
culties we had to overcome are involved in the endeavour to answer the
following questions     : —
    1. Is it  possible to convert potassium into a gas of one atmosphere's
pressure    at  any of the constant temperatures we can at present command ?
    2. Is it possible to generate pure potassium-vapour          and to keep it
from getting oxidized ?
    3. Supposing a definite volume of such vapour to have been procured,
how can its weight be ascertained ?
    After   a succession of failures, which    we shall not detail, we at last
succeeded in devising a workable process, which may be briefly described
as  follows  : —
    A cylindrical iron     bottle of at least 200 cub. centims. capacity, of a
thickness    in the body ensuring sufficient rigidity at even a bright red
heat, and provided with a well-ground inbent neck, pierced with a canal
of about 2 millims. in diameter, is employed as a generator and recep
tacle of the vapour.
    A mass of about 20 kilogrs. of zinc contained in a plumbago crucible,
which being placed in a forge-fire can be readily heated up to the
boiling-point, serves as a bath.
    The experiment begins by first deoxidizing the inside of the receptacle
at a red heat by means of a current of dry hydrogen, which is continuously
maintained until the bottle has cooled down below redness.              At this
stage   about    200 grins,  of  pure mercury  are introduced  into  the bottle,
which is then inserted into the red-hot zinc, without, however, covering
the upper extremity of the bottle.         After £ of the mercury is distilled
off (which is accomplished in a very short time), the neck is withdrawn,
                                                                   s 2

204                      Mr.  J. Spillcr on New Sources               [Mar. 6,
and while the mercury-vapours        are still streaming out, an iron test-tube,
previously prepared with great care and charged with 4-5 grms. of
potassium, is dropped into the bottle, the neck reinserted, and after the
whole of the bottle has been immersed into the zinc, the blast of the forge
is forcibly increased so as, in the shortest possible time, to bring the zinc
into the state of boiling, proper arrangements being made for keeping
the neck of the bottle red-hot.        The potassium in a short time begins to
 volatilize,  issuing in jets into the air and depositing caustic potash at
 the nozzle, which must be kept clear by means of an iron wire.               As
 soon as the distillation of the potassium ceases, the nozzle is closed by
 means of a ground-in wire plug, at once immersed into a mass of mer
 cury contained      in a test-tube, and the bottle withdrawn to a proper
 support, on which it is allowed to cool.
    After it has reached a manageable temperature, the bottle is inserted
 into a mass of recently boiled water, the wire plug withdrawn, and the
  hydrogen formed by the action of the water on the potassium pumped
 out, by means of a " Sprengel," into a eudiometer, to be measured.
    In   the experiments we have hitherto carried out, we have satisfied
 ourselves that the amount of mercury-vapour not swept out by the potas
 sium is quite inappreciable ; and as our object has been in the mean time
 to merely arrive at approximate        results and to perfect our methods of
 manipulation,      we have neglected the minute correction, which, on
 account of that small remnant of mercury, ought, strictly speaking, to
 have been applied to the volume of the vapour as calculated from the
 capacity of the bottle in the cold, the coefficient of expansion of iron, and
 the temperature (1040° Deville) at which the vapour was measured.
    The results of our observations conclusively show that the density of
 potassium-vapour, as produced in the process described, cannot exceed
 45 times that of hydrogen, and that therefore the molecule of potassium
 consists of two atoms (K2).
    We intend to prosecute our research in other directions, proposing to
 ascertain,   if possible, the densities of the iodides of ca;siuin, rubidium,
 and potassium, these being, according to Bunsen's experiments, the most
 volatile of the haloids of the alkali metals.
  II. " On     New Sources of Ethyl- and Methyl-Aniline." By John
        Spiller, F.C.S. Communicated by Dr. Debus, F.R.S. Re
        ceived December 10, 1872.
    In   the process of manufacturing the Hofmann violet by the action of
 ethylic or methylic iodide upon rosaniline or one of its salts, there is al
 ways produced a considerable quantity of a dark-coloured resinous or pitch
 like substance, which has received the name of " Hofmann gum." This
 by-product varies in amount and consistence according to the shade of
 violet   simultaneously    produced    being much more abundant      when the

iodide is employed       in large proportion for the purpose of obtaining the
bluer  shades.     It   has hitherto received no technical application, but ac
cumulates     as a waste     refuse in the Aniline       Dye-Works where Dr. A.
W. Hofmann's        process   is used.
    Whether obtained by the ethylic or methylic reaction, the properties of
this body may be briefly summarized as follows : — It is easily fusible in
boiling water, and very nearly of the same gravity, for it sinks or swims
with the slightest current, being itself all but insoluble in that liquid. In
dilute acids (sulphuric and hydrochloric) it is freely soluble, giving dark-
brown liquids, from which the gum may be again thrown down unchanged
by neutralizing with alkali. Alcohol and benzol dissolve it freely, espe
cially when heated to nearly the boiling temperature ; and glacial acetic
acid likewise holds it in solution, being precipitated, however, on dilution
with water.
    During the past year       a great number    of experiments have been made
upon various descriptions of Hofmann gum, varying in their origin and
quality according to the amount and nature of the iodide concerned in
their production.        The results naturally divide themselves into two series,
according     as they happen to be ethyl or methyl derivatives, but there
appears to be a perfect parallel between the two cases ; and as much in
terest attaches just now to the economical production of methyl-aniline,
the work has rather extended in the direction of the methyl gums.
                                   I
    Without further preface, may state that the object of this note is to
announce the fact that these gums furnish a large quantity of methyl-
aniline by destructive distillation. After the Hofmann gum has been
 kept fused for some time to drive off nearly the whole of the enclosed
water, it is charged into an iron still, either with or without the addition
of roughly powdered charcoal, and then submitted to               a greater heat over
a coke   fire*. An oily body of nauseous odour soon commences to come
over,   and the distillation may be safely carried on until the product
amounts to half the weight of the gum originally employed.                 Small quan
tities of water and ammonia commonly appear, together with a little per
manent     gas ; but practically the oil and residual pitch may be said to be
 the sole resultants of the operation.       This oily body is methyl-aniline, and
when purified by rectification in glass retorts becomes nearly colourless,
 boiling at 200° C, and rising only a few degrees above that point towards
the end of the distillation.        Not only does it possess the peculiar odour
 so characteristic of methyl-aniline, but the oil has the required boiling-
point as stated above, and the remarkable property of forming perma
nently liquid compounds (not crystallizable) with any of the ordinary
acids.    When acted upon with arsenic acid, at or near the boiling-point
of the mixture, it furnishes a violet of somewhat red shade, which may
   * A mixture of pulverized iron borings, kaolin, and syrupy silicate of soda forms an
excellent lute for fixing on the head of the still, as it withstands a high temperature
without softening.

be employed as a dye       ;  and the oil gives colours of various tints -when
treated with other oxidizing agents, according to the usual reactions of
methyl-aniline.      The red-violet from the arsenical melt may, after puri
fication, be converted into the bluer shades by the Hofmann process, when
a new generation of gum is again observed.
   The specific gravity of the methyl-aniline oil has varied a little in dif
ferent operations, but keeps within the ranges of 0'95 and 097.                 It is
probable that this trifling variation may be ascribed to admixtures of di
methyl-aniline, due in part to the introduction of higher methylated pro
ducts into the crude gum employed in these experiments.
   By operating in a similar manner upon the ethyl gums the corresponding
ethyl-aniline has been obtained, the boiling-point of which was higher and
not so definite (205°-210° C.) as in the case of the oil already described.
    By way of conclusion, and as giving further proof towards establishing
the identity of the new oils with ethyl- and methyl-aniline            respectively,
it may    be  stated that    they  fail  to give Girard's  blue  when   heated with
rosolic acid or rosaniline, but take the peculiar course of changing slightly
towards violet, and then suddenly becoming decolorized, — reactions almost
without parallel in the history of the tinctorial aniline derivatives.

       von Willemoes-Suhm, Ph.D., Naturalist to the 'Challenger'
       Exploring-Expedition.              Communicated       by Prof. Wyville

    In lat. 35° 47', long. 8° 23', off Cape St. Vincent, the trawl was sent
down to a depth of 10'JO fathoms on the 28th of January, and brought
up, among other very interesting things, a large transparent Amphipod
 with enormous faceted eyes. The animal, evidently hitherto unknown,
 will be the type of a new genus, having the following characters : —

                           Thaumops pellucidu, n. sp.
 Corpus longitudine 14 mm., latitudine 21 mm., pellucidum.
    An anatomical description of this interesting animal is given, illustrated
 by two plates ; and it is shown that, among the Amphipods known to us,
 Phronima is its nearest relation.      But there are so many points in which
 this genus differs from Phronima, that       it cannot form a member of the
 family Phronimidae ; and      I  therefore propose to establish for it a new
 family, Thaumopidae, belonging to the tribe of Hyperina.
    The form of the head is totally different from that of Phronima ; the
 antenna}    are not situated near the mouth, but at its front, and the
 enormous faceted eyes occupy its upper surface.            The first two pairs of
 thoracic appendages are not, as in Phronima, ambulatory legs, but
 maxillipeds, so that only five pairs of legs are ambulatory in Thaumops.
 The thorax is composed of six segments — the first of which has, on its
underside, the vulva and one pair of maxillipeds ; and the second, re
presenting two segments, bears two pairs of appendages, the larger
maxilliped and the first pair of ambulatory legs. The abdomen consists
of five segments, with three pairs of pedes spurii, the caudal appendages
being attached to the fourth and fifth segments.
    The animal being beautifully transparent, the nervous system could be
carefully worked out without dissecting it ; the position of the nerves
going out from the cephalic ganglion, as well as that of the five pairs of
thoracic and the three pairs of abdominal ganglia, could be ascertained.
The eyes, having at their borders very peculiar appendages, were examined,
and a description is given of the structure of the large crystalline bodies
which are to be seen in them. Organs of hearing and touch have not
been discovered.
    The mouth is covered by a pair of maxillae and a small labium.              There
is a recurved     oesophageal  passage   leading into a largo coocal stomach,
and an intestinal tube departing from near the end of the oesophagus and
running straight to the anus.
    The  heart is an elongated tube extending from the second to the             fifth
segment,    with  probably  three  openings.     Three   pairs of transparent sac
like gills are attached at the base of the second, third, and fourth pairs of
feet.
    Genital organs. — The single specimen taken is a female.              The ovary,
probably composed of       two    ovaries, has    a rose-colour,  and    the   genital
papilla  is situated  at the  under   part of   the  first segment   ; it  is covered
by two small lamellae, which in this case did not sustain the eggs, which
were found to be attached to the first pair of ambulatory legs. The
animal seems to carry them in a manner similar to the pycnogonid
Kymphon.

to undergo no metamorphosis, and that the young ones leave the eggs

    Mode of life. — It could not be made out whether T. pellucida inhabits
the deep sea, or whether it is, like Phronima, a pelagic animal, having
been caught by the         trawl only   as the    latter  came up  from the depths.

            Tomlinson, F.R.S. Received February 10, 1873.
    In the year 1866, M. Gernez and M. Viollette published each a memoir
on supersaturated saline solutions*, in which the same conclusions are
arrived at, namely : — (1) that the only nucleus capable of suddenly crys
tallizing any one of such solutions is a salt of the same kind as that dis
solved ; and (2) that all bodies, solid, liquid, or aeriform, which apparently
act as nuclei, are really contaminated with a hydrate of the salt that forms
the supersaturated solution.
    I cannot    refrain from expressing my admiration at the unwearied skill
and patience with which these two memoirs were prepared.                     The experi
ments were repeated by hundreds, and under a large variety of circum
stances, so that it seems scarcely possible to entertain any doubt as to
the validity of the conclusions arrived at.               I  had not seen these memoirs
until long after the publication of my second paper on this subject t, or
 I  should have hesitated in offering it to the Eoyal Society without spe
cial reference to them.           What    I  did see was a very brief abstract of M.

those of    M. Viollette, and      some of them mere variations, such as the    proof
that bodies greedy of water and capable of being hydrated do not produce
crystallization ; only M. Viollette made use of calcined sulphate of copper
instead of calcic chloride &c.*   Moreover, no fresh proofs are wanted as
to the non-nuclear action of the modified salt or of the anhydrous                  salt
on supersaturated solutions of Glauber's salt.

   Eecently, MM. Gernez t and Viollette have each, on the occasion of
the publication of my third paper (namely, that written in conjunction
with M. Van der Mensbrugghe§), called in question the integrity of my
experiments,      M. Gernez insisting that the oils and other liquids employed
by me contain   salts of the same kind as those of the solutions they
apparently acted on.
   Such an assertion as this seems to me to be very difficult of proof ;
and it seems equally bold to assume that the air of an open garden
in the country contains salts of various kinds, watching their oppor
tunity to get into my flasks and vitiate the results of my experiments.
    Idesire to invite special attention to a statement made in my second
paper ; the more so because, without desiring for a moment to call in
question the negative results obtained by MM. Gernez and Viollette,
namely, that pure oils &c., as used by them, whether in the form of films
or globules, do not cause the solutions to crystallize, the method indicated
opens a new process for ascertaining whether there is really any other
nucleus except a salt of the same kind. The statement referred to is as
follows : —
   " A solution of two
                         parts of Glauber's salt to one part of water was
boiled and filtered into three flasks, which were covered with watch-
glasses and left until the next day. A drop of castor-oil was then placed
upon the surface of each : it formed a lens which gradually flattened ;
but there was no separation of salt, even when the flasks were shaken so
 as to break up the oil into small globules             If, while the flask is
being turned round, a sudden jerk be given to                    it,
                                                      so as to flatten some of
the globules against the side into films, the whole solution instantly be
comes solid"       ||.
 I    desire on the present occasion to describe     number of experiments
                                                                 a
in which this process has been observed. But anticipating the objection
 that the various oils that have been long on my shelves, and already used
 in former experiments, may really contain various kinds of saline nuclei,

 210                           Mr. C. Tomlinson      on             [Mar. 13,
 olive, and sperm.        I
                      did not allow these oils once to enter my laboratory,
 but kept them  in my library, and never opened the phials except in the
 open air.
    The flasks and dropping-tubes were washed in strong sulphuric acid,
 and rinsed in tap-water, the tubes being kept immersed in clean water
 in the open air. The solutions were filtered into the flasks, and these,
 being covered with small beakers, were reboiled until steam issued from
 the orifice.
    The flasks were then taken into my garden, and when cold an oil was
 dropped upon the surface of each solution.       If the oil formed a well-
 shaped  lens, there was no separation of salt ; and  in many cases, instead
 of restoring the small beaker to its place, a well-fitting cork was driven
 into the neck, and the flasks were thus left for a time, on some occasions
 extending to the next day.
   In order to avoid the objection that during the shaking crystallization
 might be produced by some of the solution splashing against the cork,
 many of these experiments were repeated in a pear-shaped flask, nearly
 12 inches in height, and containing about 2 or 3 ounces of the solution.
Most of the experiments were tried in globular flasks of 5 ounces capacity,
with straight cylindrical necks 4 inches high.
   Experiment 1. Sodic sulphate — 1 salt, 1 water.      Solution in tall flask
covered with a small beaker.     Next day oil of sweet almonds was dropped
into     it,
         and the flask corked.    After about an hour circular motion was
                                                           a
given  to the flask, so as to disperse the oil into minute globules through
the solution, giving    the appearance of an emulsion.
                          it                              The flask was left
at rest during about an hour, then suddenly shaken, so as to rattle the
solution against the side, when all at once, as   if with flash,
                                                               a   it became
solid.
     Now in this   case  may be objected that
                          it                  a crystal of the sodic sulphate
hydrate was derived     from  one of the following sources: — (1) from the
air, (2) from the oil, (3) from the cork, or (4) from the side of the flask.
(1) It could not be derived from the air, either of the laboratory or of
the garden, because the solution remained liquid long after the flask had
been corked.   (2) It could not have been derived from the oil, because
this was dispersed through the solution in myriads of globules, without
any nuclear action, and the flask was left to repose for an hour after the
oil had been so dispersed.    (3) Nor could any nucleus have been derived
from the cork, because the solution never touched it. Nor could a mi
nute speck of the sodic sulphate hydrate have fallen from the cork; for the
latter had been put into hot water, out of which      itwas taken the moment
it was put into the flask.   It could not have been derived from any of
the hot water from the cork streaming down the side of the flask to the
solution, because sodic sulphate in solution    is  in the non-nuclear anhy
drous state, and also because two hours had elapsed between the cork
ing of the flask and the solidification of the solution.   (4) A crystal could

not have been derived from the walls of the flask, because the solution
had been briskly boiled in                      it,
                              so that steam escaped with considerable
force from the neck after the small beaker had been put on. Hence
I  am compelled to fall back on my former statement * — namely, that the
oil acted as  nucleus by the flattening of one or more of the globules
                    a
against the wall of the flask into the form of film.
     A
     globular flask, containing the same solution and the same oil, was
corked, and the oil dispersed in globules.  It was left some hours, with
occasional shaking, so as to rattle the solution against the side. The
rattling motion was purposely less energetic than in the former case,
to avoid splashing against the cork.       This solution crystallized after
it had been left    short time at rest and
                         a                     did so in large flat crystals,

described in my second paper, very different from the minute radial ac
tion noticed when crystallization sets in from point t.                  a
   A similar flask, containing the same solution, was treated with oil of
bergamot,    drop of which was allowed to trickle down the side of the
                  a
flask.  As soon as the oil touched the solution, crystallization set in,
the radiant-point coinciding with such point of contact, and the whole
surface was covered with fine lines diverging from this point alone.
   In another case drop of the oil of rosemary was deposited on the
                               a
centre of the solution.     On shaking the flask, the solution assumed the
solid state.

answer my present purpose — namely, to show that some supersaturated
saline solutions really do crystallize under the action of other nuclei than
a salt of the same kind as that of the solution operated on.
  My experiments were performed in the open air, at temperatures be
tween 30° and50° F. At comparatively low temperatures the shaking of
the flask containing the solution sometimes produced a copious liberation
of anhydrous salt, which rapidly combines with water and forms the

7-atom hydrate
it generally happens that the solution becomes solid, and the 7-atom salt
opaque white.
    I
    may perhaps be allowed to state that my experiments, conducted as
they were in the open air, were delayed by the rainy weather of last year.
There    however, this advantage in wet weather, that the saline particles
           is,
said to exist in the air are washed down and brought into solution, in
which condition they are not nuclear, as   have already shown in the case

      Seeing, then, that in the case of sodic sulphate, which is said to be
  always present in the air of rooms, and, according to MM. Gernez and
  Yiollette, even in that of the country, the chances are that it is most
  likely to be present either in the effloresced condition or in solution,
  and equally non-nuclear in both,        I  cannot help thinking that too much
  importance has been given to this part of the subject; for if it be
  true, we are reduced to the dilemma, pointed out by JV1. Jeannel *, that
 there must be floating in the air specimens of all kinds of salts that form
 supersaturated solutions and crystallize by the introduction of a solid
 nucleus ; whereas there are some such salts which cannot exist in the pre
 sence of the oxygen or of the ammonia of the air.
 II. " Visible       Direction : being an Elementary Contribution to
        the Study of Monocular and Binocular Vision." By James
        Jago, M.D. Oxon., A.B. Cantab., F.R.S. Received February
         12, 1873.
                                      (Abstract.)
     It is a well-known fact that when the eye has been displaced in its
 socket,   as, for instance, by the tip of the finger applied to the eyeball
through the eyelid, all objects seen by it deviate from their true direc
 tions ; and the author's mode of proceeding in this paper is to inquire
 whether visual deviations that may be observed in arbitrary, but
 methodically devised, displacements of the eyeball in its socket follow
any law, and then to consider how far the results thus derived are con
formable with other monocular and binocular experiences, and how far
they may be available in the explanation of certain phenomena that have
been deemed anomalous in physiological optics.
     Having pointed out means by which the ball may be easily displaced in
any direction, he draws attention to the fact that, when by such means
the apparent directions of objects seen by the eye are made to deviate from
their true directions through fully 30°, the orbital muscles so fully retain
their command over the movements of the eyeball, that that point in the
visual field which was painted on the point of direct sight in the centre
of the foramen centrale retinae still continues to be there painted. He
shows this to happen whatever be the direction in which the eyeball is
displaced in its orbit.
     This fact being a fundamental one in the inquiry he has in hand, he puts
it to nicer tests still.
     He adjusts the two eyes, when equally displaced so as to cause objects
to deviate greatly from their true directions, to look awhile at the top of
a high object     in the open air, and having obtained            a strong spectrum  of
this object in the retinai,    he, with the released       eyes, looks    at an appro-

 priate mark on a grey wall, and finds that the spectrum really has its
 margin across the point of direct sight ; and he tries other experiments
 in corroboration.
    Also by agitating    a pin-hole in a card across the eye when looking at
 such a high object, he brings the retina into view, and sees that the point
of direct sight is visibly within the foramen centrale retinae, as made visible
by the shadow of the wall that bounds the foramen.          He indicates other
 means of proving the same fact.
    He gathers from a series of experiments that the mastery of the orbital
muscles over such movements of the eyeball as are requisite for pointing
the optic axis to its objective point, is practically unimpaired by such
shiftings of the eyeball in its socket as have been described.
    He then proceeds to show that the regulating duties of the orbital
muscles, when the eyeball is displaced in its orbit, are not only fulfilled
as to the rotation    of the optic axis about a central point, but as to the
rotation of the eyeball about this axis. To make experiments to this end,
we must have another subjectively visible retinal spot besides the foramen
centrale ; and this we negatively have in the punctum ca>cum, or at the
base of the optic nerve.
   A diagram is devised by which we may manage that one point of it
shall be seen by the direct sight of both eyes, whilst another point is found
to fall in the middle of the blind spot of one eye ; and the diagram is
examined by this eye when this has been pushed from its orbital place
upwards, downwards, inwards, and outwards, and in various oblique
directions, besides when more or less twisted on its axis ; and thus it is
demonstrated     that what happened with the point of direct sight in the
retina happens equally surely for every other retinal point — that under
all these displacements the orbital muscles do not forfeit their control of
the eyeball, but so regulate its movements that the different points of the
field of vision remain constantly painted on the same retinal points.
   From these and other methodically continued experiments, he draws
the general inference, that if the centre of the foramen centrale retinse
be forced at any instant from its position by any sort of manipu
lation, and then made to describe a circle round its first position of ease
whilst the optic axis has never ceased to remain parallel to its first direc
tion (that is,   has   generated a cylinder in revolving), the axis of the
seeming field of vision will have so revolved as to have generated a cone,
whose apex is posterior to the retina in the first or undisturbed direction
of the optic axis.      The like might have been said of any other normal
to the retina, the axis of the base of the optic nerve, for instance, were it
accessible to light ; whilst a twisting retinal movement about a fixed axis
twists the seeming field of vision.
    If the optic axis revolve so as to generate a cone whose apex is in front
of the eye, the axis of the seeming field may, according to circumstances,
generate a cylinder, or a more acute cone enclosing the other.

   Conversely, the parallax of the visual field being noted, we can assign
the retinal displacements that have produced them.
     Should      undue contraction              of any orbital muscle, or discordant       con
tractions of the orbital muscles, engender visual parallaxes, we may as
safely judge from these parallaxes of the retinal displacements that
must have been induced, as                  if they had    been due to manipulation    of the
eyeball.
  In these summarized conclusions we have the means of solving highly
important problems in physiological optics.
   It is found that sensation, or the function of responding to objective
light, is exclusively resident in the retinal elements of the bacillar layer,
but that the visual functions   of the retina extend no further ; for it has
been evinced in manifold      experiments that when the axes of all the
pencils of objective light which concur in imaging a picture upon the
retina are normals to its surface, any point in the picture may be perceived
as lying in successive directions, forming very variable angles with and
round about its normal.       The retina cannot inform us of the visible
direction of any point painted on its surface.
   This being so, there is no alternative but to seek for a solution of the
mystery in the structure out of which the retina proceeds, for the pro
perty in question is plainly inherent in the visual nervous apparatus.
  The author recalls that he had long ago pointed out that, though the
optic nerve in its orbital course and its fibres in their retinal course
are obnoxious to mechanical  pressure, no visual sensation can be im
mediately produced by such pressure on nerve-trunks or branches. Sen
sation can only be produced by pressure through the sclerotic by affecting
the rods and cones of the bacillar layer, and then only when the flexure of
the retina crowds together the internal (as to the eye) ends of the bacillar
elements.   He cites his former words : — " When we turn in the dark the
eyeballs sharply, or even mildly, a couple of white circular rings, brighter at
one margin than the other, enclosing a paler area with a central dark spot,
flash forth, the diameter extending an angle of several degrees
The phenomenon is plainly the result of flexure of the retina where the
nerve runs into           it,
                    as the eye    pulled round in its socket until
                                                is                    drags           it

The absence of the tough and dense sclerotic where the nerve penetrates
it,as well as of the choroid, indicates how readily the nerve must yield to
the slightest traction.
   In these previously recorded facts the author feels assured that he
had, unwittingly, provided himself with    key to the secret of visible
                                                             a
direction.
      For   it   has been shown            by
                                diversified experiments that whenever there
is  parallax in visible direction

tion upon the nerve-stem, tending to carry its distal extremity that way.
The " white circular rings, brighter at one margin than the other," have
been instanced as proclaiming that such traction cannot occur without
flexure between the nerve-stem and the eye-apple, which displays itself
at the junction of the optic disk with the surrounding retinal expansion.
In    other words, under the concordant action of the orbital muscles, all   the
movements of the globe are so equably coordinated that the nerve-stem is
never subjected to unwonted traction, and consequently always emerges
through the ocular tissues to open out into the retina as a normal to their
surfaces, in which case no visual parallax appears.  But no sooner is there
lateral traction than the axis of the emergent nerve-stem, or of the optic
disk, deviates from the said normality ; and were that disk impressible
by objective light, its central point would deviate in the same direction,
and an equal deviation in visible direction would be associated with every
other point in the visual field.
   Hence we are fairly landed upon the conclusion that visible direction,
which has already been tracked backwards to the optic nerve, is a function
 of its terminal direction, being identical with it at the centre of the optic
 disk, both in the equable use of the eye and in the unequable.
    Finally, it is clear that if the eyeball be twisted round the axis of the
 optic disk the terminal portion of the nerve will be twisted in the same
 direction; and thus the opposite twisting of the visible field in certain ex
periments related are explicable by the same hypothesis — an hypothesis
that accounts for all the phenomena of visible direction, whether regular
or irregular.
    Whenever the inverted retinal image, by means of nervous arrangement,
is reinverted, an erect image is seemingly projected, if not from, by means
of the base of the optic nerve.
    The principles here arrived at, when applied to binocular vision, lead
to the observation of phenomena that have not been before put on
record.
•   Wheatstone,   in his classic paper in the Philosophical Transactions,
wherein he announces his discovery of the stereoscope and expounds its
theory, only speaks of stereoscopic vision from two perspectives, an appro
priate one for each eye, when (no instrument being used) the optic axes meet
each other beyond them, or have previously intersected, so that each eye sees
the other's perspective — that      in all experiments by him and other
                                        is,
subsequent writers on the subject the optic axes have always been supposed
to intersect or to lie in one plane.

optic axes beyond them, they yield a hollow pyramid, and when looked at
by a previous decussation of these axes yield a solid pyramid. But these
perspectives are placed so that the one which was at the left has the
one that was at the right immediately underneath                  it,
                                                   with about half an
inch of plain paper between them.

                                                               we can put
the under perspective immediately upon the upper one seen with the
other eye, and thus realize the hollow pyramid    or by placing the finger

upon the top of the left eye, we can depress the upper perspective to
cover the under one, and thus realize the solid pyramid.   The first pyra
mid depends from the plane of the paper, the second stands upon it.
  By   means of    finger under one eye and another upon the other, we
                      a
can obtain either hollow or solid pyramids anywhere between the two
perspectives   or by

   In all these cases the optic axes do not intercept each other, but the
axes of visible direction (functional of the final directions of the optic

       Hygiene, Netley Medical School.            Received February 26,
       1873.
   All  organized beings exhibit both structural and functional conditions,
forming the grounds of comparison by which natural affinities, in smaller
groups, and points of difference in larger ones, are detected and esta
blished in systematic classification.
   General    anatomical  or physiological considerations in agreement are
usually of more importance than the harmony of single or special condi
tions of either description ; and though structural characters, as a rule,
are superior to those of a functional nature, much may be learnt from an
arrangement founded on physiological principles alone.     I have elsewhere
pointed out the deceptiveness of taking the habit of life as a guide in
classification, though this is adopted by many zoologists ; for essentially
different types may live under precisely similar circumstances, or the
habit of life may be very different in the members of the same type.
Thus, if we look upon a pectinate gill for aquatic respiration, fluviatile or
marine, and the amphibious coincidence of this with a pulmonary
chamber, or the presence of the latter cavity alone in purely terrestrial
Gasteropods, as grouping characters, nothing can be more erroneous ;
for all these conditions of the respiratory system are to be met with in
unequivocal examples of the same group, anatomically defined, as in the
Nerite alliance, or that of Rissoa for example. Nevertheless animals so
simple in their nature as the Protozoa may be distributed physiologically,
with some show of truthfulness, in the resulting scheme.
    Passing the leading types of the Protozoa in review, we notice that
the Gregarinidao alone are essentially parasitic in their habit of life,
obtaining nutriment from materials elaborated by other animals.           All
the rest are therefore non-parasitic, deriving their sustenance from the
 outer world.      If  we now consider the manner in which nutritious
matters are taken up and assimilated by these animals, we find that
 some of them must subsist on organic substances in solution, which are
absorbed by the general surface of the body.          Moreover we observe
 that this takes place either indirectly through a more or less consistent

    investing substance, or directly through the pores, foramina, or fenestra
    tions   of the calcareous or siliceous capsules protecting the contained
   sarcode-bodies.        In other instances, on the contrary, solid food is actually
   consumed by mouthless beings, which simply open their bodies to receive
   it; and this opening of the body may take place at any part of the
   surface most convenient, or it may be restricted to a definite locality,
   shadowing forth the permanent mouth of the Stomatoda, or even that of
   the most     primitive form of Hydrozoa.

      This Table may be said to afford us good general grounds for forming
 an estimate of the relative superiority of the several types thus physio
 logically defined, and it is mainly in keeping with their more commonly
received distribution founded on structural                 particulars.
      A   show of progressive improvement is seen in the respective sections
A, B, and C, though to all appearance the simplest group of animals in
existence, namely the Monera of Hackel, is included in the section B.
These rudimentary creatures are destitute of both nucleus and contractile
vesicle, though exhibiting activities in movement, taking food, and repro
ducing their kind, not even second to those of Amoeba and its allies. The
smallest ciliated molecule endowed with animal life could not present a
more simple structure than that of the perfectly homogeneous and jelly
like Monera.          Indeed the evolution of any of the other primitive forms
from a plastic source like this is quite conceivable, though of course we
have no actual means of observing such a transmutation.
     Moreover the development of ameeboids in some part of the life-
history of most Protozoa would appear to stamp that form as the
                                                                                t 2

earliest genetic type of beings.      With the exception of a nucleus and a
contractile vesicle, Amoeba itself may have sprung from Protanweba • and
the finally encysted jelly-globules of Protomyxa and Myxastrum breaking
up    into naked amceboids, or pseudonavicellae liberating them, very
strikingly suggest the source from which the Oreyarinw may have been
evolved.
    The valuable researches of Mr. Archer, of Dublin, have brought to
light many very interesting freshwater Protozoa, thus much augmenting
our materials for comparison, and adding new zest to inquiry as to their
natural affinities or their probable origin and derivatives.
    If evolutionary forces are admitted to be in constant operation, it
would be hard to say that any two existing forms should stand to each
other in the relation of source and product.       It would perhaps be safer
to say that existing forms have taken their origin from such forms as are
 still in existence ; for as it is but reasonable to suppose that in the
lapse of time all the members of the primary type must have undergone
 some change, the persistence of that type through all in its primitive
 state is difficult to conceive, though, for any thing we yet know, this may
be the case.
    Without indulging in this theme further, if we now seek for the most
 probable derivatives of definite types of Protozoa, some remarkable facts
 strike us first in relation to the cestoid worms as bearing upon their
 possible derivation from the Gregarinidae.       I  have already noticed the
 affinity of the Gregarinians themselves to Protomyxa and Myxastrum
 amongst the Monera ; but when we find the hooklets of Tcenia and the
 sucker-pits of Tosnia and Bothryoetphalus shadowed forth in Hoplo-
 rhynchus and Actinoctphalus respectively, we can scarcely help acknow
 ledging the alliance here indicated.    In the Gregarinidae, moreover, there
 is not only a distinct external integument, but Van Beneden has lately
 demonstrated      the existence   of circular muscular   fibres on its  inner
 surface  ; a similar   habit of life in both cases is also very significant.
 Nor   would it be inconsistent to regard the Trematoda and Nematoidea as
 further developments of the same series of essentially internal parasites.
    Now, although the Thalassieollida> are not parasites, the genus Tlialassi-
 eolla and the Oregarina alone of all the simple Protozoa take up their nutri
 ment in solution, after the manner of the compound forms, namely the
                                                                    I
 Porifera, restricted Polycystina, and Foraminifera. This fact, think, is
 significant, as suggesting the derivation of Gregarina from some such
 original as Thalassicolla, as it does not seem natural to suppose that the
 former, which is so essentially an Entozoon, could have been descended
 from a stock capable of assuming solid food in the outer world.
    Dr. Carpenter unconsciously gives us the weight of his opinion in the
 following quotations     from his valuable work on the microscope.         On
 page 449 he says, speaking of Sphcerozoum,
                                                " Towards the inner surf ace of
 this (the outer) coat are scattered a great number of oval bodies resembling

    1873.]          the Invertebrata in relation to Evolution.                 221
   cells, having a tolerably distinct membraniform wall and a conspicuous
   round central     nucleus, thus corresponding closely with the Gregarina
  type."     I  might mention in passing that, having frequently taken in
  the towing-net the unequivocal allies of Dktyocha with sarcode bodies
  identical with those of Sphcerozoum,         I  have no hesitation in assuming
  Dictyocha itself to belong rather to the Thalassicollidae than to the group
  with which it is more usually associated. This family is commonly
  included under the bead of Ehizopoda ; and there can be no doubt that
  the generalization, irrespective of that term, is a correct one; but it is a
  stretch of transcendental anatomy to speak of the existence of pseudo-
  podia in any member of it. The radiating branched filaments within the
  dense external investment of Thahissicolla nucleate are not extensions of
  the sarcode-body, like those of Gromia for example, but apparently act as
 retinacula, and as conduits for dialytic currents, which may account for
 the phenomenon of cyclosis observed in some instances.
     Professor James-Clark, of Pennsylvania, appears to have satisfied him
 self, at least, that there is a remarkable agreement of characters exhibited
 between the Porifera and the Infusoria, which are connected, as he
 endeavours to show, by a regular gradation of animals.             The derivation
 of the latter group of Protozoa from the former, which              I had myself
 assumed quite independently, is therefore supported by that gentleman's
 researches.
     Even with our present advanced knowledge of the Infusoria it is
 doubtful if we do not still include amongst them the larvae of Turbellaria;
 and, indeed, the     passage   from the one type to the other would appear to
 be natural and easy.        On the other hand, tracing through such forms as
 Nemertes, Bonellia,    and   Priapulus, Sipunculus will lead directly to the
less equivocal Echinodermata         ;   and here the series must     wind up, for
 further evolution, though perhaps possible, does not appear to have
taken place.
     The existence of such low or simple forms of Eotifera as the genus
Astplanchna,      for example, would        be  favourable to   the idea that the
Noctilucidae might have been the progenitors of that order of beings. It
is of course quite gratuitous, but convenient, at present to assume that
the iNoctilucidae would thus hold the same relationship to the Polycystina
that the Infusoria appear to do to the Porifera. However this may be,
it is more certain that the Eotifera are at the root of the annulose and
articulate series.
     From    the Eotifera, through     the Annelida, we may thus trace the de
velopment of the crustaceous           and chitinous types of Articulata like a
dichotomous branch.
     The Annelida may         be linked with the Crustacea by means of the
Sagittidae, whose exquisitely striped muscular fibres accord to them a
higher position than the other parts of their organization would perhaps
warrant them to take.

    There    is obviously a representative relationship between the crusta-
ceous     Macrura, Anomura, and Brachyura and the chitinous Myriopoda,
Insecta, and Arachnida.
     The earthworms and the leeches may help to fill up the gap between
the Chsetopod Annelida and the Myriopoda (as, for example, between the
genera Geophilxts and Nereis), though it must be confessed that the exist
ing links are inadequate, or they have never been sufficiently made out.
     The first rudiments of a tracheal system are probably to be sought for
in the Terricolous Annelida, though true articulated limbs and a dorsal
heart seem to make their first appearance in the Iulidaj.
     Should the simplest hydroid polyps have sprung from Buch Protozoa
as Diffluijia, Arcella, or Astrorhizct, with their pseudopodial tentacula
encircling a fixed oral point, the existence of a living series from the
k> .vest type of animals to that which is obviously on the confines of the
Vertebrata would be clearly demonstrable*.                      Furthermore, as the inter
polation of any other invertebrate types would disturb the harmony
here, the inference is natural that they also might be distributed in a
 similar way into as many groups or series as their affinities or anti
pathies would suggest or necessitate.
     Having studied this subject very carefully, it appears to me that the
whole of the Invertebrata admit of distribution into four distinct series,
corresponding with the number of sections of the Protozoa, from which
all the other types may have taken their origin.                     Thus, on dividing the
Astomatous Protozoa into compound types and their allied simple forms,
we obtain the following highly suggestive arrangement, in which the
groups represent each other so remarkably that they would seem to be
 quite natural.      I   have appended the Stomatodaand the twelve remaining
sections of the Invertebrata in the order indicated by their affinities.

    So as not to complicate the Table,           I   thought it better to supplement
it with the definition of the four leading types of compound Protozoa.
    1.  In   the Collosphaera type, the sarcode-bodies lie at some distance
apart and are always distinct.
    2. In the Porifera type the sarcode-bodies are closely approximated or
confluent.
    3. In the Polycystina type the sarcode-bodies are concentric and con
nected by radiating stolons.
    4. In the Foraminifera type the sarcode-bodies are connected by
stolons in linear series or some order of juxtaposition.
    If  it is incumbent upon the developmental hypothesis to derive the
Vertebrata from the preexisting Invertebrata, the only line through
which it would be possible to trace their descent is that leading from the
Protozoa to the Mollusca proper, or the fourth series of the Table. It
would also appear that the Entozoa, Echinodermata, and Articulata
appertain severally to separate series of their own ; and whatever may
happen by-and-by, it would be difficult to find, in the present fauna of
the globe, a single form clearly deducible from any of them.
   The habit of life of the Entozoon, the peculiarity of structure of the
Echinoderm, and the very perfection of organization of the Articulata, as
it were, preclude their evolution into any other existing type. To use a
common phrase, they may be said to lead nowhere, though they may be
easily and,     I   think, consistently traced back to their possible origin in
the Protozoa.
   It  would be great presumption to say that even an approach to perfec
tion had been attained in this attempted classification of a whole sub-
kingdom of animals. Nevertheless in the preceding Table the relationships
existing amongst the members of that subkingdom are presented to the
eye  at  a single glance, and     in  a manner that would       be quite unattainable
by systems maintaining the original creation of every so-called species,
and that in an order perhaps more easily described than understood.

       1873.
    For more reasons than one we may, perhaps, now look back with
 advantage upon the friendly controversy carried on rather more than a
 century ago between the learned and generous Abbe Spallanzani and our
 no less distinguished         countryman       Turberville Needham.              Writing
 concerning his own relation to Needham, the Abbe said*,                        I
                                                                             " wish to
 deserve his esteem        whilst combating his opinion"; and, in accordance
 with this sentiment, we fiud him treating his adversary's views with
 great respect, and at the same time repudiating much of the empty and
idle criticism in which so many of Needham's contemporaries indulged
with regard to his work. This criticism, Spallanzani sayst, " Without
looking into details, contented itself by throwing doubt upon                     some  of
the facts, and by explaining after its own fashion others whose possi
bility it was willing to admit."          He moreover warmly reprobated the
ignorant and disrespectful statements made by an anonymous writer who
had shown himself little worthy of being heard upon the subjects in
                                                                          "
dispute. Spallanzani on this occasion very wisely said J: — When it is a
question concerning observations and experiments, it is necessary to
have repeated them with much circumspection                     before venturing to
pronounce that they are doubtful or untrustworthy. He who will
allow himself to speak of them with contempt, and who can only
attempt to refute them with writings composed by the glimmer derived
from a treacherous lamp, will not find himself in a condition to retain
the esteem of learned men."          The anonymous writer (in his ' Lettres a
un Americain'), to whom Spallanzani referred, had gone so far as to
doubt the statements of Needham as to the constant appearance of
organisms in infusions which had been previously boiled, and also
intimated    that even if they were to be found, it was only because they
had been enabled to resist the destructive influence of the boiling fluid.
This latter assertion was emphatically denied by Spallanzani, his
denial   being based      upon a most extensive series of experiments ¦with
eggs in great variety and with seeds of all degrees of hardness ; these
were all found to be killed by a very short contact with boiling water.
Spallanzani had thoroughly satisfied himself that even very thick-coated
seeds could not resist this destructive agent ; whilst he thought that the

 idea, entertained        by some, of the eggs of the lowest infusoria being
 protected    from    the  injurious influence of the boiling water by reason of
 their extreme minuteness, was a supposition so improbable as scarcely to
 deserve serious consideration.            Such a notion was, he thought, wholly
 opposed to what was known concerning the transmission                          of heat.
 Whilst, therefore, the opinion of those who believe that eggs have the
 power of resisting the destructive influence of boiling water could be
 fully refuted, Spallanzani thought it by no means followed that the
 infusoria which always, after a very short time, appeared in boiling
 infusions had arisen independently of the existence of eggs.                          The
 infusions being freely exposed to the air, it was very possible that                  this
 air had introduced eggs into the fluids, which by their development                   had
 given birth to the infusoria*.
    After the lapse of a century it has at last been clearly shown that                this
 supposition     of aerial contamination         advanced by Spallanzani (warrant
 able and natural         as it was at the time) is one which, in the great
 majority of     cases, is devoid    of all foundation in fact, so far as concerns
the organisms essentially associated with processes of putrefaction, viz.
 Bacteria and Vibriones.          The means of proving this statement, based
 upon independent observations made by Professor Burdon Sanderson and
myself, were recently submitted to the consideration of the Royal
 Society  f.    Before     the reading of this communication            I  was under the
 impression that        almost every one of those who had taken part in the
 controversies which had been carried on both here and abroad concerning
the Origin of Life were prepared to admit, as Spallanzani had done, that
the eggs or germs of such organisms as appear in infusions were unable
to survive when the infusions containing them were raised to the
temperature at which water boils.                 This impression was produced in
part by the explicit statements on this subject that had been made by
very many biologists, and also in part by a comparatively recent and
authoritative       confirmation    which this view as to the destructive          effects
of boiling infusions upon Bacteria            had received.       Little more than two
years ago Professor Huxley, as President of the British Association
for the Advancement of Science, recorded experiments in his Inaugural
Address which were obviously based upon this belief as a starting-point ;
and subsequently, in one of the Sectional Meetings, after referring to some
of my experiments, and to the fact that all unmistakably vital movements
ceased after Bacteria had been boiled, Professor Huxley addedj : —
                                                                                        " I

    226                   Prof. H. C. Bastian on the Heat                       [Mar. 20,
   observers who have supposed they have found Bacteria surviving after
   boiling have made the mistake which           I  should have done at one time, and,
   in fact,  have confused the       Brownian movements with true living             move
   ments." Some eminent biologists do not now (in reference to the experi
   ments cited in my last communication) suggest that the organisms found
   in the infusions were dead and had              been    there before the fluids were
   boiled  :  they express doubts concerning that which seems formerly to
  have been regarded as established, and now wish for evidence to show that
  the germs of Bacteria and Vibriones are killed in a boiling infusion of
  hay or turnip, as they have been proved to be in
                                                                   " Pasteur's Solution     "
  and in solutions containing ammonic tartrate and sodic phosphate.
      With the view of removing this last source of doubt more effectuallv,
  and also of refuting the unwarrantable* conclusion of M. Pasteur, to the
  effect that the germs of Bacteria and Vibriones are not killed in neutral
  or slightly alkaline fluids at a temperature of 212° F.,                I almost imme
  diately after the reading of my last communication commenced a fresh
  series of experiments.
      Nearly two years ago, in my ' Modes of Origin of Lowest Organisms,'
  I   brought forward evidence to show that Bacteria, Vibriones, and their
  supposed germs are killed at a temperature of 140° F. (60° C.) in neutral
  or very faintly acid solutions containing ammonic tartrate and sodic phos
 phate, and also evidence tending to show that these living units were
 killed in neutral infusions of hay and in acid infusions of turnip at the
  same temperature.
      The crucial evidence adduced concerning the degree of heat destructive
 to Bacteria, Vibriones, and their germs, in the saline solution, was of
 this nature.       The solution had    been shown       to be incapable of engendering
 Bacteria and Vibriones (under all ordinary conditions) after it had been
 boiled, although it still continued capable of supporting the life and
 encouraging the rapid multiplication of any of these organisms which were
 purposely added to it.           Some of this boiled solution, therefore, was
 introduced into flasks previously washed with boiling water ; and when
 the fluids had sufficiently cooled, that of each flask was inoculated with
living Bacteria and Vibriones — in the proportion of one drop of a fluid
 quite turbid with these organisms to one fluid ounce of the clear saline
 solutiont.      These mixtures containing an abundance of living organisms
were then heated to various temperatures, ranging from 122° F. (50° C.) to
167°F. (75° C.) ; and it was invariably found that those which had been

  those   which had been raised             to 140° F. or upwards         as invariably
 remained clear and unaltered.               The turbidity in the first series having
  been ascertained       to be due to the enormous multiplication of Bacteria and
  Vibriones, and      it being a well-established fact that such organisms when
 undoubtedly       living always rapidly multiply in these fluids, the conclusion
 seemed almost inevitable that the organisms and their germs must have
 been killed in the flasks which were briefly subjected to the temperature
 of 140° F.       How else are we to account for the fact that these fluids
 remained quite unaltered although             living organisms were added to them
 in the same         proportion as they had been to those less-heated fluids
 which had so rapidly become turbid -? Even if there does remain the mere
 possibility that the organisms and their supposed germs had not actually
 been killed, they were certainly              so far damaged as to be unable to
 manifest any vital characteristics.            The heat had, at all events, deprived
 them of their powers of growth and multiplication ; and these gone, so

of 140° F. enables us to draw            just the  same conclusions from other expe
riments, as      if    such a temperature had produced a demonstrably actual
death*.       Seeing also that these saline solutions were inoculated with
a   fluid  in which Bacteria and Vibriones were multiplying rapidly, we
had a     right to infer that they were multiplying in their accustomed
manner, " as much by the known method of fission, as by any unknown
and assumed method of reproduction."                   So that, as  I at the time saidt,
"
   These experiments seem to show, therefore, that even if Bacteria do
multiply by means of invisible gemmules, as well as by the known
process of fission, such invisible            particles possess no higher power of
resisting     the destructive        influence of heat than the parent Bacteria
themselves      possess."
    This is,   in fact, by far the most satisfactory kind of evidence that              can
be   produced concerning the powers of resisting heat enjoyed by Bacteria
and Vibriones, because it also fully meets the hypothesis as to their
possible    multiplication by invisible gemmules possessed of a greater power
of    resisting heat, and because no mere inspection by the microscope of
dead     Bacteria       can  entitle   us positively    to affirm that they are dead,
even though all characteristically vital or
                                                       " true living " movements

be absent.
    Facts of a very similar nature were mentioned in the same work
strongly tending to show that Bacteria and Vibriones are also killed at
the same temperature           in other fluids, such as infusions of hay or turnip.
These     facts were referred to in the following statement^ : — " Thus, if on

 the same slip, though under different covering-glasses, specimens of a
 hay-infusion turbid with Bacteria are mounted, (a) without being heated,
 (b) after the fluid has been raised to 1 22° F. for ten minutes, and (c) after
 the fluid has been heated to 140° F. for ten minutes, it will be found that
 in the course of    a few days the Bacteria    under a and    b  have notably
 increased in quantity, whilst those under c    do not become more numerous,
 however long the slide is kept.    Facts of the same kind are observable
 if a turnip-infusion containing living Bacteria is experimented with ; and
 the phenomena are in no way different if a solution of amnionic tartrate
 and sodic phosphate (containing Bacteria) be employed instead of one of
 these vegetable infusions.     The multiplication of the Bacteria beneath
 the covering-glass, when it occurs, is soon rendered obvious, even to the
naked eye, by the increasing cloudiness of the film."
     The facts just cited concerning the behaviour of thin films of turbid
infusions which had heen heated to different        temperatures gave me the
 clue as to the proper direction of future work. It would seem that,
 when mounted in the manner described, such thin films of infusion
 continue capable of supporting and favouring the multiplication of any
 already existing Bacteria and Vibriones, although under such conditions
 no new birth of living particles appears to take place even in these
 fluids.   The question then arose as to whether, by subjecting larger
 quantities of the same infusions to any particular sets of conditions, we
 could ensure that     they also should continue to manifest the same
properties   ; because if so, it would be almost as easy to determine the
death-point of Bacteria and Vibriones when exposed to heat in these
infusions, as it had been to determine it for the saline solutions already
mentioned.
    It was pointed out by Gruithuisen early in the present century, that
many infusions, otherwise very productive, ceased to be so when they
were poured into a glass vessel whilst boiling, and when this was filled
so that    the tightly fitting stopper touched the fluid.       Having myself
proved the truth of this assertion for hay-infusion, it seemed likely that,
                                                  I
by having recourse to a method of this kind, should be able to lower the
virtues of boiled hay- and turnip-infusions to the level of those possessed
by the boiled saline solution with which      I  had previously experimented
— that is, to reduce them to a state in which, whilst they appear (under
these conditions) quite unable of themselves to engender Bacteria or
 Vibriones, they continue well capable of favouring the rapid multiplication
of such organisms.
    This was found to     be the case;   and  I   have accordingly performed
upwards of one hundred experiments         with inoculated portions of these
two infusions raised to different temperatures.        The mode in which the
experiments were conducted was as follows :       —
    Infusions of hay and turnip of slightly different strengths were
employed.      These infusions, having been first loosely strained through

1873.]               necessary    to  kill Bacteria, Vibriones, §c.                229
muslin, were boiled for about ten or fifteen                minutes,  and then whilst
boiling strained through            ordinary Swedish filtering-paper into a glass
beaker which         had previously been well rinsed with boiling water.              A
number of glass bottles or tubes were also prepared, which, together
with their stoppers or corks, had been boiled in ordinary tap water for
a few minutes*.           They were taken out full of the boiling fluid ; and the
stoppers    or  corks    being at once inserted, the vessels and their contents
were set aside to cool. When the filtered infusion of hay or turnip
had been rapidly cooled down to about 110° F. (by letting the beaker
containing it stand in a large basin of cold water), it was inoculated
with some of a turbid infusion of hay swarming with active Bacteria
and Vibriones —in the proportion of one drop of the turbid fluid to each
fluid ounce of the now clear filtered infusiont.                 The beaker was then
placed upon       a   sand-bath,   and  its contained   fluid (in which a thermometer
was immersed) gradually raised to the required temperature.                  The fluid
was maintained at the same temperature for five minutes by alternately
raising the beaker from and replacing it upon the sand-bath. The bottles
to be used were then one by one uncorked, emptied, and refilled to the
brim with the heated inoculated fluidj. The corks or stoppers were at
once very tightly pressed down, so as to leave no air between them and
the surface of the fluids. The beaker was then replaced upon the sand-
bath and the gas turned on more fully, in order that the experimental
fluid might be rapidly raised to a temperature 9° F. (5° C.) higher than
it  had been before.           After five minutes' exposure to this temperature
other bottles were filled in the same manner, and so on for the various
temperatures the influence of which it was desired to test.
    Thus prepared, the bottles and tubes have been exposed during the day
to a temperature ranging from 65° to 75° F. And generally one had
not to wait long in order to ascertain what the results were to be. In
some cases, if the contents of the vessels were to become turbid, this
was more or less manifest after an interval of forty-eight hours ; in
other cases, however, the turbidity manifested itself three or more days
later : the reason of this difference will be fully discussed in a subsequent
communication          .
    For   the sake of simplicity and brevity, the necessary particulars con
cerning the 102 experiments have been embodied in the following Table: —
   * The   vessels    employed  have varied in capacity from two drachms to four ounces ;
some have been provided with glass stoppers and others with very tightly fitting corks ;
and the latter   I  find have answered quite as well as the former. On the wholo  I have
found tightly corked one-ounce phials to be about the most convenient vessels to employ
in these inoculation experiments.
   f  It was found desirable to filter the infusions after they had been boiled, because
the boiling generally somewhat impaired their clearness.
   { At this stage, of course, very great care is needed in order to avoid all chance of
accidental contamination either with living organisms or with unheated fragments or
particles of organic matter.

    The experimental results above tabulated seem naturally divisible into
three groups. Thus, when heated only to 131° F., all the infusions became
turbid within two days, just as the inoculated saline solutions had done*.
Heated to 158° F. all the inoculated organic infusions remained clear, as
had been the case with the saline solutions in my previous experiments
when heated to 140°      F.    There remains, therefore, an intermediate heat
zone (ranging from a little below 140° to a little below 158° F.) after an
 exposure to which the inoculated organic infusions are apt to become
more slowly turbid, although inoculated saline solutions raised to the
same temperatures      invariably remain unaltered.          The full explanation of
these apparent anomalies         I  propose    to make     the   subject of a future
communication to the Koyal Society ; meanwhile we may quite safely
conclude that Bacteria, Vibriones, and their supposed germs are either
actually killed or else completely deprived of their powers of multiplica
tion after a brief exposure to the temperature of 158° F. (70° C).
    This evidence now in our possession              as   to the limits of "vital
            "
resistance    to heat displayed by Bacteria, Vibriones, and their supposed
germs in neutral saline solutions, and in neutral or acid organic infusions,
is most pertinent and valuable when considered in relation to that
supplied by other sets of experiments bearing upon the all-important
problem of the Origin of Life.             These latter experiments alone may
possibly leave doubt in many minds ; but the more thoroughly they are
considered in relation to the evidence brought forward in this communi
                           I
cation, the more fully, venture to think, will every lingering doubt as to
the proper conclusion to be arrived at be dispelled.
    Thus we now know that boiled turnip- or hay-infusions exposed to
ordinary air, exposed to filtered air, to calcined air, or shut off altogether
from contact with air are more or less prone to swarm with Bacteria and
 Vibriones in the course of from two to six days ; but, placed under slightly
different conditions such as were employed in the inoculation experiments
above quoted, although infusions of the same nature do not undergo " spon
taneous" putrefactive changes, yet when living Bacteria and Vibriones are
added, and not subsequently heated, putrefaction invariably takes place and
the fluids thus situated rapidly become turbid. There is therefore nothing
in the conditions themselves tending to hinder the process of putrefaction,
 so long as living units are there to initiate it. Our experiments now show
 that as long as the added Bacteria, Vibriones, and their supposed germs are
 subjected to a heat not exceeding 131° F. (55° C), putrefaction invariably
 occurs within two days ; whilst, on the contrary, whenever they are
 subjected to a temperature of 158° F. (70° C.) putrefaction does not occur.
 To what can this difference be due, except to the fact that the previously
 living organisms, which, when living, always excite putrefaction,         have been
                     *  In the experiments  already referred to.

232 On the Heat necessary to                kill Bacteria, Vibriones,     ^c.   [Mar. 20,
killed by the temperature of 158° F. ? It would be of no avail to suppose
that the absence of putrefaction in these latter cases is due to the fart
that a heat of 158° F., instead of killing the organisms and their germs,
merely annuls their powers of reproduction, because in the other series
of experiments (with which these have to be compared), where similar
fluids are exposed to ordinary or purified air, or are shut off from the
influence of air altogether, the most active putrefaction and multiplica
tion of organisms takes place in two, three, or four days, in spite of the
much more potent heat of 212° F. to which any preexisting germs or
organisms must have been subjected.        The supposition, therefore, that
the Bacteria, Vibriones, and their germs were not killed in our inoculation
experiments    at the temperature of 158°               F., but were merely      deprived
of their powers of reproduction, would be no gain to those who desire
to stave off the admission that Bacteria and Vibriones can be proved to
arise de novo in certain cases. Let us assume this (which is indisputably
proved by    these inoculation experiments), viz. that an exposure to a
temperature of 158° F. (70° C.) for five minutes deprives Bacteria,
 Vibriones, and their germs of their usual powers of growth and repro
duction   — that    is,   that   it   reduces them to    a   state of potential,   if    not
necessarily to     one of actual death.          What   end would be served        by   such
a   reservation?     The impending conclusion could not be staved off                     by
means of it.       The explanation of what occurs in the other set of experi
ments, where the much more potent heat of 212° F.           employed, still
                                                                     is
would  not  be possible without having recourse to the supposition of                      a
de novo origination of living units, so long as those which may have pre
existed in the flasks could be proved to have been reduced to such                         a
state of potential death.  It would be preposterous, and contrary to the
whole order of Nature, to assume that the vastly increased destructive
influence of   a   heat of 212°        F. had restored vital properties which     a   lesser
amount (158° F.) of the same influence had completely annulled.
  The evidence supplied by these different series of experiments,                         in
whichever way      itregarded, as
                          is         seems to me, absolutely compels the
                                            it
logical reasoner to conclude  that the  swarms of living organisms which
so often make their appearance in boiled infusions treated in one or other
of the various modes already proved to be either destructive or exclusive
of preexisting living things are the products of new brood of " living"

particles, which, in the absence of any coexisting living organisms, must
have taken origin in the fluid itself. For this mode of origin of living
units, so long spoken of and repudiated as " spontaneous generation,"                   I
have proposed the new term Archebiosis.

    other parts of the body, may be         found by solid geometry.             It is evident    that
    in many cases these relations            are merely translations into the language
   of solid geometry       of certain properties of the spherical ellipse. In trying
   to make use of the spherical ellipse in a general manner,                      I  have been led
   to some theorems which         I think are interesting, and which seem to be new.
   In what follows       I  shall restrict myself almost entirely to these results.
        1. Let a body be turning about a fixed point O under the action of
   no forces, and let the angular velocities about the principal axes at O be
         h„ •»,. Also let A, B, C be the principal moments at the fixed point ;

It   is clear that the three points     I, G, H     describe spherical ellipses on the
                                                     Ga
sphere of radius unity.         We    know that             lies between the greatest, A,
 and the least, C, of the principal moments of inertia ; let us suppose that
 it is also greater than the mean principal moment B. In this case the
 concavities     of the three ellipses will be towards the point A, t. e. the
 point where the axis of greatest moment cuts the sphere. This point is
 therefore to be regarded as the common centre of the three ellipses. If
 — <B,      the common centre would be the intersection                   of the least    axis of
 moment with the sphere.
    In the figure the eye is supposed situated on the axis of greatest
 moment, viewing the sphere from a considerable distance.                             All great
 circles on the sphere are represented by straight lines.
     The semiaxes     A K, A L of     the eccentric       ellipse are evidently given          by
                                                                         If (a\

   In   this paper is given an account of a series of observations made in
the Observatory of Birr Castle, in further prosecution of a shorter and
less carefully conducted investigation, as regards many details, which
forms the subject of two former communications* to the Royal Society.
   The observations were first corrected for change of the moon's distance
from the place of observation and change of phase during the continuance
of each night's work, and thus a curve, whose ordinates represented the
scale-readings (corrected) and whose abscissae represented the corre
sponding altitudes, was obtained for each night's work. By combining

 all these, a single curve and table for reducing all the observations to the
 same zenith-distance was obtained, which proved to be nearly, but not
 quite, the same as that found by Professor Seidel for the light of the
 stars. By employing the table thus deduced, and also reducing the heat-
 determinations obtained on the various nights for change of distance of
 the sun, a more accurate phase-curve was deduced, indicating a more
  rapid increase of the radiant heat on approaching full moon than was
 given by the formula previously employed, but still not so much as Pro
 fessor Zbllner's gives for the moon's light.
    By employing Laplace's formula for the extinction of light in our
 atmosphere, the heat-effect in terms of the scale-readings was deduced,
 and an approximation to the height of the atmosphere attempted.
    From a series of simultaneous measurements of the moon's heat and
 light at intervals during the partial eclipse of November 14, 1872, when
 clouds did not interfere, it was found that the heat and light diminish
 nearly if not quite proportionally, the minimum for both occurring at or
 very near the middle of the eclipse, when they were reduced to about half
 what they were before and after contact with the penumbra.

 I. " On   the Structure   of Striped Muscular Fibre."         By Edward
       Albert Schafer.       Communicated      by  Dr.  Sharpey,   V.P.R.S.
       Received March 13, 1873.
                                 (Abstract.)
    After premising that, owing to the rapidity with which changes     set in
after death, the subject in question can only properly be worked out
whilst the muscular fibres are still living, the author proceeds to give
the result of his investigations of the tissue in this condition.        The
animal employed was the common large water-beetle, the muscles of the
legs being taken.     These were examined entirely without addition, being
either teazed out upon a glass slide in the ordinary way and covered
with thin glass, or else prepared upon the latter, which was then inverted
over a ring of putty after the method introduced by Strieker.
    The author describes a muscular fibre as consisting of a ground-
substance appearing at first sight to be formed of two distinct substances
(the one dim, the other bright in aspect, which are arranged in alternating
disks disposed in successive series, with their planes at right angles to

 1873.]            Structure    of Striped Muscular Fibre.                  243
the axis of the fibre) and of a vast number of minute rod-like particles,
to which he applies the term muscle-rods, which are closely arranged
side by side and parallel to the axis of the fibre, so as to form by their
juxtaposition as many series as there are disks of dim substance in the
fibre.   The main part or shaft of each muscle-rod is imbedded in and
traverses a disk of dim substance, while the ends, which are enlarged at
the extremity into little knobs or heads, extend into the bright disks.
These little knobs it is which give the appearance of the line of dots
which has long been described as existing in the middle of each bright
stripe ; when the fibre is somewhat extended this line appears double,
owing to the separation of the heads of the two successive series of
muscle-rods which meet in the middle of the disk of bright substance.
The author describes the rods as differing somewhat both in relative
position and in form, these differences being accompanied by corre
sponding changes in the appearance of the ground-substance.                  The
principal changes are those of form.            Thus, in what the author is
inclined to regard as the state of absolute rest, the rods are uniformly
cylindrical without terminal enlargements ; in this case only a longi
tudinal fibrillation is to be seen in the fibre, all trace of transverse
striping having disappeared.          In the normal state of slight tension,
however, the rod-heads make their appearance, and with them the bright
substance by which they are surrounded, so that the dim ground-
substance    now presents a transversely striated aspect. In contraction
of the muscle the     heads of the rods become enlarged at the expense of
the shaft, the extremities of each muscle-rod thus approaching one
another   : the enlarged heads, being closely applied both to the neigh
bouring    ones of the same series and to those of the next series which
meet them in the bright stripe, the line of dots now appears as a dark
transverse band with bright borders.          As the contraction proceeds, and
these dark bands approach one another, the bright borders encroach upon
the dim stripe, which finally disappears, so that its place is taken up by
a single transverse    bright stripe. Consequently contracted muscle shows
alternate   dark and   light stripes ; the former, however, are in this case due
to the enlarged juxtaposed extremities of the rods, the light on the other
hand being mainly composed of the ground-substance which has become
accumulated in the intervals between their shafts.
   After giving a description of the appearances observed in transverse
section, when examined in the normal state without addition, and after
the consideration of those which are met with in sections from frozen
muscle examined in    ^  per cent. solution of common salt, and which have been
described by Cohnheim, the author proceeds to consider the nature of
the ground-substance,        and more especially the transversely striated
appearance which it ordinarily presents.         He gives it as his opinion that
the ground-substance is in reality uniform in nature throughout, and
that the bright bands which cross it are due to an optical effect produced

244               On the Structure  of Striped Muscular Fibre.        [Apr. 3,
by the presence of the globular heads of the muscle-rods, which have a
different refractive index from that of the ground-substance.              That
such an explanation is possible, is shown by the examination of minute
oil-globules imbedded in gelatine, which appear under the microscope as
dark spots with a bright surrounding, the juxtaposition of several such
dots giving the effect of a bright band.     That the bright transverse bands
in muscle are similarly produced by the juxtaposition of the rod-heads
would appear from the following amongst other considerations : —
    1. Where the rod-heads are smaller the bright bands are correspond
       ingly narrower.
    2. Where the rod-heads have become merged into the shafts, so as no
       longer to be seen as distinct objects, the bright transverse stripes
       have also entirely disappeared.
    3. When in contraction the rod-heads enlarge and encroach on the
       shaft, their bright borders accompany them and encroach on the dim
       substance, so that at last all appearance of dimness becomes entirely
       obliterated, the bright borders becoming blended in the middle.
    4. The part of the muscle-rod where the head joins the shaft is
       rendered indistinct by the brightness around the rod-head ; whereas
       if this brightness were inherent in the ground-substance, this part
       of the rod would stand out all the darker by the contrast.
    5. The appearance of a transverse section is corroborated ; for in
       this case the rod-heads are seen so close together that the optical
       effect of any one would become merged into those of its neighbours :
       consequently the whole of the intermediate substance would appear
       bright ; and this is actually found to be the case.
    6. The fact that both the dim and the bright substance of resting
       muscle appear doubly refracting would      seem to indicate   that they
       are of the same nature.
    The author then proceeds to give the result of his investigations of the
appearance of muscle under polarized light. He finds that, as regards
muscle at rest when placed between crossed Nicols, the whole fibre
appears illuminated ; in the contracted state, on the other hand, the
appearance is presented of illuminated stripes with dark intervals.         The
latter correspond with the lines formed by the juxtaposition of the
enlarged ends of the muscle-rods ; these consequently are singly
refracting (isotropous), and so, in all probability, are the shafts of the
muscle-rods     ;  they do not, however, stand out as black streaks, since
they are surrounded          by doubly refracting (anisotropous)       ground-
substance, and are illuminated          by  the light   which  has  previously
traversed     this.   In the same way    it may readily  be understood    why,
in the resting muscle also, the rods, although isotropous, do not appear
as such.      The conclusion, then, that the author arrives at on this point is
that the whole of the muscular fibre is anisotropous, with the exception
 of the muscle-rods.

disks    of isotropous       and anisotropous      substances   are  observed,   the
muscular fibre is in a state of contraction            (although not    necessarily
             —
shortened) that       is to say that the anisotropous substance        has become
accumulated between the shafts of the rods, the isotropous             disks   being
due to the rod-heads, between which there is no perceptible             amount of
anisotropous substance left remaining.
    The author concludes the paper by offering a conjecture as to the
nature of the substances which, according to his description, compose
the proper substance of muscle, and as to the probable mode in which
the   contraction is effected.       He is inclined to regard the intermediate
ground-substance as        the true contractile part, and thinks that it may be
allied in nature to ordinary protoplasm, the rods, on the other hand,
being elastic structures, and merely serving to restore the fibre to its
original length.

    In connexion with the investigation on the electric decomposition             of
carbonic-acid gas referred to in a previous communication to the Society,
I was led to submit a mixture of hydrogen and carbonic-oxide gas to the
action of electricity in the induction-tube, the mixed gases being circu
lated through the tube by means of an apparatus which               I will not now
describe.     A contraction was soon observed to have taken place, which at
 the  end of an hour amounted to 10 cub. centims.              The rate of contrac
 tion steadily diminished, and during the fifth hour of the duration of the
 experiment amounted to only 2 cub. centims.                  The experiment was
 stopped, and the gas analyzed with the following results in two several
 analyses  : —

  the gas, together with a trace of oxygen, which have been omitted from
  the calculation.
     The result of this reaction is expressed in the following equation : —
                             CO + 3Ha=CH4+HaO.
     This fundamental experiment, which constitutes the basis of a new
  method of chemical synthesis, susceptible of the most varied applica
 tions, and of peculiar interest in reference to the explication of natural
 phenomena, was commenced by me on the 10th of January last at Oxford,
 in the laboratory of my friend and successor in the Chair of Chemistry,
  Professor Odling ; and two analyses of the gas were completed, and the
 results attained in the course of a week from that date.
    In a similar experiment made with a mixture of hydrogen and carbonic-
 acid gas, a contraction also occurred, attended with the formation of
 water.    The gas which resulted from the experiment was found to con
 sist (after the absorption of carbonic acid) of hydrogen and carbonic oxide,
 together with a little marsh-gas.         Traces of oxygen and nitrogen were
 also present.     Minute drops, too, of an oily liquid appeared in the tube.
 This liquid, after the conclusion of the experiment, was dissolved in a
 small quantity of water.         The solution was strongly acid and had a
 pungent    taste.   It reduced  an alkaline solution of terchloride of gold and
 an ammoniacal solution of nitrate of silver.          These reactions are the
 characteristic properties of formic acid, of which we may infer the syn
 thesis to have been effected according to the equation
                                 H,+COa=HaCOa.
    I may avail    myself of the present opportunity to place on record the
following important facts in reference to the action of electricity on car
 bonic-oxide gas.
    When pure and dry carbonic oxide is circulated through the induction-
tube, and there submitted to the action of electricity, a decomposition of
the gas occurs, attended with a gradual and regular contraction, which, in
the form assumed in my experiments, occurred at the regular               rate of
about 5 cub. centims. in an hour.         Carbonic acid is formed, and      simul
taneously     with  its  formation  a  solid  deposit may be observed      in the
induction-tube.      This deposit appears as a transparent film of         a red-
brown colour, lining the walls of the tube.            It is perfectly soluble in
water, which is strongly coloured by it. The solution has an intensely
acid reaction.
    The solid deposit in the tube, in the dry condition before it has been
in contact with water, is an oxide of carbon. Samples, however, made in
different experiments do not present precisely the same composition ; but
nevertheless they appear to belong to a certain limited number of forms
which repeatedly occur, and may invariably be referred to the same general
order or system. This system is, or appears to be, what           I may term an

 weight 12 may be regarded as the first term, and of which the adjacent
 terms differ by an increment of carbonic oxide (CO) weighing 28, pre
 cisely as homologous series of hydrocarbons differ by the increment CHa
 with the weight 14.      I  have succeeded in identifying by analysis two at
 least of these substances,      namely    the adjacent terms C403 and CsOt.
 From this point of view these peculiar bodies are members of a series of
 oxycarbons analogous in the oxycarbon system to the series of hydro
 carbons of which the unit of carbon is the first and the unit of acetylene
 CaH, is the second term, the oxycarbon C403 being represented in that
 series by the hydrocarbon erotonylene C4H6, and the oxycarbon               Cs0l by
 the hydrocarbon valerylene C,H9.
 III.   "On    an Air-Battery."       By   J.  H. Gladstone, Ph.D., F.R.S.,
          and  Alfred Tribe,       F.C.S.     Received March 6, 1873.
    The galvanic battery which we are about to describe is founded on a
reaction that we brought under the notice of the Royal Society last
spring*. We then showed that if pieces of copper and silver in contact
are immersed in a solution of nitrate of copper in the presence of
oxygen, a decomposition of the salt ensues, with the formation of
cuprous oxide on the silver and a corresponding solution of the copper,
while a galvanic current passes through the liquid from copper to silver.
We stated, moreover, that this was no isolated phenomenon, but only
one of a large class of similar reactions.                It seemed desirable to
examine more fully the history and the capabilities of the electrical
power thus produced.
    It was previously ascertained that         the  combination       of the oxygen
takes place only in the neighbourhood of the silver ;              and the following
formulas may serve to render the chemical change                    and transference
more intelligible :—
       Before contact,
                       t»Ag + O + Cu2NOs + Cu2N03 + nCu             ;

                  mAgH-Cu20 + Cu2NO,+Cu2NOs+(n-2)                     Cu.
This action is evidently     a continuous    one until either the oxygen or the
copper fails.
   Now the oxygen of the atmosphere is practically unlimited in amount,
but there is a difficulty in bringing any large quantity of it into contact
at once with the silver and the dissolved salt.
    To facilitate   this, we arrange that the silver plate should have a
horizontal   position just under the surface of the liquid in the cell ; and,

in fact, we convert it into a small silver tray full of crystals of the     same
metal which rise in projections to the very surface.      The copper        plate
lies horizontally under    it,
                             separated,   need be, by a piece of muslin, and
                                         if
connexion    ismade by  a  wire as usual. The vertical part of the copper
plate, from    alittle above the liquid to the bend, should be varnished         ;
otherwise   solution    principally takes place there, which causes the
horizontal  part of the plate to drop off. Holes are made in the silver
tray with the view of shortening the communication between the air-
surface and the copper plate and of facilitating the movements of the
salt   in solution.   The solution     itself may be contained   in   a   shallow
trough or saucer, and the whole arrangement       will   be somewhat as    in   the
sectional view here given —  :

    The contrast is evident.     That the deoxygenized solution does give a
deflection at all is due partly to the difficulty of excluding air, and
partly, perhaps, at first to the oxygen condensed on the surface of the
silver plate.    The effect due to the water itself is inappreciable.
    From the nature of the reaction it might be expected that the current
would gradually diminish on account of the using up of the dissolved
oxygen in the neighbourhood of the silver ; such a diminution always
does take place, at least after the first few vibrations of the needle.
    It might be expected, too, that when the amount of action has run down
considerably, the mere moving of the liquid so as to bring fresh parts of
the solution against the silver would augment the currents.           It does so.
    The   same  might  be predicted from   stirring up  the crystals of   silver in
the tray so as to expose new surfaces. This also was found to be the case.
     And, again, it might be anticipated that if the wire were disconnected
for a time so as to allow the oxygen to diffuse itself from other parts of
the solution, and the connexion were made, the current would be found
 as strong, or nearly so, as before.     That also is true in fact.
     A cell with the plates connected by a wire was placed under a bell-jar
full of air over mercury. The mercury gradually rose inside, as might
be expected from the absorption of the oxygen in the air.
     The necessity of oxygen and the avidity with which it is taken up are
both illustrated by the following experiment : — Two cells with horizontal
 plates were prepared alike in every respect, except that the first was
 filled with a solution simply deprived of oxygen, the second with a
 solution through which a stream of carbonic-acid gas had been passed
 for some time. The first was placed in the air, the second in a vessel
 from which the air had been expelled by allowing carbonic-acid gas to
 flow into it for an hour or two.
     The deflections obtained were as follows, the 1-999 shunt being used
 and the temperature being 13°-7 C : —

    As the cell in an atmosphere of carbonic-acid      gas showed considerable
 action, in fact nearly half as much as that in the air, each cell was short
 circuited for 23 hours, with the expectation that any oxygen in the
 closed vessel would be used up ; and, indeed, the most prominent crystals
 of silver in the cell in carbonic-acid gas became reddened, while a cuprous
 deposit extended over the whole of the crystals in the other cell. When,
 however, the short wires were removed and the galvanometer interposed,
 the cell  in the air    gave a deflection    of 136, practically the    same as
 before, but that in carbonic-acid gas,   instead of showing a great    decrease,
 rose to 80.     It was then found that the vessel containing the latter
 slowly admitted air ; so the contents were swept out by a fresh stream
 of carbonic-acid gas, and it was made properly air-tight.     After connexion
 by a short wire for 3 days the galvanometer indicated a deflection of 20,
 that of the cell in the air being 110, temperature 10° C. As this showed
a very great reduction of the chemical action, carbonic-acid gas was
 again passed through the vessel for an hour or two ; and after a
 connexion of two more days the indication of the galvanometer was
 only 3, while the other cell gave 115, the temperature being now 10o-5C.
 The action, therefore, was at last reduced almost to nothing ; and the
original fault in the experiment brought out, perhaps more clearly than
would otherwise be seen, how eagerly the solution will absorb even
minute quantities of oxygen from the surrounding gas.
    An important point to determine was the best strength of the copper
nitrate solution. Six per cent. was generally preferred, for two reasons :—
first, it gives about the maximum of effect — a solution four times as
strong gives less than half the deflection, and a solution only a quarter
as strong gives only two thirds ; secondly, a stronger solution than this
6 per cent. is apt to produce a deposit, not of pure cuprous oxide, but of
a subnitrate,    which was supposed      to clog up the silver     crystals to a
greater extent.
    Another point investigated was the best proportion between the areas
of the metallic surfaces. Experiments were made with vertical plates,
in which the silver was kept at a uniform size and the copper was
diminished by covering it more and more with varnish ; and another set
was made in which the copper remained the same, while the silver plate
was reduced.

    The increase, therefore, of the silver or negative metal causes an
almost proportionate increase in the chemical action. This, doubtless,
arises from the necessity of oxygen, and explains the value of the large
surface exposed by the silver crystals in the tray.
    The effect of heat on the action of this cell was examined ; it
increases the action greatly : thus an arrangement which gave a deflec
tion of 40 at 20° C. gave one of 250 at 50° C. ; and the augmentation was
 observed to be much more rapid in the higher than in the lower portions
 of this range of temperature.
    If  the formula given above for the reaction be a true one, it follows
 that every atom of copper deposited on the silver in the state of suboxide
 must be compensated by an atom of copper dissolved from the copper
 plate.    This was proved quantitatively.        In a cell that had been in
 action for a week the loss of the copper plate was 0-391 grm., while

252          Messrs. Gladstone and Tribe on an Air-battery,                [Apr. 3,
the suboxide deposited on the silver was found to be equivalent to
0-398 grm. of metallic copper.           This deposit of suboxide, though it soon
forms apparently a complete covering to the silver, does not greatly
diminish the action      ;  it is probably porous, besides being itself a conductor
of electricity.     In    some cases we have found it deposited in crystals
sufficiently large    to   be seen by the naked eye, and which are shown by a
magnifying-glass to be regular octahedra.
    The internal resistance of this battery, as might be expected, is small.
    The electrolytic power of the current was examined. One cell, the
plates of which were about two inches in diameter, was found sufficient
to decompose such metallic salts as the nitrates of copper, silver, or lead,
copper sulphate or stannous chloride, in aqueous solution, when platinum
 was used for the negative electrode, and for the positive the same metal
as existed in the salt experimented on.              Six cells were sufficient to
decompose dilute sulphuric acid slowly and dilute hydrocloric acid pretty
 quickly, copper electrodes being employed.
    The theoretical interest of this battery lies mainly in the fact that it
 differs  essentially    from every other galvanic arrangement, inasmuch as
 the binary compound in solution is incapable of being decomposed either
 by the positive metal alone or by the two metals in conjunction ; it
 cannot serve, in fact, as the liquid element of the circuit without the
 presence of another body ready to combine with one of its constituents
 when set free.
     Grove's gas-battery is essentially different from ours if the oxygen
 and hydrogen condensed on the platinum plates play the part of the two
 metals ; but it closely resembles ours if hydrogen acts the part of the
 positive and platinum that of the negative metal ; the dilute sulphuric
 acid, a hydrogen compound, will then be decomposed on account of the
 simultaneous presence of the oxygen, which can combine with the
 liberated hydrogen.          Viewed in this manner Grove's gas-battery is only
 a special case of the general reaction which we have described in our
 previous paper ; and the formula will be : —
       Before contact,
                              >»Pt  + 0 + Ha S04+»H;
       after contact,
                              m  Pt + Ha O +    804 + («
                                                          - 2)11.
     The practical interest        of our arrangement lies in the fact that it is
 an approximation towards a constant air-battery.              Should it ever come
 into use elsewhere than on the lecture-table, it will probably be in the
 form of    a combination          of zinc and copper, with an aerated solution
 of zinc chloride ; for that arrangement has an electromotive force six
 times that of the arrangement we have more particularly studied, and
 about three quarters that of a Daniell's cell.         The numbers representing
 the difference of potential between the two metals, which were actually

   Chloride of zinc is preferred to the sulphate, as it offers less internal
resistance, and a solution of 20 per cent. is recommended as about the
best conductor*.        A  single cell of this description is capable of decom
posing dilute sulphuric or hydrochloric acid, when copper electrodes are
employed.       The two metals might be arranged as in a DanieU's battery ;
the zinc would of course require no amalgamation, and the whole might
be left for weeks or months without any attention.                 The oxide of zinc
produced      generally falls to the bottom of the vessel, and may be
separated whenever it is thought desirable.
     The power is thus obtained at a minimum of expense, for the oxygen
which combines with the zinc costs nothing.                  Such a battery would
appear to be specially adapted to cases where the galvanic current has
to  be frequently broken,       as   in telegraphy ; for at each period of rest it
renews its strength by the absorption or diffusion of more oxygen from
 the air.

 I. " On   the Durability    and Preservation      of Iron Ships, and on
      Riveted Joints."      By Sir William Fairbairn, Bart., F.R.S.
       Received March 5, 1873.
                                 (Abstract.)
                                                      '
   The disaster which happened to the ' Megaera is first discussed, as
showing the need of constant inspection of iron structures.        That vessel
was built by the author of the paper in 1849, and, in his opinion, would
have been perfectly sound at the present time if her interior had been
freely open to inspection, and if such inspection had been regularly
carried out.   Some years ago an alarming report was circulated as to the
   vol. xxi.                                                       z

260               Sir W. Fairbairn    on the  Durability and        [Apr. 24,
corrosion of the Menai Bridge. The author on that occasion visited the
bridge, and found that no corrosion had taken place, careful attention to
proper means of prevention having been sufficient to preserve the struc
ture.    The proved value of periodical inspections in the case of steam-
boilers is then alluded to, and the author urges the importance of similar
inspections of iron ships by the Admiralty and by private shipowners.
    As respects riveted joints, the author first discusses the relative merits
of machine- and hand-riveting,      and points out that in machine-riveting
there is much greater security that the rivets properly fill the rivet-holes.
The rate at which riveting can be done is given as 16 rivets per minute
with    a lever riveting-machine,   10 rivets per minute with a steam rivet
ing-machine,    and 0-66 rivet per minute      when the riveting is done by
hand.
                         Experiments on Riveted Joints.
    The author alludes, first, to the series of experiments on riveted joints
which were communicated by him to the Royal Society in 1850. Those
experiments showed that, taking the strength of a solid plate at 100, the
strength of an equal width of riveted joint would be 70 if the joint were
double riveted, and 56 if the joint were single riveted : in other words,
30 per cent. of strength is lost in a double-riveted joint, and 44 per cent.
in a single-riveted joint.      Since that time it has appeared to some
engineers that the process of punching was injurious to the plates, and
in many cases recourse has been had to drilling to form the rivet-holes.
On this point the author was of opinion that with good iron no sensible
injury resulted from punching the rivet-holes ; on the other hand, with
rigid and bad plates, the plate would crack between the rivet-holes, and
the plate would have to be discarded.          He regarded it as a distinct
advantage of the punching-process that it thus tested the quality of the
 iron. It had been found in certain cases that the rivets sheared across
 with a less force when in drilled than when in punched holes, and this
 had been attributed to the sharpness of the edges of the drilled holes.
 This point seemed to require investigation, and experiments to elucidate
 it had, therefore, been made, the results of which are narrated in the
 paper.    The theory that the sharp edges of drilled holes induced a
 cutting action, which diminished the strength of the rivets, had suggested
 to Colonel Inglis, R.E., to try whether a greater resistance in the joint
 could be obtained by purposely rounding the edges of the rivet-holes.
  Some experiments had been made for Colonel Inglis by Mr. Kirkaldy,
 from which it appeared that the resistance of the rivet was increased 10
  per cent. by this rounding of the edges of the rivet-holes.      The author
 has also experimented on this point, and the results of his experiments
  are given in the paper.
     A series of tables of experiments are then given, each result being
  fully discussed. The following Table is a summary of results obtained
  by the author.

    The general conclusions drawn by the author from his experiments are
as follows —                   :
   (1) Joints with drilled holes are weaker and elongate less before fracture
than Joints with punched holes.     The average of four experiments on
joints with drilled holes, compared with the average of four experiments
on joints with punched holes, shows that the rivets in the former are
1-36 ton per square inch, or       per cent., weaker than the rivets in the
latter. The elongation       also 26  per cent, less with drilled than with               is
punched holes.

The mean of three experiments on hand-riveted joints, compared with the
mean of three experiments on machine-riveted joints, shows an excess of
shearing resistance in the rivets in the hand-riveted joints amounting to
1-495 ton per square inch, or        per cent.  The hand-riveted joint also                                               7\

that in hand-riveted joints the rivet           slightly hardened by being

 part of the plate in front of the rivet.         The amount of that bending
  stress is approximately estimated, and a rule found for the distance of
 the rivet-hole from the edge of the plate.        When the plate gives way by
 tearing    from  rivet-hole to rivet-hole, it is commonly assumed that the
 stress on the part of the plate between the rivets is a uniformly distri
 buted stress.      This is shown to be not strictly correct, and the want of
 uniformity of stress will cause the plate to give way with a lower average
 intensity of stress than that which corresponds to the ultimate resistance
  of the plate to tension.       How much the plate may be weakened by the
 want of uniformity in the distribution of the stress it is impossible to
 calculate.     Probably the loss of strength due to this cause is in ductile
 plates very small ; but it is pointed out that this weakening may account,
 at least in part, for the apparent loss of strength of the plates at joints
 as compared with the same plates broken in an imperforated condition.
 This loss of strength has been hitherto ascribed entirely to injury done to
 the plate in the punching-process.        When the rivet gives way by shear
 ing, the stress on the section is also not uniform. In consequence of
 the great deformation of the rivet before fracture, it is subjected to bend
 ing as well as shearing action. The friction between the plates induced
 by the contraction of the rivets in cooling has been supposed sometimes
 to add to the apparent resistance of the rivet to shearing.         It is shown
 that a considerable displacement of the plates takes place before ultimate
 fracture, and that the deformation of the rivets is so great that it can
 hardly    be supposed      that they exert any tension, holding the plates
 together at the moment of fracture.           The friction should therefore be
 entirely neglected     in estimating the ultimate  resistance of riveted joints ;
 and this, indeed, has been done by most English writers.
     The question of the resistance to deformation is then discussed, and a
 limit fixed for the safe intensity of the pressure on the bearing surface
 of the rivet.
     The practical considerations affecting the diameter of the rivet are then
 stated ; and joining these to the considerations given above, a series of
rules for proportioning riveted joints are drawn up, and some Tables of
the proportions of rivets and joints are given.

 shown in Table   III.,  no more than 4 lines and 4 columns, or 4'= 16 entries.
 If   we dealt with 8 points, the number of entries would amount to 8' =64,

 such tedious computations need excite no apprehension, because               I shall

    We have thus far supposed no current to exist         ; if  there should be a
current, the above contour would be incorrect         as regards the position of
A   ;  but it would be perfectly correct in regard to the position in which a
float would be found at the end of the day which had been dropped in the
water at the beginning, because the float and the ship would have drifted
simultaneously in parallel lines.      If, then, A be the point of departure
and A' be the position of the float at the end of the day, and if we
draw a contour,      as described   above, round A', it     will  be   true for the
joint effects of winds and currents for A. Conversely, in order to con
struct a contour for their joint effects from A, we have first to draw A A'
to represent the drift of the current in one day from A, and then to use
A' as a point of construction for a contour calculated upon the data of the
winds alone ; the contour so drawn will be the required figure, with A
for the point of departure.

     It  seems strange that so useful and definite a conception as that         of the
 contour we have been considering should not long since have acquired a
 name.       The idea in its general application is not unfamiliar to us,
  because we are all accustomed to reflect how far we can travel in an
  hour's walk, ride, or drive from our house, in various directions, and we
 know that the distances in different directions vary according to the good
  ness or straightness of the road.           Nevertheless our vocabulary does not
 admit of an expression of the idea upon which this memoir is based, with
  out a tedious paraphrase including references to (1) equal and specified
 times, (2) direct geographical distance, (3) universality of directions, and
 (4) a bounding line.        I  therefore propose to employ the word isochrone
 (equality of time) in a special sense in this memoir, meaning thereby all
 that is expressed by the contour just described, which             I should call the
 " isochrone from A," the unit of measurement being understood to be a
 single day's sail, unless otherwise specified.        The isochrone towards A will
 be the same figure reversed and inverted.
     The lines of swiftest     passage from one port to another can only be de
 termined      after computation of the isochrones for a sufficient number of
 ocean districts within the region of inquiry to enable those at any par
 ticular spot, or as much of them as is needed, to be found by interpola
 tion.     It seems to me perfectly impossible to draw any portion of an
 isochrone, except in a rudely approximative way, without previous com
 putation.       Calculation to 8 or 16 points takes so long to perform, and small
 differences in the mean force of the winds have so large an influence,
 that no human brain is competent to deduce correct results after a mere
 inspection of the data. As an example,             I  may be allowed to mention
        I
 that asked a naval officer of unusually large experience in the construc
 tion of weather charts, and who was familiar with the sailing qualities of
 a  " Beaufort standard ship," to estimate portions of isochrones in certain
 cases   ; and   I found the mean error of his estimates to exceed 15 per cent.
 The guesses of ordinary navigators would necessarily be much more wide
of the truth. Now we must recollect that a very small saving on the
average length of voyages would amount to an enormous aggregate of
commercial gain, and that, where precision is practicable, we should never
rest satisfied with the rule of thumb.          Our meteorological statistics afford
the best information attainable at the present moment, and they exceed
by some hundredfold the experiences of any one navigator ; their pro
bable errors may nevertheless be large, but that is no reason for need
lessly associating them with additional subjects of doubt.              The probable
error of a navigator's estimate of an isochrone, and consequently of the
data which he must use, whether consciously or not, whenever he attempts
to calculate his best track, is due at the present time to no less than three
distinct    sets of uncertainties  : — a, the average weather  ; 6, the performance
of his ship on different courses with winds of different force (which        I under
stand to be hardly ever ascertained with much precision)           ; c, the computa-

tion of the isochrone.          If A, B,   and C be the probable errors of these three
respectively, then the probable error of the navigator's estimate will be
 v' A'+B'+C".            My desire is to reduce this large item to        a simple    A,
which may itself be minimized until it ceases to be of any practical in
convenience.         It is no new thing that statistics should require discussion
and elaborate calculation before they can be turned to account and be
made the familiar basis of vast commercial undertakings.                Classified lists
of   ages  at  death    are  no  more   fitted  to be the immediate   guides of those
who grant annuities or engage to pay reversions, than are the crude
meteorological        statistics of the ocean to be the immediate guides of the
navigator.
    It is probable that most vessels may practically admit of division into
some moderate number of classes, and that it would suffice to calculate
isochrones for each of these classes ; but in any case the number of cal
culations must be very large, because they would differ not only for the
class of ship and the particular destination, but also for the season of the
year when the voyage was made. It is therefore important that even
individual ships should be enabled to have isochrones drawn for their
especial use at a trifling cost.          I  will now show how this may be effected
by mechanical means.
    The drawing       I  give (fig. 3) is only a diagram to explain the principle of
the machine      ;  the framework is left out, and the proportions are somewhat
varied for the convenience of illustration.            Also, for simplicity of explana
tion,  I  have supposed the machine constructed to apply to no more than
4 points of the compass, and it is represented as adjusted to work out the
example already given in Table             III.
    A  long tray, open at the top and almost wholly open along the front,
has 8 grooves, into which pieces of zinc, thin wood, or even stout card
board may be dropped, much like the glass plates in a photographer's
box.     In  fig. 3 we only see the base of this tray, A A, and the pieces of
zinc standing upon it in the position in which they would be held by the
grooves.      The zinc plates have curved edges in front, which refer to the
sailing qualities of the particular ship under consideration ; these are cut
out from the data in Table II., each plate corresponding to the column
whose heading it bears. The ordinate of the curve is proportionate to
the force of the wind, and the abscissa to the distance sailed in one day
on the specified course (0, 8, 16, or 24) with that force of wind. There
are grooves cut in A A, one under each zinc plate, and there are tramwavs,
T, upon which A A may be set, in gear with those grooves. In the figure
it is so set that 0 is opposite to n, 8 to e, 16 to s, and 24 to w ; but if it
were lifted up and laid one groove more to the left, 0 (on the right
                                                                                  hand)
would be opposite to w, 8 to n, 16 to «, and 24 to s. Similarly, by setting
it two or three grooves to the left, the other possible variations would be
gone through.           The slides n, e, s, and w refer to the course of the ship

  shown     in the first column of Table III., and the four different     i
  correspond to the four lines in the body of that Table.
     The slides n, «, *, and w more to and fro parallel to the tramways,
  and are each furnished with bars that can be pushed vertically up and
  down, and a rod projects horizontally from each of the bars towards the
  zinc plate opposite to it. Graduations referring to the force of the wind
  are placed on the bars, which are thereby adjusted to come in contact at
  the proper levels with the zinc plates, and to be pushed back through a
  distance equal to the length of the abscissa) at those levels, when       AA   is
  run forwards on its tramway.
     Thus far we have obtained the result that n, e, s, and w shall be seve
 rally pushed back to the distances which would be sailed over in one day
 if the wind blew on 100 occasions with specified forces from each of those
  quarters, and if the ship were sailing to that quarter whose initial is
 opposite to the zinc plate marked 0.          As A A is adjusted in the figure,
 that quarter would be N. ; if it were moved one step to the left it would
 be W., if 2 steps it would be 8., and if 3 steps it would be E.
     We have now to diminish the movements impressed upon n, e, s, and
 w in the ratio of the percentage of occurrence of the several winds.
 This is effected by linking them to another series of slides, N, E, S, and
 W, as shown in the figure, and by attaching adjustable centres to the arms,
 there shown in a vertical position.        The standards to which those centres
 would be clamped are almost wholly removed in the figure, but the top and
 bottom of them can be seen.          The reduction will be correct within such
 limits as we need, when the links are somewhat longer than in the figure
and the arm does not swing through more than 40°.              I therefore do not
 care to propose in this case the somewhat more complicated, but per
fectly accurate arrangement which          I contrived for the parallel slides of
the paragraphs now in use at the Meteorological Office, of which a de
scription is given in the Eeport of the Meteorological            Committee for
 1870, p. 30.
    I  place the adjustable centres between the links in the cases of N
and S, and above them in those of E and W ; consequently, when n, e, *,
and w are all pushed back, N and S will advance, and E and W will
retreat   :  the reason for doing this will be seen presently.        In order to
graduate     the arms   for the adjustable   centres, we must  take the      part
of the distance between the pivots of the links as the unit of measure
ment, and measure in both cases from the pivot of the upper link as the
zero-point.      Then if p=the percentage to which the movementa are to
be reduced, the graduations       for p between the links are determined by the
formula     ,]^^     , and when above the links by
            100 +  p                                    100—  p
    The results we have now attained are that, when       AA  is pushed forward,
N, E, S, W shall move alternately forwards and backwards, each through
a distance     corresponding    to that which    a ship  would sail towards  the

quarter whose initial is opposite to the zinc plate marked 0, under the
several influences of the    N., E., 8., and W. winds as they are found to
occur. What remains is to sum up these movements.
    I  put a pulley, running easily on its axis, upon each of the upper slides,
as in the figure, and pass a band, one of whose ends is secured to a fixed
peg, round these pulleys, alternately over and under them.        The free end
of the band is kept stretched by a light weight, and a framework, carry
ing a vertical pricker, is urged to and fro by the movements of the band.
A disk (D), upon which the drawing-paper is secured, has its centre
exactly below the pricker when the machine is at zero ; and whenever A
is pushed home, the pricker travels in a radial distance to an amount
equal to twice the sum of the movements of the several slides, and there
fore through a distance proportionate to a day's sail of the ship towards
the quarter whose initial letter is opposite to the zinc plate marked 0. If
desired, the numerical value of the movement of the string could of course
be read off.
    The manipulation    of the instrument would be as follows : —
    1. Remove A A. 2. Push or pull the slides n, e, s, w into their mean
position. 3. Thrust a skewer, S 8, through the holes in the arms and
framework to hold every thing fast. 4. Adjust the centres, and clamp
them if necessary. 5. Adjust the bars for force of wind. 6. Bemove
the Bkewer. 7. Push the slides n, e, s, w as far back as they will go.
 8. Replace A A, and pull the slides forward to it. The machine is now
in working order. a. Push A A home. b. Press the pricker, not for
 getting to mark the N point,         c. Turn the disk through a quadrant.
 d. Pull back A A, and set it one step in advance on the tramways.
 e. Pull the slides up to it.
    The series 1 to 8 has to be gone through once for all for each isochrone ;
 that from o to e for each of the 4 points of the compass. The whole of
 these actions are simple and rapid, and the adjustments are of the easiest
 kind. An isochrone based upon 4 points ought to be leisurely plotted out
 in 2\ minutes, and one based upon 8 points in 4 minutes.
    This step-by-step arrangement is far easier of construction than one,
which may suggest itself to many persons, in which the movement should
 be continuous, using a curved surface instead of a set of curved edges, and
 by which the entire curve should be drawn instead of a few points
 pricked out ; also it is far more convenient and compact not to arrange
 the machine in a circular form, which is that which would most naturally
 first be thought of.
    "When the isochrones have been drawn to scale on a chart, isochronic
 lines at various points along any proposed route could readily be found by
 graphical interpolation.     Thus, in fig. 4, let the route be from L to M,

   There  ismuch to say about the proper method of discussing the crude
statistics derived from ocean districts artificially bounded by lines of
latitude and longitude in order to obtain the most probable meteoro
logical values, but Iwill only allude to them here.           First, homogeneous
districts and periods of time have to be made out         ;   secondly, the crude
observations   in       each   subdivision   of those districts have to   be dis
cussed in connexion with those made at adjacent subdivisions in the
same district  and, thirdly, they have to be discussed in reference to
               ;
those made in preceding and succeeding periods of time. There    no                is
doubt but that labour spent in these discussions would after   time            a
become more remunerative than the same amount of labour in accumu
lating fresh observations.

are, and their great importance ; 2, how to calcinate them ; 3, how to
construct a machine to supersede their calculation and to make it
possible to have them drawn for special cases at a trifling cost ; 4, how
to make an isochronal chart ; and, 5, how to use it on individual occasions.
    I should be glad if one result of this memoir were to bring into greater
prominence than at present the high value of the ocean statistics collected,
and now being published by the Meteorological Office, and the fact that no
degree of precision of meteorological knowledge need be thrown away in
the practice of navigation.      Such knowledge will be good for all time, and
will always afford the requisite data whence isochrones conformable to
the varying performances of new varieties of ships and to new lines of
commerce may be calculated.

  I. " On        the Condensation of a Mixture               of Air and Steam upon
         Cold Surfaces."            By Osborne Reynolds, M.A., Fellow of
         Queen's College, Cambridge, and Professor of Engineering in
         the Owens College, Manchester.                  Communicated by Professor
         Roscoe, F.R.S.            Received March 22, 1873.
     1. The object       of this investigation is to ascertain how far the presence
 of   a small     quantity of air affects the power of a cold surface to condense
 steam.       A priori it   seemed probable that      it might retard condensation very
 much     ;  for when pure      steam comes up to a cold surface and is condensed,
 it leaves an empty        space which is immediately       filled with fresh steam   ;  so
 that the      passage    of the   steam   up to the cold surface is unobstructed,
 and   if the surface could carry off the heat fast enough, then the rate of
 condensation would be unlimited.               If, however, the steam is mixed with
 air, then, as the mixture comes into contact with the cold surface, the steam
 will  be condensed and the           air will  be  left between the fresh     steam  and
 the cold surface      ;  so that after condensation       has commenced that surface
 will be protected by a stratum of air, and fresh steam will have either
 to displace this or pass through it before it in turn can be condensed.
     2. This question, besides its philosophical                interest, has important
 practical bearings on the steam-engine.
    First.    If  the quantity of air mixed with the steam            affects the rate at
 which it condenses, then the ratio which the pressure of air bears to the
 pressure of steam in a condenser will materially affect its efficiency : this
 is particularly important with reference to the surface-condenser.
    Second.     If air prevents     the condensation of steam, then by sending air
 into the boiler of a high-pressure engine, the condensation at the surface
 of the cylinder will be prevented, which, if allowed to occur, becomes
a source of great waste ; for when the steam comes into a cold cylinder
 it condenses, heating the cylinder and leaving water, which will again be
 evaporated as soon as the steam escapes ; and this, in evaporating, will
cool the cylinder.          By preventing this, the mixing of air with the steam
would effect the same object as the steam-jacket, only in a more efficient
manner       ; for the heat communicated to the steam               in the cylinder from
the jacket is not nearly so effective as that which is communicated from
the boiler, in consequence of the steam in the cylinder being at a lower
temperature than that in the boiler.
    3.  The experiments for this investigation were, by the kind permission
of Dr. Roscoe, carried out by Mr. Pasley, a student in the Chemical Labo
ratory of the Owens College ; and              I beg to tender him my best thanks.
    4. In making these experiments two objects were particularly kept
in view : —                                                                      *
    First. To ascertain if there is a great difference in the rate of conden
sation of pure steam and a mixture of steam and air — to ascertain in fact
whether pure steam condenses at an unlimited speed.

  Second. To ascertain if (and according to what law) the effect of air on
the condensation increases as the proportion of air to steam increases.
   5. Of these two undertakings    the first is much the most difficult.
The rate of condensation of pure steam is so great that it is practically
impossible to measure it ; and to institute a comparison between this
and the condensation of a mixture of steam and air is like comparing the
infinite with the finite.   It is practically impossible to keep any surface
cold when an unlimited supply of pure steam is condensed upon               so                          it.
that under such circumstances the quantity of pure steam condensed                                            is
limited by the power of the surface to carry off the heat.           The best
method of obtaining        qualitative result seems to be by introducing
                                a
sufficient cold water into flask of steam to condense
                                     a                      all, and ascertain   it
whether this condensation       effected suddenly or slowly.

     6.The presence of hot water in the flask with the steam very much
assists in ascertaining the rapidity of condensation.     When there        no                      is
hot water in the flask, the condensation by the injected water         only                   is              a
question of time the gauge will come to the same point whether the con

                 quick.   But    hot water

which     is   attained in the interval         will therefore depend on the rapidity                         of
condensation.          The interval            will be very short and the better the
                                                                             ;
vacuum the shorter          it   will     be   ;   so that     unless the condensation             is   very
sudden, there will be but a slight reduction of pressure.
  If, however, the condensation     really instantaneous,

allowed to cool and a little air was let in (about equal to half an inch                                      of
mercury in the gauge, or about        sixtieth of the volume of the flask).

this time, however, as the cold water entered the mercury did not rush
up the gauge, but rose slowly a small distance and there remained.
   8. This experiment shows, therefore, that there is a great difference in
the rates at which pure steam and steam with air condense on a cold
surface, so great in fact that the speed with pure steam must be regarded
as nearly infinite.
   9. To compare the various effects of different quantities of air, two
methods have been used, which may be described as    follows : —
   I. A surface-condenser is formed within the boiler or flask, so that the
steam may be condensed as fast as it is generated.       Then, when a flame
of a certain size acts on the boiler, the effect of the air is to cause the
pressure of steam in the flask to increase.     This method is founded on
the assumption that the rate at which steam will condense at a cold
surface     is,   cateris paribus, proportional to its pressure — an assumption
which      is   probably not far from the truth.
     II.   With the     same apparatus as   in method     I.   the rate of condensation
is   measured by the quantity of water condensed in given time, obtained
                                                                 a
by counting the drops from the condenser, the pressure within the flask
being kept constant.  This method does not involve any assumption    but                    ;
the conditions for its being accurate are such as cannot be obtained for                    ;
not only must the temperature of the condenser and the temperature of
the steam remain constant, but the pressure of the steam must also
remain constant, and       the two former conditions are fulfilled the latter

cannot be for the temperature of the steam will be the boiling-point of

air and steam must be constant, and therefore, as the pressure of the air in
creases, the pressure of the steam must decrease. This variation of pressure
is not very great and its effect may be allowed for on the assumption that
                        ;
the condensation     proportional to the pressure of steam.
                            is                                This    accom            is
plished     by
            dividing the drops by the pressure of the steam.
   These methods, neither of which, as           appears,
                                                     it      rigorous, seem
                                                                     is
nevertheless to be the best and fortunately the law which the effect of
                                      ;

                    ;
concordant for practical purposes.
   10. The apparatus employed in these experiments consisted of a glass
flask, in which    surface-condenser was formed of
                        a                               copper pipe passing
                                                                a
in and out through the cork. This pipe was kept cool by stream of              a
water, and was so fixed that all the condensed water dropped from
and the drops could be counted.         The flask was freed from air                             by it,
boiling; the volume of air passed into the flask could be accurately
measured     and ample time was allowed for the air in the flask to produce

     12. Table    I. shows the result of an experiment after the first method,
 during which the flame and condensation remained constant, whilst the
 pressure within the flask increased with the quantity of air.
     Table  II.  shows the result of an experiment after the second method,
 in which the pressure within the flask remained constant, whilst the flame
 and condensation were reduced as the air was admitted.               In this experi
 ment the rate at which the water             passed through   the condenser was
 constant     from first to last, and consequently the temperature of the
 effluent water varied with the condensation.
     Table III. shows the result of an experiment, also made according to
 the second method, but in which the quantity of water flowing through
 the condenser was so varied that the temperature of the effluent water
 remained constant.
     13. Each of these Tables shows the effect of air on the condensation in
a very definite manner; but the results as given in the column pa in
                                              DroDs
 Table I. cannot be compared with the               in Tables II. and    III.   as they

 stand ; for these show the effect of the air in a series of increasing figures.
If, however, these figures show the power of the air to diminish conden
sation, then they will be inversely proportional to the quantity of water
condensed, t. e. what would have been condensed if the pressure and
other things had remained constant.            Hence the numbers in the column
— should      be  proportional to the numbers in the column            — — in Tables
H. and HI.
    In order to    compare the results of these experiments, the results in each
Table have been multiplied by a common factor, so that they may be the
same when the pressure of air is one tenth that of the steam.                Thus the
numbers in the                  in Table I. have been multiplied by 2000, and

280        On the Condensation of Steam upon Cold Surfaces.                    [May   1,
   The point of no air might have been chosen as the point in which the
curves should coincide     ; but, as has been previously explained, the results
under such circumstances are to be taken as indicating the power of the
condenser    to  carry off the heat.        Had it been possible to            keep the
condenser cool, then there is reason to believe that there would               have been
no limit to the condensation       of pure steam, and that         the true form of  the
curves is like that shown by the dots.
                     Katio of the pressure of air to that of steam.
    Although the curves      do not coincide, yet they are all      of the   same form,
 and the difference between them is not greater than can be accounted                  for
 by the disturbing causes already mentioned.               They all show that         the
 effect of air begins to fall off rapidly when its pressure amounts to               one-
 tenth that of the steam, and that when it amounts to about one fourth
 that of the steam the admission of more air produces scarcely any effect.
    14. Conclusions. — The conclusions to be drawn from these experi
 ments are as follows    : —
    1.  That  a small quantity of air in       steam   does    very much retard its
 condensation upon a cold surface ; that, in fact, there is no limit to the

pressure of the air is one tenth that of the steam, or when about two

    15. Remarks. As this investigation      was nearly completed my atten
tion was called to a statement by Sir W. Armstrong, to the effect that
Mr. Siemens had suggested as an explanation of the otherwise anomalous
advantage of forcing air into the boiler of a steam-engine, that the air
may prevent, in a great measure, the condensation at the surface of the
cylinder.     It would thus seem that Mr. Siemens has already suggested
the probability of the fact which is proved in this investigation.          I  am
not aware, however, that any previous        experiments have been made on
the subject, and therefore   I  offer these results as independent testimony
of the correctness    of Mr. Siemens's views as well as of my own.

        Communicated by Sir B. C. Brodie, Bart., F.R.S. Received
        May 1, 1873.
    The action of induced electricity   on mixtures of certain gases has been
 lately  shown   by Sir Benjamin    Brodie (Proc. Eoy. Soc. April 3, 1873) to
yield very interesting results.
    An obvious application of his method was to treat a mixture of dry
 hydrogen and nitrogen in a similar manner as those referred to above,
 with the view of effecting the synthesis of ammonia ; and Sir B. Brodie
 kindly allowed me the use of his apparatus for the purpose of the
 experiment, which was conducted as follows : —
    A mixture of about three volumes of hydrogen with one of nitrogen in
 a bell- jar over water, was passed through two tubes containing pumice
 moistened with alkaline pyrogallate and sulphuric acid respectively, then
 through a Siemens induction-tube,        and into a bulb containing dilute
  hydrochloric acid.    The whole apparatus being first filled with pure
  hydrogen, about half a litre of the mixed gases was sent through the
  apparatus, the induction-coil not being in action ; the bulb containing
  the acid was then removed     and another substituted, containing an equal
  volume   of the same acid.

282       On the Effect      of Pressure on the Spectra   of Gases.   [May   1,
     About half    a  litre of the mixed  gases  was now passed   through   the
apparatus, submitting them to the action of the electricity.          The con
tents of the two bulbs were next transferred to two test-tubes      ; and after
adding excess of potash to each, Nessler's test was applied.          The  first
solution gave a faint yellow coloration, the second a rather thick reddish-
brown precipitate.
     No attempt was made to estimate the quantity of ammonia formed, as
it would vary with many of the conditions of the experiment.
     Since writing the account of the above experiment, which was made
 in Dr. Odling's laboratory at Oxford on March 24, I have seen in the
 ' Comptes Eendus ' for April 22, 1873, a note of an experiment by Messrs.
 Thénard of Paris, in which they observe the formation of traces of
ammonia by the action of electricity on a mixture of hydrogen and
nitrogen ; but no details of the mode of operating are given.
 III. " On the Effect of Pressure        on the Character    of the  Spectra of
        Gases."      By C. H. Stearn and G. H. Lee. Communicated
        by W. Huggins, F.R.S.           Received March 19, 1873.
     The variations in the spectra of gases which accompany changes of
density have been studied by Pliicker and Hittorf, Frankland and
Lockyer, Wiillner and others.
     It appears to us that one cause to which these changes may be due
has been overlooked, and that many of the observed variations are entirely
independent of the density of the gas.        If a Leyden jar be placed in the
circuit, and the current from an induction-coil be passed through a
Pliicker's tube containing nitrogen with the traces of hydrogen generally
present, the following well-known phenomena are observed.
    When the gas is near atmospheric pressure, the line-spectrum of
nitrogen is brilliant, and the F line of hydrogen is broad and nebulous.
As the pressure is reduced, the lines of nitrogen gradually fade out, and
the band-spectrum appears, while at the same time the F line of hydrogen
becomes narrow and well defined.          If fresh gas be admitted, the line-
spectrum reappears, accompanied by a widening of the F line.
    That these changes are not dependent on the density of the gas,
appears from the following experiment : —
    A sealed tube containing nitrogen, with traces of hydrogen at a
pressure of about 2 millims., was placed before the spectroscope. A
second tube was connected with the air-pump, and the current passed
through both tubes, a Leyden jar being placed in the circuit.
    When the pressure in the second tube was high, the line-spectrum of
nitrogen appeared brilliantly in the sealed tube, and the F line was broad
and nebulous     ;  as the exhaustion proceeded these lines faded out, and the
F   line became    narrow, in precisely the same manner as if the sealed   tube
had been in process of exhaustion.        The explanation appears to be     thai

1873.]          On the Electrical Resistance      of Selenium.           283
the production of the line-spectrum of nitrogen, and the expansion of
the F line of hydrogen, depend entirely on the intensity of the charge
communicated to the Leyden jar. When the pressure of the gas between
the electrodes is high, the discharge does not take place until the jar is
fully charged ; but as the exhaustion proceeds a less and less charge is
communicated to the jar, and the discharge at last is virtually not more
than that of the simple current.
    The same effect may be produced by interposing a break in the circuit,
the length of which may be increased as the pressure in the tube is re
duced.    Pliicker and Hittorf appear to have used a break, as in their
paper in the Philosophical Transactions, Nov. 1864, they speak of the ex
pansion of lines obtained by increasing the charge of the jar by an inter
posed stratum of air.     They do not, however, appear to have noticed that
the reduction of pressure in the tube was only equivalent to a diminution
of the charge of the jar, and that to this cause many of the changes of
spectra which accompany the reduced pressure ought to be ascribed.
    We are continuing our experiments on the effect of temperature on
the spectrum, but prefer to reserve this portion of the subject for the
present.

    The following communications     were read  : —
 I. " The   Action of Light on the Electrical Resistance of Sele
       nium."     By Lieut. Sale, R.E.           Communicated by J. N.
       Lockyer, F.R.S. Received March 28, 1873.
    It having been recently brought to notice that selenium in the crys
talline condition exhibits the remarkable property of having a conduc
tivity varying with the degree of light to which it is exposed, the fol
lowing experiments were undertaken with a view to the further elucida
 tion of the matter : —
    Experiment 1. — A bar of crystalline selenium measuring approximately
 1-5" X "5" x "05" was procured, and platinum wire terminals were fastened
 to the ends.
    The bar itself was then enclosed in a box having a draw-lid, so as to
 admit or exclude the light at pleasure.
    Then, the lid of the box being on, the resistance of the selenium was
 measured by means of a high-resistance galvanometer and a Wheat-
 stone's bridge, with dial-coils capable of measuring up to 10,000,000 ohms.
 The battery-power was 2 cells Daniel!.
    The measurement was made on a dull cloudy day, and in           a room of
 equable temperature.
    The resistance having been carefully balanced, the lid of the box was
 withdrawn, when the resistance of the selenium fell instantaneously and

considerably, as indicated by the rapid movement of the spot of light             on
the galvanometer-scale.
   Experiment 2. — The transition from darkness to the light given by              an
ordinary gas-burner (conditions       as  before), caused a slight and barely
perceptible fall in the resistance.
   Experiment 3. — The bar of selenium was next tried in the solar             spec
trum on a very bright cloudless day (conditions as before), except              that
more battery-power was used (10 cells Daniell).
   The diffused daylight could not be cut off ; so the trial was made in         the
most shaded part of an ordinary room, the spectrum being superimposed
on the ordinary diffused daylight.
   The resistances were very carefully balanced in each            case, with the
following results : —

              after exposure (resistance rising)               310,000
   The indications were very clear ; and the bar of selenium was so sensi
tive to the action of the spectrum, that a slight movement of the prism
produced a corresponding movement in the spot of light on the galvano
meter-scale.
   It is to be noted that in this experiment the reflecting galvanometer
was placed on a heavy masonry pillar insulated from the floor for obser
vatory purposes, and that the battery, bar of selenium, and resistance-
coils were in another room, being connected by long and carefully               in
sulated leads with the galvanometer.
   Experiment 4. —The diffused light was cut off as much as possible             by
screens  ; and the resistances were again balanced in the solar         spectrum.

    Experiment 5. —The selenium was also exposed to the spectrum                of
the electric light in a darkened room.
    The effect was feeble  ;   but by using more battery-power      in balancing,
it was possible to measure the swing of the spot of light when the
selenium was suddenly exposed to the action of the light of the spectrum.
    The maximum effect was obtained in, or just at the edge of the red,
the violet and blue rays producing scarcely any effect.
    Experiment 6. —The selenium was exposed to the full sunlight ; the
resistance fell enormously and instantaneously, and on balancing it was
found to be little more than half what       it was in the darkness.
    The following were the general results of the experiments : —
    Results. — (1) That the resistance of selenium is largely affected by ex
posure to light.
    (2) That this effect is not produced by the actinic rays, but is at a
maximum at, or just outside the red rays, at a place nearly coincident
with the locus of the maximum of the heat-rays.
    (3) That the effect of varying resistances is certainly not due to any
 change of temperature in the bar of selenium.
    (4) That the effect produced on exposure to light is sensibly instanta
neous, but that, on cutting off the light, the return to the normal re
 sistance is not so rapid.
    It would seem that there exists a power in rays nearly coincident with
 the heat-rays of high intensity, of altering instantaneously and without
 change of temperature the molecular condition of this particular element.

    The observations in this paper are a continuation of those referred to in
 the previous communication bearing the same title. They deal (1) with
 the spectra of chemical compounds, and (2) with the spectra of mecha
 nical mixtures.
                             I. Chemical Compounds.
    Several series of salts were observed      ; these series may be divided into
 two : — 1st, those in which the atomic weights varied in each series       ; 2nd,
those in which the associated elements varied in each series.                 The
 following salts were mapped       : —
 Pb F„ Pb CI,, Pb Bra, Pb I, ; Sr F„ Sr CI,, Sr Br„ Sr I, ;                 Ba F„
       Ba Cl„ Ba Br., Ba I, ; Mg F„ Mg Cl„ Mg Bra, Mg I,                  ;  Na F,
       NaCl, NaBr, Na I.
 The conditions of the experiments are described.           The same aluminium
 cups, described in the first paper, were used ; and the poles were arranged

  286             Mr.  J. N. Lockyer     on Spectrum- Analysis.         [May     8,
 in such   a manner    that they could at will be surrounded with any gas or
  vapour.    Hydrogen was used in some of these experiments ; it was puri
  fied in the usual manner by drying and freeing from traces of sulphu
 retted hydrogen ; it was then passed over clean cut pieces of sodium,          and
  admitted to the poles. An induction-spark from 5 one-pint Grove             cells
 was used, the circuit being without the Leyden jar.
     The lead compounds behaved (in air) as follows : —
     The fluoride gave the eleven longest lines of the metal ; but four were
 very faint.
     The chloride gave nine lines ; one of these was very short.
     The bromide gave six lines ; but one was a mere dot on the pole.
     The iodide gave four lines distinctly and two as dots, one of which was
 scarcely visible.
     It is pointed out that the decrease in length and number             of  lines
 follows the increase in the atomic weight of the non-metallic           element,
 the lines dying out in the order of their length.
     Barium was next experimented on, the same series of salts being used.
 A marked departure from the results obtained in the case of the lead
 compounds was observed, especially in the case of the fluoride, its
 spectrum being much the simplest ; in fact it consisted of only 4 lines.
 Strontium behaved like barium; and so did magnesium fluoride.                This
 anomalous behaviour was found to be most probably due to the ex
 ceedingly refractory nature of these fluorides, all of them being quite in
fusible, and non-volatile in any spark that was used.
     Sodic fluoride, sodic chloride, sodic bromide, and sodic iodide exhi
 bited a behaviour exactly the reverse of that of lead ;       i. e.  the iodide
 showed most of the metallic spectrum.
     The difference between flame-spectra and those produced by a weak
electric discharge are then discussed.       Beads of the chlorides &c. were
heated in a Bunsen gas-flame ; Bala gave a " structure
                                                             "
                                                               spectrum (since
proved to be due to the oxide) and the line at wave-length 5534-5,
by very far the longest metallic line of barium.            The bromide be
haved like the iodide ; and so did the chloride, except that its spectrum
was more brilliant.       Baric fluoride gave scarcely a trace of a spectrum,
the oxide structure being scarcely visible, and 5534-5 very faint indeed.
The strontium salts follow those of barium — 4607-5, the longest strontium
line, appearing in conjunction with an oxide spectrum.             The strontic
fluoride,   however, refused to give any spectrum whatever.                 These
results   are compared with those obtained with the weak spark, and it
is shown that the difference is one of degree : e. g. baric bromide gives
25 lines in the spark ; these are the longest lines.     In the flame it gives
but one line   ; but this is the longest of all the barium lines, and indeed
very far   exceeds  all the others in length.    When the flame-spectra are
compared with those produced by the low-tension spark, the spectra of
the metals in the combination are in the former case invariably more
simple than in the latter, so that only the very longest line or lines are bfl.

   Some experiments made by        Mr. E.   J. Iriswell to determine the cause of
the similarity of the spectra       of the various salts of the same metal
observed   in air are then given, the conclusion        being that the spectrum
observed is really that of the oxide.
   Kirchhoff and Bunsen's, Mitscherlich's, and Clifton and Eoscoe's prior
conclusions on the points investigated are stated at length ; and it is
shown that the observations recorded, taken in conjunction with the
determination     of the long and short lines of metallic vapours, are in
favour of the views advanced by Mitscherlich, Clifton, and Eoscoe.               For
while the spectra of the iodides, bromides, &c. of any element in air
are the same, as stated by Kirchhoff and Bunsen, the fact that this is
not the spectrum of the metal is established by the other fact, that only the
very longest lines of the metal are present, increased     dissociation bringing    in
the other metallic lines in the order of their length.
   The spectra have been mapped with the salts in hydrogen : here the
spectra are different, as stated by Mitscherlich ; and the metallic lines are
represented   according to the volatility of the compound,     only  the very longest
lines being visible in the case of the least-volatile one.
   The following are the conclusions arrived at :—
   1.  A  compound body has as definite a spectrum as a simple one ; but
while   the spectrum of the latter consists of lines, the number and
thickness    of some of which increase with molecular approach, the
spectrum of a compound consists in the main of channelled spaces and
bands, which increase in like manner.              In short, the molecules of a
simple body and of a compound one are affected in the same manner
by their approach or recess, so far as their spectra are concerned;
in  other words, both spectra have their long and short lines or bands.            In
each case the greatest simplicity of the spectrum depends upon the
greatest separation of molecules, and the greatest complexity (a con
tinuous spectrum) upon their nearest approach.
   2. The    heat required to act upon a compound, so as to render its
spectrum    visible,  dissociates the compound according to its volatility:
the number of true metallic lines which thus appear is a measure of the
dissociation   ; and doubtless    as the metal lines     increase in number the
compound bands thin out.
   Mitscherlich's observations, that the metalloids show the same structural
spectra as the compound bodies, is then referred to, and the question is
asked whether the molecules of a metalloid do not in structure lie be
tween those of elements on the "one hand and of compounds on the other.
   These considerations are applied to solar and stellar spectra ; the
general appearance of the solar spectrum shows that in all probability
there are no compounds in the sun.
   Secchi's maps of a large number of stellar spectra are referred to as
now indicating beyond all doubt the existence of compound vapours in

the atmosphere of some stars ; and it is suggested that the phenomena of
variable stars may be due to a delicate state of equilibrium in the
temperature of a star, which now produces the great absorption of               the
compound and now that of the elemental molecules.
                            II.  Mechanical Mixtures.
    The second part of the paper deals with the mechanical              mixtures.
Maps of the spectra of alloys of the following percentages are         given  : —
            Sn and Cd      percentages of Cd     10-0, 5-0, 1-0, 0-15.
            Pb and Zn          „      „     Zn   10-0, 5-0, 1-0, 0-1.
            Pb and Mg          „      „     Mg 10-0, 1-0, 0-1, 0-01.
    It  is pointed  out that the lines disappear from the spectrum as the
percentage becomes less, the shortest lines disappearing first —and that
although we have here the foreshadowing of a quantitative spectrum-
analysis, the method is so rough as to be inapplicable.
    It is then stated that further researches on a method which promises
much greater accuracy are in progress.
    The bearing of these results on our knowledge of the reversing           layer
of the sun's atmosphere is then discussed.

 which    are generally   known by the vague and convenient             names      of
 " Fucoids," " Annelide-burrows," and " tracks."          After expressing        his
 opinion that the first step towards the study of      these obscure fossils lies
 in the provisional grouping and naming of the more marked forms which
 are already known to exist, the author proceeds to divide the remains
 under consideration into two great groups.        In the first of these groups
 are those fossils which are truly the burrows of marine worms, as distin
 guished from mere trails and surface-tracks.          Some of these burrows
 (Scolithus) are more or less nearly vertical in direction as regards the
 strata in which they are found ; and they are to be looked upon as being
 true burrows of habitation.          In this section are placed the genera
 Scolithus, Arenicolites, and Histioderma.      Other burrows are of a totally

 different nature from the preceding, and may reasonably be compared to
 the  burro ws of the recent lobworms.           These burrows run more or less hori
 zontally as compared       with the laminae of deposition, or they penetrate the
 strata obliquely.       They are not burrows of habitation, but are wandering
 tunnels excavated by the worm in its search after food.                   The fossils of
this group, therefore, as preserved to us, are not the actual burrows
themselves, but the burrows filled up with the sand or mud which the
 worm has passed through its alimentary canal.                    The burrows of this
kind (including many forms previously described under the names of
 Chondrites,    Palceophyeus, &c.), the         author    groups   together    under the
name    of Planolites.
    The second great group of Annelide-remains                       comprises genuine
surface-trails    or " tracks," which of necessity never pass below the surface
of   the bed on which they occur.                 Some of these remains, such as
Crcssojpodia,   are, beyond doubt, due to the operation of marine Annelides ;
but it may be a matter of question whether we have in these cases the
actually petrified body of the worm, or merely the track produced by the
passage   of the animal over the surface of the mud or sand.                 The author,
however, gives reasons        for  believing    that  the   latter  explanation is truly
the correct one.          Other fossils belonging to this group (such as
Mi/rianites)    are equally, beyond doubt, produced by the operations of
marine animals ; but it remains quite uncertain whether they have been
formed by Annelides, Crustaceans,                 or Mollusks.        Lastly, there are
remains which appear to be really casts of the surface-trails of Annelides
or other marine       creatures, and which, therefore, are elevated above the
surface of the bed on which they occur.                Such remains may readily be
confounded      with those belonging          to the genus Planolites, from which
they are only distinguishable        by the fact that they are strictly confined to
a  single  surface    of deposition.         To fossils of this nature the author
proposes to    restrict the generic title of       Nemertites.
   Finally, the author describes some singular tracks apparently produced
by Crustaceans belonging to the genus Ceratiocaris, and for which he
proposes the generic name of Caridolites.

   The object of this paper is to describe experiments made at intervals
from 1870 to 1872 in the Physical Laboratory of Glasgow University to
determine the relation between the fundamental units in the two systems
of absolute electrical measurement, the electromagnetic and the electro
static.    A summary is also given of the results of similar observations
made by W. F. King in 1867 and 1868.

  1873.]                   Units in the Electromagnetic        Unit.               291
     The two systems of electrical          measurement, or the units which they
  employ, are founded        on the fundamental units of time, mass, and space
 applied to the observed effects           of electricity at rest and electricity in
 motion.       The dimensions of quantity in the two systems are such that
 the  ratio of the electromagnetic and the electrostatic unit of quantity is
 expressible as a velocity.
    This velocity, usually known as v, is not only of great importance
in all combinations        of electromagnetic and electrostatic action, but it is
also of great scientific importance           in the theory of the propagation of
electromagnetic       disturbances through a dielectric medium.          It occupies a
very   important place in the development of the electromagnetic theory
of light by Professor Clerk Maxwell, according to whose theory this
velocity v is the same as the velocity of light.
   The first experimental        determination of v was made by Weber from a
common       electrostatic   and electromagnetic measure of capacity.          As the
result of Weber's experiments, v was found to be 310-74 x 10H centims.
per second.
   Another determination was made by Prof. Clerk Maxwell in 1868, by
means     of a direct comparison of electrostatic attraction with electro
magnetic      repulsion.      His experiments      gave   f=288xl08      centims. per
second.
   The value      of  v given   by the experiments here described is 293 x 10a
centims.     per second.       The method employed was that of obtaining an
absolute     electrostatic   and an absolute electromagnetic measurement of
the same      electromotive force.      v is defined as the ratio of the units of
quantity    in  the  two  systems   ; but  it follows from the definition of electro
motive force, that v is also the ratio of the units of electromotive force in
the two    systems.
   The electromotive force, or the difference         of potentials between the two
poles   of a constant Daniell's battery, was measured electrostatically by
means of Sir William Thomson's absolute electrometer.                   The absolute
electromagnetic       value of this electromotive force was given by the effect
of the   current which it maintained in the circuit of an electrodynamo-
meter.     The determination of this value depended on the resistance of the
electrodynamometer-circuit, which was reckoned in terms of the absolute
value of the British-Association          standard unit of resistance.       Any cor
rection which may hereafter be found to be applicable to the absolute
value   of this standard coil, as measured at King's College by Professors
Clerk Maxwell, Balfour Stewart, and Fleeming Jenkin, must be applied
to the   value of v given above.
   The comparisons          made in 1867 and 1868 by        Mr. King     gave  as  the
mean    value of v, 284-6 x 10* centims. per second.
   The experiments made           in 1870 with the new absolute electrometer
gave as    the mean result v=294-5 x 10s centims. per second. The result

  A  mystery has pervaded the history and character of this almost un
known mineral (the very name of which is mis-spelled " Syepoorite                                          *),
which was scarcely to have been expected from English mineralogists. as

of which an analysis             is   here submitted.

with bevelled or truncated edges, and some octahedrons.     As these modi

of the former from the latter.

of them crushed in a Plattner's steel mortar, produced a powder weighing
only 36 mgrs.         This powder is blue-black and semimetallic, like that
made from galena        ;  it adheres to every thing it touches, soiling paper like
graphite — a property not possessed by the crystals.             Neither the roasted

Proceedings of the Eoyal Society, No. 137, vol. xx. par. 89) a very slight

changes its semimetallic appearance for the sooty black one of protoxide
of cobalt; for sulphides, arsenides, &c. thus roasted do not "sinter."

intimately with a quantity of the Freiberg rust and water ; and when
carefully ignited on a new platinum tray, it deposited exactly similar

  (13) Three large selected crystals of Jeypoorite were added, one by
one, to a phosphoric acid bead of 50 mgrs. in an O. P.  These weighed
3-2 mgrs.         They all at first emitted   bubbles of gas (S03 ?), and

case of the first crystal.  The second crystal coloured the glass a much
deeper red ; and when the third had been dissolved in the glass, it assumed
the splendid red-violet hue of cobalt (vide " Pyrology," par. 35).
   (14) It took exactly 2-5 mgrs. of pure cobalt oxide to give to a 50 mgr.
P glass laid alongside of (13) on a sheet of white paper, and also viewed
withit by transmitted light, the same colour.

  (15) It took 21 mgrs. of carbonate of soda to azurize bead (14), but
only 20 mgrs. to azurize (13) ; so that there was slightly more acid in the
former bead.
  (16) The bead (14) weighed, after the soda had been added, 77 mgrs.,
while (13) bead weighed 75 mgrs.   They had both been kept up to the
mark by  the means mentioned in par. 78 of the paper on " Pyrology."
   (17) As this percentage of cobalt seemed too high compared with that
recorded in works on mineralogy from Middleton's analysis above cited,                            I
made the following second assay, in a manner slightly differing from the
preceding.        Inorder also to guard against the possibility of loss of any
cobalt    from its fusion in the form of arsenide with the red-hot platinum-
wire, the     glass with a Jeypoorite crystal on its surface was manipulated
in such a manner that the      lower surface of the bead just touched the upper
surface of the jet, in which position the ring of the platinum-wire never
even approaches a red heat, being kept comparatively cool by the action of
the superposed blast (par. 7, " Pyrology "), which cuts the heat off from it ;
while sufficient heat is imparted to the      P glass to dissolve most sub
stances,     which,  even metals, cannot under these conditions attack or
combine       with the platinum, although, lightened by the loss of volatile
on bright  silver foil with distilled water, gave a brown stain of AgS quite as strong as
that afterwards   afforded by Jeypoorite, to which, therefore, if this soda had been used,
double the amount of sulphur it really contains might have been attributed.      The same
?oda fused on platinum wire gave no stain whatever to silver.
   A glass of pure boric acid fused in O.P. on this charcoal detects in its ash (" Pyro-
'°67." par- 65) silica, lime (in considerable quantity), magnesia, and protoxide of iron ;
while soda, as above-mentioned,      shows it to contain sulphur, or sulphuric acid, and
also shows its iron, which gives the soda a pale salmon-colour.          The Government
gunpowder       is,

matter, or raised by the boiling of fresh P added, the metallic mass or
ball rises to or touches the platinum wire.             The glass is thus made to
act as a miniature test-tube, with this advantage, that.any novel reaction
or peculiarity    can, by removing it from the pyrocoue, be immediately
preserved for inspection, like a fly in amber.
   (18) (a) 2-4 mgrs. of pure cobalt oxide were taken to standardire an
assumed 50-mgr. I- glass with an apparent red-violet colour.
   (6) It took four Jeypoorite crystals, weighing 3-2 mgrs.,                     to bring
another     P  glass, also measured only by the eye, to a similar colour*.

methods small quantities of sulphur and sublimates ; but, assuming the
percentage of cobalt oxide in Jeypoorite to be about 82, of the remaining

antimony, with very little sulphur— certainly not more than 5 per cent. ;
so that  I would temporarily, until a sufficient quantity of the pure mineral

   (20) The garlic smell of volatilizing arsenic is only obtainable from
Jeypoorite by heating the mineral carefully with a ball of gold upon
charcoal.     Plattner used gold for separating copper from its arsenide and
that of nickel (vide his 'Nickel and Cobalt Assay,' page 616 etseq.); but
he fuses the arsenides with the gold in borax, in which condition it would
appear that the gold takes up some arsenic and retains it (vide Gmelin's
'
  Chemistry,' vol. vi. p. 238, English translation).           My use of gold, on
the contrary, is more mechanical than chemical, for the gold ball (weigh
ing about 100 mgrs.) is placed in a round cavity made in a charcoal
mortar (" Pyrology," par. 88) slightly larger than its diameter, and a
crystal of Jeypoorite put on the offside or rear, i. e. the side away from the
blast.   The whole front of the mortar is now covered with an H. P.
not too strong (fig. 8, " Pyrology "), when the gold becomes red-hot, but
does not fuse.     The cobalt of the arsenide has now a tendency to reduction.
and to join the gold in a metallic state, while the arsenic is volatilized by

found that, thus roasted, Jeypoorite considerably, and even pure SbaO,

not do so         at all.

298                    Mr. C. Meldrum            on a connexion            [May     15,
   With this idea, it was      some time ago determined to discuss the cyclones
that had occurred during the last twenty-five years in the Southern Indian
Ocean, and it was found, what had been often surmised, that they were
more frequent and more violent in the maxima than in the minima                    sun-
spot years.
   It is well known that the cyclones of the Indian Ocean are attended
with much rain, which is not confined to the body of the storm, but ex
tends over wide areas. Tears remarkable for cyclones, therefore, should
be also years remarkable        for rain ; but to test this inference, with regard
to the Indian Ocean, we had no rainfall statistics, except eighteen years'
observations at Mauritius : and these were in every respect favourable,
the rainiest years having been those in which cyclones were most abun
dant.    In the absence of other data, the Brisbane and Adelaide rainfalls
were consulted ; and it was found that, like the Mauritius rainfall, they indi
cated a periodicity.       It was then surmised that there might be           a rainfall
periodicity generally, and that, if such was the case, both it and the cy
clone periodicity were concomitant effects of one and the same cause.
This supposition having been strengthened by the results of an examina
tion of the rainfall of England, it was resolved to examine all the rainfall-
tables (containing one or more sun-spot periods) that could be obtained.
   The first step was to ascertain whether there was any marked differ
ence in the amount of rainfall at or about the turning-points of the sun-
spot period.       This has been done for eighteen stations by adding the
rainfall in the three principal years of maxima, and in the three principal
years of minima sun-spots, and then comparing the results.                The follow
ing  Table  gives   the  stations and    the  years of observation :  —

  300                  Mr. C. Meldruni             on a connexion                 [May 15,
 or minimum year in the middle.              This happens in the following cases :—
 In  the  Aberdeen   series,    1865-67     has   been taken for 1866-68, because we
 have not the observations          for 1868.            In the Deanston-House series
  1837-39 has been taken for        1836-38,        the series commencing with 1837.
 In the Demerara observations 1854-56 has been taken in place of 1855-57,
 the series ending with 1856.           The years 1870-72 have, in the Mauritius
 series, been taken for three maxima-years ; but if 1872 be the maximum-
 sunspot year, and the three principal maxima-years be 1871-73, the rain
 fall for these years will probablybe still greater; for since the 1st of January
 1873, 38 inches of rain have fallen.              The means of two years have been
 taken in the Brisbane observations, the series commencing with 1860 and
 ending with 1871. In the Calcutta and Toronto series we have taken the
 one maximum-period, and the mean of the two minima-periods.
    These slight deviations,      as   will  be afterwards         seen, do not affect       the
 general results.
    Now, collecting the sums of the rainfall in the maxima- and                      minima-
 periods of three years each, we get the following Table : —

   The   above Table comprises the results of              all the rainfall-tables     I   can
find containing a maximum- and a minimum-period.                        Now we see that,
in the maximum-sunspot periods of three years each, the rainfall at the
eighteen stations was 395-85 inches greater than in the lrunimum-sunspot

1873.]          between   Rainfall and Sun-spot Periodicity.                    301
periods of three years each, and, which is still more striking, that the ex
cess is on the side of the maxima-periods at fifteen out of the eighteen
stations.
   In  the last three columns        I have given the total rainfall for the single
maxima-years       1817, 1830, 1837, 1849, and 1860, and for the single
minima-years     1823, 1834, 1844, 1856, and 1857, with the excesses and
defects ; and we find a total excess of 105-36 inches in favour of the
maxima-years, only five stations showing an excess on the other side.
   The unfavourable stations are Toronto, Calcutta, and Natal ; and it
should be remarked that at Toronto the snow was not melted, but one
tenth of its depth taken to represent an equivalent depth of water, while
Mr. Blarifone, the meteorological reporter to the Bengal Government,
has expressed a doubt as to the accuracy of the Calcutta observations in
the earlier part of the series. If, however, we had taken the years 1847-49
in place of 1848-50 for the maximum-period, the Calcutta observa
tions would have given a different result.              With regard to Natal, the
geographical peculiarities described by Dr. Maun probably render that
station unfavourable for showing in a few years any periodicity that may
exist.
   Having ascertained, then, that there is at nearly all the above stations
a very remarkable difference in the amount of rainfall at or near the
turning-points of the sun-ppot period, the next step is to find the effect
of grouping the observations.              For this purpose we give, in the first
place,  the  rainfall at as  many      stations as possible in each minimum-sun-
spot year, and in each two or three years on either side of it ; and, in the
second place, we give the rainfall for each maximum-year and two or
three years on either side of it. If we do not find any tendency to
an equalization of the annual rainfall, we shall have further proof of a
periodicity.

  The last      four Tables show an increase of rain at or very near the
maximum-sunspot year ; and there                         is,   upon the whole,        a     distinct ten
dency to an ascent and descent.
  Comparing Tables          IX.            XIII.,
                                  we find that the mean rainfall in the
                                   and
minimum-sunspot  years 1834, 1844,  1856, and 1866 was 27-38 inches,
and in the maximum-sunspot  years 1836, 1848, and 1861, 35"83 inches,
giving an excess of 8-45 inches.
   With the exception of 1842, all the years of minimum and maximum
rainfall shown by the Tables are within   fraction of the corresponding
                                                               a
minmum- and maximum-sunspot year.
  The last Table       Ibeg to present          is    one showing the annual fall at eighteen
stations.      An inspection of            it   will show that, generally,5 the maxima-
periods                      each more rainfall than any other three con
           of those years give
secutive years, and  the  minima-periods less rain than any other three
consecutive years, in each set of observations.
  There    are no doubt errors of observation, as well as discrepancies,
arising from changing the forms and positions of the gauges and                              ;          it   is

                the Heating of       a                         By
       Balfour Stewart, M.A., F.R.S., Professor of Natural Phi
       losophy in Owens College, Manchester, and P. G. Tait, M.A.,
       Professor of Natural Philosophy in the University of Edin
       burgh. Received April 10, 1873.
  26.   In two previous communications (Proc. Eoy. Soc. June 15, 1865,
and   No. 88, 1866) to this Society, we gave an account of some experi
ments which we had made upon the heating of a disk through rotation
in vacuo. In these experiments the increase of radiation of the heated
disk was observed by means of a delicate thermopile and galvanometer.
Three aluminium disks of various thicknesses and one ebonite disk were
used ; and the results derived from the experiments were as follows : —
  (1) The heating effect observed appeared to be independent of the
density, and of the chemical constitution, of the residual air and vapour
surrounding the disks.
   (2) The quantity of heat developed under similar circumstances of
rotation in three aluminium disks -05, '0375, '025 of an inch in thickness
respectively appeared to be the same, inasmuch as the relative thermo-
metric effect for these disks varied inversely as their thickness.
  (3) Besides the heating effect alluded to in (1) and (2), there was
found to be, when the vacuum had been recently made, a strictly tempo
rary effect, sometimes in the direction of heat, sometimes in that of cold,
owing probably to the condensation or evaporation of small quantities of
aqueous vapour ; but this effect was only noticeable during rotation, dis
appearing the moment the motion was stopped.
   27. The experiments described in these communications were resumed
in 1870.  In the interval an addition had been made to the apparatus, in
virtue of which an ordinary carbonic-acid vacuum might be subjected to
the influenceof a vessel containing potash allowed to open in and thus     it,
to absorb as much as possible of the remaining gas.
  On May       4
               a    carbonic-acid vacuum was obtained         bythis means (pres
sure 0-05 in.). A disk made of cartridge-paper,            when made to rotate in
this vacuum, gave      very perceptible result.
                          a                      Carbonic acid was then
allowed to enter the vacuum until the pressure became 0-65 in. The
consequence of this increased pressure was in this instance an increase in
          which was probably of permanent nature, inasmuch as
the effect,                               a                   re                 it
mained after three days. Unfortunately the exact increase was not
noted;   but   it   is   believed that the heat-indication    became   about three
times as great  in consequence of the additional pressure.
   28. On May 11 another carbonic-acid vacuum was made (pressure
0-12 in.), and at the suggestion of Professor Maxwell        sulphuric-acid
                                                                   a
gauge  was  placed  in the receiver.  A  rotation  was then made   and the  ;
result of the rotation was    hardly perceptible rise in the sulphuric-acid
                                 a
                                                                   2   o   2

310           Messrs. Stewart and      Tait on the Heating     of a    [May 15,
gauge. We may therefore imagine that the residual air was not greatly
heated.
     29. On May 16 another carbonic-acid vacuum was obtained (pressure
0- 08 in.), and with an ebonite disk of about         inch thickness, the heat-
indication was 16. Carbonic acid was introduced until the pressure was
1- 6 in.; but the indication was only 18.        This result is in conformity
with our previous experiments, in which an increase of pressure of the
residual air produced little or no effect.
     30. The ebonite disk was likewise tried in a carbonic-acid vacuum,
 pressure 0-04 in. ; and also in one, pressure 0-02 in., which was the
 lowest we could obtain.        The result of these experiments appeared to
 show that in all probability the cartridge-paper disk radiated more than
 twice as much as the thin ebonite disk.      The experiments were put a stop
 to by a collapse of the glass receiver during rotation, fortunately with
 out injuring any one present.
      31. In June 1871 the experiments were resumed.           In the meantime
 Mr. Beckley       had fitted  the apparatus   with  an  arrangement working
 through a barometer-tube, by means of which, instead of trusting to ra
 diation, the disk itself might, after rotation, be tapped by means of the
 pile, which could be brought up to it and then withdrawn. By this
  means a much larger effect might be obtained ; and it became possible, by
 varying the adjustment, to find according to what law the heat effect
  varies with the distance from the centre.
      32. These experiments were conducted in the following manner:—
  The disk was first of all tapped before rotation several times ; at each
  tapping the momentary swing of the needle was recorded, and the mean
  of the readings was regarded     as indicating the state of the disk with re
  spect   to heat.
      The disk was next tapped after rotation, and the difference between
  the readings before and after was taken as indicating the change in the
  state of the disk produced by rotation.     In the later experiments the disk
  bsfore rotation    was   kept in slight motion in order to equalize any ten
  dency to unequal heating of its various parts ; but this was not done in
  the experiments of June 1871. In these experiments (June 1871) the
  disk was of brown paper, and the results obtained were as follows :— For
  a carbonic-acid vacuum (pressure 0-065 in.) a swing of 307 divisions was
  recorded, while for a hydrogen vacuum (pressure 0-150
                                                                   in.) a swing of
   281 divisions was recorded.     Each result was the mean of three rotations.
       33. The next experiments were made in January 1872.           The galvano
   meter was one of Thomson's, but more adapted for battery currents, and
   hence not in a very delicate state for these experiments ; the time of
   vibration of the needle was 3 seconds. The disk used was of ebonite
   (thickness about ^ in.). The ebonite of this disk was completely black;
   and in this respect, as well as in being thinner, it differed from the
  ebonite disk first used in the radiation-experiments
                                                          (art. 17). In the pre

distance of 1-5 in. from the rim.   The amount and velocity of rotation
were represented        turns of the handle, or 3750 turns of the disk, in
                           by 30
about 40 seconds.   The following results were obtained, a result repre
senting on an average somewhat more than four rotations : —

     It       thus appear that the results derived by tapping are very
           would
different from the radiation-results, inasmuch as in the former the effect
of the pressure and quality of the residual air is very apparent, while in
the radiation-results it is hardly perceptible.  A probable explanation of
this will be given afterwards (art. 46) ; but in the mean time, in view of
these results, it will be expedient to discuss them quite independently
and by themselves, with the view of ascertaining whether they can best
be  explained by a gas-effect alone, or whether they likewise indicate                                               a
residual effect independent of gas.
     34.   With this object let us take                  (Alii?)    as representing             the whole
tffeet at a      pressure of           in., due to whatever        cause       or   causes.      We thus
obtain

we obtain
                                               Dry hydrogen.       Dry air.          Dry carbonic        acid.

  Finally, let us regard as unknown residual effect the difference between
the whole effect and the gas-effect, and we obtain

     35.Similar experiments with the same galvanometer were made with
a  disk of cartridge-paper, of which the pores were filled with solid
paraffin.   And here we may mention that in all experiments with paper
disks     small wooden attachment was placed at some little distance be
           a
hind the disk and at the height of the pile, and against this the disk was
pressed        during tapping — care being taken that the disk did not touch                                 it
during         motion, but only when     was pressed against
                                                   it              bringing up      it   by
the   pile.
     With this paper disk the amount and speed of motion were represented
 by  30 turns. of the handle, or 3750 turns of the disk, in 30 seconds. Tho

  36. Now,         if     we suppose that there                        is    only one effect due to                  gas,    it
follows   :—
   (a) That the proportion between the effects due to the various gases
experimented on (and all of the same pressure)      nevertheless different            is
for the two disks.
   (/3) That the proportion (for the same disk) between the effects due
                                                                                                                             to

   If, however, we suppose that there are two effects, one of which                                                   is
                                                                                                                      in
dependent of the residual gas, we find —                           :
  (a) That, as regards the gas-effect, the proportion between that                                                   due     to
the various gases    nearly the same for both disks.
                           is                        Thus                                                 in the   ebouite
disk we have     20, 18, while in the paper disk we have
                     4,                                                                            4,      20, 23     as re
presenting the gas-effect for the various gases.
  (/3)    That the residual                  effect     in either disk           is   nearly the same for                   the
various gases.   Thus in the ebonite disk we have 5-5, 5-0, 6-0, while                                                       in
the paper disk we have 21-0, 25-0, 20-5 as representing the residual effect
for the various gases.
   The results are thus much more simple on the hypothesis of two effects,
one of these being independent of the residual gas, than on the hypothesis
of only one effect.
  37.     It   was next endeavoured to ascertain                                  whether these two                  effects
were differently influenced by   blind.                 a
   A linen blind was first used before the thin ebonite disk, which                                                          it
cloaked during rotation, falling down afterwards. During rotation the
blind did not appear to touch the disk.       delicate galvanomer was used
                                                                       A

The rotation consisted of 30 turns of the handle in 40 seconds, as before.

    Thus the proportion between the two effects is greatly altered by the
 blind ; for while the hydrogen effect is not much diminished, the other is
reduced to     little more than one half.
    38. A chamois-leather blind was next used, which lay close to the disk
during rotation.         For all these experiments the time of vibration of the
galvanometer-needle was 20 to 30 seconds, while the speed was the same
as before.       Also the disk was tapped immediately                     after   rotation, and
then again     at the interval of one minute            ;  and in order to obtain as many
individual results as possible, the mean of these two tappings has been
taken in the following comparison : —

   Here also we find that the proportion between the two effects is greatly
altered by the        blind; so that while the hydrogen-effect is not much
stopped, the      other is diminished very considerably.
   39.   A   set of experiments of 8 observations, each similar to those of
arts. 33, 34, 35, were made with the blind on for the two gases, dry
hydrogen and       dry air.   From these we obtain the following : —

    Again, from certain experiments with the blind off (each result being
the mean      of 6 observations), we obtain the following effect : —

and hence      we find residual effect =31.
    From all these results, allowing for errors of experiment, we may sup
pose that the residual effect is not much altered by a chamois-leather
 blind.
    We ought to mention that the numbers of this article, similarly to those
 of art. 38,   represent the mean of two tappings, the one taken immediatly
 after rotation, and the other after the interval of one minute.
    40.  It  was suggested to us by Prof. Helmholtz that it would be desi
 rable to ascertain whether any difference was produced in the results by
 loading the disk on one side ; for if these results were due to vibration, it
 might be supposed that they           would   be affected by this means.

314         Messrs. Stewart and Tait on the Heating of a           [May  15,
    It will be seen by art. 39 that the residual effect obtained from a disk
covered with chamois leather is approximately the same as that from an

   In the following experiment the disk was covered with          a chamois-
leather blind with a segment cut out as underneath —

   A   mean of two sets of experiments (consisting of 16 separate observa
tions, and embracing results immediately after rotation, as well as results
one minute after) gave as the result of tapping in A with ^ dry hydro
gen 47, while a mean of 24 similar observations with the same atmosphere
gave as the result of tapping an uncovered disk 53.      Allowing for errors
of experiment,   we may conclude   that this arrangement does not    much in
fluence the results.
   41. The disk was next treated in the following manner:      —
   It'was covered with   a chamois leather   blind tied into holes drilled in
the disk, and having the above shape.        The mean of 3 sets of experi
ments similar to those in art. 40, and consisting of 18 separate observa
tions, gave as follows for an atmosphere of         dry hydrogen, tapping in
A 54, tapping in B 56, which two results are approximately equal to one
another, the mean being 55.
   The mean of 3 sets of experiments,     consisting of 24 separate observa
tions for an atmosphere of      hydrogen, but with an uncovered disk, gave
53 as the heat-result.      All these experiments apparently combine to
prove that the result is not due to vibration.
   42. When the atmosphere was ^ hyd.4-/0- air, we also found A and
B approximately the same, A giving 181 while B gave 182; we have
therefore not hesitated to combine together the results of tapping in this
atmosphere, whether at A, or at B, or with an uncovered disk, in the
comparison given in art. 38.

  43.  Our next experiments were made with the view of testing whether
or not the two effects, the residual and the gas-effect, were resident in the
same particles of the disk ; and for this purpose the experiments made
immediately after rotation were compared with those made one minute
afterwards.
  The experiments          available for this purpose
                                                    are so numerous that they
can bear    splitting   into two portions, in each of which the same result is

also, as the mean of 22  individual comparisons, we obtain the proportion
of 1-19 : 1, while as the mean of the whole we obtain 1-25 : 1.
   Treating in a similar manner the observations made with an atmosphere
of ^ hyd. + ^ air, we obtain
           As the mean of 25 comparisons                                            1'47      :    1,

while as the mean of the whole we obtain 1-44 : 1.
   We therefore conclude that the residual effect is less diminished during
the interval of one minute than the gas-effect.
   44. We next made experiments with two aluminium            disks -05 and
•025 of an inch in thickness respectively.   These disks were covered on
both sides with a coating of lampblack applied by negative photographic
varnish.
  In both disks we found that with a vacuum of ^ hyd. the effect one
minute after rotation was greater than the effect immediately after rota
tion.      Thus we have      :   —

   Inall the experiments with aluminium disks the needle of the galvano
meter vibrated 20 times in 20 seconds, and the rotation consisted of 30
turns of the handle in 40 seconds.
   Without pretending to explain all these experiments*, it must, we
think, be concluded from them that there are two effects which are
differently distributed over the particles of the disk.
   45. The relation between the effect for ^ hyd. and that for ^ hy<L+
    air for the thin aluminium disk (galv. 20 in 20 seconds) is given as
follows : —

   We thus     see that the effect      for   ^
                                        hyd. (which may be supposed to re
present the residual effect) and that for      hyd. -f^y air (which maybe
supposed  to represent the  gas-effect)  are both diminished in very nearly
the same proportion, namely 100 : 77, by the above transference of the
pile to a position nearer the centre of the disk.    It would thus appear
that the difference in distribution among the particles of the two effects
brought to light in art. 44 cannot be explained by a difference from
centre to rim, but would        rather seem to be due to a difference in                            depth.
If thisappear to be improbable, it must be remembered that these experi
ments were not made on a naked metallic disk.        These experiments
would therefore appear to show that in an aluminium disk covered with
varnish, as well as in a disk of ebonite, we may imagine the residual
effect to be more deeply seated than the gas-effect.
   46.    We venture on the following           as what appears to us                 to   be the most
probable explanation      of the whole body of experiments, including                                those
with radiation.
   (1) There is     a temporaryheat or cold effect (art. 26) which may be
supposed to arise in particles very slightly attached to the disk ; this is
radiated off chiefly during rotation, and probably does not greatly affect
the disk afterwards.
  (2) There is a surface gas-effect, which in an aluminium and even in
an ebonite disk is conducted into the interior as it arises, so that it does
  * May not this peculiarity of     the aluminium    disk in the hydrogen vacuum                    be due
to some hygrometric surface-effect    resident in the varnish ?       In        one experiment, but
only one, the peculiarity was absent.                                 ,

not greatly radiate during rotation of the disk (art. 26).               In  a paper
disk, however, which is formed           of a badly conducting material loosely
put together, part of the effect        does   escape as radiation during rotation
(art. 27).
    (3) There    is a residual    effect, which is more deeply seated than the
gas-effect.     And   inasmuch as radiation takes place from a perceptible
depth,   this effect is much more influential than the gas-effect in increasing
radiation after rotation.       In the case of a paper disk, this deeply seated
effect will be less diminished by radiation during rotation than the gas-
effect, and therefore      after rotation    in such   a disk we might    expect the
gas-effect to be peculiarly small (art. 35).
    47. In the course of these experiments we have endeavoured to prove
that this residual effect is not caused by vibration.            The radiation-expe
riments with aluminium         disks of three different    thicknesses went, on the
other hand, to show that         it was of the nature of     a surface-effect.   This
is confirmed by the results derived from tapping ; for, in the first place,
the experiments of art. 45 show that the two effects (the residual and
the gas-effect) are probably distributed in the same proportion, going
from the centre to the circumference of the disk.             Again , taking the two
 disks of thickness -05 and "025 of an inch, we obtain the following re
 sults : —
                               Effect for t\ liyd.         Effect for ^ hyd.    air.
    Thin disk               48 (22 observations).          228 (10 observations).
    Thick disk              29 (20 observations).          108 (10 observations).
    Now, allowing for errors of experiment, we see that the residual, as
 well as the gas-effect, is reduced to about one half for the thick disk.
    Again, an experiment of a similar nature gave the effect for -fo hyd. in
 an ebonite disk of -Jg- in. in thickness =33, against a result =55 for the
 thin ebonite disk. Unfortunately it was omitted to make a comparison
 with these two disks for the gas-effect ; nevertheless these results are all
 in favour of the residual effect being a surface-effect.
     48. It might be well to make one remark regarding these experiments.
 They are not like the radiation-experiments, which required an extremely
 delicate instrument in order to give a sensible effect. But, on the other
 hand, the effect obtained by tapping being that due to the mere surface of
 the disk, is liable to be altered by any thing which affects the surface of
 the disk.    We have     come to the conclusion that      in such experiments it is
 unadvisable     to use a porous hygrometric surface, such as that of paper,
 not having its pores filled with paraffin or some other similar substance.
 It is likewise desirable that all parts of the apparatus should be as nearly
 as possible   of the same temperature ; indeed we suspect that some ex
 periments     made    during some very peculiar summer weather were in
 fluenced by a want of temperature-equilibrium            between the various parts
 of the apparatus, the result appearing            to be that the gas-effect for the
  ebonite disk was abnormally large.

     49. Our conclusion from the evidence before us                         is,   that the residual
effect     surface-effect more deeply seated than the gas-effect, but dis
              is   a
tributed outwards from the centre to the circumference, very much in the
same manner as the gas-effect.  The residual effect likewise appears able
to penetrate  chamois-leather blind without any perceptible diminution.
                        a
We regard these conclusions as preliminary, and shall endeavour in our
future experiments to procure additional evidence of these properties of
the residual effect, as well as to obtain new facts regarding it. In the
mean time, as the subject    one of interest, and has been already too long
                                    is
delayed, we have not hesitated to bring these results before the notice of
the Royal Society.
   In concluding we would desire to express our thanks to                          Mr. F. Kingdon
for his assistance to us in many of these experiments.

          On the Heat necessary to     kill Bacteria, Vibriones,  fyc.   325
 "Further Observations on the Temperature              at which Bacteria,
        Vibriones, and their Supposed Germs are killed when exposed
       to Heat in a moist state ; and on the Causes of Putrefaction
       and Fermentation." By H. Charlton Bastian, M.A., M.D.,
       F.R.S., Professor of Pathological Anatomy in University
       College, London.       Received March 25, Read May        1,  1873.
   Whilst a heat of 140° F. (60° C.) appears to be destructive to Bacteria,
 Vibriones, and their supposed germs in a neutral saline solution, a heat of
 149° or of 158° F. is often necessary to prevent the occurrence of putre
faction in the inoculated fluids when specimens of organic infusions are
employed.      What is the reason of this difference ? Is it owing to the
fact that living organisms are enabled to withstand the destructive in
fluence of heat better in such fluids than when immersed in neutral saline
solutions ?    At first sight it might seem that this was the conclusion to
be drawn.      We   must not, however, rest satisfied with mere superficial
considerations.
   The problem is an interesting one ; yet it should be clearly understood
that its solution, whatever it may be, cannot in the least affect the vali
dity of the conclusion arrived at in my last paper, viz. that living matter
is certainly capable of arising de novo.      We were enabled to arrive at
the conclusion above mentioned regarding Archebiosis by starting with
the undoubted fact that a heat of 158° F. reduces to a state of potential
death all the Bacteria, Vibriones, and their supposed germs which an or
ganic infusion may contain.                                I
                                  The inquiry upon which now propose to
enter, therefore, touching the degree of heat below this point which may
suffice to kill such organisms and their supposed germs in an organic
infusion, and touching the cause of the delayed putrefaction apt to take
place in inoculated organic infusions which have been heated to tempe
ratures above 140° and below 158° F., is one lying altogether outside the
chain of fact and inference by which the occurrence of Archebiosis is
proved.
   It  seems to me that the solution of the problems which form the sub
ject  of   the present communication can only be safely attempted by
keeping constantly before our minds two main considerations : —
   Thus, in the experiments whose results it is now our object to en
deavour to explain, the fluids have been inoculated with a compoun
consisting partly (a) of living units, and partly (6) of a drop of a solu
tion of organic matter in a state of molecular change ; so that in many
cases where putrefaction has been initiated after the inoculating com
 pound has been heated to certain temperatures, there is the possibiliy
that this process of putrefaction may have been induced (in spite of the
death of the organisms and their germs) owing to the influence of b, the
dissolved    organic  matter   of the inoculating  compound;   that is tosay

    32G                             Prof. H. C. Bastian on the Heat
    the heat to which the mixture has been exposed may have been adequate
    to kill all the living units entering into the inoculating compound,
    although it may not have been sufficient to prevent its not-living organic
    matter acting as a ferment upon the infusion*.
                                I
       And there are, think, the very best reasons for concluding that in all
    the cases in which turbidity has occurred after the organic mixtures have
    been subjected to a heat of 140° F. (60°C.) and upwards, this turbidity
    has been due, not to the survival of the living units, but rather to the
    fact that the mere dead organic matter of the inoculating compound has
    acted upon the more unstable organic infusions in a way which it was
    not able to do upon the boiled saline fluids.
      In  order more fully to explain the grounds upon which this conclusion
    is based, it will now be necessary to recast the results of the 102 inocu
    lation experiments recorded in my last communication t. They require
    to be thrown into a new tabular form, in order to show how the results
    differed amongst themselves when organic infusions of different strengths
    were employed.    The consideration of this aspect of the question was
    purposely delayed, in order to avoid the introduction of unnecessary
    complications into my last communication, seeing that the conclusion
    which        I
             then sought to establish was in no way affected by these facts.

   Reference will be made to these Tables in the setting forth of my
reasons for the conclusion that the more or less delayed putrefaction which
takes place in inoculated organic infusions raised to the temperature of
140° F., and to other degrees of heat above this point, is due to the in
fluence of the not-living ingredient (b) of the inoculating compound.
These reasons are the following : —
  1 . Because the turbidity which has occurred                 in inoculated organic in
fusions that have been subjected to a                 temperature of 140° F. has always
manifested itself appreciably later, and advanced much more slowly than
in similar mixtures which had not been heated above 131° F. ; whilst it
has commenced even later, and progressed                       still more slowly, when occur
ring in mixtures previously heated to 149° F.      Such facts might be
accounted for by the supposition that exposure in these organic fluids
to the slightly higher temperature suffices to retard the rate of growth
and    multiplication of the living units of the inoculating compound, al
though  the  facts are  equally explicable upon  the  supposition  that the
later and less energetic putrefactions are due to the sole influence of the
mere organic matter of the inoculating compound.
  2. So far as the evidence embodied in the Tables goes, it tends to show
that the more unstable different specimens of similar infusions are (that
is,the stronger they are), the more rapidly and frequently does late tur
bidity ensue, and the more this late turbidity approaches, both in time
of onset and in rate of increase, to that which occurs when inoculated
infusions are not heated to more than 131° F. — when both living and
not-living elements of the inoculating    compound act conjointly as
ferments.   Such facts show  quite clearly that where the intrinsic or
predisposing causes of change are strong, there less potent exciting
agencies are more readily capable of coming into play but they still do         ;
                                                                                     2e2

                       Prof. H. C. Bastian on the Heat
not enable us to decide whether the exciting cause of this delayed turbi
dity is in part the living element whose vitality and rate of reproduction
has been lowered by the heat, or whether the effects are wholly attribu
table to the mere organic matter of the inoculating compound.
    So far, therefore, we have concomitant variations which are equally
compatible with either hypothesis.       But it will be found that each of the
three succeeding arguments speaks more and more plainly against the
possible influence of the living element, and in favour of the action of
the organic matter of the inoculating compound, as an efficient exciting
cause of the delayed putrefactions occurring in the cases in question.
    3. As   stated in my last communication *, when single drops of slightly
turbid infusions of hay or turnip previously heated to 140° F. are mounted
 and securely cemented as microscopical specimens, no increase of turbi
 dity takes place, although drops of similar infusions heated only to
 122°  F. do notably increase in turbidity (owing to the multiplication of
 Bacteria) when mounted in a similar manner.             Under such restrictive
 conditions as these, in fact, a drop of an inoculated and previously heated
 organic infusion behaves in precisely the same manner as a drop of a
 similarly treated ammonic-tartrate solution.        In each case, when heated
 to 140° F., turbidity does not occur, apparently because there are no
 living units to multiply, and because in these mere thin films of fluid
 dead ferments are as incapable of operating upon the organic fluids as
 they are upon the ammonic-tartrate solutions.
    4. Because, in the case of the inoculation of fluids which are not easily
 amenable to the influence of dead ferments, such as a solution containing
 ammonic tartrate      and sodic phosphate, this delayed turbidity does not
 occur at all.    Such inoculated fluids become rapidly turbid when heated
 to 131° F., though they remain clear after a brief exposure to a tempera
 ture of 140° F. When the living units in the inoculating compound are
 killed, there is nothing left to induce turbidity in such solutions. The
 mere fact that these fluids do not undergo change when exposed to the
 air proves conclusively that they are very slightly amenable to the in
 fluence of the ordinary dead organic particles and fragments with        which
 the atmosphere abounds.        The absence of delayed turbidity in        these
 fluids serves, therefore, to throw much light upon the cause of its occur
 rence in the organic infusions.
    5. And, lastly,  I  can adduce crucial evidence supplied by the " Method
 of Difference,"   speaking with its accustomed clearness.      Two portions of
the same hay- or turnip-infusion can be inoculated in such a manner as
to supply us with the information we require.           In the one case we may
employ a drop of a turbid ammonic-tartrate          solution previously heated
to 140° F., in which, therefore, the living units would certainly be killed;
whilst in the other wo may add an unheated drop of the same              turbid
saline solution to the organic fluid, and then heat this mixture        also to
                                 * Loc. cit p. 228.

   the   temperature of 140° F.             The comparative behaviour of these two
  inoculated      fluids (placed, in the ordinary manner, in previously boiled
  corked phials) should be capable of showing us whether the living
 elements      of the inoculating compound were able to survive when heated
 in the organic infusion.           If they did survive, the fluids inoculated in this
 manner ought to undergo putrefaction earlier and more rapidly than
 those inoculated with the drop of turbid fluid, in which we know that the
 Bacteria, Vibriones, and their supposed germs would have been reduced
to a state of potential death.               With the view of settling this question,
therefore, the        following experiments were made : —

potentially killed when heated to 140° F. in the neutral saline fluid,
    * These
               experiments of series C, D, and    E were   many times repeated with specimens
of the same turnip- and hay-infusions, the specific          gravity of the former being about
1008 and that of the latter 1005.        Different specimens of hay especially vary so much
that it becomes absolutely essential to use portions of the same infusion for the compa
rative experiments of these different series.

330                        Prof.   II. C. Bastian on the Heat
which the experiments of series A show to be eminently favourable for
their growth and reproduction.                Being certain, therefore, that the living
units are killed in the drops with which the fluids of series C were inocu
lated (because they were drops of the same fluid as was employed in
series B), we may be equally certain that the turbidity and putrefaction
which did ensue in the turnip-solutions of series C were due to the in
 fluence of the mere dead constituents              of these drops of the turbid saline
 fluid; whilst, seeing that the behaviour of the fluids of series D was
 precisely similar to those of series C, we have a perfect right to infer that
 this series of fluids (D) was as devoid of living units as those of C are
 known to be — that is, that Bacteria, Vibriones, and their supposed germs
 are killed by the temperature of 140° F. in organic fluids, just as they are
 in saline fluids, although, as shown by the experiments of series E, thsy
 do not succumb to a heat of 131° F. These experiments of series C and
 D further illustrate the different degrees of amenability of different
 organic fluids to the same dead ferments ; whilst the comparison of the
 results with the hay-infusions of series C and D with those previously
 cited (in which the inoculating compound was a drop of an organic infusion
 heated to the same temperature of 140° F.) will illustrate the different
  influence of dissimilar dead ferments upon infusions of the same kind.
      The evidence now in our possession shows, therefore, that whilst the
  temperature at which living ferments cease to be operative varies within
  very narrow limits (131°-140°F.)*,                that which destroys the virtues of
  not-living ferments varies within much wider limits, and depends not
  only upon the amount of heat employed, but also upon the nature of the
  putrescible or fermentable liquid to which such ferment is added, in con
  junction with the degree of heat and other conditions to which the mix
  ture is subsequently exposed t. Here, therefore, we have evidence as to
  the existence of a most important difference between living and nob-
  living ferments, which          has always    been    either unrecognized      or   more    or
   less deliberately ignored by        M.    Pasteur and his followers}:.        This   differ-

   arrest a process of fermentation taking place under their influence in a sugar wlutwr-
   Torula heated in water to 140° F. also fail to initiate fermentation in a sugar solution.
   I have also found that an exposure to a temperature of 131° F. for five minutes alnn
   suffices to destroy the life of Desmids, Puglenn, Amoebae, Monads, Ciliated Infusora.
   Rotifers, Nematoids, and other organisms contained in specimens of pond-water.            All
  these lower organisms seem to be destroyed at about the same temperature, as might
   have been expected from the fundamental relationship which must exist between these
   several varieties of the one substance — living matter.

   M. Pasteur was engaged in an investigation one of the avowed objects of which was to
  determine whether fermentation could or could not take place without the intervention of

ence is, moreover, thoroughly in accordance with the broad physico-chemi
cal theory of fermentation which has been so ably expounded by Baron
Liebig and others, and the truth of which may now be regarded as definitely
established. According to this theory "living" matter, as a ferment,
would take rank merely as a chemical compound having a tolerably defi
nite constitution ; and this, we might reasonably infer, would, like other
chemical compounds, be endowed with definite properties — and amongst
others that of being decomposed or radically altered by exposure to a certain
amount of heat. Looked at also from this essentially chemical point of
view, it would be only reasonable to expect that the molecular movements
of living ferments with a lowered vitality might not be more marked or
energetic than those which many not-living organic substances are apt to
undergo ; and this being the case, we might expect that there would often
be a great practical difficulty in ascertaining whether a ferment belonging
to the arbitrary and artificial (though, in a sense, justifiable and natural)
category of "living" things had or had not been in operation.
   It has, moreover, been most unmistakably proved that the limits of
vital resistance to heat which Bacteria, Vibriones, and their supposed
germs are capable of displaying are essentially the same in the three type
fluids which      I
                have employed — that         inis,
                                                 weak saline fluid, in

tral organic infusion, and in an acid organic infusion. No evidence exists
really tending to show that these organisms or their germs are capable
 of withstanding the effects of heat better in one of such fluids than in
another.       We may therefore safely affirm that M. Pasteur never had
any valid evidence in support of his conclusion that the germs of Bacteria
and Vibriones can resist heat better in neutral or slightly alkaline solu
tions than in slightly acid mixtures.     The experimental results which
led him to arrive at such      conclusion were not logically capable of re
                                   a
ceiving any such interpretation, whilst they can be legitimately accounted
for in accordance with the broader physico-chemical theory of fermenta
tion, the truth of which has now been established*.          We may also
safely affirm that M. Pasteur's more specific statement, to the effect that
living organisms, which M. Pasteur held (in opposition    to many other chemists) to be the
only true ferments.    In his inoculating compound (dust filtered from the atmosphere),
there was, as M. Pasteur was fully aware,  a  large amount of what his scientific opponents
considered not-living ferment, whilst possibly there existed a certain number of living
ferments. In explaining the results of his experiments,          however, M. Pasteur and
others thought he was pursuing a logical and scientific method when he attributed these
results to the action of the possibly existing element of the inoculating compound, whilst
 he ignored altogether the other element which was certainly present in comparatively
large quantity, and the testing of whose efficacy was the ostensible object of his research.

 that the differences which M. Pasteur ascribed to differences of vital resistance of or
 ganisms    in particular fluidswere just as explicable in accordance with the physico-

the germs of some Bacteria and Vibriones are capable of resisting the
influence of a heat of 212° F. when in the moist state, though they are
killed by a temperature of 230° F., was a conclusion altogether unwar
ranted   by the evidence which he adduced.   Finding that certain fluids
treated after the manner introduced by Schwann always remained quite
devoid of living organisms, M. Pasteur very legitimately concluded that
preexisting organisms and germs had been killed during the boiling of the
liquid ; but finding that when a little powdered chalk was added to fluids
of the same kind (which in all other respects were treated in a similar
manner) living organisms were after a time invariably found to appear,
although they as invariably failed to appear when the same fluids were
heated to a temperature of 230° F. (110° C), two equally legitimate pro
visional conclusions were open to M. Pasteur in explanation of these
facts.   What did M. Pasteur do ? Following the same method as he
had formerly employed*, he again ignored one of the equally possible
interpretations,    and unsuccessfully     attempted to prove, by a repe
tition of similar reasoning t, that the different results in the two
series of experiments were due to the fact that the germs of Barttrit
and Vibriones which had been killed by the temperature of 212° F. in the
first series, were not killed by this temperature in the second series           (in
which    a slightly alkaline fluid had been employed), although they were
destroyed by the higher temperature of 230° F. Thus results which were
due to the action of not-living ferments were ascribed to living ferments,
and the possible action of not-living ferments was ignored, although. as
I  have said before, the ostensible object of M. Pasteur's researches was
to inquire into the relative importance of not-living and living ferments,
or whether, in fact, " dead
                               "
                                  substances (in the ordinary acceptation        of
the word) could act as ferments.
   When viewed from the stand-point of the physico-chemical          theory       of
fermentation, the apparently contradictory results arrived at       by   the   same
experimenter at different times or by different experimenters, in this line
of research, cease to be the inexplicable puzzle which they must always
appear to those who place implicit faith in the narrower and too exclusive
" vital " theory of fermentation advocated by M. Pasteur and his followers.
   My investigations have convinced me that, with regard to degree                of
fermentability, the various fermentable fluids and mixtures are divisible
into three distinct subclasses —  :
  I. There are what may be called self-fermentable fluids or mixtures—
that is, fluids or mixtures which, after exposure to a temperature               of
212° F. or higher, are still capable of undergoing fermentative changes
without the addition of less-heated matter, either not-living or living.
The changes occurring in these self-fermentable fluids (in which preexist
ing living things have been killed), when strictly protected from contact
with adventitious particles, vary in rapidity and in intensity from the

more or less marked fermentation,               soon after they are brought into con
tact even with mere not-living organic matter.
     The experiments recorded in this communication have most conclu
sively proved the efficacy of not-living organic matter as a ferment or
inciter of change in previously barren fluids.                   And combining the know
ledge     derived     from    these   experiments     with    that   which we now possess
concerning the absence of living Bacteria, Vihrioms, and their germs iu
the air, together with the known prevalence of minute organic particles
and fragments of various kinds, the explanation of M. Pasteur's cele
brated experiments in which he had recourse to an " ensemencemeat
des poussières qui existent en suspension dans l'air," becomes quite easy
and legitimate without having recourse to the hypothesis of Pan-
spermismt. Now, also, are we enabled to understand all the apparent
inconsistencies of those experiments in which previously boiled fluids
havo been exposed to the ordinary air of different localities, and have then
been     resealed.       If  many specimens of these fluids remained                  unchanged.
whilst others, after a few days, swarmed with Bacteria and Vibrioms. we
may now very safely attribute these previously puzzling results to the
comparative absence or presence of organic fragments in the particular
volumes of air which chanced to get into the flasks, and to the different
nature of the fluids employed by different experimenters                      %.

Mr. W. N. Hartley          has laboured very industriously      to disprove something which I
never asserted (soe Proceedings of Eoyal Society, vol. xx. p. 140).         In my early paper in
' Nature '   I expressly  stated that organic impurities  were  always  present  in the saline solu
                I
tions which employed ; and, as may be seen by the note appended to the conclusions of
 that paper,   I  never claimed to have established     that living organisms could appear in
 siilino solutions free from traces of organio impurity.       Mr. Hartley did attempt to work
with approximately puro saline solutions, and in other respects also the conditions of hi?
experiments differed so much from mine. that the results which he obtained could n-*
                                              I
 possibly be considered to disprove what had previously stated.            Some of his flasks were
 heated to 180° 0., a temperature                  I
                                       about which had said nothing ; and whilst his organic
infusions were too weak, some of his saline solutions were too concentrated. though the
 strengths of others were not given at all.       Fluids were also employed (such as urine.
heated to 130° C.) which         I had not made use of, and which     I  should not have though'
of experimenting with.

    Many of the fluids which habitually remain clear after a previous ebul
lition in flasks whose necks have been plugged with cotton-wool, many
times bent, or hermetically sealed after the entry of calcined air, or when
enclosed in vessels which are completely full (in Gruithuisen's fashion),
belong to this subclass.   In other cases, however (as in many of those
instances where urine or hay- or turnip-infusions have been employed),
those who do not content themselves with a mere naked-eye inspection of
the apparently pure fluids would find on microscopical examination of
the sediment that such fluids were to a low degree self-fermentable —
that they correspond, in fact, with group            E   of the last subclass*; whilst,
in addition, my researches have shown      that many of such fluids are
capable of being rendered self-fermentable to a marked degree,     instead       if,
of subjecting them to contact with calcined air or variously filtered air,
its reflux after ebullition      is
                             altogether prevented                 by
                                                     hermetically sealing
the neck of the flask during ebullition.     Operating in this way,    have        I
repeatedly  found  that fluids freed from the pressure  of air and from  its
influence altogether become to marked extent self-fermentable, although
                                      a
the same fluids exposed to filtered or calcined air under ordinary atmo
spheric pressure remain unaltered and barren, or at most exhibit the
very low degree of fermentability referred to as characterizing group Ef.
But just as amongst the self-fermentable fluids we find there are some
which only engender Torulce or other allied fungus-germs, so now we find
that some previously boiled fluids, even when fully exposed to the air,
swarm only with Torulce.     Those exciting agents derived from the atmo
sphere which, with one set of fluids, initiate changes leading to the evolu
tion of Bacteria, with another set lead only to the evolution of Torulce.
And whilst telling us that the Bacteria which appear in previously barren
fluids after exposure to air are not due to their contamination with germs
of Bacteria, some observers would have us conclude that the Torulce
which appear in other previously barren fluids after        similar exposure
                                                                       a
are the products of preexisting aerial germs of such organisms.         This
conclusion, however, cannot readily be accepted in the face of the evidence
derived from the closed-flask experiments with self-fermentable fluids of
the lowest degreej.    Such experiments, in fact, render the hypothesis as
also   record of other experiments'made with the air of alpine regions by MM. Pouchet,
       a
Joly, and Musset, in Compt. Kend. Sept. 21, 1863.
   * Other fluids richer in organic matter or otherwise more favourably endowed, in
stead of presenting this low degree        of self-fermentability, are notably prone to undergo
change     when we attempt to preserve them in the manner described, although such
modes of preparation do suffice for preserving so many fluids.              This has been fully
admitted by Schrceder and Dusch, Schwann, Pasteur, and others.

 cessary, by showing that certain fluids, by reason of certain intrinsic
 peculiarities, when they undergo fermentation give rise to Torula only.
We are thus led to conclude that whilst some fluids are capable of en
gendering bothkinds of organisms, others tend only to produce one or other
of them — whether the fluids are contained in closed flasks or in open
vessels exposed to the incidence of atmospheric particles.        have more    I
than once seen nothing but Torula appear in an infusion of turnip ex
posed to the air after it had been heated in a closed tube to a temperature
                                             I
of 293° F. for twenty minutes, and have once seen the same thing occur
in an unheated infusion of turnip exposed to the air, though on all other
occasions such infusions have swarmed only with Bacteria and Yibriamt.
On the other hand, a boiled ammonic-tartrate solution exposed to the air,
though protected from an excess of atmospheric particles (for the advent
of a large number of these might in some cases incite putrefaction), is
never found        to contain Bacteria   ;       the fluid     continues    clear, though      a
sediment gradually accumulates at the bottom of the flask, amongst                      which
Torula and other fungus-germs are constantly to be found — more                         nume
rous though otherwise very similar to those which are to be met with in
flasks closed during ebullition, or in others to which only filtered air is
admitted.       Although Torula only appear in such fluids, they                continue    all
the time to be eminently inoculable by Bacteria                  ;    and, again, when the
Torula begin to decay they are apt to incite                    a    more or less manifest
putrefaction, during which the fluid gradually becomes turbid with .Barf?™.
It in fact, general rule that putrefaction
    is,           a                                 apt to supervene upon

a fermentation of    more smouldering type.

212° F. or higher temperatures, are unable, either alone or under the                      in
fluence of ordinary atmospheric particles or fragments, to undergo putre
faction, although such     process can invariably be initiated by bringing
                           a
the fluids into contact with  living ferments.  As examples of such fluids,
I may cite the neutral saline solution to which   have so often referred
                                                               I
and that known as Pasteur's solution.    Other fluids of the same kind
have  lately been referred to by Professor Huiziuga*.      The fact that
certain fluids cannot be made to undergo putrefaction by the influence                     in of
dead organic particles, although they become at once amenable to the
fluence of living units, unmistakably shows the superior potency of living
ferments    ;their action has, moreover, invariably proved to be certain
and inevitable in all the cases in which they were known to be present.
Even these least fermentable fluids of our third subclass invariably                        be
come turbid within three days after inoculation with living units, main            if
tained at   atemperature of about 70° F. whilst when other more change
                                                  ;
able fluids are inoculated, putrefaction ensues with equal certainty, though
with much greater rapidity.

   What we have learned, therefore, concerning the invariable uniformity
of simple inoculation experiments should of itself teach us how difficult
it would be to account for cases of delayed putrefaction, or for cases in
which    a mere smouldering fermentation is set up, by the old though now
well-nigh exploded notion of contamination by preexisting germs. Where
living ferments really exist, the course of events is definite and almost in
variable in its rapidity ; but where fermentation takes place as a result of
chemical changes occurring in the fluid itself (either by its own unaided
powers, or under the stimulating influence of a less-heated organic fer
ment) there is abundant room for all the irregularity and variation actually
encountered.       These cases of irregularity and variation have always, on
other grounds, defied all legitimate attempts to bring them individually
within the pale of a narrow and exclusively " vital " theory of fermenta
tion ; and now a wider experience with living ferments equally tends to
 show the impossibility of legitimately explaining a great mass of irregular
 phenomena by means of agents whose action is shown to be constant
 and almost invariable.
    Thus it can now be proved, by evidence of a most unmistakable nature,
 that the process of putrefaction which invariably occurs in previously
 boiled putrescible infusions contained in flasks with narrow but open
 necks is not commonly (is, perhaps, only very rarely) initiated by living
 germs or organisms derived from the atmosphere ; it can also be proved
 that putrefaction and the appearance of swarms of living organisms may
 occur in some boiled fluids when they are simply exposed to air which
 has been filtered through a firm plug of cotton-wool or through the nar
 row and bent neck of a flask, to air whose particles have been destroyed
 by heat, or even in fluids hermetically sealed in flasks from which all
 air has been expelled. The evidence in our possession is therefore most
 complete on this part of the subject : it shows beyond all doubt, not only
 that putrefaction may and does very frequently occur under conditions in
 which the advent of atmospheric particles, whether living or dead, is no
 longer possible, but also that living particles derived from the atmosphere
 can only be very rare and altogether exceptional initiators of the putre
 faction which invariably occurs in previously boiled infusions exposed to
 the air.
     Again, the evidence which we now possess with reference to the influence
 of heat upon Bacteria, Vibriones, and their supposed germs is no less deci
 sive.     It has been unmistakably proved that such organisms and their
 imaginary germs are either actually or potentially killed by a brief expo
 sure to the temperature of 140° F. when in the moist state ; and it bad
 also been previously established that they are invariably killed by desic
 cation even at much lower temperatures *.
    *  See  the experiments and conclusions of Dr. Burdon Sanderson in Thirteenth
 Report of Med. Officer of Privy Council, p. 01. This fact of the inability of theso or-

    But if living germs do not come from the air to contaminate the pre
viously boiled fluids, and if it is not possible for any of them to have
escaped     the destructive influence of heat in the boiling fluid or on the
 walls of the vessel in which the fluid is contained, what can be the mode
of origin of the swarms of living things which so rapidly and invariably
appear in such infusions when contained in open flasks, and which so
frequently appear when the infusions are contained in flasks whose necks
are closed against atmospheric particles of all kinds ? They can only
have arisen by the process which            I  have termed Archebiosis.
                                         Conclusiotis.
    If   a previously     boiled ammonic-tartrate            solution remains free from
Bacteria and Vibriones when exposed to the air, it is because the air does
not contain living organisms of this kind or their supposed germs, and
because mere dead organic particles are not capable of initiating putre
faction in such a fluid.
   And if ordinary organic infusions previously boiled and exposed to the
air do rapidly putrefy, though some of the same infusions when exposed-
only to filtered air remain pure, it is because such fluids are, in the ab
sence of living units, quite amenable to the influence of the dead organic
particles which the air so abundantly contains, although they are not self-
fermentable.
   Whilst if other more changeable fluids, after previous                     boiling,  when
exposed to filtered air or cut off altogether from contact with                        air, do
nevertheless undergo putrefaction or fermentation,                     it is because    these
fluids are self-fermentable, and need neither living units nor dead organic
particles to initiate those putrefactive or fermentative changes which lead
to the evolution of living organisms.
ganisms   and their germs to resist desiccation shows the futility of some objectionswhidi
have been from time to time raised by those who thought that Bacteria, Vibrionu. ni
their germs might resist the destructive influence of heat by adhesion to the glas sbon
the level of the fluid, or even in the fluid itself, just as dried and very thick-coated seedi
have been known to do.         Dry heat would seem to be even more fatal to such orga
nisms and their germs than a moist heat of the same degree, owing to their eitrem
inability to resist desiccation : if they become dry they are killed at a temperature of
about 104° P., whilst if they remain moist they succumb, as we have seen, to a tempe
rature of 140° F.

            On  Muscular Irritability after Systemic Death.                339

Sir GEORGE         BIDDELL AIRY, K.C.B.,            President, in the Chair.
The Croonian       Lecture, " On Muscular Irritability after Systemic
      Death," was delivered by Benjamin Ward Richardson,
      M.D., F.R.S.
                                   (Abstract.)
   The Lecturer commenced by referring to the labours of Dr. Croone,
the Physician with whose name this lecture is connected.           Croone was
distinguished    as  one of the founders       and  as first Registrar of the
Royal Society, and his scientific work included important contributions
to the subject of muscular motion.            Immediately preceding Croone,
Nicholas Stenon, of Copenhagen (first an anatomist and afterwards
Bishop of Heliopolis, a man whom Ilaller has described as vir industrius,
candidus, innocuus el magnus inventor, and whom the Grand Duke of
Tuscany buried in the tomb of his Royal house), had made known the fact
that the contractile portion of muscle is resident in the carneous or fleshy
part of the muscle, as distinguished from the fibrous part. This discovery,
seized by Croone,     led him to observe that the fleshy part of muscle is
made    up of fibres, and that each fibre possesses a distinct power of
contraction ; so that, to use his own words, " the force of the whole
muscle is but an aggregation of each particular fibre."
    Upon this observation, perfectly original at the time it was announced,
 Croone   advanced an hypothesis as to the cause of muscular motion.
He showed that for muscular contraction it was necessary that the
arteries   should   supply blood to the fleshy muscular fibres — that the
blood should pervade the fibres — that in its course, forced on by the
stroke of the heart,    it should mix with another liquor within the muscles,
and diffuse into the minute        vesicles of which   each  muscular  fibre is
 ultimately composed.       To complete the mechanism for motion, he held
 that the nervous      filaments  which ramify into each muscle supply a
 refined fluid, much more active than the muscular fluid, by which the
 activity of the muscle is called into play.
    The lecturer next briefly traced the various hypotheses that have been
 advanced to explain muscular motion since the time when Croone made
 his original observations, the purport of the argument being that,
 although great advances have been made in the study of structure, and
 one very great advance in the study of function, viz. by Haller in his
 separation of the respective forces of nerve and muscle, the precise question
 of the  cause   of muscular    motion    remains  much in the same doubt as
 Croone left it.
    Respecting    the various    theories   and hypotheses since  the time   of

310                     Dr. B. Ward Richardson                   on Muscular       [May    29,
Croone, the author had nothing to say in detail ; the object of his lecture
was to put forward certain facts he had learned on the phenomenon of
muscular               after systemic death — that muscular irritability
                  irritability
which remains sometimes for a brief, at other times for a long period
after all the outward manifestations of life have ceased, and when, to the
common apprehension, the animal tissues are dead. He included in the
same study certain examples in which muscular irritability has for a time
ceased,      but has become           redeveloped under new conditions.   He thus
included       the     study      of those states which favour the continuance of
           or which destroy

                                    and those conditions which suspend                         it
but do not destroy it.     By this method of research the author thinks we
may proceed backwards towards living irritability, and may determine
upon what that depends with more facility than                        by
                                                      experimenting on the
phenomena   of irritability in the  living animal.  He  imagines that                     if     he
knew nothing of the construction of a watch, or why for         certain time   a
a watch maintains its motion, and         he had nobody to teach him these
                                                    if
things, he might be better able to arrive at the fact he wanted trying              by
to set the motionless watch into motion than by interfering with                               it

above     explained       included     a   review of the work of twenty-five              years.
The subjects brought under consideration were arranged as follows :—
  (1) The effect of cold on muscular irritability after systemic death.
  (2) The effect of motor forces, mechanical, calorific, electrical.
  (3) The effect of abstracting and supplying blood.
  (4) The effect of certain chemical agents, inorganic and organic.
                                           Effect   of   Cold.
   Previous to the time of John Hunter     was supposed that cold
                                                           it                               was
the most effective agent for destroying muscular irritability, and to                       this
day the impression    commonly maintained
                                 is         so that the sensation ;                              of

                                       is
Hunter was the first to show by direct experiment that this was an
error, and that cold suspends irritability without destroying it. The
original experiment of Hunter illustrative of this position was here
described.   The effects of cold employed in various ways in the author's
experimental researches were now detailed systematically.         The effect
of cold in suspending the muscular irritability of fish, reptiles, and frogs
was first described.  On all these animals     was shown that cold could
                                                             it
be made to suspend without destroying the muscular irritability for                              a
long period of time, and that in fish (carp, on which the author had
made the greatest number of experiments) the restoration of irritability
could be perfected to the extent of the restoration of the living function.
   Passing to warm-blooded animals, the author showed that in the process
of cooling in every animal that has been suddenly deprived of life with

  1873.]             Irritability after Systemic Death.                   311
 out mechanical injury there is a period in the process of cooling when
 general muscular irritability may be made manifest.        He demonstrates
 this fact by the simple experiment of throwing a current of water heated
 to 115° Fahr. over the arterial system of the recently dead animal.        If
 the surrounding temperature be high at the time of this experiment, the
 operation should be performed within a few minutes after death ; but
 if the temperature be below freezing-point, it may be delayed for a long
 period.    In one experiment the author reproduced active muscular con
 traction in an animal that had lain dead and exposed to cold 6 degrees
 below freezing-point     for a period of three hours.      In this case the
 muscles generally remained irritable for seven minutes after the injection
 of the heated water, while in the muscles of the limbs, by repeating the
 injection at intervals, the irritability was maintained for two hours.
    The author drew a comparison between these experimental results and
 the phenomena of muscular irritability that have been observed in the
 human subject after death by cholera.         A short description of the
 muscular movements occurring sometimes after death from cholera was
 introduced.    The movements were not conscious, nor were they pro
 moted by electrical excitation ; but the flexors and extensors belonging to
each part in which there is movement are alternately contracted and re
 laxed as if from some internal influence.     The same observations apply
 to the phenomena of contraction and relaxation in the muscles of animals
 that have been held in abeyance by cold and have been recalled into
 action by the injection of heated fluids.
    The influence of cold in suspending without destroying muscular irrita
 bility was further evidenced by the experiment of subjecting some young
 animals to death, by the process of drowning them in ice-cold water.      It
 was shown that in the kitten the muscular irritability may be restored to
 the complete reestablishment of life after a period of two hours of apparent
 systemic death, although the muscles when the animal is first removed
 from the water may give no response to the galvanic current.            This
 same continuance of irritability after apparent systemic death by drown
ing in ice-cold water has been observed in the human subject, not in so
determinate, but in an approximated degree.        An instance was adduced
in which a youth who had been deeply immersed for twelve minutes in ice-
cold water retained muscular irritability    so perfectly that he recovered,
regained consciousness, and lived for a period of seven hours.
    Commenting on the method of irritability, the author showed that a
certain period of time is required before the irritability is raised from a
mere passive condition, in which it responds only to external stimuli,
into the condition necessary for independent active contractility. The
change of condition from the passive to the active state, when it occurs, is
so sudden as to seem instantaneous at first, then it is slowly repeated.
This rule holds good in respect to voluntary muscles and involuntary. It
is specially true in regard to the heart, which organ, the author states,

342                     Dr. B. Ward Richardson      on Muscular              [May     29,
may perform its office under two distinct degrees of tension or              pressure—
a low tension, in which the organ itself is reduced in size                  and moves
almost insensibly ; and a full tension, in which it is of larger size                 and
moves with a sufficient power to impel the blood so as to overcome                       the
arterial elasticity and the capillary resistance.
    Another fact bearing on this subject is, that in rapid decline of muscular
irritability the muscles most concerned in the support of the organic
functions, namely the heart and the muscles of respiration, are the last to
yield up their spontaneous power ; but when they have lost their power,
they are the last to regain it. To this rule there is one exception, viz. in
the muscular fibre of the right auricle of the heart.
   The author then explained that the degree of cold which suspends
irritability is fixed within certain measures of degree, from 38° to 28° F.
being the most favourable degrees of cold.          Above a temperature of
38° Eahr. the muscles in a little time pass into permanent rigidity, rigor
mortis. Below 28° the muscles, if the effect of the cold be extended to
their whole structure, pass into some new molecular condition from which
they do not return into active life, at least they do not by means of any
process of recovery of which we are at present conversant.
                                Effect of Motor Forces.
   Cold, by the inertia it induces, suspends, under certain conditions, but
does not destroy, muscular irritability. The motor forces, on the contrary,
quicken the irritability for a brief period, and then completely destroy                   it.
A method may perhaps be discovered for overcoming the effects these              of
forces, but at present        itnot known.
                                   is          The mode in which all the
motor forces act in arresting irritability      by the induction
                                                  is                    con     of   a
tractile state, which, once established, remains permanent.    It should                    be
remarked, however, that the forces respectively named mechanical,
calorific, electrical, act with different degrees of intensity, perhaps because
we cannot as yet apply them, in this particular research, with equal
measures of intensity. The author here related his experiments on the
effect of the different forces upon the right auricle of the heart, and re
ported as the result of his observations that, while all the forces act
ultimately      alike   in producing permanent contraction, the          mechanical       ex
citation   is    much slower than the calorific;          while electrical    excitation
appears to hold an intermediate place, as       were
                                                   if   it          a   combination         of
mere mechanical motion with an increased temperature.               Electrical   tension
may nevertheless be increased so as to rival heat in its immediate                    effect
on contraction.
   The author here traced out the results of         series of short sharp

  during permanent contraction,        was described from experiments bearing
 on the  relation of temperature to the muscular contraction of different
 animals — frogs, pigeons, and rabbits.         It was shown that a relative rise
 in temperature     in each class, a rise averaging    12 degrees     in Fahr. scale,
 from the natural temperature of the animal is efficient for producing
 permanent rigidity, the cause of the ultimate rigidity being coagulation
 of the coagulable muscular fluid.
    The effect of electrical excitation is in the same direction, but is varied
 according to the mode in which the excitation is performed.               Discharge
from the Leyden jar produces contraction, which is permanent or inter
 mittent in accordance with the mass of the muscle and the intensity of
the discharge.        This fact was elucidated by reference to a series of
experiments with a Leyden battery, placed in cascade, and the effect
produced by the discharge from 96 feet of surface upon animals of
different  sizes   and weights, from      sheep down    to pigeons, as well as on
sections of the bodies of the same animals immediately            after death. The
experimental      facts demonstrated      that with    an efficient    discharge  the
whole muscular system         of a small animal could be fixed      instantly in the
rigidity of death, and that the precise position of the animal at the period
immediately      preceding death was retained with such perfection, so
sudden was the change, that nothing but physical examination by the
hand   could bring to the mind the fact that the animal had passed from
life into death.
   But the same shock passed through a sheep weighing 54 pounds pro
duced only a temporary           contraction of muscle, and required several
repetitions before the rigidity was rendered permanent.
   By employing discharges of lower tension it was found that muscles, or
special tracts of muscles, in the same animal, immediately after its death,
could be made rigid quickly or slowly by variation of the intensity of
the  discharge.
   The effect of       the   intermittent electro-magnetic      current was next
brought   forward, and was shown to resemble closely that of the simple
electrical discharge from the Leyden phial.            Intensified it induces in
stant and permanent contraction ; and if it be repeated, even with but
sufficient force as to call forth feeble contraction, it destroys the irrita
bility, cateris paribus, more quickly than if the muscle had been left at rest.
   Parenthetically,     the lecturer dwelt here on the common practice after
sudden death     of endeavouring to excite the action of the enfeebled heart
by  passing through      it an electrical current.   Some practitioners,     said the
author, have gone so far as to introduce a needle into the heart itself,
and to make the needle act as one of the conductors from a battery.
Such    experimentalists,      before they undertake this operation on the
human subject, should at least observe the effect of the agency they are
employing on the exposed heart of an inferior animal recently and
suddenly killed by drowning or by          a narcotic vapour.    They would learn

344                    Dr. B. Ward Richardson on Muscular               [May 29,
then with what infinite facility the muscular irritability of the heart, in
all its parts, is excited, for a moment only, to be permanently destroyed.
They would learn that if blood be not passing through the muscular
structure        concurrently with the exciting agent, they could not more
effectually arrest function than by the very method they have adopted to
 sustain    it.
     The influence of the continuous       current on muscular     irritability  was
introduced        by the author, together with a special reference to the first
experiments of Aldini on the bodies of malefactors who had been recently
 executed     ;   and  it was shown from Aldini's most noted experiment how
 largely the phenomena of motion he induced in a dead man, and the
 recital of which caused so much sensation in the year 1803, was due, not
 to the galvanism, but to the circumstance that the dead body had               been
 exposed for the hour after death, and before the experiments                   com
 menced, to the action of cold two degrees below freezing-point.                  On
 the whole the continuous current acts on muscular fibre after the manner
 of heat.        If  the muscle, recently dead, be exposed to cold, the current,
 when sufficient, restores for a limited period the irritability, and finally
 destroys       it by inducing persistent contraction    ; if the muscle, recently
  dead, be    left at its natural temperature,   the current simply shortens the
  period of irritability by quickening contraction.
                            Abstraction and Supply   of Blood.
      Under this head the author first considered the effect of abstraction
  of blood from the living muscular fibre. He showed that when the flow
  of blood was very rapid, there was invariably a given period of muscular
  excitation.       In sheep killed in the slaughterhouse he found that this
  muscular excitement occurred at the time when the proportion of blood
  removed from the animal was equivalent to about the 320th part of the
   weight of the animal.          The increased irritability passes rapidly into
  general    convulsion    without consciousness, and, as a rule, ceases for a time
   with a temporary cessation of further loss of blood. After this the
   irritability remains, if the bleeding be arrested altogether, and can be
   called into action by any external stimulus, although it is rarely spon
   taneously manifested when the vessels are left divided and open. After
   an interval of one or two minutes there is a recurrence of loss of blood,
   followed by a muscular excitement which marks the moment of systemic
   death.      The breathing and circulation cease, but the voluntary muscles
   retain their irritability for several minutes, until they undergo per
   manent contraction ; indeed they retain their irritability under the influ
   ence of cold and lose      it under the influence of mechanical motion, heat,
   or electricity as markedly as when death has been produced without
   abstraction of blood.
       The fact of the two stages of exalted muscular irritability during
   abstraction of blood is important, as indicating the two different tensions

1873.]                        Irritability after Systemic Death.                315
of muscle to         w   hich reference has already been made. The first convulsive
action, convulsion            of syncope, marks a definite period, when the tension
of the heart and therewith of the whole vascular system is reduced to a
degree of action well defined and attended with definite phenomena.  In
this stage the force of the heart is sufficient to move the unconscious
muscles, and gradually, if blood be resupplied, to lift them again into the
condition for the sudden development of active conscious life. The second
excitement, convulsion of death, indicates the period when the passive or
lower tension of the muscular power ceases.
  A distinction                   by the author between the muscular
                             was here drawn
condition present during syncope and during death.     Syncope, it was
urged,  means the continued action of the heart at a low tension, from
which       it can
               be suddenly raised into full tension with restoration of the
powers  of life ; death means the cessation of the lowest tension at which
the heart can effectively work.
  It was shown that in all the cases of restored animation after apparent
death the condition of the heart was that of a muscle acting under the
lower degree of tension. In this intermediate stage, between syncope and
death, the most striking results were obtainable ; but beyond this stage
the methods so successful during            it,
                                     were practically useless for restoration.
   The experiments of the author for reestablishing artificial respiration,
together with artificial circulation, and of these combined with electrical
excitation of the nervous centres, were next referred to but as they had
                                                                      ;
already formed the subject of paper read before the Society, they were but
                                       a

   The author described in this place number of experimental attempts

to preserve blood for the purposes of transfusion.      He had endeavoured
to preserve by slow desiccation of blood but had found that when blood

was submitted  to evaporation, however slowly, an albuminous pellicle
formed on the upper surface, exactly as caseine forms on milk, and this

31G              Dr. B. Ward Richardson          on Muscular         [Slay 29,
prevented   the perfection   of the process. Recently he had been more
successful   by evaporating blood to which saline substances had been
added  ; he could not, at the same time, pronounce what he considered a
satisfactory termination of this line of experimental     inquiry.
                       Effect of  some  Cliemical Agents.
   In  this portion of his lecture the author detailed a series of experi
mental researches with various       chemical substances, organic, inorganic,
and intermediate,   which   tend to prolong the period of muscular irrita
bility by diffusion through the tissues of animals recently dead. The
substances which suspend irritability act in two ways.      Some, like chloride
of sodium and other soluble saline substances, act merely by holding the
coagulable fluid of the muscular tissue in a continued state of fluidity ;
others seem to have a different action, and to hold the nervous function
also in suspense.    The nitrite of amyl and other members of the nitrite
series belong to this last-named class of agents, and some of the cyanogen
bodies exert a similar influence.       In experiments with nitrite of amyl
on cold-blooded animals (frogs), the author had suspended muscular irri
tability for a period of nine days, and had then seen it restored to the
extent even of restoration    of life. In one instance this restoration took
place after the commencement of decomposition in the web of the foot of
the animal.    In warm-blooded animals a series of suspensions had been
effected by nitrites and also by cyanogens, not for so long a period, but for
periods of hours, in one instance extending to ten hours.
   Under the head Action on Nervous Matter the author included, finally, a
description of certain experiments he had made to determine the direct
effects of some agents upon the nervous matter.         In the whole series of
his inquiries no fact had impressed him more forcibly than this, that the
muscular irritability, in so far as it belongs to the muscle, may be sustained
for hours after the nervous excitation which calls it into spontaneous action
has ceased.   Hereupon he infers that after death the nervous matter under
goes a  change of condition which, in result, is identical with that change in
muscle which we call rigor mortis. There is evidence, moreover, from some
rare cases, that the final inertia ofnervous matter may be suspended and
revived, so that all the muscles may be reanimated.           This point was
elucidated by reference to the phenomena that had recently been observed
by Mr. "Wadsdale Watson, of Newport, Monmouthshire, on a double
monster, photographs of which were placed before the Society.           In this
instance two children were born so attached that the separation of tbem
was impossible.     Both lived equally for three hours after birth, and then
one died and remained dead for three hours, while the other lived. At
the end of the time named the dead child recommenced to breathe, and
showed other signs of restored muscular power; then it sank into a
second death, but at intervals of about four hours moved again; st
  ugth, twenty-three hours after its first apparent death, during a fit of

crying of the living child, it recovered sufficient power to breathe and even
to cry, and manifested evidence of life in all its muscles, except the
heart, for twenty minutes, when it had a severe convulsion, which stopped
all further motion.
   In this instance the author believed that the retention of muscular irri
tability had depended upon the retention in the nervous organism of the
conditions necessary for exciting motion.        He proceeded to describe his
researches as to the possibility of suspending nervous changes incident to
death, so as to retain the conditions requisite for the communication of
nervous impulse to muscular fibre.
                                    SUiQIAHT.
   1.  There are three degrees of muscular irritability —the active efficient,
passive efficient, negative inefficient.     The muscle after death may be
suspended in any of these conditions for action ; but, as a rule, it is the
last condition only that is maintained long after death.
   2. Muscular irritability may be suspended or stopped altogether under
three different conditions, having reference to its connexion with nervous
activity: — (a) The nervous and muscular activities may be suspended
equally, on which there may follow spontaneous return of motion.            (6)
The muscular irritability may outlive the nervous function, on which the
phenomenon of irritability may be induced by the application of the
motor forces, but there is no return of spontaneous irritability, t. e. of
irritability belonging to the animal as an independent agent. (c) The
nervous function may outlive the muscular irritability, under which cir
cumstances    irritability is invariably stopped by the production of per
sistent contractility of the muscular fibre.
   3. Nervous activity exciting muscular action is identical with all the
motor forces, and particular to none. It is equivalent to mechanical,
calorific, or electrical force, and equally susceptible of manifestation
through either.
   4. Muscular irritability after death is possible under conditions which,
so far, are thus known.         Cold, in certain defined degrees, suspends
without destroying it. The motor forces strike it into rest.             Blood
sustains it or stops it according to the balance of power existing between
the muscular and nervous systems.          Some chemical agents suspend it
independently, others suspend it, together and equally, with suspension
of the nervous function.         When suspension is equal there may         be
spontaneous return ; when it is unequal there is no return.
   In   conclusion,   the  author  said there had been six great advances
in physiological   medicine — viz. the introduction of the art of anatomy,
the discovery   of the circulation of the blood, the discovery of the chemical
process of respiration and nutrition, the discovery of the ultimate struc
ture of animal      bodies, the discovery    of osmosis and of the crystal

  to muscular structure in the living and in the dead conditions. That
  established, the phenomena of muscular movement, its suspension or its
  destruction, will be understood like every other physical fact that lies this
  side of ultimate fact— that is to say, that lies, as this

scientific investigation.
  The experiments recorded below were made with infusion of hay and
with infusion of turnip, sometimes with the addition of     few fragments             a
of pounded cheese.    It    necessary at
                                      is once  to  call attention to three
precautions which we have taken, and which we think are indispensable —                                :

        error, we excluded these from our infusion, either by filtration or by
decantation.        2. To ensure the satisfactory exposure of the whole contents

 350           Messrs. Podc and Laiikester on the Development                  [June     ID,
 of the tube to the boiling temperature, we, as a rule, completely submerged
 our experimental tubes in boiling water for a period varying from five
 minutes to half an hour.      3. The substances used in preparing the in
 fusions being necessarily of a very heterogeneous nature, we always
 examined samples of the infusions before and after boiling, at the time of
 closing the tubes, and were thus able to determine whether any changt
 had taken place in the visible particles contained in the fluid after a
 lapse of time.
    The microscopes used by us throughout, working side by side with
 samples from the same infusion, were a Hartnack's Stative TILL ob
 jective No 10 k immersion, ocular 4, belonging to the anatomical depart
 ment of the University Museum, and a large Powell and Lealand belong
 ing to the Eadcliffe Trustees, which is provided with a -fa and a -fa ob
 jective.  The former of the two English glasses was more usually em
 ployed  than the latter, on account of its greater convenience in manipu
 lation.
    Appearances in freshly prepared infusions. — Since the objects seen in
 such infusions are remarkable, and have doubtless sometimes led to error
in subsequent examination of infusions, we may draw attention to them
now.    In such freshly prepared infusions we have not unfrequently seen
appearances agreeing very closely with some of those figured by Dr.
Bastian in his book as coming into existence after boiling, sealing, and
preservation in a warm chamber. A freshly prepared and boiled strong
infusion of hay may present shreds of vegetable fibre, a considerable
number of dead Bacterium termo (some two or three to the field),
minute, highly refringent spherules, varying from the size of a blood-
corpuscle        to the   smallest size visible   ;   and   such   spherules   are   often
present in pairs, forming figure-of-8-shaped bodies, both smaller and
larger than Bacterium and of different optical character.    Further, dumb
bell-shaped   bodies are  not unfrequently   to be observed  of similar form
and size to Bacteria, but coarser in outline ; they dissolve on addition
of HC1, which Bacteria do not*. All these bodies exhibit constant
oscillatory (Brownian) movements.         The addition of new cheese to
such an infusion (as shown by examination of a simple infusion of new
cheese taken by itself) adds a considerable number of highly refringent
spherules of various sizes (oil-globules) and finely granular flakes, also a
few Bacteria and      the cheese be not quite new, almost certainly) ungus-

   Fresh-boiled turnip-infusion alone may contain so very few dead

are found, and a few finely granular flakes about j-iy^ inch in diameter.
The addition of cheese brings in, of course, the objects enumerated
above as belonging to it.
     Visibility of Bacteria. —It is perhaps necessary to say, before pro
ceeding further, that we have satisfied ourselves that, in infusions of the
optical character of those used, the multiplication of Bacteria makes itself
obvious by a cloudiness.        Hence, though we have not remained content
with that evidence, the retention by such a limpid infusion of its
limpidity is a proof of the absence of Bacteria. We also should mention,
what is well known already, that in a closed tube or bottle, after such
a cloud (of Bacteria) has developed, the Bacteria at a certain period cease
to multiply and settle down as a fine powder, leaving the fluid again clear.
Such precipitated Bacteria remain unchanged in the fluid for a long
period (weeks certainly, perhaps years), and can be readily shaken up and
at once recognized by microscopic examination ; they are, moreover, not
destroyed by boiling : hence it is not possible to miss the detection of a
development of Bacteria in a limpid turnip-infusion, examined daily for
three weeks or more by the naked eye, and finally, after agitation, by
means of the microscope.
     Sekies A. Nov. 23rd.        Experiments with hay-infusion. — An infusion
was prepared by pouring water of about 90° C. on to chopped hay. The
infusion was of a dark sherry-colour ; reaction slightly acid. The glass
tubes used in this and subsequent experiments were about five inches in
length, of half inch bore, rounded at one end and drawn out to a
capillary orifice at the other. The infusion in these and subsequent ex
periments was introduced by heating the tube and plunging its capillary
beak beneath the surface of the experimental liquid during the cooling of
the expanded air, until the tube was about one third or half filled.
Tubes 1, 2, 3 were half filled with the hay-infusion previously filtered,
the liquid was boiled in the tube, and the capillary beak fused, as nearly as
possible, during ebullition *.
    Tubes 4, 5 were similarly treated, with the difference that a small
 quantity of cheese, in a very fine state of division, had been added to this
portion of the hay-infusion before its introduction into the tubes.
    Tubes 6, 7. Quantity and character of the infusion as in 1, 2, 3, but
the tubes sealed without previous ebullition.
    * The tubes were sealed at the momentof removal from the flame over which they
 had been boiling.   In every case a subsequent recurrence of ebullition was observed
 during the cooling of the upper part of the tube. Dr. Koberts, of Manchester, has
 suggested that the occurrence   of Bacteria in tubes thus sealed may be explained by
 their in-draught, together with a certain amount of air, at the moment of closure ; but
 the experiments of Sanderson, recently confirmed by Cohn, have shown that contamina
 tion of fluids by Bacteria only takes place through the medium of impure surfaces or
 liquids.

    All these tubes (1 to 11) were after closure completely submerged in
 boiling water for fifteen minutes, and were then preserved                 in a hot-air
 bath, varying in temperature from 30° C. to 35° C.
    Microscopic and naked-eye        appearances     of  the hay-infusion at the time of
 sealing tlu tubes. — The infusion in tubes              1,  2, 3, 6, 7 was clear and
 pellucid, that in tubes 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11 was hazy.
    Microscopic examination gave the result indicated                  above, as to the
 appearances     of freshly   prepared    hay  and   hay-and-cheese    infusion.
    Subsequent appearances         of the infusion in Tubes 1-11. — The tubes
 with infusion which was pellucid at the first were found to retain this
 character for several weeks, being preserved in the air-bath                        and
 examined    from   day   to  day.   The    hazy  infusions    were  opened after four
 days, and their contents found to be unchanged.
    A portion of the same hay-and-cheese infusion, boiled and purposely
contaminated by preservation in an uncleaned beaker, was found after
four days to be teeming with Bacterium termo exhibiting vital movements.
The pellucid infusions were subsequently examined with the microscope
 at different times and found to be unchanged.
    Sehies B. Nov. 25th. Experiments with turnip-and-cheese infusion. —
An infusion was made with 700 grms. sliced white turnip and 1000 grms.
water, to which about 1 grm. finely minced new cheese was added, the jug
containing the mixture being maintained for four hours on a sand-bath at
a temperature of 45°-55° C.
   The infusion was now filtered; sp. gr. of the infusion 1011-1.                 Reac
tion slightly acid.
   Tubes 12, 13, 14. Sealed cold.            Submerged in boiling water for thirty

   Tubes     15,   16, 17, 18, 19. Sealed approximately              during ebullition.
Submerged      in  boiling   water  for  thirty  minutes.
   The tubes were preserved in the air-bath as in Series A.
   Microscopic and naked-eye appearances of the infusion at the time of
sealing the tubes. — The liquid in all the tubes was perfectly clear and
limpid. A few shreds and flakes were obvious, which appeared to be
derived from the filter-paper and from the slight precipitation of albu
minous matter.        The microscopic appearances were those above described
as characterizing     such infusions.

    Appearances in the infusions, Series C and D, at the time of sealing and

 similar to those described above as characterizing such infusions.
     Subsequent naked-eye examination of the tubes did not reveal the
 slightest change ; they remained limpid. Specimens from each group
 were opened and examined with the microscope after four days, and the
 microscopic characters found to be unchanged : the liquid was perfectly
 sweet.     The remaining tubes were examined at intervals before the end
 of December, being maintained during the whole time at a temperature
 of 35° to 40° C. in the air-bath ; they equally proved to have remained
 unchanged when opened and examined with the microscope, and were
 also free from unpleasant smell.
     Series E. Nov. 28th. — Six porcelain capsules were heated to redness,
 and nearly filled with the turnip-infusion used in Series C.     They were
 placed on the air-bath under a glass shade.

 of distilled water was added to each of these two capsules.
    After four days the infusion in capsules  1, 2, 5, and 6 was found to bo
 teeming with Bacterium termo and Bacterian filaments.
     Capsule 3 was found to be cracked, and hence was discarded           (it
 swarmed with Bacteria).

   Capsule     4 was perfectly free from organisms, and remained so during
a fortnight, when a fungus-mycelium made its appearance on the surface.
   Series F. Dec. 10th. — A strong infusion of turnip and cheese, pre
pared as in Series B (sp. gr. 1013), was boiled in an eight-ounce flask for
five minutes.       Three common test-tubes were superheated and placed in
a beaker to support them.
   No.   1.   The infusion was poured in, and with it one drop of distilled
 water.
   No.   2.   The infusion was poured in and thus left.
   No.   3. The infusion was poured in and again boiled for two minutes.
   These and the flask containing the remaining infusion were left on a
shelf for one day; on Dec. 11, there being no cloudiness in any of the four,
they were placed on the top of the hot-air bath.        On Dec. 13 No. 1 was
found to be swarming with Leptothrix-groxrtha and free Bacterium termo.
   No. 2 also was cloudy and swarmed with what Cohn calls the rosary-
chains.     No. 3 was absolutely free from all development of life, and was
perfectly sweet and limpid ; so also was the fluid in the original flask, a
large one capable of holding eight ounces.         How is the development of
Bacteria in No. 2 to be explained ? The original fluid remains pure ; the
fluid in No.    3, which was reboiled, remains so too ; the tube    itself, No  2,
had been heated red-hot       and could not be a source of contamination.
 One's attention was therefore     directed to the conditions    of the   passage
of the fluid from the flask into the tubes ; and here an explanation at
once offered itself.      The large flask had not bun superheated ; its lip was
still dirty, laden with Bacteria ready to contaminate fluids as they poured
from it   ;  hence the contamination    of the fluid in test-tube No. 2. The
validity of this explanation cannot be disputed, because it is known that
such glass surfaces, unless specially cleansed, invariably contaminate
infusions exposed to them.
   Series G. Feb. 11th. —The publication of Dr. Burdon Sanderson's
letter, describing some experiments made by Dr. Bastian, induced us
to make a further series of experiments with important modifications.
We had expressly avoided the introduction of any thing like visible lumps
of solid     cheese   or turnip into our infusions during their ebullition,
believing that such lumps were a possible source of the exclusion of
Bacteria or their germs from the killing influence of the boiling tempera
ture.    This precaution we had supposed (in the absence of any statement
to the opposite effect) to have been taken by Dr. Bastian in the experi
ments adduced by him in the ' Beginnings of Life.' The presence of such
lumps was publicly suggested in discussion at the British-Association
Meeting at Liverpool as a source of fallacy, and has been demonstrated
to be so by Dr. Ferdinand Cohn in experiments made with peas and
infusion of peas (' Beitriige zur Biologie dor Pflanzen,' Breslau, 1872).
Further, we had limited the bulk of our infusions and the size of our
experimental tubes. in view of the obvious consideration that the larger
the mass and area to be guarded against contamination           the greater the

chance of failure in that respect. Thirdly, it had not occurred to us to
make use of vessels in these experiments of a form so inconvenient and
difficult to thoroughly guard against effects of " spluttering," and to
thoroughly heat by boiling, as the retort.         Nor could we guess, in the
absence of any directions on that point from Dr. Bastian, that it was
desirable to exclude the rind of the turnip from the preparation of the
infusion.      The correspondence in ' Nature,' however, indicated that
" pounded " cheese (necessarily in a condition of solid
                                                              lumps) was added
(in some cases) to his experimental vessels after tlu turnip-infusion, and
was present during ebullition.         It also appeared that retorts capable of
holding two ounces were the vessels used ; whilst, on grounds not given,
it was considered advantageous by Dr. Bastian to peel the turnips
before slicing them.
    The following experiments were accordingly       made  : —
    An infusion of turnip      (minus the rind) was prepared and filtered ;
it had sp. gr. 1012-7. In     the experiments Nos. 34 to 47 two-ounce retorts
were used, and the bulb half filled with the experimental infusion.
     No. 34. The infusion neutralized with KHO.           About two grains of
 pounded cheese in pellets added to the retort.
     Nos. 35, 36. Infusion not neutralized.      About two grains of pounded
 cheese in pellets added to the retort.
     Nos. 37, 38, 39. The simple infusion.
     No. 40. The simple infusion, to which were added a few drops of an
 emulsion of cheese prepared with some of the turnip-infusion and new
 cheese, the emulsion having been filtered.

    Nos. 34 to 40 were boiled for five minutes ; they were then preserved in
 the air-bath at a temperature of 35° C, and sealed approximately during
 ebullition. Four of them, including No. 36, were subjected to a further
boiling of fifteen minutes in a water-bath after sealing.
    No. 41 was boiled for five minutes and placed on a shelf with its

    On Feb. 15th Nos. 34, 35, 37 were opened and found to be perfectly
 sweet and free from a development of Bacteria or other organisms.
    No. 41 was observed to be perfectly limpid, and is so still (March 17th).
    On Feb. 27th Nos. 36, 38, 39, and 40 were opened. With the excep
 tion of No. 36, they were perfectly sweet and free from organisms.
    No. 36 had a slightly foetid odour and swarmed with rather long
 Bacteria — that is, Bacteria longer than the common B. termo, which develops
 in infusions open to atmospheric air, but not quite of the form of the
 Bacillus subtilis of the butyric fermentation, which is stated to appear in
  some infusions, e. g. milk, to which the access of atmospheric air has
 been   entirely prevented.    It is to be noticed that in this series the only
  retort in which Bacteria made their appearance was one of those in

 35G       Messrs. Pode and Lankester on the Development            [June  19,
which small lumps of cheese were present during the subjection of the
 flask to the process of ebullition and subsequent immersion in boiling
 water.
    This result induced us to make    a further series of differential experi
 ments, bearing upon the influence of the state of aggregation of the
 cheese introduced into the turnip-infusion.
    Semes H. March 8th. — A turnip-infusion was prepared as in Series B ;
found after filtration to have sp. gr. 1113-5.
    Tubes similar to those used in Series A-E, and half filled, were used.
    Tubes 42, 43, 44. The simple infusion was poured into the tube, so
as to half fill it ; a lump of cheese the size of a pea was then added.
 Sealed cold.
    Tubes 45, 46, 47. To the turnip-infusion, before introduction into the
tubes, an emulsion of cheese prepared with turnip-infusion and strained
through a piece of cambric was added.        The tubes were then half filled
with this mixture and sealed cold.
    Tubes 48, 49, 50.     The  same as 42, 43, 44, but sealed approximately
during ebullition.
    Tubes 51, 52, 53.    The   same as 45, 46, 47, but sealed approximately
during ebullition.
    All the tubes, 42 to 53, were completely submerged during five minutes
in boiling water, and subsequently preserved in the air-bath at 35° C.
temperature.
    On March 13th the contents of the twelve tubes were examined with
the microscope.      No. 45 had been broken in the boiling. The five
remaining    tubes   which   had been prepared with cheese in the finely
divided condition were found to be entirely devoid of life, the infusion
microscopically and otherwise unchanged.          Of the six tubes prepared,
each with a small lump of cheese, no organisms were detected in 42 and
44 ; but in 43 and 49 a few elongate Bacteria were observed (in the
proportion of about two to the field of a Hartnack's system 10). In 48
and 50 the fluid was swarming with elongate Bacteria and true Bacillus.
The lumps of cheese in those tubes in which life appeared had softened
and spread out to a certain extent on the side of the tube.      The cheese-
lumps    in Nos. 42  and  44 retained their original form.
    From the result of these later experiments, made in consequence of
the fuller information given by Dr. Sanderson as to Dr. Bastian's mode
of treating turnip and cheese so as to obtain phenomena supposed to be
in favour of the doctrine of Archebiosis, we consider that the importance
of excluding visible lumps from the experimental infusions is clearly
indicated, as also is the comparatively greater trustworthiness of the small
tube as opposed to the larger retort for use as an experimental vessel.
We moreover consider that we, in our earlier experiments (November
and December), carefully following Dr. Bastian's directions, as far as he

contradicting Dr. Bastian's statements as to the spontaneous generation of
B.teteria in infusion of turnip to which a fragment of cheese had been
 added.
    Further, certain of the experiments above recorded, and others made
at the same times with open vessels and simple turnip -infusion, compel
 us to dissent emphatically from the conclusion of the following statement
 contained in a recent paper by Dr. Bastian (' Nature,' Feb. 6th, p. 275): —
 " Taking such a fluid, therefore, in the form of a strong filtered infusion
 of turnip, we may place it after ebullition in a superheated flask, with
 the assurance that it contains no living organisms.            Having ascertained
 also, by our previous experiments with the boiled saline fluids, that there
 is no danger of infection by Bacteria from the atmosphere, we may leave
 the rather narrow mouth of the flask open, as we did in these experi
 ments.       But when this is done, the previously clear turnip-infusion
 invariably becomes turbid in one or two days (the temperature being
 about 70° F.), owing to the presence of myriads of Bacteria." The italics
  are our own.
     We find not only that such an infusion remains free from Bacteria
  when thus treated (subject, of course, to certain failures in the precautions
                "
  taken) for one or two days," but if contamination by the admission of
  coarse atmospheric particles capable of carrying Bacteria be guarded
  against, it will remain so for weeks and probably so for years.              In con
  sequence of this absence of development of Bacteria we have cultivated
  Torida in such a turnip-infusion, so as to obtain them entirely free from
  the former organisms*.
      In conclusion, we would point out that failure in manipulation, con
  tamination in unsuspected ways, such as that due to the preservative
  influence of lumps, and, again, the mistaking of particles in an infusion
  which have been there from the first for organisms originated de novo,
  do not exhaust the list of conceivable explanations of phenomena which
  have been attributed to spontaneous generation.             When the knowledge
  of the natural history of Bacteria has advanced somewhat further, there
  will be a possibility of such explanations presenting themselves in ways
  at this moment unsuspected.
     Whilst awaiting       Professor Huizinga's fuller account of his experi
  ments, we may point out that the hypothesis of an inhibitory influence of
  increased density should be supported by experimental evidence, and that
  it cannot apply to tubes closed before boiling.            The neck of the flask
  closed with asphalt may (so far as conditions are stated by him at
  present) harbour Bacteria, as in our Series F. But especially we would
  urge upon him and others that it is undesirable, as yet, to introduce into

        Major Bengal Army. Communicated by Prof. Huxlet, Sec.
        R.S. Received April 22, 1873.
                       On the Poison of Naja tripudians.
    The destruction of life in India by snake-bites is so great, that, with
 the hope of preventing or diminishing the mortality, in 1867 Dr. Fayrer
 began, and has recently completed, a protracted and systematic series
 of investigations on the subject in all its aspects; and, in a work entitled
 the ' Thanatophidia      of India,' has published a description of the
 venomous snakes found in British India, with an account of a series of
 experiments on the lower animals, conducted for the purpose of studying
 the nature of the poison, its modus operandi, and the value of the
 numerous remedies that have been from time to time reputed as anti
 dotes — that is, as having the power of neutralizing the lethal effects of
 the virus, and of saving life.
     His object in carrying out these investigations has been : —
     1st. To ascertain the nature and relative effects of the bite of the
 different forms^of Indian venomous snakes, and the conditions and
 degrees of intensity under which the activity of the virus is most
 marked.
     2nd. The physiological   action of the virus, and its mode of   causing
 death.
     3rd. The value of remedies, and the extent to which we may,     by pre
 ventive or therapeutic measures, hope to save life.
     4th. To ascertain and make known the actual state of our informatinn
 in connexion with these three points of inquiry, and to substitute scien
 tific and rational knowledge for vague, empirical, and dangerous theories.
     He has had the honour of submitting a copy of this work to the Eoraf
 Society ; and it is therefore unnecessary to occupy its time by repeating
 much of what is therein related on the 1st, the 3rd, and part of tlie#i
 heads.

       But on that which is involved in the 2nd, and partly in the 4th, much
  still required to be done ; and therefore on the question of the nature
 is
and physiological action of the virus on life, and the application of that
knowledge in the treatment of those poisoned, the following investigations
have been      made.
      That the subject is one of interest in a purely scientific as well as
sanitary   point of view we believe will be admitted ; for it is as important to
humanity as to science that the nature and properties of a poison which,
in India alone, probably destroys over 20,000 human beings annually
should be determined.
   We are aware that these figures may excite astonishment and even mis
trust ; but the sources from which the information is derived place   we             it,
think, beyond     doubt, being derived from official returns for the year
                     a
1869, supplied to Dr. Fayrer by the Government of India.
   He has received reports from Bengal, the North-west Provinces, Pun-
jaub, Oude, Central Provinces, Central India, Rajpootana, British Bur-
mah, showing the loss of life from snake-poisoning in those provinces in
the    year 1869.

               represent,       true, only

of a population (according to Dr. Hunter) of 120,972,283, or, in roanl
numbers, about one parson in every 10,000 .
    This total, large as it is, we fear cannot be regarded as the real mortality
in these provinces, nor may the numbers be accepted as an absolutely
true indication of the relative frequency of deaths in each.
    The information from which these records were framed was, though
official, probably only partial and imperfect.         Dr. Fayrer believes that if
systematic     returns  could  be   kept, as he has suggested that they should be,
by the police in every district, subdivision, and municipality, the number of
deaths would be, excluding all doubtful cases, much larger.            He beliera
also that were such information collected throughout the whole of Hin-
doostan, it would be found that more than 20,000 persons die annually
 from snake-bite.
    The result of his investigations in India has been, we think, to show
that, so far, no agent or antidote, as that term is commonly understood.
has been fouud effective in neutralizing the action of snake-poison. We
think it is also pretty clearly demonstrated that death is caused in most
 cases, at all events where a full quantity of the virus has been injected,
 by its action on the nerve-centres, though whether on them alone, or also
 on the peripheral distribution of the nerves, or on the muscles them
 selves, or the exact extent to which each is affected, there may be same
 difficulty in determining.       The futility of all the methods of treatment
 hitherto    had   recourse   to  is  probably explained by the mode of death :
 their inutility had long since been demonstrated by Fontana, who.
 ninety years ago, among other things, showed that the outward and
 inward use of ammonia, as well as its injection into the veins, was as
 powerless for good as were all other remedies.
    There is apparently some analogy between the nature of the action of
 the cobra-virus and that of curara, death in both cases being brought
 about by arrest of respiration through paralysis of the respiratory
 apparatus.
    In the case    «f the curara it has been demonstrated by experiment          that
 this is due to paralysis of the peripheral distribution of the motor nerves;
 and it has been further shown that if respiration be continued artificially for
 a sufficient length of time, perfect recovery may take place, as we have our
 selves observed, the poison being eliminated          from the system. and not
 having, during its presence, so far compromised the integrity of the parts of
 the nervous system where it took effect as to interfere with a resumption
 of their functions after its removal.       Now it is evident that artificial respi
 ration and the use of any remedies that may expedite elimination, with
 the application of artificial warmth to sustain temperature up to the
 normal standard, are the measures which may be regarded as antidotal
 in a rational sense to this form of poisoning ; and such they have proved
 themselves to be ; for if an animal apparently dead from curara-poisoning
be kept warm and artificial respiration be kept up for some hours, it w2I
perfectly recover.

 1873.]         of the Poison of some Indian          Venomovs       Snakes.       361
   It   is in the application of similar principles that we may hope to
realize   a   similar result in    of snake-poisoning ; and it is with this
                                  cases
object that the investigations by Dr. Lauder Brunton and Dr. Fayrer, since
his return to England, of which the present paper is an instalment, have
been pursued.
    Our investigations so far confirm the opinion by Dr. Fayrer already re
corded, that death is due to the action of the poison on the nerve-centres,
to which it is conveyed by the blood with terrible rapidity when the injec
tion of the poison takes place into a large vein like the crural or jugular.
But we have not yet arrived at absolute conclusions as to the extent to
which this neurotic action is carried, whether it be localized in the nerve-
centres only, or whether there be, and to what extent, any action on
other portions of the nerve-apparatus.
    Our experiments so far, though pointing distinctly to the centres as the
seat of its action, in some cases seem to imply that the nerve-periphery
and perhaps even the muscles themselves are involved ; but on this head,
for the present, we reserve the expression of a positive opinion.
   With reference to remedial measures in cobra-poisoning, we would
remark that, so far as our experiments have as yet gone, artificial respira
tion has certainly had the effect of prolonging life ; and without com
mitting ourselves to any opinion, we would say that we would not yet
abandon hope that it may, as in the case of the curara, even save it alto
gether. This must of course depend on, first, the nature of the action of
the poison on the nerve-apparatus — that is, whether it be of a transient
or permanent character. Is        for example, like curara, which though
                                    it,                                              it
destroys   the  power of   the  peripheral extremity of the motor nerves
during its presence, yet leaves them uninjured and capable of resuming
their functions after the poison     removed (as
                                          is        may be) by elimination,
                                                           it
life being supported by artificial respiration during that process.
   If   so, and the cobra-poison,     even though antagonistic        and annihilative
of the action of the nerve-centres and peripheral distribution, or of the
muscular irritability itself, be only so whilst         present, and would,
                                                          it   is                    if
removed within reasonable time, leave the nervous apparatus or muscles
in condition to resume their operations, then,
   a                                                     elimination could be
                                                                if
carried on whilst respiration      artificially
                                     is         sustained,  we might hope to
succeed eventually in cobra as in curara poisoning.
   Or could we, indeed, conceive of and find any agent so subtle as to
overtake and neutralize the virus whilst         in the system, and before
                                                it   is                              it
should have  compromised the nerve-centres or other parts, then we should
have the antidote which has been so long sought for, but yet, we fear, not
found*. We do not now wish to speak of the action of the cobra-virus as              it

operates secondarily on the blood, either in thqse cases where great rigour
of the animal or suiallness of the dose have enabled the creature to resist
the immediate and deadly neurotic effects of the poison. Such cases are to
be classed among other septicaemiae, and are                 apart from    that we are    now
discussing.
  The question resolves itself into three points of inquiry —               :
   1st. Is the nature of the virus such that we may hope to                           find any
agent that may overtake, neutralize, and so render     (the virus)   it               narmtai

Whichever of these propositions be nearest the truth, there must still                           be
a condition in which, from the smallness of the quantity           virus         of            in
oculated, recovery    possible — one in which the full lethal effect
                                is                                        tbe            of
virus    not produced.
         is              In such cases, no doubt, remedial measures      mav
be of avail.
    The results of investigations            in India have led to the     conclusion,     then,
that death   brought about by the action of the poison on the eerebro-spinal
                  is
nerve-centres, paralyzing them, and in some cases, where the quantity                            of
virus was large and introduced into the circulation through the medium
of large vein, acting directly on the ganglia of the heart, causing arrest
    a
of its action.  In those cases where the quantity of virus inoculated                            is
smaller and of less intensity, according to the condition of the snake or
its species (the poison of some genera being less active than that                               of
others), secondary changes, though of what precise kind we are not
yet prepared to say, occur in the blood itself, but allied in character                          to
that of other blood-poisons and probably of         zymotic nature.
                                                                 a    We

already been traversed by previous observers, who have come to similar con
clusions that most of the reputed antidotes have been powerless, and that
where there has been an appearance of success, it has depended not on
any antidotal or antagonistic action of the remedy so much as on the
fact that the quantity or quality of the poison was defective ; and how
this may be explained, Dr. Fayrer has endeavoured to prove by showing
that the snake may have been exhausted, that its poison may be deficient
in quantity or in quality, or that it may have wounded without inoculating
sufficient of the poison to cause death, or more than to cause slight poison
ing, and probably that, by a sphincteral arrangement of fibres, as pointed
out by Dr. Weir Mitchell to exist in the rattlesnake, the snake may have
the power of imbedding its fangs without shedding its poison at all.'
  Much virtue has          recently attributed to one of the oldest and
                                been
most trusted of all antidotes — ammonia ; but it was long ago shown
by Fontana by repeated experiments that the injection of this agent
into the veins, as well as its internal administration and external ap
plication, were powerless (as may be seen by reference to the following*
pages of his works), so it has proved in all the experiments made with it
in India. Any complete and satisfactory means of resisting, antagonizing,
or eliminating the poison and of saving life are, we fear, still unknown ;
and it is in the hope that by determining the physiological action of the
poison we may make some advance in our knowledge of this important
subject, that the following investigations have been undertaken with cobra-
virus sent to us from Bengal, and of which we hope to receive continued
supplies from Mr. Vincent Richards, of Balosore, who, at our request, is
also carrying on a series of experiments on the subject.
               Appearance and Chemical Characters of Cobra-poison.
   The poison when fresh is a transparent, almost colourless fluid, of a
somewhat sirupy consistence, and not unlike glycerine in its appearance.
When quickly dried it forms a transparent mass of a yellowish-brown
colour, and resembling some kinds of gum-arabic.    The poison may be
kept  in  a fluid state for some months without undergoing   any change,
but after a certain time it decomposes.
   During decomposition it gives off a quantity of gas, which has been
ascertained by Dr. Armstrong to be carbonic anhydride, and at the same
time acquires a dark brown colour and a disagreeable odour.    The dried
poison may be kept for a much longer time without undergoing any
apparent change.
   The chemical constitution of the poison has been examined by Dr.
Armstrong.   He has not been able to separate from it any crystalline
principle. It is partially coagulated by heat ; mineral acids produce in it

albuminoid body.       On an ultimate analysis being made, very little

It retained  its fluidity and activity to the last. The third sample was of
a light-brown colour, quite solid, and resembling dry hard cheese in its
consistency.    The second and fourth consisted of a clear, thin, transparent
fluid and a white curdy precipitate.      None of these specimens had the
same activity as the first ; they produced similar symptoms, but much
less marked.
  Effects      ofpoison. — The local effects of the poison are partial
                    the
paralysis of the bitten part, occasionally pain in  ecchymosis aroundit,
the spot where the poison has been introduced, and sometimes in other
and distant parts, and, the animal survives for some hours, infiltration
                               if
and perhaps incipient decomposition of the tissues and haemorrhagic
discharge.
   The general symptoms are depression, faintness, hurried respiration
and exhaustion, lethargy, nausea, and vomiting. In guineapigs and rabbits
peculiar twitehing movements occur, which seem to represent vomiting in
them, and occasionally, in fact, guineapigs do vomit. Dogs vomit, are
salivated, and present an appearance as      the hair had all been rubbed
                                                      if
the wrong way, "staring."    As the poisoning proceeds paralysis appears,
sometimes affecting the hind legs first and seeming to creep up the body,
and sometimes affecting the whole animal nearly at the same time.

  Haemorrhage, relaxation of the sphincters, and involuntary evacuations,
not unfrequently of a sanguineous or muco-sanguineous character, often
precede death, and         generally accompanied by convulsions.

forwards, rests on the beak, and gradually the bird, no longer able to
support itself, rolls over on its side. There are frequent startings, as of                 if
sudden awaking from the drowsy state*.
    The effects of the poison upon dogs,                    guineapigs,      and rabbits are
illustrated by the following experiments.
   The poison which was first sent home and still remained perfectly
liquid, but had become of   dark brown, almost black colour, and some
                                    a

flank of      a   small dog. Immediately after the injection the corresponding

    22'. The condition of the ears has continued the same.          The eyes are
becoming half shut and the eyeballs turned up.
    The animal now begins to tremble.             The head is laid down on the
table and then raised again : this is succeeded by a nodding motion of
the head.     The head is next laid down on the table.
    Respirations 22 in    15 seconds.
    24'.  The animal has sunk down on its face, and paws as if its fore legs
would no longer support it.        The hind legs, however, still support the
posterior part of the body.      Respirations 11 in 10 seconds.       It seems to
be trying in vain to raise its head.
    26'. Bespirations 8 in 10 seconds.            Convulsions.    The cornea is
sensitive.    The rabbit is now lying on its side. Respirations 5 in 15
 seconds.    Pulse 12 in 18 seconds.
    31'. Cornea is nearly     but not quite insensible.      The eyeball is pro
 truding.
    About    31     respiration has stopped.        The heart is still     beating
vigorously.
    32'. Cornea insensible.      The animal opened immediately.         The heart
 was beating vigorously ; 21 beats in 10 seconds.
    An attempt was made to insert electrodes into the spinal cord and
 pass uninterrupted current through them.          No effect followed ; but it is
not certain' that they were well in the cord. Irritation of the nerves
going to the hind legs by uninterrupted current had but a slight effect.
 Direct irritation of the muscles caused them to contract.              After the
irritation was discontinued, a fibrillary twitching was observed in one of
the extensions of the thigh.
    42'. Heart still feebly pulsating.    Irritation of the brachial, sciatic, and
crural nerves has very little effect.

staltic movements of the intestines           occurred when the abdominal     cavity
was opened.        The heart was dark and slightly dilated ; all its cavities
were contracting, though feebly.           There were three beats of the auricles
to each one of the ventricles.            Irritation of the nerves in the pelvis
 caused contractions      of the legs.

                  Means of preventing  the Effects of the Poison.
    There are three ways in which the toxic effects of a poison may be
entirely prevented or greatly diminished. These are : — 1st, by preventing
its   admission    into the blood ; 2nd, by counteracting the effects it
produces while it is circulating in the body and sustaining life by
artificial respiration ; 3rd, by quickening its elimination.        The first of
these methods is the only one which has hitherto been of any great
service in cases of poisoning by the bite of cobras. Various attempts
have been made to counteract the effects of cobra-poison by means of
antidotes ; but the advantage derived from their use is still, to say the
least, doubtful.      No special attempts, so far as we know, have been
made to hasten the elimination of the poison, or at least none have been
made avowedly for this purpose, though it is possible that some of the
antidotes may have had that effect. This part of the subject we will
treat in a future paper.
    The subject of prevention of entry of the virus by ligature or other
mechanical measures has been fully discussed in the 'Thanatophidia'; it
is unnecessary to recur to it here, for the present at all events.
    For the purpose of attempting to counteract the effects of the cobra-
poison while it is circulating in the blood, it is necessary to have some
idea of its mode of action.
                         Mode of Action of  the Poison.
    Snake-poison    probably  produces its fatal or deleterious effects either
by completely paralyzing the nerve-centres or other portion of the
nervous apparatus, and thus causing arrest of respiration, or by partially
paralyzing them and also poisoning the blood, thereby inducing patho
logical conditions of a secondary nature, which may, according to circum
stances, cause the slightest or the most dangerous symptoms.
    The effect produced depends on two sets of conditions: — first, the
species    of the snake, its actual state at the time, the quantity and
quality of its poison, and the circumstances under which it inflicts the
bite ; second, the species, size, and vigour of the living creature, and the
circumstances under which it is bitten.
   Snake-poison is essentially a neurotic, and, when it takes full effect,

                                                           in   some
distribution of nerve-force. It is also an irritant ; for if applied to a
mucous membrane or to the conjunctiva, it soon induces violent in
flammation ;  absorption at the same time takes place, and symptoms of
poisoning are produced. It is also, to a certain extent, a septic ; for if the
bitten creature survive, the wound and the parts about it are apt to
slough and to induce septicaemia.                           The poison acts by absorption — that
    is,   by   entering the circulation, and so reaching the nerve-centres,  pro                        it
duces,          according to the quantity or intensity of the venom, either death
or severe local and constitutional                     symptoms.            If   it   find entry   by   a   large

entry into the circulation   or     has already entered, to neutralize or

natural              depurating organs and their secretions, and to treat local,
consecutive,                and constitutional        symptoms         by   such remedial measures as
may be required by the patient's condition.
  Absorption takes place with extreme rapidity, so fast, indeed, that                                            it
was formerly supposed, in the case of some of the more active poisons,
that they acted by transmission                       of   a    shock through the nervous system                 ;
and, so          far    as we     know at present,         it   isnot improbable that such, in some
instances, may be the case. But rapid as the effect of snake-bite some
times    there is,
                 no reason to believe that generally

nerve-centres through any other channel than that of the vascular
system.   The experiments of Blake, Hering, and, later, of Claude
Bernard  show that absorption takes place with such rapidity as to ex
plain the most rapid deaths from such cause.       Blake (vide Guy's
  Forensic Medicine,' 3rd edition,     388) found that    poison passed

 a poison injected      into the jugular vein was distributed throughout the
 circulation in nine seconds.          Claude Bernard found that a saturated
  solution of   sulphuretted hydrogen introduced into the jugular vein of a
  dog began to be eliminated from the lungs in three seconds, and when
  injected into the femoral vein of the same dog in six seconds.
     We have neither seen nor heard of any case of snake-poisoning, in
  man or the lower animals, so rapid (though in some Dr. Fayrer has ob
  served the first symptoms in a few seconds) as to justify the conclusion
  that poisoning had occurred otherwise than through the medium of the
 circulation.
     Some preliminary experiments made in England by one of us (Dr.
 Brunton) with the poison before it had undergone decomposition seemed
 to show that it produced paralysis of the spinal cord, of the ends of the
 motor nerves, and of the muscles themselves.                The experiments which
 we made together with the same poison a few months afterwards, as
 well as with other samples of poison sent from India, have not given
 concordant      results.   We therefore propose to postpone the considera
 tion of this subject to a future paper, and to confine ourselves at present
 to the mode in which death is produced by the poison, especially in
 mammals.
     Somatic death, according to Bichat, may commence in the brain, lungs,
 or heart ; but the experiments of Fontana and Legallois show that so
 long as circulation and respiration are kept up the body remains alive
 although the head be absent.              The brain is only necessary to life,
 inasmuch as the respiratory movements cease when it is removed or
 destroyed, either mechanically or by the action of a poison upon it.                 The
 causes of somatic death are thus limited to failure of the circulation and
 failure of the respiration.
     The long continuance of the cardiac pulsations after apparent death
 (Expts. I., III., IV., V., IX., X.) excludes failure of the circulation as the
 usual cause of death     ; and we are thus brought by exclusion to regard death
 caused by    the  bite  of a cobra, or by its poison introduced into the body
in any other way, as death from failure of the respiration, or, in other
 words, death by asphyxia.         The truth of this view is well illustrated by
 the following experiments *, which show that the vitality of the heart may
be retained for a considerable time if the respiration is kept up.                      It
 shows also that the convulsions which have been remarked by Bussell
and all subsequent observers as almost always preceding death are not
due so much to the action of the poison itself on the nervous centres, as
that they depend on the irritation which is produced in them by the
venosity of the blood.

jugular, and causes sudden arrest of the heart's action.

injected into the thigh of a strong fowl. Shortly after it began to droop.
It  then seemed drowsy, and crouched down with the beak resting on the

bright red colour and        became dusky.      Almost simultaneously convul
sions occurred.        A  cannula was quickly inserted into the trachea, and
artificial respiration commenced. The comb rapidly regained its bright
colour, and the convulsions ceased.         On the artificial respiration being
discontinued the lividity of the comb reappeared, and convulsions again
began. The experiment was repeated about ten times, and on each oc
casion the convulsions disappeared whenever the blood became arterial,
as shown by the bright colour of the comb, and reappeared when the
blood became venous.        After discontinuing artificial respiration, the con
vulsions returned and the fowl died.

  III. " Observations      on the Effects of Exercise on the Temperature
         and Circulation."       By C. Handfield Jones, M.B. Cantab.,
         F.R.S.    Received May 24, 1873.
     The effects of nervo-muscular exertion on the great functions of circu
 lation and calorification in the human body must always form an inter
 esting subject of observation, not only to the physiologist, but also to the
 physician, as affording the best available test of the power of the indi
 vidual frame to endure the strain of disease as well as of fatigue.            The
effect of bodily exertion on temperature has often been observed.                 J.
Davy found active exertion to raise the temperature      1°- 7 F. Obernier found
that a quick march of ] \ hour raised the temperature l°-8 to 2°-16F. Wun-
derlich gives the case of an athlete, who, while running a race, suddenly
became faint and insensible, and was found soon after to have a tempera
ture of 104°-9 F., a pulse of 128, and some albumen in his urine.           In two
hours the temperature had fallen to 102°-38.        On the second morning the
temperature was normal, and remained so, while the urine quickly became
free from albumen.       Dr. Bathurst Woodman relates the case of a youth
who, after walking seventy miles in two days, had a temperature of 105° F.,
with a pulse of 130, and enormous quantities of litbates in the urine.
Another, after similar exertion, was simUarly affected. This evidence seems
conclusive as to the tendency of severe nervo-muscular exertion to raise the
bodily temperature ; and it seems that this result is promoted by any
existing debility, as in one of Obernier's observations, when the man was
out of health, a very fast walk of one hour raised his temperature to
103°-28    F. Wunderlich's    and Dr. Woodman's    cases are   of special interest,

  of high but transitory fever.
      My own results, so far as the temperature alone is concerned, are little
  more than confirmatory of those of others ; but the records of the tracings,
  and of the variations in the cardiac force which were noted at the same
  time, may add something to their value.

  thirteen males, in average good health, during winter or spring weather,
  about the same hour, 8-10 p.m.       The age of I. was 53-54, of II. 36,
  of VIII. 38, of the others 16 to 26. All bore the exertion well, except
  IV., who vomited, and was rather prostrate for a short time after.
  The exercise consisted of a smart run for a mile or two.         I have de
  scribed the sphygmometer with which      I  measured the force of the pulse
  in the ' Medical Times and Gazette,' 1871, vol. ii. p. 183. After the run
  the pulse-rate was generally first observed, then the force necessary to
  compress the radial artery, then the tracing was taken, and lastly the
  temperature.     Wherever the pressure employed in taking the tracing is
  not stated, it is to be understood that the same was employed before
  and after the run.
      The result of the Sphygmometer observations was sufficiently constant
  to indicate the effect generally produced, or tending to be produced, by
 hard exercise.      In eight out of the thirteen cases the artery was com
  pressed by a less force after than it had been before the exercise.      The
  difference in I. was represented by 100 grammes, in III. by 48, in IV.
 by 112, in V. by 123 (about), in VII. by 56, in VIII. by 116, in X. by
 376, in XI. by 100. These figures may be considered to represent the
 diminution of the force exerted by the left ventricle.    The amount of the
 arterial contraction existing at the time of each observation is perhaps in
                                                  I
 some measure concerned in the result, but is, believe, a factor of far less
 importance than the cardiac contraction.       This opinion is borne out by
 a reference to the tracings of VI., which indicate considerable arterial
 constriction before the run, and but little after ; yet the sphygmometer
 result is almost the same in both periods.       In four instances, II., IX.,
XII. , XIII., the above relation was reversed ; the force of the cardiac
 contraction   appeared to be greater after than before the exercise.        I
can be sure,    I think, that this did not depend on erroneous observation.
The excess in      II. was 56 grammes, in IX. nearly 200, in XII. 30, in
XIII.     110 grammes.     As these were vigorous individuals, it does not
 seem improbable that the exercise, which lasted only some ten or fifteen
minutes, might excite the heart rather than exhaust it ; yet the tracings
of II. and IX. do not bear out this view. These four instances seenTto
me very important, as demonstrating, what might have been suspected on
other grounds, how necessary it is to apply the dynamic test in judging
of the validity of the circulatory organs. It is not the amount of the
force put forth by the heart at a given moment, or the correctness of the
                                                              2 H 2

form of the tracing at the same time, that will enable us to judge how
the heart and its vessels will bear the strain of fatigue or of disease. One
heart may possess much more reserve force than another, and be able to
put forth an increase of energy under the very trial to which the other is
succumbing.      One man's arteries may possess much more tone and his
capillaries more retentive power than another man's.
   The Temperature observations are very accordant, showing a rise of
•2° C. (-36° F.) in I. and IV., of -3° C. (5-°4 F.) in VII., of -4° C. (-72° F.)
in V. and IX., of -5° C. (-9° F.) in XI. and XIII., of -6° C. (1°-1 F.) in
VI., VIII., and X., and of 1° C. (l°-8 F.) in    III.  and XII.    The general
result favours the view that the nerve-centres, which regulate tempera
ture, are enfeebled, though but moderately, by the expenditure of force.
The degree of paresis produced varies much in different individuals ; but
only in two of my subjects did it approach the verge of morbid.             The
cases, however, previously cited from Wunderlich, Obernier, and "Wood-           •
man make it very probable that the same cause acting during a longer
time would have produced in my instances also decided febrile pheno
mena ; in fact it must be considered remarkable that, in spite of the free
sweating which took place, the cool weather, and the lapse of some
minutes which occurred before the temperature could be taken, the rise
should have been so constant.      One remarkable exception, indeed, there
is in case II., where the exertion produced actually a fall of -6° C.
(lo-08 F.).   This might    be explained, as the   individual is a man of fine
physique, by a similar assumption     as was made     with respect to the in
crease of cardiac force, viz. that the regulating centres were stimulated
and not depressed by the exertion ; but this is doubtful, and       I  can find
no satisfactory explanation.     In observation A, at the end of the walk
(twenty-two miles) the temperature was notably depressed, being no
more than 35°-4, i. e. l°-2 C. (2°-16 F.) below the ordinary temperature of
the individual. As food had been taken five hours before, lack of fuel could
hardly have been the sole cause, as it seems to have been in Dr. Clifford
Allbutt's case ; in fact the individual referred to has a temperature of
36°-2 C. (97°-16 F.) after six hours' fast, when quiescent.        The tracing,
observation   A  (b), was small, but the circulation was fairly good, and the
walker did not feel at all chilled.    The contrast in this instance between
the effects of short but severe exertion and prolonged moderate exertion is
very marked. The former raised the temperature of the same man on one
occasion -6° C. (lo-08 F.), the latter depressed it just twice as much.
   The Pulse-rate was doubled or more in II., IV., and V., and increased
to a less amount in the others. The reason usually assigned for this ac
celeration, viz. that the blood arrives in greater quantity at the heart
because of the pressure exerted on the veins by the contracting muscles,
appears to me by no means satisfactory ; for if this were the real cause,
the heart's action ought to be equally accelerated, or nearly so, in all
persons, irrespective of their vital condition.       Such, however, is by no

378             Dr. C. H. Jones on the Effects of Exercise             [June  19,
means the fact ; it is well known that a person in good condition will do
a given piece of work with far less acceleration of pulse than one who is
untrained.     Thus   a Londoner, in ascending a steep Surrey hill heavily
weighted, had    his  pulse raised from 78 (while sitting still) to 120 ; hut a
countryman, of rather stronger build, performed the same work with
much less acceleration.       His pulse was 90 after he had walked to the
bottom of the hill, 96 at the        top.  An    anoemic   patient of mine had
her pulse increased from 78 to 160 by a slight            exertion, which, when
she was stronger and had more blood, only raised it to 103.                Graves
observed that the degree of acceleration      of  the pulse produced by sitting
up in bed is a good indication of the extent to which a patient is ex
hausted.     These facts     seem  to prove, per exclusionem, how much the
state of the nerve-force      has to do with the pulse-rate.       Direct experi
ment (the section of the vagi) makes this still more certain ; moreover,
as acceleration of the pulse is met with very commonly in conditions of
febrile debility, and as a cause of exhaustion was present in all my cases,
it does not seem an unreasonable hypothesis, from all these premises, to
regard weakening of the regulating action of the vagi on the cardiac
nerve-apparatus as the cause of the increased pulse-rate, the vagi nerves
or their centres being weakened by the withdrawal of nerve-force to the
motor centres of the limbs.
    But though    I  can hardly doubt that this view is in the main correct,
harmonizing     also as it does with that taken as to the cause of the in
creased temperature, yet it seems to be opposed by the results obtained
with the manometer after division of the vagi. Dr. Sanderson finds that
in such experiments the contractions of the heart are sufficiently vigorous
to maintain an arterial pressure several inches higher than the normal.
But if   I may trust my finger and the sphygmometer, the force of the
cardiac contractions and the resulting arterial pressure are generally de
cidedly lowered by active exertion ; in fact we know that excessive
exertion may produce syncope.         I cannot attempt to reconcile this dis
crepancy.     Acceleration of the pulse-rate per se seems to have no influ
ence in increasing the intravascular pressure.        This conclusion seems to
follow from an examination of the sphygmometer records and of the
tracings, which, in the majority of instances, show weakening of the
 cardiac force.
    In judging   of the Tracings, it may be assumed that in the state of
 quietude there is a certain amount of nervo-muscular force put forth by
 the heart and arteries with their nerve-centres, such as can be con
 tinuously and without effort produced, and that the amount exhibited in
the conducting is duly proportioned         to that in the impelling organs.
 The plan of the circulation evidently requires that the heart's force
 should greatly exceed that of the arteries, that the latter should yield
and dilate under the pressure of the blood-current on their inner surface ;
 and this seems very constantly to take place. Moderate exercise, which

1873.]                on the Temperature and Circulation.                    379
does  not exhaust the heart,     as a walk, or holding up a weight    for a short
time, developes the tracing instead of making it smaller.          This is well
seen   in Obs. D, E, P, Or, where the greater rise implies that the
artery is relaxed, but the heart not weakened. It is also well seen in
cases   where the exercise is more severe, as VI. and XIII., but where
the heart possesses much reserve force ; and is well exemplified in an in
teresting observation published by Dr. Fraser ( Journ. of Anat. and Phys.
1869, iii. p. 128), where a tracing is given showing the effect of hard rowing.
The after-tracing is much more ample than the one before, like VI., but
differs from this in having a rounder top and a more notched fall, i. e. in
showing more dicrotism.           Where both heart and artery have been
weakened, the heart seems to recover sooner than the artery ; this is
well shown by the tracings taken in a case where nitrite of amyl was in
haled. That taken immediately after the inhalation is irregular, and much
smaller than the one taken before ; while the third, taken two minutes
after the inhalation, is quite remarkable for the height of its rise and the
length of the fall preceding the notch.       The height of the rise before the
amyl was given is -3 inch, that immediately after is about "175, while the
third is nearly -6 in. Clearly the artery yielded more on the last occasion
to the impelling force of the ventricle than it had done on the first.
Expenditure of force seems to produce the same effect. In obs. C, b, the
tracing taken two or three hours after rowing is much ampler than that
taken immediately after. In XII. the tracing taken thirty minutes after
run is decidedly ampler than that taken directly after.
    Severe exertion seems to exhaust the heart and render        it less capable
of distending the artery.      M. Lortet, in his ascents of Mont Blanc, found
his pulse at high elevations febrile, rapid, and so miserable that it was
scarcely able to raise the spring of his sphygmograph.          In most of my
 observations the tracing taken as soon as possible after the exercise is
 smaller than that taken       during quiescence. This is very specially the
case in IV., where the man was out of condition, and became prostrate
 and sick after the run ; it seems, however, to be the rule, except in in
 dividuals whose hearts are gifted with more than usual staying-power,
 such as in VI. and VIII. Prolonged exertion, though not severe, if              I
 may judge from one observation, also weakens the heart and diminishes
 the tracing.
    The general conclusion     I  am inclined to come to is, that the amplitude
 of the tracing depends partly on the force with which the heart is acting,
 and partly on the relaxation of the artery.        As, however, in all cases of
 severe exertion there must be considerable expenditure of force, and as
 at the same time the blood-flow is certainly promoted in the extremities
 and at the surface, it can hardly be doubted that the arteries, the larger
 and smaller, are relaxed, and that the size of the tracing is therefore
 mainly dependent on the amount of cardiac force exerted, which is
 but slightly opposed by resistance of the arterial coat.

380                Dr. C. H. Jones on the Effects of Exercise         [June   19,
     Cases   II. and IX. are, however, a great puzzle. Here, especially in
II.,   the tracing is more ample before than after the run ; yet the sphyg
mometer shows that in the latter period the heart is not acting more
feebly, but the reverse.                             I
                                This discrepancy is, fear, not to be got over by
the consideration       that the height of the ascent does not depend so much
on the whole amount of force put forth by the heart in a single contrac
tion as on the amount put forth at a given instant.           The artery remain
ing the same, a powerful contraction of the ventricle taking place gradu
ally may no doubt produce a lower and more sloping rise than a less forcible
one, which takes place more suddenly.               Dr. Sanderson writes that
" suddenness of contraction manifests itself in verticality and amplitude
of the primary ascent of the tracing, while in those forms of pulse which
correspond to a more gradual mode of contraction the first event is in
distinguishable."        But the heart in the cases referred to was assuredly
not contracting gradually at the time when the second tracings were
taken, but sharply and jerkingly.            Although the height of the ascent
 may be no measure of the increased amount of blood in the artery, yet it
 is,  I must think, of the force applied at each systole to the inner surface
 of the artery and of the expansion of its tube. A sharp flick against
 the pad of my sphygmometer, which (the pad) is not allowed to move
 more than a certain distance, will drive the traveller the whole length of
the scale, while a pressure less sharply and suddenly applied will not
send it nearly so far. In any case, therefore, where, the artery remaining
 in the same state, or, a fortiori, having its contractility lessened, the rise
is positively lowered in a tracing as compared with a previous one, I
 believe that weakening of the cardiac force is indicated ; at least this is
 the only interpretation      I can put on my observations.      The assumption
 of a tightened artery would solve the difficulty above stated ; but, under
 the circumstances, this seems so improbable that       I cannot  think such con
 striction existed.
     The general conclusions      as to the effect of exertion on the circulation
 and temperature which may be deduced from the foregoing observations
 are these : —
     (1) That the heart's force is, in most cases, more or less weakened by
 great exertion.       (2) That the arterial contractility is probably always
 lessened, even when the exertion is moderate. (3) That after exhaustion
 the heart recovers sooner than the artery.         (4) That the heart's action,
 in about one third of the cases of severe but brief exertion, is increased
 in force. (5) That the acceleration of the pulse probably depends chiefly
 on exhaustion of the vagi.        (6) That acceleration of pulse-rate has per se
 no   effect  in increasing intravascular pressure. (7) That the temperature is
 usually elevated by exercise from -36° to l°-8 F., but in rare instances,
 or after prolonged toil, may be lowered l°-08 to 2°-16 F. (8) That the
 paresis of cardiac and heat-regulating centres, coinciding with consump
 tion of nerve-force in motor centres, shows, that, in some way one centre

is capable of drawing upon another at a time of exigency.        (9) That the
dynamic test is indispensable to ascertain the lasting power of the heart,

acting forces.    (10) That the capacity to endure fatigue well indicates,

     The author describes the complete adult dentition of a new genus of
mammal, founded on remains discovered by Dr. Eobert O. Cunningham
in deposits of uncertain age on the banks of the River Gallegos, South
Patagonia. The animal appears to have possessed the complete typical
number of teeth, t. e. twenty-two above and below, arranged in an un
broken series, and of nearly even height, and presenting a remarkable
 gradual transition in characters, in both jaws, from the first incisor to the
 last molar. The molars more nearly resemble those of the genus Bhino
 ceros than any other known mammal ; and, judging only by the general
 characters of the teeth, the animal would appear to have been a very
 generalized type of Perissodactyle Ungulate, allied through Hyracodon
 (a North-American       Miocene      form) to Bhinoceros, also more remotely to
 Macrauchenia, and, though still more remotely, to the aberrant Nesodon
 and Toxodon. The generic name Homalodotherium was suggested for this
  form by Professor Huxley in his Presidential Address to the Geological
  Society in 1870.

     The authors propose in this paper to determine, by Bessel's method, a
 mathematical expression for a periodical phenomenon from observations
 which are affected by one or more other periodical phenomena, and to
 find criteria for judging of the extent to which the expression is affected
 by these other phenomena : to find also the true period from observations
 of a single periodical phenomenon of which the period is only approxi
 mately known ; or, having found an expression for a period of known
 approximation to the truth, to find from it the expression for the true
 period.    In the course of these inquiries, certain ambiguities which affect
 similarly Bessel's expression for a single periodic phenomenon and the
 results here arrived at are remarked upon ; and, finally, the results are
applied    to determine the nature of periodic    planetary phenomena    in  a
 particular  case.

       at  Bombay." By F. Chambers.            Communicated by Charles
       Chambers, F.R.S., Director of            the Colaba Observatory,
       Bombay.      Received May 26, 1873.
                                  (Abstract.)
    The object of this paper is to bring to notice a remarkable relation
that has been found to exist between the diurnal variations of the wind
and the barometer at Bombay.
    The observations made use of are the records of a Robinson's anemo
graph during the first three years of its performance, viz. from June
1867 to May 1870, and the corresponding hourly observations of the
barometer and the dry- and wet-bulb thermometer made at the Govern
ment Observatory, Bombay.
    The mean results for each hour of the day during the whole period
and the mean diurnal variations of each element are tabulated and gra
phically represented by figures. The diurnal variation of the wind is
then investigated, the most influential part of which is attributed to the
land- and sea-breezes which blow from E.S.E. and W.N.W., and are
shown to follow mainly the same law of progression as the temperature
of the air, thus affording confirmatory evidence of the truth of Halley's
theory of the trade-winds as applied to land- and sea-breezes.
    Some peculiarities of the curve representing the land- and sea-breezes
are then pointed out, and these, the writer concludes, are due to the super

 position of another distinct variation having two maxima and two
 minima in the twenty-four hours, like the barometer variation ; and he
 supports his views by a reference to the variation of the east components
 of the wind in the months of     July  and August, when the land- and sea-
 breezes   have almost disappeared.      This is found to exhibit a decided
 double period.   The north components of the land- and sea-breezes are
 then approximately eliminated from the north components of the whole
 variation, and the variation which    then remains exhibits a very decided
double period in this direction also.    These variations with double periods
are regarded as indicative of the existence of a double diurnal variation
in the general movements of the atmosphere.            Upon this hypothesis
typical diurnal variations of the wind are deduced for north and south
low latitudes — that for north latitudes exhibiting a double diurnal right-
handed rotation, and that for south latitudes a double diurnal left-
handed rotation   ;  and from these the diurnal variation of the barometer is
deduced.
    The movements of the wind-vane at Bombay are then analyzed ; and
the writer concludes that the greater part of the excess of " direct " over
" retrograde " rotation of the vane at Bombay is due to the diurnal varia
tion of the wind.
    Extracts are given from observations made at St. Helena, Toronto,
and Falmouth, showing the character of the diurnal wind-variations at
those places, and their greater or less agreement with the deduced
typical curves.     The writer maintains that these variations afford inde
pendently a possible, if not a probable, explanation of that movement
of the air which Dove had called the " Law of Gyration ;" and, in conclu
sion, he points to the extent of their applicability in deducing weather
probabilities, and to the method of discussing storms.
    A postscript is added, giving the mean diurnal variation of the wind
at Sandwick Manse, Orkney, and pointing out its general conformity
with the results deduced from the Bombay wind-observations.

   This paper contains some developments of a theory sketched in the
Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy, vol. xxv. p. 157.
   Paet I. discusses the quantity of energy necessary to give a body a
twist about one screw while acted upon by a wrench about another screw.
The expression virtual coefficient is defined, and application is made of the
reciprocal character of the virtual coefficient to solve the problem of
resolving a wrench along six given screws.

     Part II.    Six screws of reference can be chosen, such that       each screw
 is reciprocal   to all the rest ; the group is said to consist of      corteiprood
 screws.    The analogy between the convenience obtained by referring the
 twist coordinates of a rigid body to a group of coreciprocal screws, and
 the convenience obtained by referring the coordinates of a point to
 rectangular axes, is pointed out.         The important theorem that one screw
 can be found which is reciprocal to five given screws is discussed.
     Part III. The sextant is a function of six screws, which can be ex
pressed as a determinant.            The property possessed by six screws when
their sexiant vanishes may be enunciated in several different ways ; «.
 wrenches of appropriate magnitudes equilibrate when applied about the
 six screws to a free rigid body.           If seven twist velocities about seven
 screws neutralize, then each twist velocity must be proportional to the
 sexiant of the six remaining screws.
    Part IV. If       a quiescent   rigid body receive an impulsive wrench, then
the body commences to twist about an instantaneous screw.              It is shown
that if four impulsive screws lie on a cylindroid, the four instantaneous
screws lie on a cylindroid, and also the four impulsive reactions caused
by the constraints.         The anharmonic ratios of each of these groups of
four are all equal. Several special properties of impulsive and instanta
neous screws are also considered.
    Part V. When          a body has   k  degrees  of freedom, it is shown   that i-
principal    screws  of kinetic energy can be determined.        When an impul
sive wrench is imparted about a principal screw of kinetic energy, the
body commences to twist about the same screw.                These principles are
illustrated by detailed examination of the cases of two and three degrees
of freedom.
    Part VI. Miscellaneous          propositions.    The principal questions dis
cussed are    : — the locus plane    of a point for twists about the screws on a
cylindroid    ; the equilibrium of a body under the action of gravity for the
different cases     of freedom ; remarks on Professor Sylvester's theory of
lines in involution     ;  generalization   of a theorem due to  M. Chasles.

         Wharton, of H.M. Surveying-Ship ' Shearwater/ between the
        months of June and October, 1872."                 From a Report of that

         1873.
     There is a general flow of the Black-Sea water through the Bosphorus,
 Marmara, and Dardanelles to the Mediterranean, probably caused by the
 combination of three things : — first, the prevalence of N.E. winds in the
 Black Sea ; secondly, the excess of water received from the large rivers
 over the amount lost by temperature at some seasons ; and, thirdly, the
difference of specific gravities in the two seas.
     Of these, observation goes to prove that the wind has by far the greatest
influence.
    There    is as general a countercurrent        setting up under the surface-
stream, in an opposite        direction,  from  the Mediterranean      to the Black
 Sea.     This   seems to be dependent on the surface-current        ;  for when the
latter is slack, the undercurrent is slack likewise.
                                      Dardanelles.
       From observations made from 14th June to 30th October 1872.
    The ordinary direction of the surface-current in mid-stream is S.W.,
or " down the straits, with the wind, which blows from the opposite
               "
quarter for three parts of the year ; but when a S.W. wind has lasted a
few days and forced its way through the straits from one end to another,
the current will run in the opposite direction, but never so strongly as
the   S.W. current.
    Wherever      a point juts out into the straits, or a turn occurs, counter-
currents run up strongly inshore on their lee sides, as might be expected ;
and, generally speaking, with the exception of those places where the
straits are narrowed by two points opposite to one another, either slack
water or a slight eddy exists, on either shore, for a short distance from
the coast.

388             Commander         J. L.   Wharton on the Currents                [June 19,
    As  a general rule, the stronger       and more continuous the              N.E. wind,
the stronger the S.W. set ; but the surface-currents are capricious in their
rates, the wind seeming to affect them more at some times than at others.
This is probably owing to the different winds that may be blowing at the
two ends of the straits, it being a common occurrence that a strong S.W.
wind exists at the southern end simultaneously with a N.E. one at the
northern. This was verified on several occasions, and doubtless checks
the flow of water.
    On calm days the current will usually be slack to the S.W. ; but there
are exceptions to this also, and it will sometimes even run to the N.E.
It may, however, be safely stated that the current is rarely strong when
there is no wind.
    The general average rate of the current may be taken at 1| knot
from one end of the strait to the other ; but in some places, as at Chanak
Kalehsi, it will run 3 knots, when at Gallipoli it is but 1 knot.
    The maximum current is at Chanak, where, with a strong N.E. wind,
it will attain a speed of 4^ knots.
    As has been stated, a south-westerly wind will stop the current in the
upper part of the strait, and a long continuance will cause it to change
entirely its direction, but it will never run more than a knot to the north
eastward.
   Though the maximum lunar tide is only 3 or 4 inches, the water some
times rises as much as 2 feet above its usual height, which may be ac
counted for by the same cause— i. e. the different winds at the two ends of
the straits checking the flow below, and causing the water to accumulate
above.
    The observations for undercurrent have been made, as far as possible,
in different kinds of weather, so as to ascertain what influence the wind
might have on the movement of the water*.
    If the observed rates and areas on October 4th be taken,                 it makes   the
outflow to the inflow as 3 to         1 ; but every correction will diminish this
ratio, and it is probably nearer 3 to 2 : or, in other words, the quantity
of water flowing from the Marmara is half as much again as that
which it receives back from the Mediterranean; but this is a very
vague approximation.
   * After various modifications, the drag finally adopted was a flat board 6 feet square,
with a wing at right angles to the centre of it 2 feet in length.
   To the extremities of this short wing a sling is made fast, and to this sling the sup
porting line to the buoy is bent at such a point as will keep the surface of the drag
vertical when the strain comes on.
   It weighs 70 lbs. in air, and took 120 lbs. of lead to sink it satisfactorily.
   The line was ordinary lead line. The float was an iron nun buoy, 5 feet long by 1 in
diameter in the centre, capable of supporting 80 lbs.
   The pulling boats used drags of a similar shape, 4 feet square, of canvas, laced to a
 wooden frame to prevent collapsing, which did not require such heavy weights to sink
them.

    On all occasions when it has been practicable the specific gravity and
temperature of the water have been taken at different depths, at the same
times and places as the current observations.
    The general result of the undercurrent observations in the Dardanelles
is, that an undercurrent exists whenever a surface one does, and invari
ably in an opposite direction.
    Even with the imperfect means used, out of 12 days' observation 10
gave this result.
    The speed at which the under countercurrent travels seems to depend
upon that of the surface.
    The highest rate actually observ ed in the Dardanelles was         of a knot
an hour, when the surface-stream in the opposite direction was also the
fastest experienced, 3 knots.
    When the surface-current was slack      so was the undercurrent.
    There was little or no deviation from this rule.
    The depth of the surface-current appears to be about 10 to 15 fathoms.
    Below this, the whole of the water to the bottom is generally on the
 move in a contrary direction.
    At about 10 or 15 fathoms depth also the specific gravity of the water
 generally alters rapidly, approximating to the Mediterranean density
 below, and to that of the Black Sea above.
    The temperature also changes about this point.
    This shows that it is not superfluous surface-water that is running back
 underneath, but that it is the Mediterranean supplying the place of the
 lighter Marmara water.
    There appears to be little or no slack water between the two currents,
favourable observations having given them in opposite directions in a very
 few fathoms different depth.
              Details of Undercurrent  Observations. — Dardanelles.
    On   July  29th an under countercurrent      was obtained in the centre of
 Gallipoli Strait at 30 fathoms.     At the commencement of this observa
 tion  it  was  calm,  and  the surface  ran but a tenth of a knot, with a
 counter undercurrent of two tenths ; later in the day a breeze sprang
 up, when the surface ran six tenths, and the undercurrent was increased
 to three tenths, showing an unmistakable connexion between wind and
 current.
    Next day gave almost identical results. The current of seven tenths
 of a knot at the surface decreased in strength with the depth, changed
 its direction at about 15 fathoms, and increased in rate to the bottom,
 where it showed three tenths.
    On August 13th five boats, equidistantly arranged across the strait,
 took observations with various results ; but generally the surface-current
 ran to N.E., and the under to the S.W., reversing the usual order ; all
 rates very slow.

     The wind was S.W., light, and had been        so for two days ; but it was
 subsequently    ascertained  that  at the  south  end of the Dardanelles the
 S.W. wind had been fresh.
     On September 2nd, in the course of experiments made to compare
 different drags, no undercurrent was found. It was nearly calm, and
 the observation was confined to one spot only.
     On September 10th, after 24 hours calm, succeeding          to  seven days
 strong N.E. winds, the surface-current was almost nil.
     Five boats obtained simultaneeus observations, of which the two on
 the Asiatic side found the surface moving to S.W., and an undercurrent
 to the N.E., averaging two tenths of a knot each ; the other boats' drags
 scarcely moved. The observation was not completed.
     On October 4th four boats obtained observations in a strong N.E. wind
 that had been blowing for five days previously.
    There was a nasty sea in from the Sea of Marmara, which rendered
it difficult for the pulling boats to hold their own, and caused the loss of
 several drags in hauling in.      The results were that, at 20 fathoms and
deeper, the drags went to windward ; they were stationary at 15 fathoms,
 and above the current ran to the S.W. The swiftest rates in both
 currents    were at the extremes, the surface and bottom         ; the former
 1
   %
      knot, the latter half a knot.
    This concluded the undercurrent      observations at Gallipoli.
    September     18th.   Four boats took observations off Bourgaz Light.
The wind, which had been for three days strong from the N.E., was mo
derate from the same direction       at the commencement       of the day  ; but
before the full set of observations could be completed, it freshened to
such a degree that the boats were unable to work, and had to bear up for
the ship ; the steam cutter even had to desist.
    The result was that at 25 and 20 fathoms all drags went to windward,
though slowly, against a surface-current of 2\ knots per hour.               The
densities, as usual, changed rapidly between 10 and 20 fathoms.
    September 24th.      After a strong N.E. wind for two days, four boats
tried in the narrows      between Chanak     Kalehsi and    Kilid Bahr.      The
surface-stream was rapid, and the wind, moderate at the commencement,
increased up to 11 a.m., when the boats, having recovered their drags
with    some difficulty, had to give up any further attempt at struggling
against the current and sea.
    The results, on the whole, were not satisfactory.         With the steam
cutter on the European side of the centre using the 6-feet wooden drag,
the buoy went to windward at 33, 23, .and 10 fathoms at the rate of
T^i, and -i^ respectively, remaining stationary at 10 fathoms.        Here also
the densities changed rapidly.      The surface-current was 24 knots.
    The boat on the Asiatic side of the centre obtained a slight under
current, but was swept away herself 2 or 3 miles to leeward whilst
attempting to take temperatures.

      The boat on the Asiatic side obtained another undercurrent of T*j and
       at 17 and 23 fathoms, but at 34 fathoms it again drifted slowly to lee
  ward.     Surface-current about 3 knots.
      The countercurrents     obtained here were at less depths than any before
  observed.
      October 1st.    Four boats together, across the western entrance to the
 Dardanelles from       Koum Kaleh to Seddul Bahr. The wind was light
 and    variable, but it had been blowing half a gale from the N.E. the three
 preceding days, and the surface-stream was strong, nearly 3 knots, but
 with smooth water.         The results this day were curious,  as instead of the
 under     countercurrent      existing from the bottom upwards to about
  15  fathoms, as usual, it was found between 10 and 20 fathoms, running
 strongest at 15 ; but below 20 fathoms the water was apparently moving
 in the same     direction as the surface.
     Here, too, at the surface is no longer the pure sea of Marmara water;
 the density shows it to be mixed with the Mediterranean,          probably from
 a counter      surface-current that sometimes runs up inshore on the
 European     side.
                                      Bosphorus.
     The general flow of the water is from the Black Sea to the Marmara,
 and at    an average rate of about 2£ knots ; but the speed of the current
 will vary from hour to hour, and the course of the strait is so tortuous
that the water      runs in swirls and streams of different speeds.
     Generally the current runs quicker in the afternoon than the forenoon ;
and as the mornings are usually calm and the N.E. breeze gains strength
during the day, this seems to be attributable      to that fact.
     The remark made with regard to the Dardanelles currents, that, " as
a   rule, in a calm the currents are slack," does not, however, apply to the
Bosphorus.
                                                    '
     On two occasions during the ' Shearwater's visits the current seemed
to have ceased altogether, without any apparent cause, calms existing at
the time,    but in certain places (as the Devil's Current and off Seraglio
Point) the water was still draining down.         The Turkish fleet which lie
in the strength of the current, opposite Scutari, were swung in different
directions.
     It is reported that in the winter season, when S.W. gales of long
duration are not uncommon, the current will run the opposite way with
some     strength.
     The current gathers strength as it advances down the strait ; at
the northern entrance it was never found so strong as at the southern.
     A general undercurrent running counter to the surface-stream was
found at both ends of the Bosphorus ; in the deep channel             the rate of
this, as recorded by the drift of the buoy, varied from 1              to    of a

392    On the Currents of the Dardanelles and Bosphorus.                             [June    19,
               Details of Undercurrent Observations.              — Bosphorus.
  The spot chosen for the observations at the southern end of the
Bosphorus was between Seraglio Point and Leander's Tower.
  Here the whole surface runs down with great velocity, with no side
eddies.  There is a narrow deep channel of 34 fathoms close to the
Stamboul side, otherwise the depth does not exceed 20 fathoms. In this
deep channel the up undercurrent was found.
  On August 21st the drag * was tried in a N.E. wind, force 4, and with
a surface-current of 3.| knots. When lowered to a depth afterwards
assumed to be 20 fathoms, it at once rushed violently away against the
surface-stream.
  On the 12th of October the steam cutter tried again in the deep
channel.  This day was one of those when the surface-currents in the
Bosphorus were unaccountably slack and variable.   At Therapia, near
the north end, the water was motionless, while at Seraglio                       Point, where
the observations were made, the current was only 1^ knot.
   The result of the observation was                 a counter    undercurrent     of one knot
at a depth of 15 fathoms.  This makes the surface-current                      much shallower
than the other observations.
   On the 14th October, though calm and smooth, the surface-water was
rushing down at three knots an hour ; observations showed an up under
current at 22 fathoms, but no nearer to the surface, and at that depth
only at the rate of a quarter of a knot, but the water is of the Mediter
ranean density a few fathoms higher.
   On the 15th of October the surface-current   was very rapid ; 4£ knots
was recorded off Leander's   Tower. The results were nearly identical
with the previous days. Up current was obtained in the deep channel.
   The experiments at the north entrance of the Bosphorus were made
off Fil Burnu, where the strait is contracted by two opposite points, and
where no side eddy exists.
   On the 23rd of August the drag gave in the deep channel, at 40 and 30
fathoms, an undercurrent of       and                     -j^
                                         knot respectively, the surface
only running 1-^ knot.
   This, during all the observations, seemed to be the invariable rate of
the surface-current here, wind seeming to have little effect on it.
   Densities changed between 25 and 30 fathoms.        At this point also
(26 fathoms)   was     curiousa stratum  of cold water  of 54°, the water
immediately below being 62°, and that above, 60°. The next day corrobo
rated this.
   On the 17th of October, undercurrent was again found at 30 fathoms
and below, but not so strong as on August 23rd.       The two months'
interval had made some difference in the temperatures, but little or none
  * For   these observations          a wooden drag was     employed similar in design     to that
before described   ;   it   weighed   115 lbs. in air, and required 175 lbs. to sink it.

    The steam cutter with much difficulty, not unattended with danger,
obtained an offing of six miles on the 17th of October.
    The wind was strong and the sea high, but time would not allow of
choice of days, and the N.E. wind was almost permanent.
    The results obtained show a uniform density of 1-012 from surface to
bottom in a depth of 38 fathoms.
    Temperatures showed great decrease at the bottom, and the cold
stratum observed on the 23rd, 24th, and 26th of August was found
here also.

      and Carl Schorlemmer, F.R.S.                  Received May 6, 1873.
    One of us has shown that by oxidizing the primary heptyl alcohol from
normal heptane acid is formed, which is identical with oenanthylic acid
from oenanthol*. GEnanthylic acid is therefore a normal acid ; and as by
the distillation of castor-oil any quantity of oenanthol may be obtained, this
aldehyde appears to be the best starting-point for the preparation of the
hitherto almost unknown normal heptyl compounds.
    Some years ago Bouis and Carlet found that, by the action of zinc and
acetic acid on oenanthol, a heptyl acetate is formed, which yielded a
heptyl alcohol boiling at 165°t.           If  these statements be correct, this
alcohol cannot be a normal            compound, for its boiling-point is only 8°
higher than that of normal hexyl alcohol.           One of us, on repeating these
experiments, did not, however, succeed in obtaining a heptyl alcohol, the
chief product of the reaction consisting of high-boiling condensation-
products of oenantholj.
    To convert oenanthol into the alcohol we have therefore made use of
the excellent method which Lieben and Rossi have employed so success
fully for the reduction of other aldehydes.
    (Enanthol was shaken with fifty times its weight of water, and sodium
amalgam and an equivalent quantity of sulphuric acid were gradually
added.     The product of the reaction was a mixture of heptyl alcohol
and another very high-boiling liquid, the separation of which could be
easily effected by distillation.
    The primary heptyl alcohol thus obtained is a limpid, somewhat oily
liquid, possessing an aromatic odour and boiling at 175°-177°, if the

        F.R.S., Professor of Natural History in Owens College, Man
        chester.      Received May 17, 1873.
                                        (Abstract.)
    On two occasions the author directed attention, in the Proceedings of
the Eoyal Society (vol. xx. pp. 95 & 435), to the structure of some
 stems which appeared to him to belong to the well-known genus Astero-
phi/llites, briefly pointing out at the same time their apparent relations to
a strobilus    of which he had previously published figures and descriptions
(Transactions of the Literary and Philosophical                 Society of Manchester,
third series, vol. v. 1871) under the name of VoUcmannia Dawsoni.                        In
the present memoir he gives a detailed exposition of the various parts of
the plant, including the roots, rootlets, stems, branches, leaves, and fruit,
in different     stages  of their development.             This is done chiefly in two
modifications of the primary type         —  one from the Lower Coal-measures of
Oldham in Lancashire,          the other from those of Burntisland.                 In its
youngest state, the Oldham form first appears as a mere twig, having a
central fibro-vascular bundle enclosed in a double bark. The vascular
bundle consists entirely of vessels which are chiefly, if not wholly, of the

 1873.]                 Plants of the Coal-measures.                        395
reticulated  type.    When divided transversely, it presents a triangular
 section, the triangle having long narrow arms and very concave sides.
The bark is already differentiated into two layers, and has its exterior
deeply indented by three lateral grooves — one opposite to each concave
side of the vascular triangle.    The outer layer is prosenchymatous, with
vertically elongated cells ; the inner one consists of cylindrical paren
chyma arranged in radial lines, the cells being also elongated vertically.
As the plant grew, successive vascular layers were added exogenously to
the exterior of the vascular axis. Each layer consisted of a single linear
row of vessels, which were of large size opposite the concavities of the
triangle, and small where they approached its several angles. The radial
arrangement of those in the several growths was equally regular ; they
were disposed in single radiating series, new laminae being intercalated
peripherally as the stem grew. These radiating laminae were separated
by small medullary rays. Owing to the fact mentioned, that the laminae
radiating from the concave sides of the central triangle consisted of much
larger vessels than those radiating from its angles, three or four such
growths sufficed to convert its concave sides into slightly convex ones,
whilst a few more such additions converted the vascular axis into a
solid cylindrical rod. At this stage its transverse sections appeared de
finitely divided into six radiating areas — three of large open vessels
radiating from the sides of the primary triangle, and three of small ones
proceeding from the sides and extremities of the angles.          When these
growths have thus given a cylindrical form to the vascular axis, a change
takes place in its further development.      Concentric growths again begin
to  form,   but in  them  all the vessels  are  of almost equally small dia
meters : hence the abrupt termination          of the three areas of large
vessels in the younger growths produces a distinct circular boundary
line, marking a special stage in the genesis of the stem. From this
point the additions go on uninterruptedly, the vessels of each radiating
lamina or wedge increasing slowly in size from within outwards as the
stem advances towards maturity.       During these further developments the
bark has continued to be separated into two well-defined forms. An inner
layer consists of very delicate elongated cells with square ends (prismatic
parenchyma) ; these are seen in the transverse section arranged in ra
 diating lines proceeding from within outwards.        The outer bark consists
of narrow, elongated, prosenchymatous cells, having very thick walls ; at
intervals, corresponding with the spaces between the successive verticils
of leaves in the ordinary examples of Asterophyllites, we find distinct nodes
where the bark expands into lenticular disks.         The vascular axis passes
through   these nodes  without  undergoing   any  visible change, either in the
position of its vascular layers or in giving off vessels to the nodes or their
appendages.     The thin peripheral margin of each node sustains a verticil
of the slender leaves of Aster ophyllites, of which there are about twenty-
six in each verticil.   The aspect, dimensions, and arrangements of these

396                  Prof. W. C. Williamson on the Fossil             [June 19,
leaves     correspond exactly with what is seen in the ordinary specimens
found in the coal-shales.         Transverse sections of them exhibit a single
thick central midrib, but no traces of vascular tissues have hitherto been
found in them.
      The laminae of the vascular axis are separated by numerous medullary
 rays of small size ; these rarely exhibit more than four or five cells in
 any vertical series, and usually but one or two.           The exterior of the
 bark is deeply indented in each intern ode by three very deep superficial
 grooves, each one of which occupies the side of the stem corresponding
 with     a concavity of the central triangle of the vascular axis.          These
 grooves, which are sometimes double instead of single, extend from node
 to node, but do not indent the nodal disks.          Owing to the great depth
  to which these penetrate the bark, they give a very characteristic tri
  partite aspect to each transverse section of these stems.
      The Burntisland type agrees with the Lancashire one        in all its leading
  features of structure and growth ; but its vessels are all barred instead
  of being reticulated, and the author has not met with such beautiful
  examples of its nodal disks as he has done in the case of the other form,
  neither    has   he seen its leaves attached.     On the other hand, he has
  found specimens of much larger diameter than any that have hitherto
  been detected       in Lancashire, exhibiting the characteristic    peculiarities
  already referred to in an exquisitely beautiful manner.         The author has
  also obtained one section from this locality in which a branch is given
   off. The vessels of this divergent organ are derived from the central
   portion of one of the segments of small vessels, seen in the transverse
   sections, which proceed from one of the angles of the central triangle.
       Having elucidated the details of the aerial stems, the author proceeds
   to examine such organs of fructification as appear to belong to these
   plants, commencing with the Volkmannia Dawsoni, which he described at
   length in the Transactions of the Philosophical Society of Manchester in
   1871.     This is a verticillate strobilus with a central vascular axis, of
   which latter transverse sections exhibit a close correspondence with the
   triangular bundle of Asterophyllites, being also triangular, with concave
   sides and truncate angles.        But in order to adapt this primary fibro-
   vascular bundle to the requirements of the fruit, each of the truncate
   angles is enlarged, so as to make the entire section an almost hexagonal one.
   This axis is surrounded, as in Asterophyllites, by a double bark — an outer
   prosenchymatous one, and an inner one of more delicate cellular struc
   ture.     At   each  node this bark expands into a lenticular disk fringed
    with stiff narrow bracts, which extend upwards and outwards beyond
    the sporangia.      The latter rest upon the bractiferous disks and the basal
    portions of the bracts, each verticil being fertile. The sporangia are
    closely packed in about three concentric circles, and attached by sporangio-
    phores originating from each side of the base of each bract.                The
    sporangia    have   cellular walls;  they are full of large spores, each of

1873.]                   Plants of the Coal-measures.                    397
which    has its surface prolonged into a number of very long radiating
spines.    This fruit the author unhesitatingly identifies with the aerial
stems previously described.
   He then examines various so-called Volhmannice found in the Lan
cashire Carboniferous     shales, of which the internal structure is not pre
served, but which,     being found with leaves attached to them, admit
of no doubt     as  to their belonging to Asterophyllites.     These are re
garded as being identical with Volkmannia Dawsoni ; hence the author
accepts the latter fruit as giving the internal organization of the ordinary
Asterophyllitean strobilus. The fruit, which has been previously described
by Binney, Carruthers, and Schimper, under the names of Calamodendron
commune, Volkmannia Binneyi, and Calamostaehys Binneyana, is then in
vestigated.     The above authors had associated it with Calamites ; but
its internal structure is shown to have nothing in common with that
type ; it consists of alternating verticils of barren and fertile appendages.
The former are nodal disks bearing protective leaves ; the others are
verticils of sporangiophores, usually six in each verticil, and which closely
resemble those of the recent Equisetacese ; they project at right angles
from the central axis, and expand at their outer extremities into shield-
like disks, which sustain a circle of sporangia on the inner surface of
each shield.     The sporangia consist of a very peculiar modification of
spiral cells ; they are filled with spores which have been described as
provided with elaters, like those of Equisetum but the author rejects
                                                     ¦
this interpretation, regarding the so-called elaters as merely the torn
fragments of the ruptured mother cells in which the true spores have
 been developed.     The vascular axis is shown to be solid, and without any
 cellular elements, being wholly different from that of Calamites, in which
 the vascular axis is a hollow cylinder containing an immensely large,
 cellular, and fistular pith. In one fine example of Calamostaehys Binney
 ana the author has found the central fibro-vascular bundle surrounded by
 an exogenous ring. This, too, exhibits no resemblance whatever to the
 corresponding growths of Calamites ; on the other hand, it corresponds
 closely with conditions occurring in some parts of Asterophyllites, with
 which group the author believes the fruit to be related, notwithstanding
 the peculiarity of its sporangia and sporangiophores.          The author is
 confirmed   in  his  conclusion   that this fruit is  not Calamitean  by his
 having already described the structure of a true Calamitean strobilus,
 from an example in which the central axis retains most accurately the
 arrangements of tissues characteristic of Calamitean stems (Manchester
 Transactions,    1870).    A type of stem to which the author had pre
 viously assigned the provisional generic name of Amyelon is now shown
 to be the root or subterranean axis of Aster ophyllites, specimens being
 described in which clusters of rootlets are given off, in irregular order,
 from various points of the exterior of the branching roots. The latter
 have no medulla; but in the centres of several of them the author

398               On the Fossil Plants of the Coal-measures.               [June  19,
finds the peculiar triangular fibro-vascular bundle so characteristic of
Asterophyllites ; and in all remains of the same trifid origin of the
vascular layers may be traced in the peculiar curvatures assumed by the
vascular laminae       as  they   proceed from within outwards.             The bark
consists   of two layers     :  the inner one is composed of ordinary paren
chymatous      cells, often of considerable       size ;  the outer one consists    of
irregular piles or columns of cells, disposed perpendicularly to the
surface of the bark, and with their tangential septa in close contact and
in parallel planes. The lateral or radial boundaries of these piles of
cells are more strongly defined than the transverse septa.                    In tan
gential  sections   of  this outer  bark,  each of  these  radially disposed  columns
of parallel-sided cells appears as a single thick-walled parenchymatous
cell, whose aspect, in common with that of its neighbours, is that of
ordinary coarse parenchyma.           Such sections exhibit no indication of the
radial elongation of these cells seen in radial and transverse ones. On
reexamining the inner bark, we discover the explanation of these ap
pearances. Many of the larger and more peripheral of the cells of the
latter are seen to be undergoing division by the development within their
walls of secondary cell-partitions, which are parallel with those of the
radially disposed columns.          It appears obvious that each of the latter
was primarily      one  of the  cells of the inner bark, which has become elon
gated radially, and at the same time divided into a linear series of com
pressed cells by the growth of a succession of secondary divisions, all of
which were more or less tangential to the periphery of the stem.
    The author directs special attention to the genetic activity of this inner
bark ; the cells of its inner surface were obviously instrumental in pro
 ducing the successive circumferential additions to the primary vascular
axis, whilst those of its outer surface increased the diameter of the
 outer bark   in the way just described.
    After comparing these plants with living forms, the conclusion                    is
 arrived at that the nearest parallel to the structure of their stems is to
 be found in Psilotum triquetrum ; whilst their general affinities are
 regarded by the author as Lycopodiaceous rather than Equisetaceous.
 The exogenous aspect of their successive vascular growths is, if possible,
more conspicuous than in most of the other Carboniferous Cryptogams.
    The structure of the stems described is identical with that of those
 found at Autun by Prof. Renault, and assigned by him to Sphenopht/llvsi ;
 thus the close affinity of this genus with Asterophyllites appears to be finally
 established.     The Calamites     verticillatm of authors is probably the arbo
 rescent stem of one of these plants.

        from the one Solar Hemisphere to the other." By Warren

    1 . Hitherto in our reductions we have summed up the spotted          areas
of the various groups occurring on the sun's surface on any day, and
have regarded their sum as a representation of the spot-activity for that
day. It has occurred to us to see what result we should obtain by
taking instead for       each day the excess  of the spotted area in the one
solar hemisphere above that in the other.
    2. On adopting this method, it soon became evident that during periods
of great disturbance there is a tendency in spots to change alternately
from the north or positive to the south or negative hemisphere, and
vice versd, the period of such change being about 25 days.            When, on
the other hand, the solar disturbance is inconsiderable, the spots do not
present any such systematic oscillation.
   3. We have graphically represented on the annexed diagram the
results derived from this method during three of the most considerable
periods of solar disturbance.
    In this diagram the observed values of hemispherical excess are marked
with an asterisk, and a curve is drawn so as to equalize their smaller
irregularities.    The northern hemisphere is reckoned positive, and the
southern negative.        The unit of area is, as before, the one millionth of
the sun's visible hemisphere.

August to the end of December 1859. We derive from our diagram the

    From the whole three periods we obtain,          as the most probable     mean
 value, 25-2 days.
    7. We do not profess to have discovered the cause of these oscillations,
 but we would nevertheless suggest that the observational facts here
 brought to light may perhaps be connected with two other observational
 facts, the one of which was first brought to light by Carrington,          and the
 other by ourselves.

 402                   Mr. W. K. Parker      on the Structure            [June   19,
     The first of these is the fact that, generally speaking, spots in the north
 hemisphere have much about the same latitude as those occurring at the
  same, or nearly the same, period     in the south, both   sets  widening or con
 tracting together.      We may perhaps, therefore, suppose, by applying this
  law, that the latitude of the spots which cause the positive extremes in
  the above series is not greatly different from that of those which cause
  the corresponding negative extremes.
     The second observational law is that which tells us that spots about the
  same period have a tendency to attain their maximum at, or near, the same
  ecliptical longitude.     Now, if we suppose that in the foregoing three
  series the greatest positive extremes were caused by the positive spots
 attaining their greatest size, and the greatest negative extremes by the
 negative spots attaining their greatest size, it would follow that the two
 sets, positive and negative, must have taken       their rise at places on     the
 sun's surface 180° of longitude different       from each other, inasmuch        as
 the one set about 12 or 13 days before, or after, passed (let us say) the
  same ecliptical longitude as the other.
     But if the positive   set have the same latitude    as the negative, and      if
  the one is 180° of solar longitude different from the other, it would
 mean that     the two outbreaks are at opposite ends of the same solar diameter.
    This conclusion is an interesting one ; but, of course, it requires to be
 verified by further observation before it be finally received.         Meanwhile
 we are engaged in mapping out systematically the positions of the
 various outbreaks upon the sun's surface, and we shall soon, therefore,
 be able to find whether or not there be any truth in this conjecture.
 XIII. "      On the Structure and Development of the Skull in the
        Pig (Sus scrofa)."        By W. K. Parker,            F.R.S.      Received
        May 17, 1873.
                                    (Abstract.)
    I have   for  some years past determined to concentrate my        attention on
some one type of Mammalian           Skull, so as to be able    to present to the
 Boyal    Society a paper   similar to  those which have already appeared on
 other Vertebrate Skulls.      I was led to work out this medium type, and not
 a more generalized form, such as the Guineapig (see " On the Development
 of the Frog's Skull," Phil. Trans. 1871, p. 203), through the circumstance of
 an offer from my friend Mr. Charles Stewart to put some seventy embryos of
 the Common Pig into my possession. In the present communication             I have
had the invaluable help of advice and oversight from Professor Huxley ;
whilst the labour of my hands has been lightened by my son, Mr. T.
J. Parker, who prepared for me all the more delicate sections. The
embryos ranged in size from two thirds, or less, of an inch in length,
with the head only equal in size to a sweet pea, whilst the head of the
largest specimen was the size of that of the Common Squirrel. To these

I    have       added young pigs at birth, and have taken as the last stage the
skull of        a   half-grown individual.
     The most important results of the present investigation            may be stated
as   follows : —
     1.    In            in which the length of the body did not exceed
                 a pig-embryo,
two thirds of an inch, and four postoral clefts were present, the cranio
facial skeleton was found to consist of : — (a) the notochord, terminating
by a rounded end immediately behind the pituitary body.
   (6) On each side of the notochord, but below   there   it,
                                                        a cartilaginous
                                                                   is
plate, which in front ends by     rounded extremity on
                                         a              level with the
                                                                   a
apex of the notochord, while behind      widens out and ends at the free
                                              it
lower margin of the occipital foramen. These two plates, taken together,
constitute the " investing mass
                                "
                                  of Rathke.  In this stage they send up
no prolongations around the occipital foramen        in other words, the

rudiment of the basioccipital exists, but not of the exoccipital or super-
occipital.
   (c) The large oval auditory capsules lie on each side of the anterior
half of the investing mass, with which they are but imperfectly united               :
there      no indication of the stapes at this stage.
           is
   (d) The trabecular or first pair of praeoral visceral arches inclose              a
lyre-shaped pituitary space   they are closely applied together in front of
                                    ;
this space, and, coalescing, give rise to an azygous praenasal rostrum.
They are distinct from one another and the investing mass.
   (f) The pterygopalatine or second pair of visceral arches lie in the
maxillo- palatine processes, and are therefore subocular in position.
Each      a sigmoid bar of nascent cartilage, the incurved anterior end
           is
of which lies behind the internal nasal aperture, while the posterior
extremity     curved outwards about the level of the angle of the mouth.
                    is
The pterygo-palatine cartilages are perfectly free and distinct from the first
praeoral and from the first postoral arch.
   (/) The mandibular or first pair of postoral visceral arches are stout
continuous rods of cartilage which lie in the first visceral arch behind
the mouth.     The ventral or distal ends of these arches are not yet in
contact    the dorsal or proximal end of each
            ;                                        somewhat pointed and
                                                        is
sharply incurved, pushing inwards the membrane which closes the first
visceral cleft and  the rudiment of the membrana tympani.
                           is
   (g) The hyoid or second pair of postoral arches are in this stage
extremely similar to the first pair, with which they are parallel. They
are stout sigmoid rods of cartilage, which are separated at their distal
ends, present an incurved process at their opposite extremities, and are
not segmented.
   (h) The thyro-hyal or third postoral arches, which correspond with
the first branchial of the branchiate vertebrata, are represented two          by
short cartilaginous rods which lie on each side of the larynx.
     (»)    The olfactory sacs are surrounded by   a   cartilaginous    capsule, which

 404                  Mr. W. K. Parker     on the Structure          [June   19,
 has   coalesced below with the trabecula       of its side ; while, within, the
 mucous membrane lining the capsule presents elevations which indicate
 the position of the future turbinal outgrowth of the capsule.
    In this  stage the posterior nares are situated at the anterior part of
 the oral cavity, as in the Amphibia, and the roof of the mouth is formed by
 the floor of the skull, the palatal plate of the maxillae and palatine bones
 being foreshadowed by mere folds.       The outer end of the cleft between
 the first and second praeoral arches is the rudiment of the lachrymal duct,
 while its inner end is the hinder nasal aperture.            The gape of the
 mouth is the cleft between the second praeoral and first postoral arch.
 The auditory passage, representing the Eustachian tube, tympanum, and
external auditory meatus, is the cleft between the first and second post-
 oral arches. The proximal end of the mandibular arch, therefore, lies
in the front wall, and the hyoid in the hinder wall of the auditory
 passage.
    2.  In  an embryo pig, an inch in length, (a) the notochord is still
visible ;  (b) the investing mass, the halves of which are completely con
fluent, has become thoroughly chondrified, and is continued upwards at
each side of the occipital foramen to form an arch over it.
    (c) The auditory capsules are still distinct from the investing mass,
and a plug on the outer cartilaginous wall of each has become marked
off as the stapes.
    (d) The hinder ends of the trabecular arches have coalesced in front
of the pituitary body, but they are not yet confluent with the investing
mass.
    («) The pterygopalatine rods have increased in size ; they have not
become hyaline cartilage, but are beginning to ossify in their centre.
   (/) In    the mandibular arch the proximal end has become somewhat
bulbous,    and is recognizable as the head of the malleus, whilst the
incurved process, still more prominent than before, is the manubrium
mallei.    The rest of the arch is Meckel's cartilage ; outside this a mass
of tissue appears, which is converted into cartilage, rapidly ossifies, and
eventually becomes the ramus of the mandible.
   (g) The proximal end of the hyoidean arch, similarly enlarging and
articulating with the corresponding part of the mandibular arch, becomes
the incus, the incurved process attaching itself to the outer surface of
the stapes and becoming the long process of the incus.         The incus, thus
formed out of the proximal end of the hyoidean arch, becomes separated
from the rest of the arch by conversion of part of the arch into fibrous
tissue, and by the moving downwards and backwards of the proper hyoid
portion of the arch. A nodule of cartilage left in the fibrous connecting
band becomes      a styliform interhyal cartilage, while the proximal     end of
the detached arch becomes the stylo-hyal.
   (h) The ihyro-hyals have merely increased in size and density ; they
closely embrace the larynx by their upper ends.

    (i) The olfactory capsules are well chondrified        ; their descending inner
 edges    have   coalesced   with  each  other and, below, with the trabecule to
 form the great median septum :         the turbinal outgrowths are apparent.
    In this stage, the alisphenoids and orbito-sphenoids appear as chon-
 drifications of the walls of the skull, quite separate from the investing
 mass and from the trabecules.
     The floor     of the pituitary     space  chondrifies   independently    of the
 trabeculae   and investing     mass, but serves to unite these   four cartilaginous
 tracts.
     3.  In an embryo     pig, 1^ inch in length, (a, b, c) the primordial cranium
 is completely constituted as a cartilaginous              whole, formed by the
 coalescence    of  the   investing   mass  and  its exoccipital and superoccipital
 prolongations,       the   modified trabecule, the subpituitary cartilage, the
 auditory capsules,      and  alisphenoidal and orbito-sphenoidal cartilages, and
 the olfactory capsules.        The notochord is yet to be seen extending in the
 middle line from the hinder wall of the pituitary fossa (now the " dorsum
 sella ") to the posterior edge of the occipital region.
     (d) The trabecular arches form the sides of the sella turcica, the
 presphenoid, and the base of the septum between the olfactory capsules ;
 in front, where they form the azygous " pnsnasal," they are developed
 backwards as
                     " recurrent bands," elongations of their free recurved
 " cornua."
     (e) The    pterygo-palatine     arches, still increasing     in size, but not
 chondrifying,     are  rapidly ossifying; they are half -coiled laminae bounding
 the posterior nasal passages.
     (/)  The    mandibular      arch  and the rudimental      ramus have become
 solid cartilage, and the latter is ossifying as the dentary ; the distal part
 of each mandibular rod unites with its fellow for some distance.
    (g) The hyoid arches are each fully segmented as incus, with its
 " orbicular " head, interhyal, stylo-hyal, and cerato-hyal.
    (A) The thyro-hyals are merely larger and denser.
    (i) The olfactory capsules have the turbinal outgrowths all marked out
 as alinasal, nasal, and upper, middle, and lower turbinals.
    4. In pigs of larger size the form and proportions of the parts of the
 cranium become greatly altered, and ossification takes place on an
 extensive scale, but no new structure is added.
    5.  It  follows from      these facts that the mammalian      skull, in an early
embryonic condition, is strictly comparable with that of an Osseous Fish, a
Frog, or a Bird at a like period of development, consisting as it does of
    (a) A cartilaginous basicranial plate embracing the notochord, and,
like it, stopping behind the pituitary body.
    (6) Paired cartilaginous arches, of which two are praeoral, while the
rest are postoral.
    (c) A pair of cartilaginous auditory capsules.

406              On the Structure    of the Skull in  the  Pig.    [June   19,
   Further, that in the Mammal, as in the other Vertebrata the development
of the skull of which has been examined, the basicranial plate grows up as
an arch over the occipital region of the skull, and coalesces with the
auditory capsules, laterally, to give rise to the primordial skeleton of the
occipital, periotic, and basisphenoidal regions of the skull. The trabecula
become fused together, and, uniting with the olfactory capsules, give rise
to the presphenoidal and ethmoidal parts of the cranium ; and the
moieties of the skull thus resulting from the metamorphosis           of totally
different morphological elements become united and give            rise  to the
primordial cranium.
   As in the Salmon and Fowl, the second pair of pneoral arches give
rise to the pterygopalatine apparatus ; in the Frog this arch is late
                                                                               in
appearance, and is never distinct from the trabecular and       mandibular  bars,
serving as a conjugational band between them.             The mandibular arch,
which in the Salmon becomes converted into Meckel's cartilage,
                                                                             the
os articulare, the os quadratum, and the os metapterygoideum, in the Frog
into Meckel's cartilage and the quadrate cartilage (which early becomes
confluent with the periotic capsule), in the Bird into Meckel's cartilage.
the os articulare, and the os quadratum (which articulates movably with
the periotic capsule), in the Pig is metamorphosed into Meckel's cartilage
and the malleus, which is loosely connected with the tegmen tympani,
an outgrowth of the periotic capsule.
    Meckel's cartilage persists in the Fish and in the Amphibia, but disap
pears early in the Bird, and still earlier in the Mammal. The permanent
ossifications of the mandible are all membrane-bones in Fish, Frog, and
Fowl, but in the Mammal (exceptionally) the ramus has a cartilaginous
foundation.     The hyoidean becomes closely united with the mandibular
arch, and then segmented, in the Fish, into the hyo-mandibular, the
stylo-hyal,  cerato-hyal, and hypohyal — the hyo-mandibular, or proximal
segment, articulating with the outer wall of the periotic, and many
of the segments of the arch becoming dislocated.
    In  the Frog, the hyoid also becomes segmented, but only after ex
tensive coalescence with the mandibular arch.          The proximal segment
becomes     the suprastapedial     (hyo-mandibular)    with   its extrastapedial
process, and, extending inwards as mediostapedial and interstapedial,
articulates with the stapes, developed by segmentation from the outer
 wall of the auditory capsule.      The stylo-hyal is dislocated and becomes
connected with the auditory capsule below the stapes (opisthotic region).
    In the Bird, the hyoidean arch remains distinct from the mandibular.
 Whilst in its primordial condition it coalesces by its incurved apex
with the auditory capsule in front of the promontory, before the stapedial
plug is segmented.       It then chondrifies as three distinct cartilages— an
incudal, a stylo-hyal, and, distally, a cerato-hyal.   The stapes becomes free
from the auditory capsule, but remains united with the cartilaginous part
of the incus (mediostapedial);        the ascending part is largely &bm

(suprastapedial), and the part loosely attached to the mandibular arch
is the     elongated extrastapedial.    The short stylo-hyal afterwards
coalesces with the body of the upper or incudal segment by an after
growth of cartilage (the interhyal tract) ; a long membranous space
intervenes between it and the glossal piece (cerato-hyal.)           Thus the
"columella" of the Bird is formed of one periotic and three hyoidean
segments.
   In the Pig, the hyoidean arch is distinct, but articulates closely with the
mandibular ; its upper segment (hyo-mandibular) is converted into the
incus, and becomes connected with the stapes. The stylo-hyal is dislocated
and coalesces with the opisthotic region of the auditory capsule.

    The following account of the results of the Comparisons of the
Standards of Length of England, Austria, Spain, United States, Cape of
 Good Hope, and of a second Russian Standard at the Ordnance Survey
 Office has been drawn up by Lieutenant-Colonel Clarke, and is a sequel
to the abstract of the results of the Comparisons of the Standards of
Length of England, France, Belgium, Prussia, Russia, India, and
Australia which the Eoyal Society has done us the honour to publish
in the Philosophical Transactions for 1867, vol. clvii. p. 161.
    The accurate determination of the lengths of the various standards
employed by so many nations in the measure of the bases of their
triangulations, which are now being united into one vast network of
triangles, covering the whole of Europe, can scarcely fail to be of great
 importance for the advancement of physical science. To the comparison
of these lengths  I  have added the result of our endeavours to recover
the correct lengths of the most ancient measures of length with which
we are acquainted, viz. those of Ancient Egypt, not only because our
own measures are obviously derived from them, but also because we
thus obtain the accurate relative value of the measures and distances
given in the most ancient works on Astronomy and Geodesy which have
come down to us.
   The Ancient Egyptians employed two measures of length, viz. the
common and the royal cubits.

408     Lieut.-Col. A. R. Clarke on Standards of Length.         [June  19,
   1st. As regards the common cubit, we have the statement of Herodotus
that the Egyptian cubit was equal to the Greek cubit,
                                                         " that of Samos ; "
and we learn from the measurements of the Hecatompedon at Athens,
by Mr. Penrose, that the Greek foot was equal to 1-013 foot, or 12-156
inches, and consequently the Greek cubit was equal to 1-520 foot, or
18-240 inches.
   2nd. TheJ most recent measures of the base of the First or Great
Pyramid, that of King Cheops, viz. those made by the Royal Engineers
and Mr. Inglis, a civil engineer, give a mean length of 9120 inches, or
500 cubits of 18-240 inches for the side of the square base, or 750
Egyptian feet, each Egyptian foot being equal to 1-013 English foot.
   3rd. The Second Pyramid, according to the measures of Colonel
Howard Vyse and Mr. Perring, has a base of 707-5 feet square, or
700x1-011 feet.
   4th. The Third Pyramid has a base, according to Vyse and Perring, of
354-5 feet, or 350 Egyptian feet square, of 1-013 English foot exactly.
   We may therefore confidently assume that 1-013 foot was the true
length both of the ancient Greek and the ancient common Egyptian foot,
and that the length of the common Egyptian cubit was 18-240 inches.
   We have in the British Museum        a double royal cubit, found in the
ruins of the Temple of Karnak in Egypt ; and      I found its length to be
41-40 inches, and that of the single cubit consequently 20-70 inches,    or
1-725 foot.
   The pyramid which stands in the middle of the three, before the
Great Pyramid (that of the daughter of King Cheops), has a base,
according to Vyse and Perring, of 172-5 feet square, and therefore
100 royal cubits square exactly.
   But the same authors give the breadths of no less than seven of the
passages  in the pyramids, including the entrances to the First, Second,
and Third Pyramids, all of 41-5 inches (two cubits of 20-750 inches).
   Doursther, from the measures of the nilometer at Elephantine and of
three or four cubits found in the ruins of Memphis, which almost
exactly correspond with each other, estimated the length of the royal
cubit at 20-721 inches (see Condee, ' Dictionnaire des Poids et Mesures').
   Looking to these facts, and feeling it almost certain that the common
and the royal cubit had some definite relation to one another, like that
between the link and foot of our own country (66 feet equal 100 links),
I infer that the most probable length of the royal cubit was 20-727 inches,
and that 88 royal cubits were equal to 100 common cubits of 18-240 inches.
   This does not admit of rigid demonstration.     The dimensions of Vyse
and Perring seem to be given to the nearest half inch, and the measures
of length sold in this country differ from one another as much as the
length of the double cubit in the British Museum differs from its
estimated length.

XV. " Researches                 on Emeralds and Beryls. — Part                I. On the
         Colouring-matter of the Emerald." By Greville                         Williams,
         F.R.S.      Received May 9, 1873.
     A   considerable amount of discussion has taken place at various times
regarding the cause of the colour of the emerald. Klaproth concluded
from his earlier analyses that it was due to iron*; but the results of his
later experiments t, made after he became aware of Vauquelin's discovery
of the presence of chromium in emeralds %, confirmed the observations of
that chemist.
     From the time of Vauquelin's analyses, the colour of the emerald was
always regarded as due to the presence of oxide of chromium, until the
publication of the memoir of Lewy§, who, having burnt emeralds in
oxygen in a similar apparatus to that employed by M. Dumas in his re
searches on the atomic weight of carbon, ascertained that they contained
that element, and concluded that the colour was due to the presence of
some organic substance.                  Lewy also affirmed that the deepest-tinted
emeralds contained the most carbon. The small quantity of chromium
contained in emeralds he considered to be insufficient to account for
the colour. Wohler and Rose||, on the other hand, having exposed
emeralds to a temperature equal to the fusing-point of copper for one
hour without their losing colour, and also having fused colourless glass
with minute quantities of oxide of chromium and obtained a fine green
glass, considered chromium and not organic matter to be the cause of the
colour.
     Boussingault     If , in  the course of an investigation of the " morallons "**,
arrived     at the same conclusion as Wohler and Eose ; and although ad
mitting     them to contain carbon, denied that it was the cause of their
colour, inasmuch as they endured heating to redness for one hour with
out loss of colour. This result has been confirmed by Hofmeister tt, who
found that an emerald endured a red heat for hours without destruction
of the colour, except at the edges, and concludes this small bleaching to
arise from the destruction of the crystalline character of the stone.                 I have
carefully repeated and extended these experiments.                     The   emeralds em
ployed were canutillos from Santa Fe de Bogota ; they were kindly given
to me by Professor Church.                 The following values were obtained in a
determination of their specific gravity : —

   One of the above emeralds was exposed for three hours in a platinum
crucible to a bright reddish-yellow heat. At the end of the operation it
was rendered opaque on the edges, but the green colour was not destroyed.
This experiment completely confirms those of Wohler and Rose and Hof-
meister.       It    is,
                   think, quite evident that no organic colouring-matter
                     I
could withstand such     temperature for so long a time.

ment by Lewy that the depth of colour of emeralds         in proportion to  is
the amount of carbon present, made        at first appear improbable that
                                                   it
colourless opaque beryls would contain any of that element.      The power
of the colouring-matter to resist   red heat having, however, made me in
                                            a
clined to disconnect the question of the colour from that of the presence of
carbon, I  made experiments to determine whether beryls contained that
element, and,    so, to what amount.
                    if                    An experiment was made at this
stage of the inquiry (see p. 414), the result of which showed that the beryl
analyzed* contained the same amount of carbon as Lewy's emerald.       As                   it
was just possible that the small increase in weight of the potash-tubes used
by Lewy, Boussingault, and myself, in determining the carbon, might not
have been really due to the absorption of carbonic anhydride, but to some
volatile inorganic acid produced on heating the emeralds and beryls to
redness in an atmosphere of oxygen,        felt   necessary to settle this

tube containing lime-water ; this form of potash-tube was employed in
this and the other experiments to be described further on, as it enables
the operator to see whether the carbonic anhydride is all absorbed in the
first bulb. The carefully purified oxygen was allowed to stream through
the lime-water for half an hour to prove its freedom from carbonic an
hydride.    At the end of that time there was no trace of turbidity. The
beryl was then heated to redness, and in a few seconds the lime-water in
the first bulb of the potash-apparatus became milky.           Thus not only
proving the presence of carbon in a colourless beryl, but, taken in con
junction with the quantitative determinations, showing conclusively that
the depth of colour is not, in this class of stones, in the ratio of the
amount of carbon present.
   But although demonstration had been obtained of the presence of
carbon in the beryl A, it was still possible that it might have been
derived from the decomposition of a carbonate. To settle this question,
I  arranged an apparatus in the following manner : —
   A current of air from a gas-holder was sent in the direction indicated
by the arrow (see p. 413) ; it passed through a solution of potassium hydrate
in A and B. The three-necked bottle C contained lime-water, freshly pre
pared and perfectly clear. The current of air then passed into the three-
necked flask D, containing 3 grms. of beryl A, finely levigated in an
agate mortar, and covered to about one inch with pure distilled water.
The flask E was empty, and served to arrest any thing which might have
spirted over. The potash-apparatus F was filled to the height indicated
with lime-water. The pipette G contained concentrated sulphuric acid.
The arrangement being complete, a current of air was sent through for
half an hour ; not the slightest turbidity was found in C or F ; the air
was consequently free from carbonic anhydride.         Its freedom from any
other substance containing carbon had been previously determined by
 sending it mixed with oxygen, first into a red-hot combustion-tube, and
then into a previously weighed potash-apparatus.         After passage of the
gas for half an hour, the potash-apparatus was reweighed and found to
be absolutely unaltered.      The purity of the air employed having thus
been rigorously ascertained, the stopcock of the pipette G- was turned,
and sulphuric acid admitted into D until the water in the latter had
become very hot ; still no turbidity was observed in F. The fluid in D
was then boiled with the same result.        It was evident, therefore, that
the carbon found in the beryl was not derived from the decomposition of
a carbonate.    The stopper at H was then removed, and about 4 grms. of
pure recently fused acid chromate of potassium were added ; there was
still no turbidity observed in F for twenty minutes, during all which time
the fluid in D was gently boiled. At the end of this time a cloudiness
 began to appear in the first bulb of F, and after half an hour in the
second bulb : finally, a decided precipitate was obtained ; it was collected,
washed, and on analysis proved to be carbonate of calcium.          The expe

riment was repeated in a modified manner several times.                       It having
been found that a faint turbidity in the lime-water was sometimes ob
tained before the addition of the beryl, it was traced to the presence of
minute quantities of organic matter in the chromate and sulphuric acid.
To eliminate this source of error, the chromate and acid were mixed at
the commencement of the operation, and the current of air was kept up
until every trace of carbonic anhydride was removed ; at this point the
beryl was added, and the effect noted.             The results, both with emeralds
or the beryl A, were, however, always precisely the same.
     The apparatus was then recharged, and when half an hour's passage of
the air produced no milkiness in F, 5 milligrammes of charcoal were in
 troduced into D ; in two minutes the first bulb, and in four minutes all the
 bulbs were rendered milky.
     In another experiment, after the usual precautions, 5 milligrammes
 of graphite were acted on. In four minutes the first bulb, and in eight
 minutes all three bulbs were rendered milky.
     The above experiments show, therefore, that               the beryl A contains
 carbon, not in the state of a carbonate, but in a condition which is more
 slowly attacked than either free charcoal or graphite ; and it is, think,       I
 probably in the form of diamond, as has been shown to occur with the
 carbon contained in artificially crystallized boron*.             The power of free
 chromic acid to attack the diamond with liberation of carbonic acid has
 been shown by the Messrs. Eodgerst.
     The presence of carbon in beryls does not appear to be invariable.
 After repeated experiments upon another large beryl from Had dam
 County, North America,         I was unable to satisfy myself that it contained
 carbon.       It is true that traces were found in the experiment; but they
 were so minute that they might have been due to the difficulty of entirely
 excluding the presence of organic dust during the necessary manipu
 lations   J.
     The next point      I  wished to ascertain was the relation borne by the
 quantity      of  carbon  in the beryl A to that in the emerald.               For this
  purpose     I  employed a similar apparatus to that used by Dumas in his
 researches on the atomic weight of carbon previously alluded to.                     The
  minute error due to the apparatus was carefully determined by going
  through the whole process of heating the combustion-tube to redness for
  the same time as in the analysis, the current of oxygen passing through at
  the same speed, and finally replacing the oxygen in the system of tubes
  by a current of pure dry air.        No appreciable error was found to affect

    In working       on such minute quantities, it is not easy to speak with
certainty as       to   the proportion of hydrogen contained in emeralds and
 beryls which is not due to the water present; and the difficulty is in
creased by the fact, insisted upon by Boussingault*, that these stones do
not give off all their water below a red heat.                      If  it be considered per
missible, which        I  cannot admit, to calculate the hydrogen on the prin
ciple of deducting the water found on ignition in a crucible from that
formed during the combustion in oxygen, and then calculating the per
centage of hydrogen on the difference,                     as   Lewy   has   done, the results
would be as follows : —

    The smallness of the values obtained, and even the very fact of their
 close approximation, make me offer them with a certain amount of
reserve, and       I  shall endeavour to repeat them upon much larger quan
tities as soon as       I  have found a method of avoiding all possible sources
of error.
    I have not inserted        the numbers given by Boussingault, as there appears
to  be some mistake          in them.       He found 0-24 per cent. of carbon in the
morallons, and yet says that this number agrees with two of Lewy's
determinations, one of which (he says) gave 0-21, and another 0-25 ;
whereas    I  find, on reference to Lewy's memoir, that that chemist ob
tained in the two experiments alluded to 0-21 and 0-25, not of carbon,
but carbonic anhydride.
    As it was possible that          some    of the carbon found in these experiments
might have been derived from the steel mortar used in the preliminary crush-

ing of the emeralds and beryls,          I  pulverized some emeralds in a porcelain
 mortar, every precaution        I  could devise being taken to prevent any con
tact of organic matter. On burning in oxygen, and passing the products
of the combustion into lime-water, a copious precipitate of carbonate of
 calcium was obtained.
          On the    Effects of Fusion          upon   Emeralds and Beetls.
    On the Effects of Fusion upon Opaque Beryls. — In order to study the
 effects of fusion upon beryls or emeralds,               I  found it necessary to use
 the oxyhydrogen blowpipe.              Beryls and emeralds were amongst the
 numerous substances fused with this instrument by Clarke * as long ago
 as 1816. He states that the Siberian beryl fuses to a clear glass con
 taining bubbles. The Peruvian emerald he found to melt very easily
to a round, extremely beautiful bead free from bubbles ; it lost its green
colour, and became like a white sapphire.
    My first experiments were made upon the beryl A; it weighed
62-54 grms., and its density was taken with great care previous to fusion.
In the first experiment the whole crystal was suspended from the
balance-pan, and weighed in water ; in the second a few fragments were
weighed in a Eegnault's flask with the usual precautions.                      The values
obtained were as follows :       —

   In   order satisfactorily to submit beryls to the action of the oxyhy
drogen blowpipe, it was necessary to find a support capable of enduring
the high temperature without burning away too rapidly, and also not
containing sufficient inorganic constituents to complicate the results.
After   a few trials    I selected    square prisms        of gas-retort carbon, taking
care to ascertain by experiment that they were adapted to the purpose.
Some     specimens burn away very readily, and others yield too much ash
to permit of their being employed successfully.                  The oxyhydrogen blow
pipe employed was of the ordinary construction                 ; and, with the exception
of  having   several   nozzles   of various    calibres   to adapt it to different quan
tities of the substance to be experimented upon, needs no particular de
scription.     These nozzles (which supply the oxygen) should be well
formed, and free from internal irregularities.                Instead of hydrogen, coal-
gas   was   generally employed,         as   I  have    not    found, for the purposes

 described in this paper, hydrogen to possess advantages sufficient to coun
 terbalance the inconvenience of storing it in the large quantities required.
    The phenomena observed on submitting a fragment of beryl to the
 action of the flame are very beautiful ; but to obtain the best results,
 many precautions     and some little practice are necessary.    The coal-gas
 having been lighted and the oxygen turned on, the beryl at once begins
 to melt, and froths or, rather, boils violently. By careful regulation of
 the supply of oxygen, the boiling entirely disappears ; but the slightest
 excess of oxygen causes it to be renewed.         This property of oxygen,
 which is found to occur with other substances besides beryls and
 emeralds,  I  hope to study in greater detail.     Having so adjusted the
 flame that the beryl fuses tranquilly, and is yet at the exact point of
 maximum heat (if the substance is not too large for the apparatus), it no
 longer lies as a shapeless mass on the carbon support, but gathers together,
 rises up, and forms a perfect bead — round, clear, and brilliant.         To
 obtain the adjustment of position necessary for this result, it is indispen
 sable to wear very dark glasses, so dark, indeed, that objects can scarcely
 be discerned through them in bright daylight.      Without this precaution,
the minute details of the globule cannot be observed ; and it would be im
possible to drive away the bubbles which form instantly when the bead
 is moved in the slightest degree from the proper position.     The heat and
glare would also soon seriously affect the sight ; and, with every precau
       I
tion, have found, after the preparation of one or two hundred globules,
 that my sight appears (even after an interval of some months) to be
slightly but decidedly deteriorated.    If all is working properly, the bead
should be quite mobile ; and advantage of this must be taken to keep it
incessantly rolling, and yet not remove it from the point where it gives
out the most brilliant light. By this means the whole globule is ren
dered transparent.     If, on the other hand, it is allowed to remain with
out motion on the carbon (unless the globule be very minute), it will be
found, when cold, to have a white opaque base, passing into the centre of
the bead in a conical form, and entirely destroying its beauty.          This
exact adjustment of the position of the bead at the point of maximum
heat, combined with constant movement of the carbon support and
perfect regulation of the proportions of oxygen and hydrogen, are indis
pensable to the production of the glasses, specimens of which accompany
this paper.
    When thus fused, the globules obtained from the beryl      A  were clear
and colourless,    but generally contained a few minute air-globules and
strue, which    become  obvious under the lens.    Towards the end of this
part of the investigation    I succeeded in almost entirely avoiding these
defects  ; but  I have been compelled for a time to abandon experiments
in this direction in consequence of the strain thrown upon the eyes.
    When chromic oxide is added to the beads, and they are again carefully
fused, they acquire a fine green colour; the tint, however, is infe

 rior to that of the emerald.          The green       beads    may, by an intense and
 prolonged heat, be rendered colourless.                 With cobalt oxide the beads
 afford beautiful blue glasses of any desired shade                 ;  and  in all   cases  the
 results are the same as with the artificial mixture of beryl ingredients to
 be described further on.
     The effect of fusion upon the beryl is to lessen the hardness and
 lower the specific gravity.          The globules may be scratched by quartz.

 gravity : —

     The beryls have, therefore, lost nine per cent. of their density in pass
ing from the crystalline to the vitreous state.
     I  was desirous of carefully comparing this loss of density undergone by
beryls with that of rock-crystal fused under the same circumstances.
According to an experiment quoted by Forbes *, the specific gravity of
quartz of undoubted aqueous origin, and also that from granites, is 2-6,
and that of rock-crystal, fused before the oxyhydrogen blowpipe to an
amorphous glass, 2-2. According to the experiment of Le Eoyer and
Dumas t, the specific gravity of rock-crystal determined at 4° in vacuo
was 2-652. The value found by the Austrian Commission was 2-651223J .
I  have repeated with great care the determination of the specific gravity
of rock-crystal, both before and after fusion, with the annexed results : —

     The  above number is practically         identical with those of Le Boyer and
Dumas and the Austrian Commission.                   Bock-crystal fuses very readily
before the oxyhydrogen blowpipe, and, if care be taken, the beads ob
tained are beautifully clear and free from bubbles.

   Eock-crystal loses, therefore, no less than seventeen per cent. of its
specific gravity on passing from the crystalline to the amorphous state,
or about a half per cent. less than is undergone by garnets, according to
the observations of Magnus ; whereas the beryl A only lost nine per cent.,
or little more than half as much.
   On the Effects of Fusion upon Emeralds. — On heating alone before the
oxyhydrogen blowpipe these emeralds bear a bright red heat without losing
their colour ; and at a heat which causes incipient fusion, the edges turn
colourless and opaque, while the centre remains green. After fusion for a
short time they yield an opalescent greenish glass, which, kept for a long
time at the maximum temperature of the blowpipe, becomes quite transpa
rent and almost colourless. The addition of chromic oxide causes the bead
to become of a dull green colour, which is not improved by moderate heating.
The fact that emeralds endure a temperature capable of fusing the edges
without the centre losing colour, appears conclusive against the idea of
the colouring-matter       being organic.   The beads produced by the fusion
of emeralds resemble those formed in the same manner from beryls ; the
phenomena during the fusion are also nearly alike ; but it takes longer
and a higher temperature to produce a colourless transparent bead with
emeralds than with colourless beryls.          The beads can be scratched by
 quartz, and the density is reduced to the same extent as with the beryl.

The density of fused emeralds is therefore almost exactly the same as
the globules obtained in a similar manner from the beryl A.
   Beryls, from the most various sources and of the greatest difference in
appearance, vary but little in specific gravity ; thus a large crystal of
beryl from Haddam County, North America, weighing 1089 grms., haditf
specific gravity determined by suspension, and the number obtained was

yellow crystal, the locality of which is doubtful, gave 2-69, or exactly the
same as the emeralds from Santa Fe.
   On the Effects of Fusion upon an Artificial Mixture of Beryl Ingredients.
— Being desirous of trying the effects of fusion upon an artificial mixture
of the same composition as that of a beryl,           I made a series of careful
analyses of the beryl A. The results of these analyses have led me to a
laborious examination of the processes at present in use for the separa
tion of alumina from glucina.          The study of the original carbonate-of-
ammonia process of Vauquelin, and the modifications of Eose, Joy, Hof-
meister, and others, has taken twelve months of constant work ; but even
my earlier analyses enabled me to obtain a sufficiently close approxima
tion to the composition of the beryl A. The following were the pro
portions used : —
                  Silica                                         67- 5

                  Glucina                                        14 0
                                                                100-0
    I did not introduce                               I
                           any iron or magnesia, as regard them as accidental
impurities varying in amount.
    When a mixture of the above composition is exposed to the flame of
the oxyhydrogen blowpipe, it fuses with almost exactly the same pheno
mena as with the natural beryl.          It is, however, as might be anticipated
from the absence of iron and chromium, much easier to get a colourless
transparent bead with the mixture than with either emeralds or beryls.
The greatest difficulty in this respect is, of course, found with emeralds.
The specific gravity of the fused globules was determined with the follow

 or almost exactly the same as the density of native emeralds and beryls
 after fusion.
     When a small portion of chromic oxide is added to the artificial mix
 ture and the whole is subjected to fusion, the resulting bead is of a rich
 yellowish green, and in many experiments approached to the emerald
 tint ; but, as a rule, the colour is more of a faded leaf -green ; and although

 Prolonged     heating gradually diminishes the colour, the bead gradually
 becoming of the palest bottle-green, and, finally, nearly colourless.               This
 result is the same as with the emerald.
    The    metallic   oxide which yields the finest tints when fused with
 opaque beryls,     or  the artificial mixture, is that of cobalt.          The manner
 in which this oxide withstands the intense heat of the oxyhydrogen flame
 is remarkable.      All tints, from nearly black to that of the palest sapphire,
 can be obtained, and the resulting glasses, when cut, are extremely beau
 tiful, and have almost the lustre of crystallized gems.
    The globules obtained by fusing the artificial mixture of beryl ingre
 dients with didymium oxide show the characteristic absorption-spectrum
 of that metal in a very perfect manner, the lines being intensely black.
Even when the bead is quite opalescent from insufficient heating, the
black lines are beautifully distinct in the spectroscope.                 With a large
quantity    of  didymium      oxide  the  beads   are  of  a   lively pink, becoming
more intense by artificial light, and, when cut, form very pretty gems.
The presence of didymium in sufficient quantity raises the specific gravity.

    Conclusions.  — The evidence given in this paper, showing that colourless
beryls may contain as much carbon as the richest-tinted emerald, taken in
conjunction with the ignition experiments, and the results of the fusion of
chromic oxide with colourless beryls and with an artificial mixture of the
same    composition, leaves me no room to doubt the correctness of Vau-
quelin's conclusion, that the green colour of the emerald is due to the
presence of chromic oxide.
    The fact that emeralds and beryls lose density when fused cannot
properly be cited as proving that they have been made in nature at a low
temperature ; for it is quite possible that they were crystallized out of a
solution in a fused mass, originally formed at a temperature high enough
to keep the constituents of the emerald in a state of fusion, and that the
crystals developed themselves during a slow process of cooling or evapora
tion. The method employed by Ebelmen * for the artificial production of
chrysoberyl, namely heating alumina, glucina, and carbonate of calcium with
boracic acid in a porcelain furnace until a portion of the menstruum had
evaporated, yielded crystals of the true specific gravity, showing the

density of minerals to be less dependent on the temperature at which
they are produced than upon their crystalline or amorphous state.
   One crystalline gem (the ruby) has undoubtedly been produced in
nature at a high temperature.               I
                                     have frequently repeated Gaudin's*
experiment on  the artificial formation of this stone, and can confirm
most of his results.         I did  not, however, find the density to be quite the
same     as the native ruby        or sapphire, which is, in different specimens,
from 3-53 to 3-56.          Artificial rubies of the finest colour made by me by
Gaudin's process had a specific gravity of 3-45, which is not three per
cent. lower than that of the ruby.  The reason for this close approxima
tion will be found in the fact that fused alumina crystallizes on cooling.
The crystallization, however, is confused and imperfect, which causes
the resulting product to be only partially transparent, and to have a
slightly lower specific gravity than the natural gem. It is, consequently,
scarcely    correct     to call      the fused stones made by Gaudin's              process
" artificial rubies."
  I have  convinced myself that rubies have been formed in nature at a
temperature equal, or nearly equal, to that of the fusiug-point of alumina,
from the circumstance that the reaction between chromic oxide and
alumina, which results in the development of the red colour of the gem,
is not effected at low or even moderately high temperatures, but requires
a heat as high as that of the oxyhydrogen blowpipe.    It is not necessary
that the chromium should be presented to the alumina in the form of
chromic     acid.     It
                    appears, therefore, that the red colour of the ruby
is not caused by the presence of chromic acid ; it     in fact,       is,
                                                                  reaction      a
sui generis between alumina and chromic oxide, which, as far as my expe
riments have gone, only takes place at very elevated temperatures.

   The idea conveyed was, that two layers of spherules (first detected
by Mr. Beaumont within the tubes), like two confined layers of small
shot, had, by compression, been forced and largely spread out into broader
layers.    It was thought also that detached portions resembled long
tubes or puckers filled with spherules exactly fitting them.      The sphe
rules appeared perfectly spherical, but somewhat unequal in size.
   In   the general flattened and extended surface of the compressed and
disintegrated scale the spherules appeared dark blue or red, according to
the slight change in the focal plane, and in a still lower plane white.
    In the adjoining uninjured scales long strings of beads were seen, like
necklaces of coral, here and there sharply bordered with black lines,
apparently denoting tubes of membrane or puckers enclosing them like
a tube. Between these strings of spherules peeped forth others of a light
orange-colour.
    The slide was an old one and well known.      The mass of the crushed
scale occupied a much broader space than any of the scales.

       the Ciliary Body." By Arthur Trehern Norton, F.R.C.S.,
       Lecturer on Anatomy at St. Mary's Medical School.              Com

                                  (Abstract.)
    This paper is to show that the increase in the convexity of the lens,
when accommodated for near vision, is effected by compression of the
equator of the lens by an erectile cushion composed of the ciliary pro
cesses turgid with blood, the ciliary muscle being the motor agent ; also
that the iris aids accommodation by increasing its rapidity, but that
accommodation of vision can be effected slowly without the assistance
of the iris.
    The author states that, by dissection of human eyes, he has determined
the existence of an erectile mass attached to the interior surface of the
ciliary muscle from which the ciliary processes proceed, and that in dis
sections of injected specimens the vessels of the ciliary processes and of
the erectile mass can be seen to pass through and between the fibres of
the ciliary muscle near to the apex of that muscle.
    From the festooned appearance of the ciliary processes when unin-
jected, and from their greatly increased size when injected, he concludes
that the ciliary processes, and the mass from which they project, are
erectile, and are capable of undergoing a great alteration in size, the
erection being due to compression of their veins by contraction of the
ciliary muscle.
    In the anatomy of the ciliary muscle he gives, as the origin of that
muscle, the middle fasciculus of the posterior elastic lamina of the cornea,

and as the insertion     |  to  £ the fibres into the connective tissue of the
choroid coat of the eyeball, and the remaining fibres into the      connective
tissue of the erectile mass and ciliary processes.
    Judging the action of the muscle from the attachment of its fibres, he
states that those fibres inserting into the choroidea, and which are seen
to pass around the veins derived from tissues which he terms erectile,
must, when contracting, compress those veins, and so cause the erection
of the ciliary processes and ciliary mass ; whilst the fibres of the muscle
which curve round to insert into the connective tissue of the ciliary pro
cesses, when contracting, cause those structures to approach the muscle,
thereby tensing them upon their contained vessels, so as to render them
solid and to prevent them from flattening upon the anterior surface of
 the lens.
     The attachment of the ciliary muscle to the suspensory ligament of
 the lens, either primarily or secondarily, is denied ; so that the con
 traction of that muscle cannot draw forward the suspensory ligament as
 hitherto described.
     The existence of  a ciliary ligament is not admitted.
     The author continues    : —
     Accommodation    is known to depend upon the convexity of the lens.
     The convexity of the lens depends upon the size of the erectile organs
 (ciliary processes and ciliary mass), which, when the eye is accommodated
 for closest vision, assume the greatest amount of erection. These erec
 tile organs form a circular cushion, which overlaps the equator of the
 lens ; and as the size of this cushion increases as the erectile tissue
 becomes filled with blood, so does the cushion exert a greater amount of
 pressure upon the equator of the lens, decreasing the substance of the
 lens at its equator, and increasing it at its poles ; in this manner the lens
 is increased in convexity and accommodated for near vision.
     So far accommodation may be effected without the aid of an iris ; but
 without an iris the change of accommodation from extreme distant to
 extreme near vision must occupy the time required to fill the eiliarr
 processes with blood to complete erection.         With the iris the change is
 almost (but not quite) instantaneous.
     From the circumferential attachment the iris curtain passes obliquely
 forward for fa to fa inch, and then falls at a sharp angle. [In opera
 tions   the iris tears from this angle, and not from its circumferential
 attachment.]     The plane of the iris is therefore fa to fa inch in front of
 its attachment.
     Papillary narrowing is associated with accommodation for near vision.
 The muscular fibres of the iris are circular and radiating ; and though
 the two sets would appear to counteract each other, yet both can act at
 the same time.       When the circular fibres (sphincter) contract, th?
  radiating fibres contract with a power not sufficient to overcome the
  contraction of the circular fibres, but with a power sufficient to tense the

curtain of the iris and to obliterate the sharp angle already described.
The plane of the iris is then thrown back to a level with the circum
ferential attachment.
    The ciliary cushion, which is at the same time, one may say, slowly
enlarging by the erection of the ciliary processes Ac., and which lies be
hind the iris, is thus instantly pressed back by the iris upon the equator
of the lens, and the lens is therefore instantly accommodated for the
nearer vision. The iris is thus shown to greatly increase the rapidity of
accommodation     .

                                      (Abstract.)
    The present communication consists of two parts.
    The first part treats of the contact of conies with a given surface at a
given point ; this class of questions was first treated by Mr. Spottiswoode
in his paper " On the Contact of Conies with Surfaces," and general
 formulae applicable to all such questions were given.
    The results of that paper are here reproduced with some additions ;
with the exception of a few collateral theorems, these are all contained
in the following Table : —
     •Number of five-point conies through fixed point                        = 6
     •Order of surface formed by five-point conies through fixed axis = 8
      Number of six-point conies through fixed axis                           = 9
     •Number of seven-point conies                                            =70
    The second part treats of the contact of a quadric surface with a
surface of the order n ; and in particular it determines the number of
 points at which a quadric (other than the tangent plane reckoned twice)
can have four-branch contact with the surface.                In his paper " On the
 Contact of Surfaces," Mr. Spottiswoode proves that at an arbitrary point
on a surface there is no other solution than the doubled tangent plane,
and gives the conditions that must be satisfied by those points at which
another solution is possible.
    The method here adopted is an extension of that applied by Joachim-
stal to the contact of lines with curves and surfaces. The coordinates of
a point on a conic are expressed in terms of a single parameter, those of
a point on a quadric by two parameters.              To determine the intersection
 with a given surface we have an equation in the parameter or parameters ;
and the conditions of contact are expressed in terms of the coefficients
of that equation.      The special case of the intersection of a quadric with
a cubic surface    is treated by the method of representation         on a plane.

        1873.
    The researches detailed in the present paper were commenced in May
 1871. The results arrived at were largely obtained from using the
 microscope. Similar but less brilliant and more scanty appearances can
 be obtained with the telescope ; but the very high power and ready
adaptability of the former confers some advantages not offered by the
 latter.
    In both, however, the same principles are illustrated.
    A cone of rays of small angular aperture having the       object-glass for
 its base in each case engages the eyepiece and emerges parallel,            and
 the eyepieces are similar in each.
    Peculiar facilities for studying solar spectra and their   indications     of
 aberrations and mechanical errors also are afforded by the former.          The
 focal plane of vision may be employed to examine the effects of the      inter
 ference of complex cones of light of large angular aperture, at least
 twenty times larger than those observable by the telescope.
    The subject of the optical contacts of Venus at the coming transit
 confers peculiar interest on the nature of accurate definition of the final
 image presented to the eye-glass, especially as the new parallax will be
 entirely dependent on the keen definition of the four contacts.
    The discovery by the writer of an unsuspected residuary aberration in
 the best microscopes, described in the Philosophical Transactions for 1870,
 renders it probable that some such a residuum still remains in telescopes ;
 and this might impair the accuracy of such delicate observations as the ap
 parent contacts between Venus and the solar limb.     Eyepieces,   abounding

generally with spherical aberration, require also particular attention.             I
have repeatedly observed a fine state of definition completely blurred
merely by a change of eyepiece of the same power, which no mere
focusing ameliorated, and which could only be corrected by a change
in the convergent pencil passing through the objective intrinsically
affecting its aberration.
   Another branch of such an inquiry would be the nature of the definition
of an organic particle under high powers, as every such research (such as
the detection of the characteristics of diseased and healthy cells) may be
resolved into the power of the microscope to define a single organic
particle.    Such particles are generally brilliant and refracting, and the
errors of observation are unfortunately at present of a numerous kind.
(Appendix A.)
                         On the   Circular Solar Spectrum.
   If a  lens* be placed with its axis coincident with that of the micro
scope, and if its principal focus formed by the solar rays be examined by
an instrument of the highest quality, we shall find that minute slices, as
it were, of the solar    cone present phenomena of rare beauty and order,
dependent upon the quality of the examining instruments.
   If  two plano-convex lenses are placed with axes coincident, a good
many coloured rings may be counted, but no black ones ; so soon as their
axes become oblique, the solar spectrum takes an intricate form, whilst
the centre shows a brilliant cross ( iji ), very difficult to describe or repre
sent by portraiture, but worthy of the highest photographic art of all
the forms described.
   This spectrum     I venture to name the circular solar spectrum.
   In  my former research      I had observed a flame-disk in a darkened room.
This disk presented two or three diffraction-rings, similar to those of
telescopic stars, but much broader.
   The same method was attempted with the sun. Various objectives
were used to obtain a solar miniature of the sun's disk.
   Plain mirrors of glass silvered at the back entirely failed.
   In order to form a pure and brilliant solar spectrum under the micro
scope, it occurred to me to take advantage of the principle of total internal
reflection from a prism.   I then constructed a prism-heliostat, which, acting in
sunshine, presented an aerial miniature of the sun of great splendour (almost
as dazzling as the sun itself) for half an hour, without further adjustment.
    The prism-heliostat was furnished with a crown-glass double-convex
lens, itself being of flint ; and other lenses of less focal length could be
attached to diminish or increase the diameter of the primary image of the
sun, which, as the focal length generally used was 3 inches, gave an
image 3 sin 30' in diameter, or one fortieth of an inch nearly.             In some
cases object-glasses    and  eyepieces   were placed   in the  solar  rays emanat
ing from the prism.

 small ones can be conveniently examined.

lionths was found convenient.             To moderate the overpowering brilliance
of such a spectrum directly viewed, dark slides of graduated neutral
tints were at first used, and smaller primary disks were obtained by using
deeper lenses at the prism.
    When this minute spectrum is viewed with a high power (800 or 1000).
the phenomena attending residuary errors, whether of achromatism,
spherical aberration, or mechanical construction, are demonstrated with
so keen a severity upon the handiworks                 of man      as   to throw all other
methods into the       shade.
                                  Plienomena ohaerved.
    With the flame-disk formerly          used   * only two or three diffraction-rings
could (as already remarked) be descried ; an extraordinary                       number of
richly coloured rings of dazzling brilliance was now exhibited at the in
stant of bringing the solar disk into the plane of focal vision.
    The most striking feature, amid so much effulgence, was an intensely
black    (jet-black) diffraction-ring encircling the central disk at the
clearest focal point.       The appearance of the rings changed every instant
with   the   slightest change of focus, and their tints indicated the nature of
the  " secondary spectrum."
    Upon closer inspection, my curiosity was excited by observing the
shape of the primary or central black ring deviating from a true circular
form, somewhat squared off, as though not consisting of one pure black
ring.     I  then found, upon more careful examination, by change in the
                                        " collar corrections," that it was
eyepieces, length of body, and                                                    composed
of several excentric rings.            The research, as one depended upon the
fitful gleams of a spring sunshine, though tedious, was at this point
enlivened with the outcome of an important fact, which will be more
fully noticed further on [viz. that achromatism and aplanatism, in the
best adjustable microscopes, at present were found to be altogether                   incon
gruous].
    The   same     result, the enlarged disk, as described in my former paper
was obtained.
    The theoretical disk (exhibited on the stage of the microscope) appeared
increased to nearly four times its proper sizet.

1873.]                       Circular Solar Spectra.                           429
    Three general features were constantly observed : the rings were
seen either wholly or chiefly on one side of the solar disk, i. e. either
within or without the focus, or nearly similar, except in colour, on oppo
site sides of the focal point.
    If  the rings were on one side a nebulous brightness occupied the
other, into which the solar disk suddenly resolved itself on a slight change
of focus ; but frequently this nebulosity assumed a fine-grained or
"  engine-turned pattern."        Occasionally     two primary     disks, each with
its own system of rings, struggled for the mastery           ; and on changing the
focus a chromatrope effect was produced by the expanding rings and
their excentric intersections presenting an extraordinary loveliness of
colours.
    Another result somewhat startled me. In some of the best glasses
the movement of the Ross collar-adjustment                for the position of the
front lenses entirely     decentred  the  solar  disk, so  that here two appeared
occasionally instead of one.
    This phenomenon compelled me to infer that in many cases the collar-
                                                                        "
 adjustment may become a greater source of error than the thickness"
 of glass cover which it is intended to compensate, and that therefore
 excellent glasses, constructed with a permanent setting, are preferable,
 especially  as a new compensation       can be effected, as described p. 435*.
     The frequent appearance of several disks at once in the field of view
 caused me to suspect that the axes of the component lenses of the
 objectives were not always coincident.
    An Andrew Ross " quarter," marked             1851, though of good quality,
 displayed   several irregularly   placed   central disks, which formed so many
 different centres of diffraction-rings.
     A Berlin   glass of good quality showed a much finer primary black
 ring, and a splendid display of several coloured rings edged with black ;
 in a deeper focus four false centres appeared.
     It will not be out of place here to detail a few experiments conducted
 with the object of verifying the cause of irregularity in the primary black,
 and the particular signs of chromatic and spherical residuary aberration.
     One of the finest
                          " immersion " one-eighths of Powell and Lealand,
 made expressly for me in 1871, the aberrations of which were small
 compared with those of glasses of their old construction, was now used
 to form the miniature solar disk on the stage as derived from the distant
 prism-heliostat.
    I  then examined the solar disk with a Powell and Lealand one-sixteenth
 immersion-objective      (1862 make) adapted to water in 1870, a water-
 film being introduced between the glasses, whose axes had been carefully
 adjusted to coincidence.
     Two overlapping     disks were    now seen : each formed its own inde
 pendent diffraction systems      above   the best focus, and evanished below it
 with a confused bright halo.
                       *  By means of the compensating eyepiece.

430                           Dr. Royston-Pigott on                   [June   19,
   In  order to determine the cause of this and to insure one axis in         the
solar disk,   I substituted    for the miniature-giving objective a conveio-
plane lens   of  half   an  inch  focus ; and as this gave too large a disk, the
lens of the heliostat was reduced from three inches to an inch and a half
focal length.
    [Unless the solar disk is reduced, the splendid phenomena of the rings
cannot be properly developed.          Their number and colours change with
the slightest change of the plane of focal vision ; and a very fine and
delicate focal adjustment-screw, as well as great firmness in the apparatus,
are essential to a successful display of the rings in all their wonderful
beauty and complexity.]
    The disk formed by the simple lens was now scrutinized with the Powell
and Lealand celebrated immersion "eighth." Deeper eyepieces and a
lengthened tube were employed to subdue the intolerable brilliance of
the coloured rings ; they now exactly filled the whole field of view. At
first, used dry (improperly), this objective displayed a crimson solar disk
edged with an intensely black ring encircled with a much broader bright
ring, resembling the planet Saturn viewed perpendicularly to the plane of
his ring. (PI. n. figs. 1-3.)
    Deepening the focus with exceeding lightness of touch, the central
disk now became pearly white, set off prettily by its companion black
ring and a number of pale lavender, pale rose-colour, and then brilliant
outer circles of bright green, with intervals of orange-red, and, more out
wardly, circles of red merging into ill-defined black.
    But as the glass was constructed for vision through a film of water
upon a thin glass
                      " cover,"   I  now attached (by moisture) a small frag
ment of cover, 0-003 inch thick, to the eighth, and delicately focused
down upon the solar spectrum.
    The solar disk then appeared single, circular, and bounded by a clear
sharp black edge almost perfectly circular.
    Upon examining the axis in different planes of vision or different
sections of the solar pencil,     I  counted no less than forty-eight magnifi
cent rings (including the black rings and interspaces) displayed at one
time in the same field of view.         Derived directly from the sun, with the
brilliance  belonging to total internal reflection, this rich assemblage of
gorgeous rings, rivalling each other in prismatic splendour, set off by
the sharp contrasts of jet-black well-defined borders, and shaded with the
most delicate tints melting into one another with an exquisite softness,
reminded me of the eloquent and glowing language of the late Sir John
Herschel when describing the phenomena of diffraction. Doubtless,
however, these appearances surpassed in intensity and brilliance those he
described. (PI.    II.   figs. 2 & 3.)      Careful measurements were made.
The diameter of        the   central  disk   ; 8|S!( ; breadth of its black ring
    My surprise was further increased by observing that, by lengthening
the tube to increase power,       I  was enabled to cause each of the ruled

lines of a micrometric eyepiece (200 to an inch) to coincide exactly with
the inner edge of each black ring ; so that the breadth of each complete
ring was exactly the same as that of the central disk, viz.T)!^a!) of an
inch. (PI. II. fig. 3.)
   Slight changes in the colours of the rings were caused by the use of the
Ross collar corrections.
   In   these researches a very near approximation to achromatism was
signified by the whiteness of the central disk, the blackness of the fine
rings contrasting finely with the intervening rings, which were then of a
lavender-grey or very pale and yet brilliant lavender.
   Destruction of spherical aberration appeared imminent when the rings,
still coloured, were tolerably symmetrical on different sides of the finest
focus with contrasting colours of the residuary spectrum.                Mechanical
errors were displayed by irregularity and complexity of form.
   I   shall now venture to give some particulars of the circular solar
spectrum thus formed (as described) by a convexo-plane lens in a beam of
sunshine examined by a high-quality immersion-objective               armed with a
small piece of broken cover attached by the cohesion of water.

    Each of the rings, including the companion black or dark rings,
appeared exactly of the same breadth, viz. 61 millionths of an inch, or
nearly double the length of the wave of the extreme red ray ; whilst
the breadth of the primary black ring was nearly that of the wave-length
for the line F in Fraunhofer's spectrum, viz. 0-0004606 millimetre, or,
since the French metre is in English inches
                                       39-37078984,
it corresponds to 52256 waves to the English inch.

                                  Dr. Roystou-Pigott on                        [June 19,
     The delicate measurement of the primary black ring and disk was
 verified by a recording eyepiece micrometer.                  With this and the objec
  tive used it was found that one thousandth                   of an inch on the stage
 measured 1138 divisions, i. e. eleven turns of the divided head and
 '-ftfc of a turn.     One division therefore represented

      On estimating the breadth of the primary jet-black ring, and using a
 ruled glass micrometer, as            I  could detect no difference in the breadths
 of each ring,        I   felt justified in dividing the total diameter by the
 number of rings in order to obtain the breadth of one, which gave Trirr
 A much deeper point in the axis showed a very deep blue central haze,
 paling outwardly, and then melting into a final red fringe.
     The precision of the mechanical construction of this fine objective was
 thus revealed by the use of a simple convex lens of crown glass.                     Any
 deviation from accuracy was at once detected by the converging pencil
 of the plano-convex lens, consisting of shells of rays of various re-
 frangibilities, having their several foci arranged along the axis. As
this axis was necessarily single and unique, the interference phenomena,
especially the sharpness and intensity of the jet-black rings, could only
be so superbly exhibited by the best glasses.                   Inferior glasses blurred
them and dulled the rich beauty of the colours.
     Contrasting with this the performance of a variety of glasses, both
English and foreign, very peculiar appearances arose which doubtless
indicated grave errors of construction.                I will venture  briefly to mention
some of these : —
     (I.) A variety of spurious disks oddly arranged were displayed.
     (II.) The beauty of the rings was entirely marred ; and
     (III.) Very few rings could be developed, and sometimes                no black rings
whatever      (PI. II.   fig. 7, and    PI. in.   fig. 14).
     (IV.)  Notched, grained, and spotted           ; the rings were sometimes irregular
in shape (fig. 12).
     (V.) A multitude of fine black                excentric rings, evidently arising
from different       centres,    were seen upon a leaden-grey field surrounding
the central disk, the confusion of the rings causing a bad achromatism.
                  "                               "
     (VI.) An engine-turned pattern was not unfrequent, degenerating
into a peculiar grained and mottled appearance.
     (VII.) A    majority of the glasses were overcorrected spherically.
     (VIII.)   Achromatism         and aplanatism in our best adjustable glasses
were found to be altogether incongruous.
     As this result was alluded to at page 428, 1 proceed to relate the cir
cumstances      of the observation.            I constantly found in pursuing these
researches that either achromatism was sacrificed to aplanatism, or that
the attainment of achromatism destroyed the brightness and truth of
aplanatism.        I may relate the following experience.
     Whenever in watching the heliostat the sun was clouded over. as

alluded to at page 428, the microscopic miniature-perspective                      of the room
and distant apparatus reappeared ; and after various adjustments 1
obtained a perfect definition, free from mist and as clear and sharp as
that of an opera-glass. The prism and lens of the heliostat then gave a
pretty picture of the passing clouds, as well as the small details of the
distant objects ; but the instant the sun began to shine, before the rings
dazzled the sight, every shining point appeared haloed with a corona of
orange and red.        I  now turned aside the prism : then every polished point
in the full sunshine exhibited the same halo. Again in the shade, the
picture resumed its sharp definition.                Waiting again for the sun, forth
shone the orange haloes.            The corrections were diligently plied till the
halo nearly disappeared.             The sun passed behind a cloud.                     To my
astonishment the former sharp clear prospect was now bedimmed with a
general white mist, obscuring all the details before so beautifully clear. The
appearance of this white               mist,    above   the   best  focal point, whenever
achromatism was attained              by varying the adjustments of the screw
collars,   now    convinced      me    that the modern English glasses, when
rendered     achromatic, beget a residuary spherical aberration, obscuring
delicate structures (such as         I  propose to describe further on) by a white
mist, corresponding to spherical overcorrection, viz. the condition of
the marginal rays for white light cutting the axis at points further from
the centre of the lens than the central rays, and that until this fact is
acknowledged an insuperable bar to the finest definition will continue to
exist. (PI.    III.  figs. 8&9.)
    Dr. Colonel Woodward, U.S.A., having taken up the research, declares
he found it impossible to photograph the most difficult beaded objects
unless,    upon examining their image on a white screen, he represented
the beads red upon a blue ground; then, using a solution of the
ammonio-sulphate of copper to absorb the red rays, and then only, could
he photograph the results          I  had described * (M. Micr. Journ.).
    Eesiduary spherical aberration, it thus appears, is the chief cause of
   * In confirmation of    the same principle the late Hev.     J. B. Eeade, P.E.S., wrote 1 :—
" Dr. Pigott has made      also a very   decided   advance   in  the better  correction of resi
duary aberration, a point which has,       I  believe, been almost completely ignored (nay
even denied), until recently, by accurate observers as well as distinguished opticians.
From my own experience in Dr. Pigott's studio,          I  have no doubt that his colour-test
— a most interesting feature in his experiments — is the result of his finer balance of the
aberrations . . . This new fact is one of the most striking phenomena in microscopical
science of the present day
   " Whether this colour-test is explained on the theory of vibrating wave-length
corresponding to the infinitesimal thicknesses of films         ...   or upon their radiation,
refraction, and internal reflection of the spherical beads of which all scales and diatoms
appear to be built up, are questions so recondite as to be worthy of the considera
tion of the most advanced physicists of the day."
   As residuary aberration is still denied,     I  may be permitted to quote     '

molecules of physiological          cells, blood-disks, mucous globules, and the
discrimination of many forms of disease. It will probably remain un
corrected until opticians and observers abandon the false standards of
definition still in vogue. If, then, it is at present impossible to avoid a
residuary spherical aberration, whilst attaining very perfect achromatism,
in the microscope, the finest definition will be obtained by stopping out the
 most obnoxious rays, either by using a monochromatic ray which suits the

 refrangibility.
     Before concluding this part of the paper               I  may be allowed to make
 a few practical conclusions for those who may wish to follow up this
 line of research : —
     1. As stated in the paper " On           a Searcher     for Aplanatic Images,"         re
 garding    a convex    lens as undercorrected,           undercorrection     is shown       by
 the appearance of the rings below or beyond the focal point and evanish-
 ment into mist above it.
     2. Similarity in the rings on both sides (with change of colour also)
 denotes a balance more or less delicate of the aberrations.
     3.  An excentric position of the solar disk and             a crowding of the rings
 more closely on     one  side   than   the other    of   the circular spectrum denotes
 parallelism, but non-coincidence, of the axes of the convergent and
  divergent pencils (figs. 28 & 29).
     4. Eare and beautiful forms, resembling parachutes, vases, or comets,
  made up of ellipsoid,        parabolic, or hyperbolic         diffraction-lines,     denote
  obliquity (figs. 16-34).
     5. Their form depends on the nature of the aberrations present, and
 the mode of arranging the axis of the cone of rays forming the solar disk.
     6. Inaccurate centering of the component lenses, either at the heliostat
  or in the observing or miniature-making objectives, is shown by " excentric
           "
  turning patterns and the appearance of two or several central disks at the
  smallest focal spectrum.
     7.  The apparatus necessary to display these brilliant phenomena must
  be exceptionally heavy and steady, and the fine adjustment should have

    The Astronomer Boyal has given an account of a trial of several
kinds of eyepieces and some of their bad effects *.
    The use of a solar disk formed by an eyepiece fixed close to the
prism-heliostat     deprived of its lens, and examined by the method
already described by means of accurately corrected objectives, places the
achromatism     of the eyepiece under a severe scrutiny.             Very rich and
beautiful colours are developed in the solar rings (previously obtained
as pale as possible), corresponding         to the extent of the chromatic errors.
A   Huyghenian eyepiece was placed close to the heliostat, so as to form a
brilliant disk of the sun ; the adjusted spectrum-apparatus immediately
flashed with brilliant-coloured rings, before this appearing pale lavender
and white.
    During the    use  of the searcher for aplanatic images, it occurred to me
to investigate the effects of pushing the eyepiece gradually nearer the
object-glass without a searcher.
    I  discovered that, when within four inches, the definition showed
violent undercorrection.
    I now conceived the idea of substituting a traversing movement of the
eyepiece, especially for glasses unprovided with a Boss collar, as a
correction for thickness of cover.
    A very firm sliding-tube was constructed ; and now found   I             I  had
substituted a range of several inches, as a correction, for that of a few

    Experiment. —Adjusting the apparatus and the screw collars of the ob
jectives for severe testing, a bunch of small glass drops, of diameter O04
inch, was suspended in front of the heliostat, so as to present a minute
image of the sun.           The searching eyepiece being placed at 10 inches
distance from the stage of the microscope in the plane of which the solar
 disk is formed, and the minute solar disk observed in a state of balanced
 corrections,  it  was found that as the eyepiece was traversed towards the
 disk it  became gradually more and more undercorrected.
    It  now became evident that this movement was, upon a large scale,
 equivalent to the effect of the Boss collar movement upon a minute scale.

an objective, that a dry objective might in many cases be transformed
into an " immersion " simply by advancing the eyepiece ; also that a
sufficient variation of interval between the front lenses might in many
cases enable a    dry lens to act as an immersion.
    [The  immersion    principle is valuable for the increased volume of the
cone of rays radiant from the illuminated particle mounted in balsam,
a much larger pencil reaching the objective vid water than can possibly be
effected vid air, the " critical angles of total internal reflection which

determine the form of the caustic being so much larger in passing from
glass into water than into air.        I  have shown elsewhere that the volume
of the cone of rays transmitted from a radiant particle placed in balsam
and surmounted with a thin glass cover is about four times greater vid
water than vid air ; that result is explanatory of the greater brightness
of the immersion lens.]
    The question of the spherical and chromatic aberrations of eyepieces
has occupied the attention of the most distinguished mathematicians, and
may theoretically be considered nearly exhausted ; yet the practical
detection of its existence is known to few, as it is liable to be mixed up
with    the objective aberration.          The methods described are equally
applicable to eyepieces as to objectives.           (Appendix B.)
   The construction of a compound compensating eyepiece which should
be almost perfectly free from this residuum next engaged my attention.
   From the discovery that the advance of an eyepiece towards the ob
jective caused a violent undercorrection in the refocused objective, it became
evident that a shortened microscope could be employed as a compound
eyepiece nearly free from the usual aberrations, provided its object-glass
were properly overcorrected, as compared with its performance at the usual
standard distance of ten inches.
   The new eyepiece is finally corrected on the circular solar spectrum
(herein described), being regarded and treated as a real microscope.                   Its
object-glass, considering the exceedingly small pencil engaging it, may
conveniently be formed of slightly overcorrected achromatic lenses, com
pensated by a variable interval.         I have found an inch focal length suffi
ciently deep, mounted with a low eyepiece.                   The substitution of this
compensating eyepiece for the ordinary deep Huyghenians afforded that
degree of comfort in observation corresponding to enlarged pencils.
    After adjustment it is quite as applicable to examine the performance
of telescopes as microscopes.        The adjustment is thus accomplished : —
    1. The instrument, mounted as a complete microscope, was adjusted
for the most perfect definition on an uncovered object ; and supposing
the glasses A, B (adjustable by a variable interval) defined perfectly with
the usual length of tube 10 inches, they require overcorrection* or
separation for a shorter tube of 6 inches.
   *
      Considering the small angular aperture,  a single set of achromatic lenses might  be

      2. Various eyepieces were inserted, and the lenses A, B separated or
   closed more or less till the most perfect definition was attained.
      3. Now, regarding the instrument as a perfectly corrected compen
   sating eyepiece, it is transferred to the tube of another microscope, the
   objective of which is again adjusted by the screw-collar for the most
   distinct definition.
      Tested on the principles glanced at in this paper, the corrected com
   pensating eyepiece, free from the usual aberrations, may be confidently
   employed to test the circular solar spectrum of a minute distant solar
   heliostat-disk,  formed in its focal plane, by the objective also of a proposed
   telescope.
    On new Adjustments        for the Ohject-glasses    of Telescopes and compensations
                                  for residuary variations.
      Applied to telescopes the compensating eyepiece is adjusted some
   what differently.
      The instrument having been severely tested for an uncovered object,
  and used for this purpose as a compound microscope (its front glasses
  A, B being considerably overcorrected when tried for ten inches), the
  telescope is directed to the solar disk formed at as great a distance as is
  attainable    by a prism-heliostat ; the condition of the diffraction-rings
  will  then display the state of the telescopic objective.
     If  several eyepieces and adjustable lenses are applied in succession,
  under precautions (such as securing a sufficiently small and distant
  solar disk), the aberrations of the telescope can be accurately observed*.
     A careful consideration of the compensations effected in the microscope,
        (1) by separating the objective lenses,
        (2) by separating the eyepiece lenses,
        (3) by traversing the eyepiece in search of aplanatic images,
 leads to the conclusion that, provided the front lenses of the compen
 sating eyepiece be separable more or less, and the distance between
 them and the eyepiece be somewhat variable, then a new correction for
 the telescope is given by also separating               the component         lenses of its
 object-glass by minute intervals.
     To accomplish this accurately, sliding telescopic tubes, one carrying
 constructed and employed ; but their correction is much more tediously attained than
 by separable sets of lenses.
    * The eyepiece recommended to thus test the solar disk formed by a telescope is to
be used precisely upon the same principles as a microscope ; the greater the aperture
of the telescope the greater will be the power applicable, i. e. by deeper eyepieces and
objectives, which must have much more widely separable lenses thnn usual for cover
                                                                                      "

 rately adjusted to the solar disk, diminished sufficiently by a

 through equal spaces ; and, vice versd, slight residuary aberrations will be
                                                                              also
 affected by changes in the compensating eyepiece. The tubes should be
  ground (in the manner of making levels) truly to preserve the centering
  of the objective lenses.
      Another form of correction is the concave achromatic lens, now called
  the Barlow lens. If this lens be formed of an overcorrected combina
  tion, its effect on the final aberration will vary as it receives a larger or
  smaller pencil, i. e. as its position between the eyepiece and objective of
  a telescope or microscope is made to vary.           The traversing principle
  here advocated has therefore several important advantages worthy of
  investigation,    and may possibly form a correction    for changeable refrac
  ting powers of the atmosphere.
      In   the compensating eyepiece a large visual pencil is substituted for a
  minute one and the same ease and comfort is obtained with it as if the
  linear aperture of the telescope were greatly enlarged.           An ocular of
  one-inch focus may be used instead of another ten times as deep.
      Slight    changes in the over- or undercorrection        of the telescope
  depending on the changeable density of the atmosphere may also pro
   bably be compensated by over- or undercorrecting this eyepiece.
      Moreover the special aberrations of the eye-glasses may be ameliorated
   by a slight change of form and an alteration         in the interval between
   them.

   complete series of experiments in telescopes.           My excellent 8|-inch

    A new fiftieth immersion lens, price thirty guineas, has been made for
me by Messrs. Powell and Lealand ; with this glass, without any obli
quity, and using a tube four inches shorter than usual and a B eyepiece,
the upper continuous ribs of the Podura were resolved into strings of
blue sapphire-like beads appearing perfectly circular. The interspaces
between the markings at a lower focus showed lower strings of white
beads.
    Monads appeared blue, swimming about in the water used, and also
lying in well-defined masses ; some of them could be seen to rotate ; the
cilia were invisible, but the movements gave strong indications of them.
—April 21, 1873.
    A blue glass improved       the definition.    Coal-oil lamp and 1^-inch open
condenser object-glass.
    At present nothing is more difficult of definition in the microscope
than an assemblage of minute refracting organic particles.                      Virtually
forming disks of light, these display the diffraction-errors and phenomena
more or less vividly.       No English microscopist has yet succeeded, so far
as is known to the writer, in displaying, in the apparently blank spaces,
the beaded structure seen between the celebrated exclamation-markings
of the Podura test-object. Here a closely packed mass of organic particles,
highly refractive and transparent, obscure each other ; brilliant points are
swelled out exceedingly, for a theoretical solar disk one millionth of an
inch * in diameter appeared as large as a disk the sixty thousandth.                    To
define accurately bright organic particles, such as those of the smallest
testr-Podura, the molecules of cancer-cells and other diseased forms, and
monads (minute atoms of metal by reflected light might also be named),
is at present impossible ; when such delicate forms are in quest, all rays
of an aberrating character must necessarily be extinguished.
    Illustration. — Examining with an excellent new ^ immersion at
sunset, as already alluded to, it was only when a peculiar bluish-green
of the sky was thrown by an open excellent 1^-inch objective glass
condenser upon the stage that the internal organic particles of a deli
 cate iWiu-o-scale became visible.             Doubtless in this case the diffrac
tion-spectra here had reached a minimumt. In the details given in the
accompanying note several points are particularly worthy of notice — the
use of an intermediate lens (amplifier), the sudden appearance of organic
    * Easily  formed by placing a minute lens before the heliostat.

                                                    Introduction.
    The study of colouring-matters as described in the following paper
 requires the use of  somewhat special kind of chemistry and
                              a                                spectro                        of

scopic instruments designed for the purpose, but yet           it cannot  be looked
upon as being either chemistry or spectrum-analysis.            It is also requisite
to make use of light as a reagent, and yet the subject could not be called
photography or even photo-chemistry ; and though most intimately con
nected with biology, it could scarcely be regarded as a branch of that
science.    It appears to me most desirable to adopt some name for the
whole subject, including whatever modifications of other branches of
science are requisite for its efficient study, and none would meet the
requirements of the case better than Chromatology.           I trust that the facts
I  am about to describe      will   be sufficient  to show that we have such         a
wide branch of science before us that it deserves some special name.
Then, again, since     I  now purpose to describe the points of agreement
and difference in the colouring-matters of various classes of plants, it
appears to me that no better title could be adopted than the one             I  have
chosen,   viz. Comparative Vegetable Chromatology.
   My    attention has been for a long time directed             to the colouring-
matters of plants, but it is only within the last year that             I have dis
covered the means of carrying out the inquiry in a satisfactory manner,
and convinced myself that the most valuable conclusions are to be learned,
not by looking for the rarer or more attractive substances which give
remarkable spectra, but from the qualitative and quantitative determina
tion of the different coloured constituents of complicated mixtures, some
of which substances have no striking properties, and might easily be
overlooked, though perhaps of great importance in connexion with the
life of particular plants. The successful carrying out of this inquiry
will necessarily be the work of years ; for not only is the whole field
comparatively unexplored, but it will be requisite to examine all
classes of plants and many of animals, at various seasons of the year
and when growing in different natural and artificial circumstances, and
also to study the relation of the different colouring-matters                to one
another, and the action on them of light and chemical reagents.                    In
every department of the subject very interesting questions remain to be
 answered ; and the following paper must be looked upon merely as a
general outline of what       I  have hitherto been able to learn, and as an
indication of what may be expected to result from further research.
                 Tin Absorption-band-raking       Power of Solvents.
    The identification of the individual colouring-matters has been effected
by means of their spectra, sometimes as seen by examining the plants
themselves, but generally when dissolved in various liquids, with or with
 out the addition of appropriate reagents ; but any other peculiarities were
taken advantage of, according to the circumstances of the case.                   For
 further particulars     connected with the general method          I  refer to my
 former papers*.

     Here, however,       I would remark that the exact position of the absorp
 tion-bands given by particular substances varies considerably, according
 to the nature of the solvent, even though it is quite neutral and exerts
 no chemical action on the colouring-matter.               Thus, for example, the bands
 may lie much nearer to the red end when dissolved in bisulphide                         of
 carbon than when dissolved in benzole or absolute alcohol. This kind                    of
 fact has been often noticed by others, but its bearing on some important
 questions has generally been overlooked.                  Apparently, as a rule, the
 bands are more raised towards the blue when the colouring-matter is
 dissolved than when in a solid state, and this power of raising them
 varies with the solvent ; but the extent also depends very much on each
 particular substance.           I have carefully determined the order in which
 various liquids thus raise bands, and compared it with the order of their
 specific gravity, and of their refractive and dispersive power, but have
 hitherto failed to recognize any simple connexion between what may be
 called the band-raising poiver and any other physical property. In some
 cases the position of the bands given by the solid substance appears to
 vary according as it is in a colloid or a crystalline state. Though at
 first this difference in position may seem to be an objection in the use of
 the spectrum method, yet it only shows the need of comparing together
 our specimens in exactly the same condition, and it may be taken advan
 tage of as a means for distinguishing closely allied substances which may
 be influenced in a very different manner and for enabling us to ascertain
 the condition of a colouring-matter as it exists in an animal or plant. It
 is thus possible to determine whether it is in a free state or dissolved in
an oil or wax, and in the latter case whether it is liquid or solid. In
this manner         I  have been able to detect a difference in the relative
 quantity of oil indifferent parts of the same leaf. Various forms of
 spectrum-microscopes were employed, according to the requirements of
the case ; and the amount of material at command would often have been
too small for examination with any other kind of instrument ; so that I
think   I  may fairly say that comparative vegetable chromatology is the
first great subject which has resulted from the use of the spectrum-
microscope.
                Separation of Colouring-matters hy chemical means.
    On the present occasion           I  propose to consider almost exclusively those
 colouring-matters        which are soluble in bisulphide of carbon and in Sid
oils, but insoluble in water.             These appear to be by far the most im
portant    in   connexion with plant life, or at all events are more uniformly
distributed.        Those soluble in water and insoluble in bisulphide of

carbon or fixed oils are much more numerous, and often very partially
and, as it were, accidentally present : those of the former class may
often be separated from one another by means of bisulphide of carbon,
alcohol, and water, mixed in proper proportions.                 As an illustration   I
take the very simple case of olive Alyce, like Fucus or Laminaria. They
should be well crushed, slightly dried, and heated in spirits of wine of
the usual strength. Absolute alcohol must not be used, since it dissolves
out the chlorophyll in such a manner that it is not carried down as
usual, when agitated with bisulphide of carbon. When cold the solu
tion should be agitated in a test-tube with so much excess of the bisul
phide that a considerable quantity subsides to the bottom, carrying with
it the whole of the orange xanthophyll* and the greater part of the blue
chlorophyll, leaving some of the latter in the alcohol along with nearly
all the fucoxanthine and chlorofucine.            This solution should then be re
moved by a pipette, and agitated with a fresh quantity of bisulphide, the
process being repeated until it subsides with only a very slight tinge of
green. The alcoholic solution, on being evaporated and treated with
bisulphide, yields approximately pure fucoxanthine. Uniting the different
lots of bisulphide containing chlorophyll, and agitating them over and
over again with fresh spirit, taking care that a small excess of bisulphide
is always present, the whole of the chlorophyll may be removed, and the
orange xanthophyll left in the final residue.            On adding a little water to
the washings     containing the chlorophyll,        the disolved bisulphide     is pre
cipitated, carrying down all the chlorophyll.            By proceeding in a similar
manner, with or without the addition of weak acids or alkalies, various
other colouring-matters found in plants may be more or less perfectly
separated.     All these processes should be carried on without exposure
to strong daylight, or else some of the constituents might be in great
measure destroyed.
                              Photochemical Analysis.
    There are many cases in which certain colouring-matters cannot be
separated in a satisfactory manner by merely chemical methods, and then
fortunately we are able to resort to what            I propose to call photochemical
analysis.    The action of light on the coloured constituents of plants was
made the subject of an excellent memoir by Herschel, published in the
 Philosophical Transactions for 1842, p. 181 ; but the object he had in
 view and the methods he employed were altogether different to mine.
 He adopted no means for separating the different constituents of the
plants,   and some of his solutions          probably    contained    as many    as ten
different coloured substances ; and, moreover, at that time no attention
had been paid to their spectra.            He exposed paper coloured with such
mixtures to the solar spectrum, so as to learn the effect of each portion ;
and his results are of great interest, as showing that the decomposition
           * The exact use of all these terms  will be explained in the sequel.

                              Mr. II. C. Sorby      on                 [June   19,
is due to the luminous      rays, which act with variable intensity in different
parts of the spectrum, according to the nature of the substance.           On the
contrary, my method of photochemical analysis consists in using either
the whole or particular rays of the sunlight passing through coloured
glasses as reagents to decompose some of the constituents of a mixed
solution,   and leave others in a state of approximate purity.            In em
ploying light for such a practical purpose, it would be almost impossible
to use a spectrum.        Without this method the study of the colouring-
matters    of plants could not     be carried out   in a successful manner.       I
have sometimes studied a substance for several weeks before            I was  able
to prove that it was a mixture by ordinary chemical methods, whereas              I
afterwards found that this could be easily proved by simply exposing the
solution to the sun.      I, however, now give only such examples as have
an important bearing on the subject before me.               For instance, in the
case  of some Ahjot   it is impossible to separate the xanthophyll from the
orange xanthophyll, and the spectrum of the mixed solution in bisulphide
of carbon gives absorption-bands           in an intermediate position, not
agreeing   with  those  characteristic  of  either one or the other.     It might
thus be imagined that these Ahjce differed entirely from allied species, in
containing a single and peculiar kind of xanthophyll instead of the usual
two, thus making an apparent complete break in what is really perfect
continuity ; but by exposing the solution to the open sun the orange
xanthophyll is so much more rapidly destroyed than the xanthophyll,
that in a while the absorption-bands of the latter are seen in their
normal    position ; and knowing this fact, and comparing the spectrum
with that of the original, it is easy to see that at first there must have
been a mixture     of the two kinds.        Of course in all such experiments
care must be used     to prevent overexposure, and the specimens should be
examined from time to time.         In most cases it is also extremely difficult
to separate yellow     xanthophyll   from lichnoxanthine    ;  but by exposure to
the sun this xanthophyll is soon decomposed, its absorption-bands             dis
appear, and the uniform absorption of the lichnoxanthine                 remains.
Solutions which originally give very different spectra can thus be proved
to be merely variable mixtures of two or more substances, each well known
in  a pure state.    There are, however, cases in which         both constituents
would    be destroyed     by exposure    to white light   ;   but one is changed
chiefly by one kind of rays, and the ether by another.              For example,
when the mixed solution in bisulphide of carbon of phycoxanthine and
orange lichnoxanthine, obtained from certain Algct and lichens, is exposed
to the open sun, the phycoxanthine is soon destroyed, but at the same
time some of the orange lichnoxanthine, and it is almost impossible to
cease exposing at the proper point ; when kept under deep green glass,
however, it is easy to decompose nearly all the phycoxanthine             without
materially diminishing the amount of the orange kelmoxanthiue.              Other

  applications    of this method      will    be  given     when      describing  special
  cases.
                                General Action    of Light.
     Independent of its value in such practical analyses, the study of the
 action of light on vegetable colouring-matters is of great interest in con
 nexion with changes that occur in the plants themselves ; but since so
  much still remains to be learned,      I  will now only give a general summary
 of what    I  have already ascertained.        As a general rule, when solutions
  of such substances     are  exposed  to  the  open sun, their colour is destroyed
 without the formation of any intermediate coloured product ; but in a
 few cases entirely different coloured compounds are generated, and after
 wards themselves destroyed on further exposure. This bleaching effect
 depends upon the combined presence of light and air ; for if kept in the
 dark, or if sealed up in tubes quite free from air, and then exposed to the
 sun, very little or no such alteration occurs. Other things being equal,
 the rate of change varies enormously according to the nature of the
 substance, and, with the same substance, varies much according to the
 solvent.
                                      Sensitizers.
    The presence of minute quantities of certain oils very greatly increases
 the rate of change in a solution exposed to the light, and it is convenient
to call this their sensitizing action. Probably in many cases it depends
 upon their ozonizing influence. Such substances occur in certain plants,
 and the result is that the effect of an equal amount of light is sometimes
increased     threefold   or even more.       If this  substance could be procured
 pure in moderate quantity it would be a            most valuable reagent, since it
 has very little or no effect on colouring-matters              unless exposed to the
                                I
 light. In the mean time have found turpentine a very useful sensitizer,
the chief objection being that it sometimes acts as an oxidizer, even in the
dark, and is too energetic, so that very little should be used. Oil of
citronelle has the most powerful reverse action of any that                   I have ex
amined, and greatly reduces the effect of light.               I  therefore often use it
to protect from change.
                  Correlation of Optical and Chemical Characters.
    We might naturally expect that those rays of light which are absorbed
most strongly would be most instrumental in effecting decomposition.
If  this be a law, it is subject to modifying conditions, not yet apparent ;
and since many of the changes do not take place without the presence of
air, they are due not to light itself alone, but to oxidization intensified by
its presence. At all events it is not merely the blue end of the spectrum
(the so called chemical rays) that act, for some substances are rapidly
destroyed in red light, as was shown by Herschel and subsequently by
Gerland*.      I have met with so many cases where a number of substances

 absorption-bands, are decomposed when exposed to the light in the                order

in which the bands lie towards the red end, that cannot but think                  there
 is some    connexion    between    these   facts.    When the      spectra are quite
 unlike  (for example when one          has  two and the other        three bands, or
 two at  a different interval,   or no bands at all) there is no such connexion.
 Those which seem to approach most closely and uniformly to the law
belong to simple groups, and give spectra more or less closely analogous,
as it were, to the same musical chord in different keys ; and this leads me
 to think  it probable that, if we had such         a perfect   series of  substances,
the rate at which they would be decomposed by the action of light would
vary directly as the length of the waves absorbed, or as would express
the facts equally well in many cases, as though the power of decom
position varied directly as the width of the spectrum over which the
absorption extends, i.e. as the number of different rays absorbed. This
would also, in great measure, correspond to what occurs when the same
substance is dissolved in liquids which cause the absorption to extend
more and more towards the red end. Whether this be a general law or
only a common fact, the results are of very great importance in connexion
with my present subject. The effect of this difference in the rate of
change will be better understood by means of the following rough illus
tration.     Suppose that there is a mixture of three analogous colouring-
matters, a, 6, andf, the absorption-bands of a being nearest to the red and
those of   c  to the blue end of the spectrum, and suppose that on exposure
to the sun, in the time required to destroy one part of c, two parts of b
and three of a are decomposed, it is obvious that the original proportion
between the different      substances would soon be very materially            changed.
This would alter the ratio in which they would be decomposed by further
action until a sort of equilibrium was established ; so that, whatever
might have been the original proportion, there would at length be a sort
of ultimate     vanishing ratio, depending on the nature of the substance
and of the solvent and on the kind of light and its intensity.               I  find this
fluxional manner of viewing such facts often very useful, and cannot but
think that it might be introduced with advantage into similar subjects.
However,     for the  sake of simplicity, supposing that the assumed rate of
decomposition      remained    constant, and adopting arbitrary units, which
only express the ratios for each substance, we should have some such
result as the following : —

                         Comparative Quantitative Analysis.
   By applying     the above-described     general methods to the study of the
mixed coloured solutions obtained from plants, there is usually no serious
difficulty in carrying out a qualitative analysis, even though, as often
happens, half a dozen or more coloured substances are present.                 It is,
however, often very desirable to determine them quantitatively ; not, indeed,
their relative weights in one case, but the relative amount of each
particular colouring-matter in different plants or in the same when
grown in different conditions — a kind of comparative quantitative
analysis. In some cases this can be done without difficulty. The various
coloured constituents can be separated with sufficient accuracy, and the
relative volumes of equally       strong   solution determined.      The most con
venient plan is to have test-tubes of the same internal diameter, and to
dilute the solution in one or in both until the intensity of the colour is
exactly the same, or, still better, until the characteristic absorption is equal,
as seen in the spectroscope, with equal illumination. The relative length
of the column in the tubes then, of course, gives the relative amount of
the particular colouring-matter.        We may also thus ascertain the relative
quantity    of  two   or  even more in the same solution, by making the re
spective bands equal, first in the case of one and then in that of the
other.    I  intend to construct a form of spectrum-microscope and pre
pare   apparatus    specially suited for accurate comparisons, which require
perfectly equal illumination ; but even those analyses which            I have been
able to make by means of my present instruments are sufficient to show
the value of such quantitative methods.             I  have hitherto chiefly com
pared   the  different   specimens  together,   but for the future  I shall prepare
suitable standard solutions, sealed up in tubes with as little air as possible,
protected by oil of citronelle ; and if it turn out that they remain un
altered by long keeping, it will thus be possible to determine the re
lative amount of the various colouring-matters in plants growing at
different   seasons   of the year.
                          Fundamental    Colouring-matters.
   Trusting     that   the above   account    will  be  sufficient to indicate   the
general characters of the methods        I have employed,     I now proceed to the
consideration     of the individual colouring-matters.           The total number
met with in plants is very great, possibly some hundreds ; but a large
proportion occur only in the petals, fruits, seeds, and roots. The study
of these will no doubt throw much light on particular questions, but

they are of far less importance in connexion with my present subject
than those which occur in the leaves of the higher or in the fronds of
the lower classes of plants.                   I
                               purpose, therefore, to confine my remarks
almost exclusively to these. Even then it is very necessary to distinguish
between those which appear to be essential for the healthy growth of each
class of plants and those which have the character of accidental products,
formed under particular conditions, and often absent, without apparently
interfering with the normal development of the plant. There is exactly
the same difference in the case of animals.      The haemoglobin of the
blood and the coloured substances in bile are of the utmost physiological
importance, whereas those in the hair and feathers are either of no im
portance whatever, or are of advantage to the animal only in some very
indirect manner.    Similarly, the colouring-matters   belonging to the
chlorophyll and xanthophyll groups appear to be        essential, whereas
those of the erythrophyll group have all the characters of products vary
ing with accidental circumstances ; and if they are of any value to the
plant, it is only indirectly, as, for instance, in attracting to the petals
insects instrumental          in causing fertilization.                   These accidental    and un
essential  colouring-matters  are often so much more conspicuous than
those of real importance, that they might easily lead any one to conclude
that the study of the colouring of plants could not lead to satisfactory
results, since very often the colour is not of value even in distinguishing
different species. It         is,
                        however, not the mere colour that   of importance,         is
but the nature and relative amount of what may be called the funda
mental colouring-matters, of which there are altogether somewhere between
a   dozen and    a   score.         For example, we often have varieties                      of   plants
which    have    red leaves        of green this

stituents of the higher    classes of plants are present in their normal
quantity, or their equilibrium only slightly modified by     corresponding         a
difference in conditions.    In those classes of plants where conspicuous
accidental colouring-matters are seldom developed (as, for instance,                                      in
the different groups of marine Algoi), the importance of the colour                                       is
universally admitted     and  ; find that when studied in accordance with

    In the Proceedings of the Eoyal Society for 1864* there is a paper by
Professor Stokes, rather more than a page long, on the supposed identity
of biliverdin with chlorophyll, with remarks on the constitution of chlo
rophyll, which, in my opinion, in the space of a few sentences contains
more valuable information on that subject than all other subsequent
papers put together.                               I
                          In this he says, " find the chlorophyll of land-
plants to be a mixture of four substances, two green and two yellow, all
possessing highly distinctive optical properties.           The green substances
yield solutions exhibiting a strong red fluorescence ; the yellow substances
do not            Green sea-weeds agree with land-plants, except as to the
relative proportions of the substances present ; but in olive-coloured sea
weeds the second green substance is replaced by a third green substance,
and the first yellow substance by a third yellow substance, to the pre
sence of which the dull colour of those plants is due."              No particulars
were given respecting the manner in which these different colouring-
matters had been separated, nor any description of their individual cha
racteristics, and this is probably the reason why these statements have
had so little influence on subsequent researches. If            I may judge from
my     own   experience,  an   experimenter might         well  have paid a great
amount of attention to the subject without being able to discover the
nature of the evidence which had led the author to adopt such conclu
sions ; and it would require a very considerable amount of independent
discovery to enable any one to appreciate their real merit. As for myself,
I  investigated the subject quite independently, and it was not until after
I  had satisfied myself as to the real facts of the case that       I compared my
results with those described by Stokes in the above-named paper, and
then saw that they corresponded in many of the most important par
ticulars, though   I have no doubt that        I  was led to them by studying a
very different class of facts.        The principal green substance of the
author   is  manifestly my    blue  chlorophyll ; his second green substance
my yellow chlorophyll, and his third green substance my chlorofucine,
whilst his third yellow substance, found in olive sea-weeds, must be my
fucoxanthine.     His other two yellow substances must, in some way or
other, represent the four yellow substances described by me as orange
xanthophyll, xanthophyll, yellow xanthophyll, and lichnoxanthine, with
perhaps a little of my orange lichnoxanthine.            It will thus be seen that
my conclusions    fully confirm what he       has said respecting   the compound

phide of carbon and insoluble in water, which agree in having absorption
at both ends of the spectrum, in having well-marked absorption-bands at
the red end, to the principal of which the strong red fluorescence is
related, and in being decomposed with greater or less facility by weak
acids into new products, giving somewhat analogous, but yet quite di
stinct spectra to those characteristic of them in their natural state. All
are rapidly decomposed in strong sunlight, when air is also present, but
not otherwise.

     I was  first led to distinguish the compound nature of the chlorophyll
in    ordinary green leaves by studying that found in Oscilhitorice, as
named in former papers.   This kind is that which occurs throughout the
whole vegetable world, and the difference consists in the usual but not
universal presence of another along with                      it,
                                            which second kind differs in
the highest and in the very lowest classes of plants. Blue chlorophyll
can be best obtained in an approximately pure state from olive Alytr,
like Fucus or Laminaria, by the method already described. Its spectrum
shows three absorption-bands at the red end, that nearest the extreme
red being     by
              far the most intense.   Unless the solution be very strong,

ciently so to enable me to determine many of its peculiarities.           The best
method of obtaining it is to boil Ulva latissima first in water and then in
spirit.     If this plant cannot be procured, the small green Algce so com
mon on damp wood and stones may be used with advantage, and need
not be boiled in water.       The deep green solution in alcohol should be
agitated with bisulphide of carbon, and a few drops of water added, if
requisite, to cause nearly all the green colouring-matter to be carried
down, and nearly all the xanthophylls to remain in solution. On removing
this and agitating the bisulphide with fresh spirit of wine of the usual
strength, taking care to have a considerable excess of the bisulphide pre
sent, a large portion of the yellow chlorophyll and some of the blue are
dissolved.     Eemoving this solution to another tube, adding a little water,
and separating the diluted alcohol, the precipitated bisulphide should be
evaporated to dryness at a gentle heat. On redissolving in benzole and
examining the spectrum of a properly diluted solution, it will be seen
that it differs in many important particulars from that of pure blue
chlorophyll. Besides bands exactly corresponding with those charac
teristic of that substance, it has an independent dark and narrow band
in the red, and another much broader in the middle of the blue, as
though the solution were a mixture of blue chlorophyll with some other
substance* —a conclusion completely borne out by further examination,
since the same blue kind as that found in olive Algce occurs almost free
from this second substance in the residue left after repeated agitation
with spirit. Taking, then, a solution in benzole of blue chlorophyll, of
such a strength that the principal absorption-band in the red may exactly
correspond with that seen in the above-named mixture, and comparing
together the spectra side by side, it is easy to see what absorption-bands
are due to the other substance. Again, since blue chlorophyll is far more
easily decomposed by weak acids than the yellow, and yields a product
very slowly decomposed by light, we may take a mixed solution in which
the blue    has undergone    this change, and, by treating it in the manner
described above, may obtain a mixture of yellow chlorophyll and the pro
duct of the action of acids on the blue. Dissolving this in benzole, and
taking a solution of the product of the action of acids on the pure blue, of
such a strength as to give the corresponding absorption-bands equal when
seen side by side, those due to the yellow chlorophyll can easily be distin
guished ; and on exposing for a while to the direct rays of the sun, these
bands disappear, whilst those due to the product of the action of acids on
the blue kind remain just as in the specimen used for comparison. By these
means     I have been able to prove that the spectrum of yellow chlorophyll
dissolved in benzole has a very dark and well-defined narrow band in the red,
further from the red end than that due to blue chlorophyll, and probably
another much fainter in the orange.             There is also a broad and strong

band in the middle of the blue       ;  the whole of the blue is  absorbed, and
not, as in the case of blue chlorophyll, a considerable portion transmitted.
The general colour is therefore such a yellow-green that the term yellow
chlorophyll seems very appropriate.         When dissolved in alcohol the prin
cipal band in the red is made about twice as broad, and half as dark, as
when in benzole or bisulphide of carbon, and can no longer be seen quite
detached and separate from that due to blue chlorophyll. especiallvif the re
lative amount of the latter be considerable, and merely causes an unsymme-
trical shading on the side towards the orange.        It is to this circumstance
in great measure that must be attributed the fact of the compound nature
of chlorophyll having been overlooked, alcohol having been so generally
used as the solvent.
                                    Chlorofucine.
    It  is some time since     I  was first led to believe that   a third kind of
colouring-matter      belonging to the chlorophyll group existed in some
freshwater Alga.       I  first obtained it separate from blue chlorophyll in
examining a complicated mixture of that and other substances obtained
by Mr. Charles Horner from an Actinia, viz. Anthea csrnit. var. tiharaj-
dina.     The special bands due to this other substance had attracted his
attention, and led him to think that the chlorophyll, as a whole, was
different to that in plants.       I   have since found that this third member
of the group is      one  of the fundamental constituents of Fucus and other
olive Alger, and have therefore named it chlorafurine.        In order to obtain
it approximately pure, the fresh fronds should be crushed in a mortar
and slightly dried, so that on adding ordinary spirit of wine too much
water may not be present.         For the same reason the solution should be
 kept covered up at a gentle heat, and not boiled.            On agitating with
 repeated quantities of bisulphide of carbon, the whole of the blue chlo
 rophyll may be removed, and the alcoholic solution then contains much
 fucoxanthine     and the chlorofucine, showing two well-marked absorption-
 bands, one between the red and the orange and the other in the yellow.
 On adding water and agitating with more bisulphide, both these sub
 stances are carried down ; and on evaporating the mixed solution. tlie
 chlorofucine    is often partially lost by decomposition in some unknown
 way.     To prepare it free from fucoxanthine, the above-named alcoholic
 solution should be diluted with an equal bulk of water, a drop or twoot
 ammonia added, and agitated over and over again with fresh bisulphide,
  until it subsides to the bottom almost colourless.        By thus adding am
 monia the chlorofucine is retained in solution, and the whole of the
 fucoxanthine is carried down in the bisulphide.            The dilute alcoholic
 solution   is then of  a pale green colour, and contains chlorofucine mixed
  with a yellow substance soluble in water. On evaporating to small bulk
  at a gentle heat, the loss of alcohol causes impure chlorofucine to be
 deposited ; and after transferring to a narrow tube, allowing it to sub
 side, and removing the yellow aqueous solution, almost pure ehloroto*'

can be     dissolved out from the deposit by means of absolute alcohol : at
all   events it is free from chlorophyll, and perhaps only contains a small
quantity of the pale yellow substance. The colour of this solution is a
yellow-green, very much like that of a crude solution from green leaves.
The      spectrum    shows two dark absorption-bands,           one  between the red
and the orange, and another between the orange and the yellow. The
 whole of the green is transmitted, but the whole of the blue cut off ; and
 when the solution is dilute, a broad and somewhat obscure band may be
 seen in the centre of the blue, if excellent daylight is used. The addition
 of a little    ammonia slightly increases the intensity of the band nearest
 the red end. When thus modified by dilute alkalies, chlorofucine is very
 sparingly, if at all, soluble in bisulphide of carbon. Excess of hydro
 chloric acid causes immediate decomposition into a new compound, with
 a single absorption-band in the orange. Weak acids slowly produce the
 same effect ; and it is important to bear this in mind, since this product
 of the action of acids, and not the original substance, is met with in
 studying certain plants.
     The difference between the spectra of the above-named three green
 substances will be better understood by means of the following figure,
 which represents the absorption-bands as seen in solutions diluted so as
 to show those at the blue          end, and only the darkest       and most charac
  teristic of those in the red.

     The position of the narrow bright red bands scon in the spectra of the
  light of fluorescence of these three members of the chlorophyll group
  differs even more than that of the absorption-bands, since in the case of
  chlorofucine the bright orange-red band almost coincides with the dark
   band of absorption, whereas in the case of both blue and yellow chloro
   phyll the more red bands lie just on the red side of the centre of their
   absorption-bands.        The result is that the three different narrow red
   bands characteristic of the light of fluorescence of the three different

substances have their centres nearly at equal intervals.           All three kinds
are so rapidly decomposed by strong direct sunlight, that the study of
their fluorescence is a matter of some difficulty. Whilst thus alluding to
this subject,   I  would take the opportunity of describing a method which
I   have found extremely convenient in deciding whether a substance pos
 sesses genuine fluorescence, or whether it is spurious and due to the
 presence of solid particles so minute that the solution may appear quite
 clear and transparent.      I illuminate by means of light which has passed
 through   a solution    of sulphate of didymium.        If, then, there be only a
 spurious fluorescence, the spectrum shows all the absorption-bands of the
 didymium — in fact we obtain merely a spectrum of that body modified
 by reflection ; whereas if it be a true and pure fluorescence, no trace of
 the bands of didymium can be seen.           If there be a genuine fluorescence
 along with some reflected light, a more or less faint spectrum of didy
 mium will be visible due to this spurious light, with a brighter part            due
 to the genuine fluorescence.
                    Action of Acids on  the  Chlorophyll   Group.
    As previously mentioned, all the above-named members of the chloro
phyll group are decomposed with greater or less facility by acids. Each
gives rise to an independent product ; so that, though they have many
generic peculiarities in common, they must be regarded as well-marked
species,  and not in any way as mere accidental modifications             of a single
substance.
                                Xantlwphyll Group.
    A considerable number of different colouring-matters might be classed
with this group, but on the present occasion         I  purpose to consider only
the six most commonly met with in leaves or fronds or in fungi. They
are characterized by being insoluble in water, but soluble in bisulphide
of carbon and fixed oils, and by giving spectra with two more or less
well-marked absorption-bands, varying in position with the particular
substance, and very considerably         raised towards     the blue end     when a
liquid of great band-raising power is used as a solvent. When the solu
tion is strong, the whole of the blue end is absorbed up to these bands.
Sometimes three absorption-bands may be seen ; but in that case it is
generally easy to prove, either by chemical or photochemical methods,
that the third band is due to a second substance. Weak acids or alkalies
have no immediate effect in altering the position of the bands; but when
dissolved in absolute alcohol all the members of the group are slowly
decomposed by a little hydrochloric acid, gradually fading to a colourless
solution, even in the dark.        The rate at which this takes place and the
production    of  intermediate coloured products depend to some small ex
tent on the presence of air, but still more on the presence of minute
quantities of sensitizing substances.         The nature of this action is still

 1873.]            Comparative Vegetable Chromatology           .            457
rather obscure ; but a further study of it seems likely to throw light on
the cause of the production of some of the colouring-matters           found in
particular plants.    When such a sensitizing substance is absent, so that
the alteration takes place too slowly, a little turpentine is an excellent
substitute.    The changes which occur vary according to the particular
species of the group, and thus furnish a valuable means for distin
guishing them, or for recognizing small quantities of some when mixed
with others.
                         ,        Pliycoxanthine.
    This name was first proposed by Kraus* for a substance he obtained
from Oscillatorice ; but there is no doubt whatever that his preparation
was a mixture of two or three distinct kinds of colouring-matters, which
can easily be separated, and do occur separately in other plants.           That
for which   I adopt the name may be obtained in the most pure state from
the lichen Peltigera canina when growing in a very damp and shady
place, or from some species of Oscillatorice when growing quite open to
the sun.     The various coloured substances should be dissolved out by
hot spirit, and the solution when cold diluted, if requisite, with a little
water, and agitated over and over again with fresh quantities of bisul
phide of carbon until it subsides tinged only a pale pink. By this
means almost the whole of the other colouring-matters are carried down,
with the exception of the lichnoxanthines.              On evaporating the alco
holic solution and redissolving in bisulphide of carbon, a red solution is
obtained, which, when more dilute, is a fine pink, and gives a spectrum
with two excellent absorption-bands in the green. When it is dissolved
in absolute alcohol these bands lie much further from the red end, and
the colour is sufficiently yellow to justify the name pliycoxanthine, or, at
all events, to make it undesirable to introduce another.            On adding a
little hydrochloric acid and turpentine, the colour gradually fades, with
out the production of any well-marked intermediate coloured substance.
I   am much inclined    to believe that this phycoxanthine        may be formed
from orange xanthophyll, both artificially and naturally ; but since this
change occurs only in very rare and special cases, it probably depends
 on the presence of some sensitizing substance, only occasionally present
or under conditions not yet understood.
                                 Peziza Xanthine.
    This is the name     I  propose for an orange-yellow colouring-matter
found in Peziza aurantia and some other fungi.              It resembles phyco
xanthine in many particulars, but differs in the position of the absorption-
bands, which lie further from the red end.

 ing-matters,    since it occurs in greater or less quantity in all classes of
  plants, including fungi. It may be obtained in its most pure state from
 the orange-coloured antherozoids of Fucus serratus in spring, which exude
 from    the antheridia when the fronds are kept damp. These may be
 washed off the fronds into water and separated by filtering, after any coarser
 particles have subsided. The colouring-matters should then be dissolved
 out in hot strong alcohol, and the clear solution agitated with bisulphide
 of carbon. This carries down the orange xanthophyll, which may be
 somewhat further purified by repeated agitation with fresh alcohol. It
 may also be obtained from Pdtujera canina or from Oseillatoria grown in
 bright light by a similar process ; but in that case, in order to separate
 the chlorophyll, it is requisite to agitate very many times with fresh
 spirit and repeated additions of bisulphide of carbon, so as always to
 leave only a small quantity undissolved.        The success of this method
 depends upon the fact that, unless the relative amount of the orange
 xanthophyll be too great, the whole is carried down in the bisulphide of
 carbon, when agitated with spirit of the usual strength. The amount
 present in the leaves of the higher classes of plants is smaller than in
 those just named ; but by following the same process a final residue of
 orange-colour      may be obtained, which, however, is seldom free from
impurities.     When pure and dissolved in bisulphide of carbon, the colour
is a slightly pink-orange, and the spectrum shows two obscure absorp
tion-bands     in the blue end of the green and green end of the blue.
These lie much further from the red end when it is dissolved in absolute
alcohol ; and on adding a little hydrochloric acid and turpentine it gra
dually becomes colourless, sometimes turning slightly green ; but this is
probably due to the presence of another substance — generally to a trace
of yellow xanthophyll.
                                   Xantlwphyll.
    I propose to restrict this name, as applied to an individual substance,
to the principal constituent of the mixture which has usually been so
called.    This generally, if not always, must have been mixed with my
yellow    xanthophyll and lichnoxanthine.       Xanthophyll, as the term is
applied by me, may be obtained in the most pure state from Porphura
vulgaris, by heating in spirit, removing the blue chlorophyll by agitation
w ith bisulphide of carbon, and then adding water to the alcoholic solu
tion, which precipitates the bisulphide along with the xanthophyll.        The
solution in bisulphide of carbon is of a slightly orange-yellow         colour,
and gives a spectrum w ith two absorption-bands between the green and
the blue. When dissolved in absolute alcohol they lie at the green end
of the blue ; and on adding a little hydrochloric acid and turpentine the
colour gradually disappears, without the production of any new inter
mediate coloured substance, or only such a faint tinge of green as is
probably due to impurity. Xanthophyll may also be procured from
dark-coloured varieties of Wallflowers
                                          (C/mraiithus cheiri), and with more

difficulty from green or yellow leaves ; but being then mixed with yellow
xanthophyll, it is almost impossible to obtain it pure, and it therefore
turns green when treated with hydrochloric acid and turpentine.                   If no
sensitizer   be present, such mixtures      may change so slowly that the blue
product may fade as fast as it is formed, and never be very visible.
                                Yellow Xantliophyll.
    This may be obtained in its most pure state from different kinds of
bright yellow flowers, as, for instance, the yellow Chrysanthemum.
When dissolved in bisulphide of carbon it is of a clear lemon-yellow
colour, differing most decidedly from that of xanthophyll properly so
called.    The spectrum shows two very distinct absorption-bands in the
green end of the blue : these lie still further within the blue when
absolute alcohol is used as the solvent, and, on adding a little hydro
chloric acid, the yellow xanthophyll is decomposed, first into a new and
paler yellow substance*, with the absorption-bands at a different interval
and more towards the blue end, and afterwards into a fine deep blue
colouring-matter, which will be more fully described further on. Yellow
xanthophyll may be obtained in an impure state from ordinary green
leaves, by first removing the chlorophyll and then adding successive
small quantities of water, agitating with bisulphide of carbon after each
addition, and keeping separate each quantity thus carried down.                     The
first contains much xanthophyll and a little yellow xanthophyll, and each
 subsequent quantity contains less of one and more of the other, as may
 be proved by both chemical and photochemical               methods, or by the posi
tion of the absorption-bands,       until, towards the last, the yellow xantho
phyll greatly preponderates,         mixed,     however,     with so   much     lichno-
xanthine    that the absorption-bands         seen    in its spectrum are far less
distinct than when it is prepared from the petals of such flowers as                    I
have named.        On treating the solution in absolute alcohol with hydro
chloric acid, though it turns to a blue-green, a residual yellow colour
(liehnoxanthine) remains when the blue has faded, which is not the case
 when pure.      If  the leaves have an acid juice, the last residue consists,
 not of yellow xanthophyll, but of the above-named yellow product of the
 action upon it of weak acids.

 exposing to the open sun, that which has its absorption extending over

 is destroyed more rapidly than the one of which the absorption extends
 over a less space, and the absorption-bands lie nearer to the blue end.
 If  any contiguous two species be mixed, the rate at which they are de
 composed differs so little that very much of both must be destroyed
  before the one whose absorption lies the nearer to the blue end is left

almost free from the other. On the contrary, when we have a mixture
of two more extreme, a very considerable quantity of one is left when
the other has disappeared.

between the rate of decomposition and the absorption of light turn out to

                                     be an additional

the loss of the energy in decomposing the chlorophyll of those rays of
light which, in its absence, would have been instrumental in decom
posing the phycoxanthine, or whether

branch of inquiry, which can hardly fail to be of value in explaining the

 added  to the alcoholic solution, and the whole diluted with an                equal bulk
 of water. The bisulphide of carbon        then precipitated with
                                                        is                      almost all
 the fucoxanthine,  whilst  nearly the whole  of the chlorofucine               remains in
 the dilute alcohol. As thus purified, fucoxanthine dissolved in bisulphide
 of carbon      of
                is   beautiful amber colour, and its spectrum shows two
                          a
 obscure absorption-bands, the position being intermediate between those
 of orange xanthophyll and xanthophyll, so that     mixture of these gives

 nearly the same spectrum. The difference, however,     completely provedis
 by  other facts.  The  bands  of fucoxanthine  are  much   less raised by
 alcohol and other liquids of high band-raising                    power than the bands of

 those two kinds      of xanthophyll, and it resists the action ot light far
 more than they do.       A mixture of pure orange xanthophyll and xautbo-
 phyll in absolute alcohol treated with hydrochloric          acid would,  at the
 most, give only a pale green, whereas fucoxanthine is changed into a
 splendid blue substance, and subsequently into a sort of claret-coloured,
 before finally and slowly fading.         Though the spectra of fucoxanthine
 and yellow xanthophyll are essentially different, yet this blue product is
 the same.     It absorbs the whole of the red end of the spectrum, not
 transmitting even the extreme red        ; and on adding an excess of ammonia
 this absorption is entirely removed, and the colour is changed to a bright
 yellow. The spectrum then shows a well-marked absorption-band at the
 violet end of the blue.     On adding excess of hydrochloric acid, the ori
 ginal  blue colour  is restored  ; and hence     this substance has the unusual
 peculiarity of being made blue by acids and yellow by alkalies. Hitherto
 I have never met with it in plants themselves.           Taking every thing into
consideration,     we must look upon fucoxanthine as closely related             to
xanthophyll     ; but at the same time the different effect of solvents          in
raising the absorption-bands, and the greater permanence when exposed
 to light, may perhaps make it desirable to class it in a subgroup.            The
dull olive colour of those Algce in which it occurs so            abundantly  (the
 Melanosperma) is apparently mainly due to it in a free state, not dissolved
in any oil. On comparing the spectrum of the light transmitted by a
frond in its natural condition with that of the light transmitted by a
portion which has been boiled for a short time in water until the colour
has changed to green, it may be seen that the absorption due to the
fucoxanthine is considerably raised, just as if at that high temperature
it were attacked and dissolved by the oil present in the plant.
                              Lichnoxanthine     Group.
    This is a name which       I propose for a number of colouring-matters
found in a great variety of plants.          Two are more especially abundant
in fungi ; but since they occur in a more marked manner in lichens
than in any other plants      having true leaves or fronds,     it appears  to me
desirable to adopt the name Udmoxanthine rather than funr/oj-anthuu,
which perhaps may be found convenient for some of the substances found
more especially in fungi.       So far  I   have met with three different kinds
of lichnoxanthine     in the  leaves  and fronds of plants.      They are all   in
soluble in water,      and soluble in bisulphide       of carbon, but have a    far
greater tendency to dissolve in alcohol ; and in some cases easilv pass
into   a modification which is insoluble in the bisulphide, and yet readily
dissolved by absolute alcohol.       The spectra do not show any well-marked
absorption-bands,     but merely   a general absorption, extending more or less
from the blue end, according to the particular species, and very little if
at all modified by the addition of weak alkalies or acids.           All are of a
much more permanent character than the different kinds of xanthophWJ,

reaisting the action of light and acids so well that they are very often
obtained as residues when all the colouring-matters of that group have
been decomposed. They, however, do ultimately fade. It is not yet cer
tain whether these substanc ee are essential for the growth even of lichens,
or only constant products.

    This particular species occurs in many fungi, but have more especially
studied it as obtained from lichens.       PeUigera canina, growing well
exposed to the sun, should be crushed and heated in spirit.          After
separating the whole of the chlorophyll in the manner already described,
the alcoholic solution should be evaporated to dryness, and the lichno
xanthine and the phycoxanthine dissolved out by bisulphide of carbon.
On exposing this to the sun under green glass until the pink tinge is lost
and the absorption-bands of the phycoxanthine have disappeared, the
lichnoxanthine remains of an orange colour. Its spectrum, when the
solution is sufficiently strong, shows absorption of the whole of the blue
and green, gradually shading off to about the end of the yellow.      The
modification soluble only in alcohol may be obtained from Platysma
glaucum and many other lichens by agitating the alcoholic solution with
bisulphide of carbon, and then diluting the alcohol with water, so that all
the substances soluble in the bisulphide may be carried down in          all it,
soluble in water remain dissolved, and the modified orange lichnoxanthine
may be deposited in     free state, and, after separation, dissolved in ab

solute alcohol.

  This   is   the most common member of the group, and          is   so widely dis
tributed that    occurs in almost all plants, though sometimes in very

prepared from the root of the carrot by dissolving out the colour in spirit,
and agitating with bisulphide of carbon to remove the orange xanthophyll
and the greater part of the xanthophyll.     On evaporating the alcoholic
solution to dryness bisulphide of carbon dissolves the lichnoxanthine
along with   good deal of xanthophyll and yellow xanthophyll

exposing the solution   to the sun, those two colouring-matters  may be
destroyed, and the lichnoxanthine left alone.  When pure and dissolved

of the blue, and ending suddenly about the centre of the green.               It   is
so difficult to separate this lichnoxanthine, properly so called, from orange
lichnoxanthine, that    Ishall frequently call the mixture the lidmoxanthiius,
without attempting to give them alone.

                                Yellow Liehnoxanthine.
    I have  adopted this name for a substance very similar to that just
described, but giving a spectrum in which the absorption does not ex
tend so far from the blue end, so that the colour is a more pure yellow.
It is best obtained from Parmelia (Physcia) petrietina by the same pro
cess as that   just described.
                                   Phyeoeyan Group.
    I have described the two principal species of this group in former
papers*, and will therefore only briefly allude to a few character*.
Phycoeyan gives a spectrum with a well-marked absorption-band in the
orange, and has a very intense red fluorescence, due to a narrow red
band.   Pink phycoeyan gives       a similar kind of spectrum, only the principal
absorption-band     lies  between    the yellow and the green. It, too, is highly
fluorescent, but the light of fluorescence is orange, due to a much
broader band. These two mixed together constitute Cohn's phyeoeyan.
Both are soluble in water, but exist in the plants in a solid form or con
centrated solution,       as shown by the position of the absorption-bands,
which lie considerably nearer to the red end than when the corre
sponding substances are dissolved in water.
                                Phycoerythrine Group.
    This is the name     I propose to adopt     for two colouring-matters found in
Alger, described by me       in  a  former paper t- One is pink, giving a spec
trum with an absorption-band at the yellow end of the green, and the
other is red, the spectrum showing a band at the blue end of the green.
I  therefore call one pink phyeoerythrine and the other red phyeoerythriw.
Neither are fluorescent, and both are soluble in water.
                                 Erythrophyll Group.
    This is the name    I have applied      to a large number of colouring-matters,
soluble in water and insoluble in bisulphide of carbon, found in the leaves
and petals of plants.        I shall not now attempt to describe them in detail,
but refer to my former papers for a further but yet very imperfect ac
count of their peculiarities:}:.        They do not appear to be essential con
stituents of leaves, but rather products formed under particular conditions.
Much remains to be learned respecting the different kinds ; for though
an accidental constituent, there are important differences between those

substances included in the group are all soluble in water, and of a more
or less pale yellow colour ; they are very slowly changed by the action of
light. The connexion between them and the different classes of plants is
still very obscure. They are interesting chiefly in connexion with the
production of the tints of autumnal foliage,           some  of which     are due to
their oxidization.

connexion with the present subject, now proceed to the consideration of
their distribution. The individual species are the elementary coloured
 constituents     which    exist in some and are absent from other plants, or
occur in    a very different     proportion, according to the kind of plant or
 the conditions     in which it grows. In my opinion it is only by a careful
 qualitative and quantitative determination of the coloured constituents
 that we can arrive at any satisfactory conclusions respecting them.            Mere
 general    colour   is altogether deceptive   : it might lead us   to conclude  that
 there was a complete difference in the colouring-matter, when there is
 merely a difference in the relative amount of the same substances ; whilst,
 at the same time, it might appear to indicate that two cases were alike,
  when they really differ in most essential particulars.          On the contrary,
 by such a method of qualitative and quantitative analysis the exact
 differences and the exact character of the connexion may be seen at a
 glance ; and    I  cannot but think that by carrying out such principles our
 knowledge     of  certain  questions connected with plants will be very greatly
 extended.      The whole subject, however, is in its infancy       ; very much re
 mains to be learned respecting nearly every thing connected with it ; and
         I
 what now describe must be looked upon as very little more than a few
 general conclusions, which appear to follow from what is already known.
 One may fully expect that further research will much modify the ex
 planations which now seem the most plausible ; but it appears to me un
 desirable not to point out the general bearings of what is known, merely
 because they may be modified, or even disproved, by what is still un
 known, since a mass of unconnected facts would be of very little interest.
     The subject of comparative vegetable chromatology may be divided
 into two parts, viz. — first, that in which different specimens of the same
  plant growing in different conditions are compared, in order to learn the
  effects due to external agencies ; and, secondly, that in which different
  plants growing in similar conditions are compared, in order to ascertain
  the effects due to internal organization.

 46G                            Mr. H. C. Sorby      on                [June   19,
          Comparison of    the same  Plants growing in different conditions.
    There are many facts connected with the colouring of plants which
 appear to be almost or quite unintelligible, if we suppose that the
 colouring-matters       when once formed undergo no immediate further
 change : for example, if we suppose that the chlorophyll is formed in
 the young leaves in spring, and remains permanent until they fade in
 autumn.       If,  on the contrary,     we assume as an hypothesis that the
 various colouring-matters        (or at least some of them) are in a state of
 constant change, we can readily explain many striking facts. Whatever
 may be the ultimate conclusion,        I shall therefore discuss my subject in
 accordance with the hypothesis that the colouring-matters are being more
 or less constantly formed by the internal constructive energy of the
 plants, and decomposed by the destructive action of the oxygen of the
 air, intensified by the presence of light ; and that the condition of each
 particular part of a plant, at all seasons of the year and under different
circumstances, depends upon and expresses the temporary or more per
 manent equilibrium between these two opposing forces, both of which
may vary very considerably.           By means of such an hypothesis it is pos
sible to employ accurate physical methods in the study of vegetable
physiology ; and since the laws which regulate the destructive force may
be determined by experimenting           with dead matter, we may       learn what
does and what does        not depend on life, and thus be     in a better position
to understand its essential nature.
    According, then, to these principles we may expect to find in plants
variations depending on a change in the constructive force, as well as
others due to variations in the amount of light to which they are
exposed.
                           Action  of Light on Chlorophyll.
    When    a solution    of chlorophyll is exposed to the sun and air it is
decomposed, the rate of change and the character of the result varying
much according to the solvent, and also depending on the presence of
minute quantities of sensitizing or protecting oils.          When dissolved in
benzole or absolute alcohol, and protected by oil of citronelle, the chloro
phyll slowly disappears, and very little of a red colouring-matter is
formed, or, if it be formed, it is destroyed nearly as quickly, not accumu
lating so as to become conspicuous.          On the contrary, when the chloro
phyll   is dissolved   in bisulphide   of carbon,  the change is far more rapid,
and several different crimson         and red substances are formed, the      pro
duction of each particular kind depending on a variety of conditions not
yet completely understood ; and this makes it still uncertain whether
some    are exclusively     or only mainly due to the blue, and some to the
yellow chlorophyll.         Since these red substances are destroyed by the
action   of  the   blue rays, they are obtained to greater advantage by expo
sing to red light, which acts upon the chlorophyll, but not on these pro-

ducts. It thus appears that chlorophyll is in the first instance decom
posed by light into various coloured compounds, which become colourless
on further exposure, and that these may be developed so as to be very
conspicuous or scarcely visible, according to particular conditions.
                            Production of Red Leaves.
    The red substances thus formed artificially differ from those met with
in plants in being soluble in bisulphide of carbon, and more rapidly
destroyed by the action of light ; but yet it appears to me extremely pro
bable that those often found in leaves are products formed by the action
of light on chlorophyll, under conditions which have not been reproduced
artificially. At all events, by adopting this hypothesis, the changes that
occur in many leaves at different seasons of the year admit of very
 simple explanation.      I  have constantly noticed that the leaves of some
 plants are more especially subject to this disappearance of chlorophyll
 and formation of erythrophyll when the twig on which they grow is
 partially broken, or when the leaf is actually severed from the plant, but
 remains in a damp place, so as not to actually wither, especially when
 the underside is exposed to the light. The change is also often depen
 dent on the presence of parasitic fungi or insects, and often takes place
 along the dying edge of a leaf, where it is not actually dead, but, so to
 speak, only half alive ; and hence there seems to be no doubt that one
 essential condition is that the leaf should be in a state of low vitality. It
 also depends upon the presence of light ; for if a leaf that seems likely
 to change be partially covered with some opaque substance, that part
 will remain green when the rest        has turned red.      Such rough natural
 photographs    are often  found   where  one leaf  has partially shaded another.
 This explanation of the facts agrees very well with what occurs at
 different seasons of the year.      The leaves of some plants are almost per
 fectly green in summer, but as winter approaches they turn more or
 less red, and on the return of spring these self-same leaves lose their
 red colour and become green.         From this   I  should draw the very simple
 and probable conclusion, that as the temperature falls the equilibrium
 between the constructive and destructive agencies is so much modified by
 the reduction of vital activity, that the amount of chlorophyll formed is
 relatively less than that of the red substance, whereas at a more favour
 able season  of the year more of the chlorophyll and less of the red are
 produced, and the leaves again become green.            On this principle it is
 also easy to understand the        reason  of  the   distribution  of red colour
 in different parts of the same plant —as, for instance, only in the tips of
 the leaves or in the leaf-stalks, and in those parts well exposed to the
 sun.    According to   these   views of the subject, permanent red varieties
 of plants are due to a similar difference in the equilibrium, sometimes
 greatly modified by the conditions in which they grow, the development
 of the erythrophyll being also generally dependent on exposure to light.

     The fact of some kinds of leaves never turning red is analogous to                     what
     occurs in the case of particular solutions of chlorophyll. It is not                   at all
     improbable that in some cases certain            kinds    of erythrophyll        may be
     formed independent of chlorophyll.
                 Waste ami supply    of   the   Colouring-matters   in Plants.
        As is well known, when plants grow in the dark very little or no chlo
     rophyll and other colouring-matters are formed ; they are, as it is said.
     blandied.    Hence it appears that the production of such substances is
     some direct function of the action of light.   At the same time chlorophyll
     when in solution     is very rapidly decomposed by light, and the other
     colouring-matters are similarly affected, but in less and varying degree.
     The power with which they resist decomposition when in living plant*
    is very remarkable, and may in part be due to their not being in solution,
    and to the unknown force which               I
                                              have called constructive energy;
    but it appears to me very difficult or impossible to explain many facts,
    unless we suppose that light does to some extent exert this decomposing
    action on the colouring-matters,      even when they exist in the leaves.
    Perhaps, indeed, it may be one of the most important changes that take
    place in them, and quite essential to plant life. It may seem strange
    to suppose that any thing can be formed by the action of light and also
    decomposed by        but this corresponds with what does certainly occur
                         it,                                                                    in
    artificial experiments.    The red substances formed from chlorophyll                       by
    the action of light are themselves afterwards decomposed                as   by   it,       I
    have already described and ;      ifwe suppose that chlorophyll and other
    colouring-matters    are in some  way or other formed through the agency

    subject seems justified by such an experiment as the following                          :   I
    selected two perfectly similar and contiguous leaves, nearly a year old,
    growing in the month of May on the outside of an Acnba jaixmita.
    where much exposed to the sun, and covered part of one with black cloth.
    After only week the part of the leaf thus covered up and protected
                 a
    from the light had become most decidedly greener, and after three weeks
    itwas moderately deep green whereas the part of the same leaf exposed
             a                        ;

    of the other leaf which had not been covered up, the Hue of jiuioh'on

being sharply defined.     I then took exactly equal quantities of the part
thus covered up and of the corresponding leaf which had remained the
whole time exposed to the light, and determined the relative quantities
of the chlorophylls, of the xanthophylls, and of a yellow colouring-matter
soluble in water, by the quantitative methods already explained. Taking
the amount of each at 100 for the leaf left in its natural exposed state,
the relative quantities in that kept shaded were as follows : —
                                      Chlorophylls.   Xanthophylls.  Soluble in aq.
      Natural state                        100            100            100
      Shaded for three weeks               150             75            200
   Here, then, we see that the chlorophyll had increased 50 per cent.»
which is an increase of above 2 per cent. per diem ; and this, be it
remembered, in a leaf nearly a year old.         The increase in the yellow
colour soluble in water was still greater, whereas the xanthophyll had
diminished. This alteration may be greater than common, because                   I
selected the plant on account of its being unusually sensitive to the
action of light. Shading a leaf in the manner described above is of
course quite a different thing to so smothering up an entire plant as to
cause it to become sickly and fade, or to preventing the development of
young leaves by keeping them in the dark. It seems to me that such a
striking difference, about which there could be no doubt, must prove
either that the absence of light is favourable to the development of chlo
rophyll, which would scarcely agree with other well-known facts, or else
that the increase in its amount does in some measure indicate the quantity
formed also in the other, but decomposed in the same interval by exposure
to the sun. At all events the facts seem to prove that the equilibrium
between the different constituents of leaves can soon be changed by
altered conditions,   as though,  like the bodies of animals, the apparent
permanence were only an approximately uniform equilibrium between
construction and decomposition, the actual chemical changes being of
course entirely different in the two cases.   We may very well believe that
the old and effete colouring-matters      are thus destroyed, and that the
result of this constant change is that the endochrome in the leaves is
always in a young and vigorous condition.         I  use this term endochrome
to signify any kind of mixed colouring-matter       found in the cells.
                  Various comparative quantitative analyses.
   This change of equilibrium is fully established by a comparison of
leaves grown under different circumstances.            The exterior leaves of
Acuha japonica, on the south side, where fully exposed to the sun, are
usually very much dappled with yellow patches almost free from chloro
phyll, and even the green parts themselves are pale ; whereas the leaves in
the interior of the plant, where much shaded, have very few or none of
the yellow patches, and are of a dark green.          There is  a similar   differ-

                 Change in Equilibrium due       to the  Action of Light.
     The principal conclusions to be drawn from the above facts are, that
 leaves exposed to the sun contain nearly (or, at all events, more nearly)
 the same quantity of the colouring-matters least changed by the action
 of light as those grown in the shade, but that when grown in the sun
 those substances which are more and more readily decomposed by the
 action of light are more and more reduced in amount in the same order.
 This difference in the equilibrium could be imitated artificially by so con
 triving that a certain quantity of each colouring-matter should be added
 at a uniform rate to a solution exposed to the sun. In that case the
 relative proportion in which they would remain would depend on the rate
 at which they were introduced and the intensity of the action of the
 light. Thus, making use of the same sort of rough illustration as that
 already adopted, we might have; —
       Added in a given time                                     10a + 105+10tf

    In   the   above illustration the amount supposed to be added at a
uniform     rate of course represents the quantity of each colouring-matter
 formed in the leaves in the time required to produce the corresponding
 decomposition.      The results correspond so well that it seems to me a
 good provisional hypothesis ; and the facts are of much interest, as
showing that very important changes occur in living plants in accordance
with the same laws as regulate the changes in the same colouring-matters
when treated as simple dead compounds in experiment tubes.

    I now proceed     to a more complicated        case.   The fronds of Peltigera
canina contain      at least seven different       colouring-matters ; but in my
analyses    I did not attempt to distinguish the two kinds of lichnoxanthine,
and   therefore   give them as united.       The apothecia are coloured by these
latter substances, with little or no trace of any others. The results of

  which of course was separated.

     On comparing these together it will be seen that the specimen with
  such abundant fructification (II.) contained the maximum, or nearly the
  maximum, quantity of all the different colouring-matters,                 as though the
  amount of light were just that best suited for its growth. The specimen
  in extreme shade (I.) shows a remarkable falling off in some of the con
  stituents, as if the plant were in a sickly state ; and the small amount of
  the lichnoxanthines is particularly interesting, because they are the speeiil
   colouring-matters of the fructification, which in this specimen was not
   developed, perhaps for that very reason.                 The difference in the pro
  portion    of   the   other  substances     in the  specimens more and more ex
   posed to the sun (III., IV. & V.) is in strict accordance with the lawsalread;
   explained, and the reduction in the amount of chlorophyll is most re
   markable.       The lichnoxanthines, however, do not follow that law, but
   seem more connected with the presence or absence of fructification.                    In
   reference to this       question   I  may mention that, as before           named, the
   antherozoids      of Fuctis serratus are exclusively, or almost             exclusively,
   coloured by orange xanthophyll, which occurs only in small quantity in
   the fronds themselves.         Taking two portions of the plant, one from the
   lower part of a frond bearing many well-developed antheridia, and the
   other from a similar part of a frond of the same specimen with w
   antheridia,     I  found that the amount of orange xanthophyll was about
   40 per cent. less in the former, as though this substance had been tot
   considerable extent drawn off from the frond to supply the antherowds.

 There is a decided indication of the       same fact  in the  case  of the lichno-
 xanthine   in Peltigera, but scarcely sufficient to prove it conclusively.
    The above examples must be looked upon merely as indications of
 what may be done ; but they will,        I trust, be sufficient to show that the
 study of the relative amount of the various colouring-matters found in
 the same plant, under different conditions, is likely to throw much light
 on certain questions connected with vegetable physiology.

and to ascertain the laws regulating the distribution of some of the colour
less constituents of plants, though that would require entirely different

methods of study. Residing, as do, inland has increased my difficulties,
      I                                        I
and have been obliged to rely on what could learn during a temporary
residence in Devonshire, and from material subsequently sent to me by
Dr. Baker of Dawlish, Mr. Charles Horner of Mortlake, and other kind
friends. At the same time, being able to spend several hours every day
in the open country, at all seasons of the year, has been of great value
in studying other parts of my subject.
   In   the present state of the question there is some difficulty in deciding
what general principles should be adopted in attemptiug to arrange the
various classes in a natural order, in accordance with the nature or re
lative amount of the colouring-matters.             For example, whether they
should be arranged in a single linear series, or in two or more parallel or
divergent groups. This difficulty is partly due to the existence of sudden
gaps, not yet filled up by intermediate examples, so that the true con
nexion is not quite apparent.        I  have constructed a table, representing
                               I
what is so far known ; but think it better not to publish it until more
complete   — only to describe    some    of the principal conclusions      deduced
from it.

   Perhaps cannot choose a better illustration than that furnished by
the different groups of Algce — the olive, the red, and the green. They
contain at least twelve different colouring-matters,             distributed   very
differently, in such a manner as to connect, and yet to distinguish, the
different groups very characteristically.        I  have not yet made any ac

of the various substances by the following signs : —

    On inspecting this Table it will     be seen that the olive Alga are charac
terized by the relatively large      amount   of chlorofucine and fueoxanthine,
and the total absence of yellow chlorophyll, of xanthophyll, and of yellow
xanthophyll.     The red are especially distinguished by the colouring-matters
 of the phycocyan and phycoerythrine groups, but also differ from the olive
in containing xanthophyll and very little chlorofucine and fucoxanthine.
The green are characterized by the presence of yellow chlorophyll and
yellow xanthophyll, as well as by the absence of chlorofucine, fueoxanthine,
and the substances soluble in water, so characteristic of the red group.
Blue chlorophyll, orange xanthophyll, and the lichnoxanthines are com
 mon to all.     It will also be seen that the red group is intermediate
 between the olive and the green, and, independent of the red colouring-
 matters, it differs from each of the other groups far less than they do
 from   one another.    It  is also still more closely connected with each by
 other examples.     My    endeavour has been to extend such a method of
 comparison to all the leading classes of plants and to some of the lower
 classes of animals, and to ascertain the order in which they should be
 arranged, so as, in like manner, to show the most gradual and unbroken
 passage from one to the other.
           Connexion  between   the lowest classes of Animals and Plants.
    Comparing these various groups of Alga with other classes of            plant?,
 and with such low classes of animals as Actinia,         I  found that the  whole
 of the colouring-matters present in green Alga are those most eharaeteriftic
 of all the higher plants, the only difference being that in certain circum
 stances these latter contain in addition         various more or less accidental
 and unessential substances, belonging to the erythrophyll and cbxyso-
 tannin groups, some kinds of which, nevertheless, do to some extent appear
 characteristic of particular classes.     As far as their constituent colouring-
 matters are concerned, the green Alga are therefore perfectly typical
 plants.    On the contrary the olive Alga differ in a very marked manner:
 they contain no yellow chlorophyll,           nor either of the two kinds of

1873.]                Comparative Vegetable Chromatology.                         475
xanthophyll,      all so characteristic of the most perfect plants, but contain
chlorof    ucine and f ucoxanthine, both of which occur in certain species of
Actiniae, like Anthea       cereus,  var. smaragdina.        The presence of such
colouring-matters,       therefore,  connects    the olive    Alga with the lower
classes of animals, in the same     manner that the presence of blue chlorophyll
connects some animals with plants.              Such substances, though essential
to the growth of plants, are not constant in closely allied species of animals,
as though they were of no more importance for the life of animals than
the accidental vegetable colouring-matters are for the life of plants. The
value of these connexions between plants and animals remains to be
determined, but in any case such definite facts must,             I think, have some
very important signification.         If, then, according to these principles, the
olive Alga be looked upon as a link connecting the lowest classes of plants
with     some of the lowest classes of animals, there is a perfect and simple
continuity ; whereas if they were to be considered intermediate between
green Alga and the higher Cryptogamva, there would               be two great breaks
of chromatological continuity.
                          Changes occurring    in Oscillatoriae.
     The olive Alga are also connected in another manner with lichens,
 through Oscillatoria.       These latter plants are extremely interesting, since
 they are subject to most remarkable changes, depending on the conditions
 in which they grow.       I  have made a series of quantitative analyses, which
 show this in a striking manner.          I may here say that the chief difficulty
 in the analyses was the determination of the amount of the lichnoxanthines
 in presence of chlorofucine and fucoxanthine, and therefore the quantities
 given must be looked upon as only approximate, derived from several
 different methods, none of which were perfectly satisfactory, though they
 all agreed in leading to the same general conclusions.             In discussing the
 results of the analyses, it was requisite to take the amount of blue
 chlorophyll as uniform, since it was the only constituent occurring in any
  considerable quantity throughout the whole series. To have taken equal
 weights of the plants themselves would have been almost impossible, and
  would often have made those which really correspond very closely appear
  to differ extremely, since the constitution of the endochrome is the im
  portant question.       Of course by thus calculating the results as if the
  amount of chlorophyll were the same in all, there appears to be an in
  crease in some of the other constituents in the specimens exposed to the
  sun, due, however, in reality to a reduction in the relative quantity of
  chlorophyll.

  In this Table are compared together the same or very similar plants
growing in different conditions, as connected by the brackets, and also
plants belonging even to different classes.  On comparing together the
amount of the different constituents of the same plants grown in less or
more light, it will be seen that some of the differences are in perfect
agreement with those already described ; but the differences in the
Oscillatoria! are evidently not a mere change in equilibrium, due to the
decomposing action of the light, and point unmistakably to a great
difference in the constructive force of the plant, depending on increased
light. There is a remarkable development of phycoxanthine and orange
xanthophyll, and a great decrease in the amount of chlorofucine and
fucoxanthine,                  is that we have a change almost from the
                      and the result
type of olive Alga- to that of certain lichens.     When growing in a very
shady place  the colouring-matters    soluble in bisulphide of carbon are all
identical with those in Funis and other olive Alga?, whereas when grown
exposed to much sun there is a great reduction in the amount of those
substances which are so characteristic of that group, and at the same
time a great development of others which are almost or altogether absent
from    it,
         but occur in large quantity in, and are very characteristic of,
such lichens as Peltigera eanina.     The olive Algw are, however, di
stinguished from those Oscillatorice which approach them most closely                              by
the absence          of the phycocyans        ;   and though these occur in Peltigera,            it

1873.]               Comparative Vegetable Chromatohgy.                            477
is distinguished by the absence of fucoxanthine from those Oscillatoria
which in other respects agree with it. We may also draw another
important conclusion from the above facts.                Oscillatorice approach most
closely to the olive Alga when their vegetative energy is the weakest,
when so little light is present that they can only just keep alive.               This
seems    to show that the colouring of olive Algce, in some way or other,
belongs to a lower type than that of the green Alga, as indicated by other
facts  previously described.
                  General connexion     of different  classes  of Plants.
    The olive Algce are thus connected with the lowest green plants by
 means of two different groups of the red Alga, one leading gradually to the
 green Alga through Porphyra, and the other to lichens through Peltigera.
 There is the same          sudden break in both, where the phycocyan and
 phycoerythrine      colours   cease and yellow chlorophyll and yellow xantho-
 phyll make their appearance —at least               I  have hitherto met with no
 good connecting links containing a small quantity of both instead of a
 normal amount of one or of the other ; and if this be really a universal
 fact, it would seem to show that, in some way or other, the presence of
 the   phycocyans      excludes    yellow chlorophyll and yellow xanthophyll.
 Curiously enough this break does not occur between one great natural
 class and another, but in passing from those red Algce which are so
 closely related to the green series as       Porphyra, and from Peltigera to other
 lichens.     So much remains to be learned of the details that it would be
 premature to put forward any general scheme with the expectation of its
 being finally adopted ; but at the same time it may perhaps be well to
 express what is already known, if only as a guide for further research.
  Of course    I  refer simply to the distribution of the colouring-matters ;
 and this could hardly be expected to depend upon, or accurately follow,
  the difference in the development of the reproductive organs ; but, on the
  contrary, it seems to represent something special in the constitution of
 the plants, for which no name has hitherto been adopted, but which                   I
  have  called constructive energy.      If such be really the case, an arrange
  ment founded on chromatological           characters alone would by no means
  necessarily   agree  in every particular with       a natural system founded on
  structural peculiarities.       Taking    into   consideration      the various facts
  described above, the following arrangement expresses every thing so far
  known respecting the distribution of the different colouring-matters : —

478                             Mr. H. C. Sorby      on                [June  19,
    The colouring-matters found in Actinia are very various, and it is only
particular species that contain those found in Alger. Lichens, as a whole,
are characterized by a number of what may be called accidental consti
tuents — such, at least, as occur in one species and not in another closely
allied to it. Many of these are almost or quite colourless substances,
which easily give rise to colouring-matters           when treated with various
reagents.     This   fact,  combined   with their  partial distribution, is taken
advantage of in studying lichens as a means for distinguishing closely
connected species. Their more constant and apparently fundamental
colouring-matters correspond with those found in the higher classes of
plants, but differ considerably in relative proportion, the lichnoianthines
usually being relatively more abundant.
                        Relation   of Fungi to other Plants.
    Fungi cannot be      arranged in a direct order in any part of       the series
shown in the Table given above.           Their most common colouring-matters
exactly correspond with those found in the apothecia of lichens, and
their more accidental constituents are also quite analogous to those
occasionally found in the apothecia of particular lichens —for example
in those of Cladonia comumpioides.
   According to the principles adopted in this paper, fungi ought then to
be looked upon, not as fronds, but as the fructification of a low type of
plants ; and   I  think that the fact of the colouring-matters alone leading to
such a satisfactory conclusion, shows that they must have some important
physiological    signification.
 Connexion   between   the  Colouring-matters  of Flowers and  those in ilu Lcaw.
    Since a comparison between the colouring-matters          found in the petals
of flowers with those in the foliage has many points of interest in con
nexion with the relationships of fungi, it seems best now to describe some
of the principal facts.       The coloured substances in the petals are in many
cases exactly the same as those in the foliage from which chlorophyll has
disappeared ; so that the petals are often exactly like leaves which have
turned yellow or red in autumn, or the very yellow or red leaves
of early spring, but in other cases special coloured substances are
developed which do not occur in leaves.                Many yellow flowers are
coloured by a very variable amount and variable mixture of lichno-
xonthine and the three kinds of xanthophyll, but orange-coloured flown
sometimes contain in addition other substances analogous to peziza
xanthine and phycoxanthine.             The colour of many crimson, pink,
and red flowers       is due to the development of substances belonging to
the erythrophyll group, and not unfrequently to exactly the same kind
as that so often found in leaves. The number of different species is very
considerable, and it would make this paper far too long to describe them;
and, besides this, it would be requisite to
                                                      explain methods of study

 1873.]                Comparative Vegetable Chromatology           .              479
differing    entirely from      those    given  above.    Some of the        particular
colouring-matters occur in very different natural orders ; whereas              I  have
found others only in one particular order, or even only in a single species
of plant.      Much remains to be learned in connexion with this branch of
the subject     ;  but many facts seem to indicate that these various substances
may be due to an alteration of the normal constituents of leaves, some
being probably formed from chlorophyll, others from the xanthophylls,
and perhaps         some from other constituents.      So far as  I   have been able to
ascertain,     their development seems as if related to extra oxidization,
modified by light and other varying conditions not yet understood ; and
it will be an interesting field for inquiry to determine how far they are
due to simple changes in the normal constituents of leaves — in fact how
far the petals of flowers are modified leaves, in colour as well as in struc
ture.
                              Effects of Light on Mowers.
     I have made very few experiments with the view of ascertaining the
effect of a different amount of light on the petals of flowers, but what              I
have    thus learned in the     case  of a dark variety of the common       wallflower
(Cheiranthus cheiri) clearly indicates that very important facts could be
 learned in this manner.         By diminishing the exposure to light, a com
 plete alteration was produced in the relative amount of the colouring-
 matters.      No erythrophyll was developed, which was abundant in those
 flowers exposed to the sun, and, for an equal quantity of petals, only
 about one third the amount of xanthophyll,              and yet about the same
 quantity of chlorophyll         and lichnoxanthine     were formed.        The result
 was that    I    had produced a temporary alteration in the proportion of the
 colouring-matters, which corresponded closely with what is the permanent
  condition of a different natural variety or even of a different but closely
 allied species.       Judging from certain facts which have lately attracted
 my attention,       I think it extremely probable that in some cases natural
  varieties may be imitated in a similar temporary manner by reducing
  the constructive energy of the plants by other means.               The extension of
  such inquiries will probably throw much light on the cause of the pro
  duction of different coloured varieties of the flowers of the same species

                          Connexion  between  Fungi and Lichens.
      Such, then, being the relation between the organs of reproduction and
  the foliage, it is to some extent possible to understand the connexion
  between parasitic plants like fungi, which do not derive their support
  from the constructive       energy of their own fronds, and those which are
   self-supporting     and possess true fronds.    In the highest classes of plants
   the flowers are connected with the leaves more especially by means of
   xanthophyll and yellow xanthophyll ; whereas in the case of lichens the

 apothecia contain very little,   if  any, of those     substances, but      a large
amount of the lichnoxanthines       so characteristic    of the   class.    Looking
upon fungi from this chromatological point of view, they bear something
like the same relation to lichens that the petals of a leafless parasitic
plant would bear to the foliage of one of normal character — that is to say,
they are, as it were, the coloured organs of reproduction of parasitic
plants of a type closely approaching that of lichens, which of course is in
very close, if not in absolute agreement with the conclusions drawn
by botanists from entirely different data.
                           Yellow varieties of Leaves.
    One of the most interesting questions connected       with the higher     classes
of plants is the production of yellow varieties of leaves.            Some, instead
of being of the usual deep green, are far more yellow, or have special
leaves or parts of leaves containing a very little chlorophyll generally
diffused.    Such leaves must be distinguished from those of normal green
character with very bright patches free from chlorophyll, like Crottm
variegatum.    Now   I find that in many, if not all, such cases there is not
only   a great  change   in the total amount, but also a most             important
difference in the relative quantity of the blue and the yellow chlorophyll.
This may be seen by examining the spectra of the leaves themselves, m
illuminated by such bright, direct, concentrated sunlight as will penetrate
through so many thicknesses of the leaves, pressed together by a strong
compressorium, and show the spectrum to advantage.             If  in this manner,
 for example, ten thicknesses of very yellow leaves be compared with a
single green one, it may be seen that the absorption-bands in the red
due to the chlorophylls differ most materially.          By proper management
the band in the red due to yellow chlorophyll can always be seen in the
spectrum of normal green leaves,       but no trace is visible in the         case of
these   very yellow leaves  — only that due to blue chlorophyll.              I have
confirmed this conclusion by examining the chlorophyll when in solution
in benzole, and find that, though some of the yellow kind is present, the
relative amount is much less than normal.         The method of study which
I   have adopted is as    follows : — I crush the    leaves, and heat them in
spirit until all the chlorophyll    is dissolved.   When cold       I  agitate with
bisulphide of carbon, adding        so much    water   that   the   whole of     the
chlorophylls   may be carried down ; and after evaporating the bisulphide
at a gentle heat,  I redissolve in benzole. Taking two tubes containing a
solution of such a strength that the spectrum shows the absorption-band
in the red of the yellow chlorophyll to the greatest advantage, I add
benzole to one tube until the band in the red due to blue chlorophyll is of
the same intensity as that due to the yellow chlorophyll in the other
tube, as seen by comparing the spectra together side by side with equally
bright illumination, and carefully measure how much the original

solution had to   be diluted    in order to obtain that equality.         This being
a constant point of comparison, it is possible to determine the relative
quantity of yellow chlorophyll in different kinds of leaves.                 So far  I
have not worked out the question in full detail, because the present form
of instrument and apparatus is not suited for very accurate determinations,
and therefore the following Table must be looked upon as a mere first
attempt.     Great care must be taken not to expose such dilute solutions
to much light, since they are       so  rapidly changed, even by gaslight, that
serious errors might easily result from this cause.             In all cases   I  have
taken the amount of blue chlorophyll as 100, and expressed the relative
quantity of yellow chlorophyll in percentages, in accordance with the
above named principle.        I also give some other cases for comparison.

    The normal relative amount of yellow chlorophyll in green leaves
 certainly varies, and there seems reason to believe that this to some
 extent, if not mainly, depends on the length of time to which they have
 been exposed to the sun.          When healthy green leaves fade and turn
 yellow the relative amount of yellow chlorophyll is increased, in accord
ance with what is known respecting the greater ease with which blue
 chlorophyll is decomposed, but the relative amount does not appear to
 become so great as in the case of a mixed solution exposed to the sun.
 On the contrary, when leaves are very yellow, owing to having been
 grown almost in the dark, the relative amount of yellow chlorophyll is
 much less than normal, as though under such unfavourable conditions
 the blue chlorophyll were more readily formed than the yellow.              It might
 therefore be said that when the constructive energy is weak, the initial
 proportion of the yellow is about one third of the normal, but that when
 the leaves fade, the vanishing ratio is about double the normal. The blue
 chlorophyll is therefore, as it were, more readily formed and more readily
 decomposed than the yellow. The relatively small amount of yellow chloro
 phyll found in those leaves which are normally very yellow cannot there
 fore be due to the decomposing effect of light, but must rather be attributed
 to weak constructive     energy, like that in leaves abnormally yellow on
 account of having been grown almost in the dark. This great reduction in
 the relative quantity of yellow chlorophyll causes them to approach
 towards the normal type of those low orders of plants from which it is
 altogether absent.     The determination     of the relative amounts of the two

  482              On Comparative Vegetable Chromatology.            [June   19,
  kinds of xanthophyll is often rather difficult ; but in some cases, at all
  events, the relative quantity of the yellow xanthophyll is greatly reduced
  in yellow varieties of leaves, so that, as in other circumstances, it seems
  to vary in the same manner as yellow chlorophyll. This question, how
 ever, requires further examination.       The very great relative amount of
 the xanthophylls    is  readily explained by supposing that they are formed
 when the constructive energy is too low to give rise to chlorophyll, and
 that they may remain in faded leaves when the energy is too weak to
 prevent its decomposition.
                         Condition of Chlorophyll in Leaves.
    By carefully studying the position of the principal absorption-band in
 the red, seen in the spectra of the leaves themselves, by means of a com
 pound prism of considerable dispersive power, and a bright dot, seen by
 reflection   from  the upper surface, made to move over the spectrum by
 a   micrometer-screw, as proposed by Mr. Browning and modified by
 myself,  I  find that there is every reason to believe that in normal healthy
 green leaves the chlorophyll is chiefly in a free state.       On boiling for a
 short time in water, the oils or wax present in the leaf combine with the
 chlorophyll, and raise the band somewhat further from the red end,
 especially if the relative amount of chlorophyll is small.         Of course I
 here refer to leaves which have little or no free acid in the juice to
 decompose the chlorophyll into the well-known product of the action of
acids.    When dissolved in the common fixed oils the band is still further
raised.     The small quantity of chlorophyll in very yellow leaves appears
 to be chiefly combined naturally with some oil, fat, or wax, so that the
spectrum resembles that of a green leaf that has been boiled.          This may
 perhaps be due in part to the total amount being so small in comparison
to that of the oil or wax, but at the same time it is interesting to find
that a relatively large quantity is thus combined in olive Algm ;         and it
will be a subject for further inquiry to ascertain whether, when         chloro
phyll occurs in animals, it is not similarly combined, or even dissolved,
in a fat or oil.
    Taking, then, every thing into account, leaves which are normally very
yellow appear to be characterized by a very low constructive energy so
                                                                            —
low, in fact, that     a  plant could not live   if all its leaves were of   the
extreme condition of that type ; and this, like what was described in
connexion with Oscillatoria, seems to point to the conclusion that those
classes of plants (like the red and olive Ah/ce) whieh more or less
closely resemble these yellow leaves in certain important particulars are
lower in the scale as regards some peculiarity on which the production
of the colouring-matters        depends, which, for want of a better name, I
have called constructive energy.        We might thus speak of constructive
energy as being weak or strong in the same plant in different conditions,
or as being of a low or high type in different classes of plants ; and such

cases as     those just named seem to show that a weak constructive energy
has a great tendency to give rise to results analogous to those due to one
of low type.       It' this conclusion should be confirmed by further research,
it would be an important fact in connexion with the theory of evolution,
since it would show that, as in the organization of animals, where deve
lopment is arrested, there is a more or less permanent continuance of a
lower type of structure, so in plants there is a permanent continuance of
a lower type of colouring.
                                        Conclusion.
     Such, then, is a general account of the present state of what           I have
named comparative vegetable chromatology.               I cannot but feel that it is
 very incomplete, both in compass and in detail, and that much remains
 to be learned respecting nearly every thing connected with it. Not only
 are the    natural objects requiring careful study very numerous and often
 difficult to obtain in a proper condition, but, as will have been seen,
 several new questions are most intimately connected with my subject —
 questions of great interest in connexion with optics and chemistry, which
  would probably never have been raised if it had not been for their rela
  tion to the facts    I  have described.    There are indications of other general
  questions which have not yet been fairly examined, and, in fact, the whole
  subject must be looked upon as being quite in its infancy. At the same
  time   I  trust that what    I  have described will be sufficient to show that
  the nature and relative proportion of the various colouring-matters             in
   plants must have some very important signification, and that a more com
   plete knowledge of comparative vegetable chromatology may be expected
   to throw much light on the development of plants, and enable us to
   examine some of the most fundamental questions in biology from a new
   and independent       point of view. The subject is also interesting in other
   respects.     The  storing up of the energy of the sun's rays in the various
   compounds formed by plants is probably so intimately connected with
   the optical and chemical properties of some of their coloured constituents,
   that the further extension of such inquiries as           I have described may
   possibly assist in clearing up this very difficult and yet most important
   problem.

       In  my previous experiments        the maximum amount of ozone obtained
    by the action of     electricity upon pure oxygen passed through the induc
    tion-tube of  W. Siemens      was about 20 per cent., an amount which, under

  484              On the Action     of Electricity   on Gases.        [June   19,
  the conditions of the experiment, could not be exceeded.         It occurred   to
  me as possible to replace the 80 per cent. of oxygen unaffected by            the
 action of the electricity by an indifferent gas, and thus to effect            the
  complete conversion of oxygen into ozone.          This idea   was the starting-
  point of the following investigation.
     When pure and dry carbonic-acid gas is subjected in the induction-tube
 to the electric action, a certain proportion of the gas is decomposed into
  carbonic oxide and oxygen, a portion of which appears in the form of
  ozone.    The presence of this ozone may be detected by its odour and the
  characteristic oxidations produced by it.
     It was a point of fundamental importance to determine whether the
  ozone thus generated was the same in kind as that formed by the action
  of electricity on pure oxygen, and whether the oxidations referred to were
 exclusively due to it ; for it was quite conceivable that under the peculiar
 circumstances of the experiment other substances capable of producing
 similar oxidizing effects might be formed.          Now, in the investigation
 before referred    to,  I  had discovered   certain  quantitative    reactions of
 ozone by which this substance is discriminated from all other known
 gases, and by which its presence may be detected and its quantity
 estimated.     The electrized carbonic-acid gas was examined by the aid of
 these reactions.
     When the electrized gas was passed through a solution of hyposul
 phite of soda, it was found to undergo a diminution in volume equal in
 amount to twice the " iodine-titre of the gas, the mean of twelve expe
                                       "
 riments giving for this value 1-9, the "titre" being 1. The oxidation also
 effected in the solution of hyposulphite of soda was equal to three times
 the "titre" of the gas, the mean of a set of five experiments giving for this
 value, according to one method of estimation, 2-72, and according to a
 second and more exact method 3-01.           Again, the oxidation effected by
 the electrized gas in a   solution of protochloride of tin was equal to three
 times the "titre" of the gas, the value found as the mean of six experi
 ments being 2-77. In two experiments also, in which both the oxidation
 and contraction were respectively estimated, 2-75 and 2-69 were the
 values found for the oxidation, and 1-9 and 1-8 the values found for           the
 contraction, the  " titre" of the gas being in all cases assumed as 1. These
 experiments conclusively demonstrate the identity of the ozone formed
 by the action of electricity upon carbonic-acid gas with the ozone simi
 larly generated from pure oxygen.
     Various experiments were instituted with the view of ascertaining the
 conditions    most favourable to the conversion of a large proportion of
 this oxygen into ozone. The conclusion at which          I arrived was that the
 greatest proportion of ozone in relation to the total oxygen was pro
duced when a rapid current of dry carbonic-acid gas was acted upon at
a   low temperature by electricity of feeble tension.       When these condi
tions were realized, it was found that 75 per cent. of the total
                                                                           oxygen

eliminated      in the induction-tube        by the decomposition of the carbonic-
acid gas could readily be converted into ozone, but that it was difficult
to pass this limit.        This amount corresponds with the formation of a gas
constituted of ozone and oxygen in the proportion of two units of ozone
to one unit of oxygen, the matter of the oxygen being thus distributed
2£3 + £'.     In several experiments, nevertheless, this limit was considerably
exceeded    ;  and   a table is given    of nine experiments, in which the amount
per cent.   of ozone ranged from        a minimum of 76-6 per cent. to a maximum
of 85-5   per cent. This latter amount corresponds with a gas constituted
of ozone      and oxygen in the proportion of four units of ozone to one of
oxygen, thus 4£3+£3.            In this case the ratio of the total oxygen present
to the titre of the gas is 3-5 ; if the whole oxygen were converted into
ozone, the value of this ratio would be 3.
   These experiments, taken in connexion with those described in my
previous communication, leave no room for reasonable doubt as to the
composition of the unit of ozone, which is the triad form of the element
oxygen, and is to be symbolized as                 an hypothesis henceforth to be
regarded      as  conclusively     demonstrated.     This remarkable discovery has
many important bearings upon chemical theory, especially in relation to
the problem elsewhere raised by me of the true nature of the elemental
bodies and the constitution of the unit of the element chlorine, which
ozone so closely resembles in its chemical properties, and which is also
a triad element symbolized as a%*.

   1873.]     Electrical Phenomena in the leaf of Dionsea muscipula.              495

   Sir GEORGE BIDDELL AIRY, K.C.B.,                     President, in the Chair.
      In  pursuance of the Statutes, notice of the ensuing Anniversary Meet
  ing was given from the Chair.
      Capt. John Herschel, R.E., elected in 1871, was admitted into the
   Society.
      General    Boileau, Mr. Etheridge, Mr. Merrifield, Mr. Newmarch, and
  Prof. Ramsay, having been nominated by the President, were elected by
  ballot Auditors of the Treasurer's Accounts on the part of the Society.
     The Presents received were laid on the Table, and thanks ordered for
  them.
     The following communications were read       : —
  I. "Note       on the Electrical Phenomena which               accompany      irri
         tation of the leaf of Dioncea muscipula."                By  J.   Burdon
         Sanderson, M.D., F.R.S., Professor of Practical Physiology
         in University College.       Received October 13, 1873.
     1. When the opposite ends of a living leaf of Dioncea are placed on non-
 polarizable electrodes in metallic connexion with each other, and a
 Thomson's reflecting galvanometer of high resistance is introduced
 into the circuit thus formed, a deflection is observed which indicates the
 existence of a current from the proximal to the distal end of the leaf.
                   I
 This current call the normal leaf-current. If, instead of the leaf, the
 leaf-stalk is placed on the electrodes (the leaf remaining united to it) in
such a way that the extreme end of the stalk rests on one electrode and
a part of the stalk at a certain distance from the leaf on the other, a
current is indicated which is opposed to that in the leaf. This          I  call the
stalk-current.      To demonstrate these two currents, it is not necessary to
expose any cut surface to the electrodes.
    2. In a leaf with the petiole attached, the strength of the current is
determined by the length of the petiole cut off with the leaf, in such a
way that the shorter the petiole the greater is the deflection.         Thus in a
leaf with a petiole an inch long,      I observed   a deflection  of 40.    I  then
cut off half, then half the remainder, and so       on.   After these successive
amputations,      the deflections were respectively 50, 65, 90, 120.          If in
this experiment, instead of completely severing the leaf at each time, it is
merely all but divided with a sharp knife, the cut surfaces remaining in
accurate apposition, the result is exactly the same as if the severance were
complete ; no further effect is obtained on separating the parts.

current. —   If  the leaf is placed on the galvanometer electrodes as before,

reaches               (so as to touch the sensitive hairs on the upper
                the interior
surface of the lamina), the needle swings to the right, the leaf at the
same time closing on the fly.
     b.   The fly having been caught                    does      not remain quiet in the leaf;                each
time    moves, the needle again swings to the right, always coming to

creased whenever the leaf                isirritated in any of the ways above described.

are situated   touched with

 1873.]      On the Algebraical Analogues         of Logical Relations.      497
 II. " On     the Algebraical Analogues          of Logical Relations." By
       Alexander        J.  Ellis, B.A., F.R.S., F.S.A., F.C.P.S., F.C.P.
       Received March 19, 1873.
                                    (Abstract.)
    The object of this paper is to examine the " mathematical theory of
 logic," thus laid down by Dr. George Boole in his ' Laws of Thought,'
 p. 37 : — " Let us conceive of an Algebra in which the symbols x, y, z,
 &c. admit indifferently of the values 0 and 1, and of these values alone.
 The laws, the axioms, and the processes of such an algebra will be
 identical in their whole extent with the laws, the axioms, and the pro
cesses of an Algebra of Logic. Difference of interpretation will alone
divide them." For this purpose, first the laws of such an algebra have
 been investigated independently of logic ; and secondly the laws of primary
and secondary logical propositions as laid down by Dr. Boole have been
developed in an algebraical form, and compared with the former.             The
main results presumed to be established are : —
    1. That there is a fundamental difference between such an algebra
and logic, inasmuch as the algebra admits of only two phases, 0 and 1,
and logic admits of three phases, namely, not only none and all, corre
sponding to 0 and 1, but also some, " which, though it may include in its
                                           "
meaning all, does not include none           (ibid. p. 124), and hence has no
analogue in such an algebra ; that is, an algebra of 0 and I can corre
spond only to a logic of none and all.
    2. That, notwithstanding this difference, there are certain formal re
lations of equations which allow the algebra of 0 and 1 to be used as an
algorithm for the purpose of arriving at certain logical forms, which,
however, have then to be interpreted on a basis which has not even any
analogy to the algebraical.
    3. That the introduction of this algorithm introduces theoretical diffi
culties, adds to the amount of work, and is entirely unnecessary even
for the purposes of the theory of probabilities       founded upon   it by Dr.
Boole.
    In  the paper the general case is examined, and a solution          is pro
posed for the difficulties arising from the interpretation of the      symbols
                                                                        "
g and       which Boole says " must be established experimentally         (ibid.
p. 92).     The following simple case will show the nature of the      investi
gation   ; but, for brevity, even this case is not fully considered.
   In  algebra, let x and y have either one of the values 0 or 1, and no
other.     And let  x1, y  be connected  with them by the equations
                             l=x+x'     and    l=y+y'.                       (a)
Then                       xaf=0,       and   x=x2;                          (b)

   we find that    x  occurs  only in the term xy, and y' only in the term x'y,
   whereas x' and y' both occur in two terms.              This is the only relation
   useful in logic.     But   further,  owing  to the  necessity for all terms vanish
   ing except one, there can be only one term in which x occurs, in which
   case neither x' nor y' can occur, and there may be no such term.                  This
   again has no logical analogue.

  most generally no term on the right of (a") will=»'Tr, and any number of
  the terms may be greater than 0.           This has no analogue in the algebra
 in question.       If there   is a limiting equation as X=XY, or        " all X is Y,"

though, if both vX=0 and              vY'=0, then iX'T=cII,       w hich has an alge

     The difference between the laws of such an algebra and of logical cal
culation, therefore, appears to be one of principle and not of interpreta
tion only.

   Solubility. — 1 part of the salt dissolved in about 22 of water at 16°          C,
and   in 5 parts at 100°C.
   It  may be noticed that the water found is a little above the calculated
amount, just so much in fact as the chromium is too low ; this is not to
be wondered at when the singular nature of the salt is taken into account,
a salt which at the   ordinary atmospheric pressure and temperature loses
4 per cent., or 1 molecule of water in dry air— a substance that can be
dried only by crushing between bibulous paper and exposure in an open
place to cool air.    The solution, of a greenish-purple colour, when boiled
becomes more decidedly green, and assumes its original colour on cooling.
A  little calcium oxalate generally separates out during recrystallization,
The salt is exceedingly stable, and it crystallizes with the greatest ease
from hot or cold, acid or neutral solutions, and can be precipitated in
the crystalline state. It is almost insoluble in strong hydrochloric acid.
   The following are the properties of the crystals : —When deposited
slowly they are formed in clusters, the individual crystals being never
more than -ffo of an inch in thickness and £ an inch long.                       They
possess a greenish-black lustre, and apparently consist of prisms with a
rectangular base; they reflect white light. From hot solutions much
smaller crystals deposit ; their colour is olive-green in daylight, and
                     * Calculated from  0-424 grm. of platinum.

beetroot-red      by gaslight.     Under like circumstances the powdered
substance is of the same colour.       Minute crystals, examined in daylight by
the microscope, are of a pale green tint ; fragments of large crystals coarsely
powdered appear of almost all tints, rich green and blue prevailing.
Larger crystals, deposited by spontaneous evaporation of a cold solution,
appear of two colours chiefly, a beautiful blue and rich green, with some
times a tinge of deep red, their appearance being exceedingly charming.
    Occasionally crystals of a good size, seen by reflected light, appear of two
colours   ;  this has been observed in a mass of crystals removed from a
glass dish, where they had grown in contact with the glass ; distinct blue
and green patches of colour were seen intermingled.               These crystals
most likely had not true surfaces, but were covered with smaller crystals,
 so that light reflected from the large facets became colour by transmission
through small crystals.        A quantity of the salt crystallized in isolated
 prisms in the bottom of a beaker glass was examined by looking directly
at the sun ; thus viewed they were ruby-red ; on turning away from the
direct rays at an angle of 30° they appeared green ; and on moving still
further round,      some   of them appeared blue. We may thus vary the
colour    of the crystals     by admitting white light to them at different
angles. An experiment was made in order to ascertain whether viewing
a crystal through different axes produced alterations in colour.          It was
not easy to see how this could be done, because a crystal -^-q of an inch
thickness would certainly be too large to transmit light sufficiently well.
I   devised, however, the following plan, and successfully overcame the
difficulty.     Taking a quill tube of good glass free from streaks and
bubbles,    I  drew this out sharply to a capillary size, and ran a minute
crystal into it with a little of the mother-liquor ; by blowing into the tube
the liquid was slowly expelled, while the crystal was securely wedged
into the fine end, and so remained stationary when the tube was turned
over.    To make      a stage for holding this, a glass slip had a cork bored
with a hole cemented to it ; the tube being passed through the hole, could
be turned over without displacement from the field of the microscope.
    In the first observation the crystal looked opaque ; but here and there
an indistinct red light shone through on turning it ; a green tint with a
shade of red next made its appearance, the green became full and bril
liant ; opacity next succeeded, and then blue with a tinge of green ;
finally the full beautiful blue colour.        In each revolution of a crystal
there were two periods of blue, two of green, and two of opacity with a
tinge of red. When a crystal so small as to be quite transparent in any
position was examined in this manner, it was seen that purely red light
was transmitted through its edges. It is thus rendered very evident that the
play of colour is due to pleochrbism, or the property which, by virtue of
double refraction, some minerals possess of transmitting light of dif
ferent tints through their different crystalline axes.         I have examined
many well-crystallized salts in the manner already described, and there
are none which can compare with potassio-calcium chromic oxalate.            The

platinocyanides, most beautiful crystalline coloured bodies, attracted my
attention ; but their prominent properties are the converse of my salt ;
they reflect two or three different coloured rays, but transmit only one.
Such salts are :—

   Haidinger*, however, who examined the magnesium platinocyanide,
found that although to the unaided eye the light transmitted was of a
pure carmine-red, yet the dichroscopic lens showed that the colour of
thin crystals was distinctly separated into crimson-red and a tint less
blue. The two axes of thin crystals give spectra which do not differ
from each other materially, nor from the solution of this salt in par
ticular, nor from chromium salts generally.          I   noticed that solutions of
the salt, when left to evaporate spontaneously in porcelain dishes, fre
quently formed crystalline crusts, which adhered to the sides for an inch
or  so above   the liquid ;  and it occurred     to me that such crusts would
serve   admirably for spectroscopic observations, isolated crystals being
too small. Having purposely prepared a good quantity of the salt in
this state, portions were selected, mounted, and examined with the micro-
spectroscope in brilliant sunlight, with the result that three different
spectra were observed.        The accompanying         sketch shows the relative
positions of the transmitted rays.

  Sorby's scale.     The green rays passing through a short axis consisted of
  the red band 0-2, and one green band between 5 and 6-5, the blue rays
  passing at right angles to the former being situated between 6-5 and 9.
  Very frequently the blue rays were associated with the red band 0-2.
  If  these spectra be combined, the absorption-spectrum             common to the
  solution and to thin crystals is produced.
     Examined with a Nicol's prism and with similar crystals used         as analyzers,
  it was found that this substance is         a powerful polarizer.         There is a
  marked difference when the blue and the green rays are examined with
  a Nicol's prism, the former being much more completely polarized than
  the latter, so that in rotating the Nicol there is an alternation of brilliant
  blue and perfect darkness —if the crystal be thin, of blue and reddish
 green.     If, however, a crystal transmitting green rays of equal brilliancy
  be examined, the     light is not cut off, but only obscured.      In like manner,
 if both analyzer and polarizer consist of these crystals, when in a position
 at right angles to each other, the effect of course is the same as that pro
 duced by a Nicol's prism, viz. only green rays are transmitted. The green
  ray is more strongly refracted, and at the same time more absorbed than
 the blue, in accordance with Babinet's law (Pogg. 'Annalen,' vol. xli.
 p. 116). This was made evident from their apparent change of                      colour
 when white light was admitted to them at different angles.                        These
 observations account for the facts already noticed — namely               that minute
 crystals    appear green even under the microscope, and also that the
 powder is green.
     Let us take haphazard a number of crystals, or fragments of crystals,
 lying in all directions over each other, and it is easy to see that no blue
 rays can be transmitted ; for where two crystals cross, the light trans
 mitted is green.       The green rays being more absorbed (that is to say,
 travelling with less facility) than the blue, it is possible to have a
blue crystal so thin as to transmit white light through one axis,                  while
green rays would pass at right angles through the other ; under                     these
 circumstances the crystals would appear green.            The red colour      seen by
 gaslight   is of course   due  to the suppression   of the green and blue        by the
yellow illumination.
    I   find that Sir David Brewster*, and also Haidinger, have examined
the blue potassium chromic oxalate of Gregory; and many of its pro
perties are those also of my salt.        Brewster states : — " In the smaller
                                                     t
crystals, which are generally the best formed, the colour of both reflected
and transmitted daylight is blue, but that of candle-light is purplish.
" The relations of this salt to plain and polarized light may               be readily
examined and finely exhibited by placing upon a plate of glass a few drops
of a saturated solution of it in water.        If the crystals are slowly formed,
they will be found of various thicknesses, each thickness exhibiting a
different colour, varying from perfect transparency through all shades of

yellow, pale orange, red, and blue in candle-light."            I find the colour of
 small crystals by reflected light is not always blue, but varies between
 blue and green, just as does the new salt under the circumstances already
 mentioned.        Again, the variations in tint of small crystals is attributed
 to the differences in thickness ; but it is really due to pleochroism of a
 character identical with that in my salt.         A crystal powdered up coarsely,
 and placed under the microscope, no longer presents a blue colour, but
 consists of a beautiful collection of coloured fragments, decided red, green,
 blue, and yellow, besides all imaginable intermediate tints, such as neutral
 green and greenish blue. These tints change as the fragments roll over
 in the liquid surrounding them. This property is not noticed by
 Haidinger, who, in a contribution to PoggendorfFs ' Annalen * on the pleo
                                                                       '
 chroism of this potassium salt, states that the dichroiscope showed the
 ordinary image to be green, and the extraordinary blue, the blue tint
  being the brighter, so that, the colours being brought together in day
 light, the blue prevails.
      Brewster noticed previously that, the images — produced by double re
 fraction in these crystals, the least refracted was blue, and the most
  refracted green.
      Bunsent has obtained different absorption-spectra by passing polarized
  light through different axes of crystals of didymium sulphate.
      Light in traversing a crystal of such a substance as this new com
  pound is both coloured and polarized by the crystal itself ; it is there
  fore impossible to regard its spectrum by other than polarized light. We
  therefore get different kinds of absorption in different crystalline axes,
  which are manifested in a striking manner by the varying colours the
   salt presents.      This well exemplifies the fact that pleochroism results
   from the polarization of light traversing a doubly-refracting coloured
   medium.
      From the microscopic examination            of many similar new compounds,
   namely ammonio-calcium, potassio-ammonium, potassio-lithium,                    potas-
   sio-thallium, barium, and strontium chromic oxalates, it was found that
   the efficiency in displaying pleochroism was inversely as the molecular
   weight of the compounds, because the property depends upon the
   amount of colour the chromium gives to the crystals.                The proportion
   of chromium      is  of  course larger  when it is associated  with other elements
   possessing small atomic weights.            And whether we have 40 parts of
   calcium    or 406 of thallium in        a compound associated     with 52 of chro
    mium, is a     matter which greatly affects the percentage of chromium in
   the substance.
       It was at first supposed, from the totally different appearance of the
    salt when precipitated, and when slowly formed in large crystals, that
    two compounds were obtained, it being a common occurrence to have

 two modifications of a chromium salt, as for instance the blue and the
 green solutions of chromic nitrates and sulphates.                  Chemical analysis,
 however, showed them to be identical in composition, while the crystal
 lization and close examination of many specimens disclosed the nature of
 the substance.      I  have come to the conclusion that this is certainly the
 most remarkable example of pleochroi'sm at present known.
                       Note. — Eeceived November           7, 1873.
    I find  that the potassio-calcium chromic oxalate is a substance which
 excels uranium compounds as a test for the purity of white light. It is
 well known that uranic salts exhibit dark bands in the blue part of the
 spectrum, which cannot be seen by gas-light although plainly visible by
 day ; they are, however, shown with some distinctness by the lime-light.
 This chromium compound shows a red tint by gas-light, red and blue by
 the lime-light, while by the light of magnesium wire or the sun it displays
 red, blue, and green.        So sensitive, indeed, is this substance that its true
colour cannot be seen on an ordinary November morning in London, some
crystals appearing blue, others of a colour varying between neutral grey,
lilac, and red tints, according to the yellowness of the atmosphere.
                                                                    I
    To the list of substances examined for pleochroi'sm, have now to add,
besides the minerals well known to possess this property : —
                     Sulphate of iodo-quinine.
                      Sulphate of iodo-cinchonidine.
                      Sulphate of iodo-quinidine.

                     Potassium permanganate.
                     Teriodide of tetrethylammonium.
    The powerful polarizing qualities of the first two iodine compounds
are well known ; they have been described by Dr. Herapath* and Prof.
Stokes.     As they crystallize, however, in thin plates, it is impossible to
transmit light through more than one axis; they cannot therefore be
brought into comparison with my substance.                      Endeavours to obtain
large   thick crystals  did  not meet  with  success.    Sulphate     of iodo-quinidine
crystallizes in beautiful orange-brown prisms with a violet lustre ; it is,
however, but a feeble polarizer, and therefore does not exhibit pleochroi'sm
to any noticeable extent.         The double palladium salts which have been
previously     examined     are  beautifully   pleochro'ic prismatic crystals ex
hibiting an orange-brown tint along the principal crystalline axis, and a
green in other positions.        It is well seen in crystals £ millim. in thick
ness. Potassium permanganate is a substance which, seen even in
minute crystals, is still opaque.          A very dilute solution was allowed to

    The authors, after referring to experiments which showed clearly that the
 spectroscope might be employed to detect minute differences in the com
position of certain alloys, proceed to give an account of the researches
which they had instituted with a view to ascertain the degree of accuracy
 of which the method is capable.
    The image of an electric spark passing between the unknown alloy
and a fixed electrode being thrown by means of a lens on the slit
of the spectroscope, the phenomena observed were found to vary with
the composition of the alloys ; and further, by arranging them together
with known check-pieces on a suitable stand, and bringing them in turn
 under the fixed electrode, the composition of the unknown alloys was de
termined by comparison with the known check-pieces.
    The shape of the electrode ultimately adopted was that represented
 in  the sketch ;  and these pieces were held in their places
 by suitable metallic     clips.   Special attention was then
 directed   to the adjustment of the length of the spark,
 which was found to materially influence the phenomena.
 The method adopted consisted in placing the variable
 electrode in the field of a fixed microscope having a
 3- or 4-inch objective, and adjusting the summit of this electrode to
 coincide with the spider-lines of the eyepiece.
    After a series of experiments on alloys of zinc and cadmium of various
 compositions, the results of which were shown on a curve, more extended
 trials were made with the gold-copper alloy employed in coinage, which
 was peculiarly suited to these researches in consequence of the known
 method of assay having been brought to so high a state of perfection

 composition being determined with accuracy to the          part of the original

 curves, which show the         results of experiments, and in which the
 coordinates are given by the ordinary method of assay, and by the spec

    The chief practical advantage which appeared to flow from this inquiry
 was that, if it were possible to replace the parting assay by the spectro-
 scopical method, a great saving of time in ascertaining the value of gold
 bullion would    be effected.

        trum of the      Sun." — Part    III. By J. Norman Lockyer.
        Received November 20, 1873.
                                    (Abstract.)
    The paper commences with an introduction, in which the general line
 of work since the last paper is indicated.        Roughly speaking, this has
 been to ascertain the capabilities of the new method in a quantitative
 direction.    It is stated that while qualitative spectrum-analysis depends
 upon the positions of the lines, quantitative spectrum-analysis       on the
 other hand depends not on position but on the length, brightness, and
 thickness of the lines.
    The necessity of maps carefully executed and showing the individu
 ality of each line is shown ; and it is stated that the execution of these
 maps required the use of the electric arc to render the vapours of the
 metals incandescent.      A battery of 30 Grove's cells of one pint capacity
 was accordingly employed in the researches about to be described.
    The difficulties of eye-observations of the characters of the lines
compelled the application of photography, another reason for the use of
 which existed in the facility it afforded for confronting spectra with each
 other, and so eliminating coincident lines, since the lines, if due to im
purities, would be longest and thickest in the spectrum to which they
 really belonged.
    The portion of the spectrum at present       worked upon is that from   H
toF.
    Another branch of the research has been the construction of a Table of
all the named Fraunhofer lines, showing the lengths and thicknesses of the
metallic lines to the absorption of which they were due ; this Table enabled
the author to allocate upwards of 50 lines in the solar spectrum, pre
sumably overlooked by Angstrom and Thalén. The Table was intended
as a preliminary    to a new photographic map of the spectrum from H to F,
on a larger scale than Angstrom's, which was intended to clear away all
the difficulties touching coincidences —and to have below it complete
                                                                        maps

complete at present, but is making rapid

    A   preliminary search for elements supposed not to        be in the sun  has
also been commenced.
    Of    the above-named     researches the subsequent parts      of the paper
refer to :—

    IV. The preliminary inquiry into the existence in the sun of elements
not previously traced.
    I.   The experiments   made on a possible quantitative Spectrum-  Analysis.
    After the two former papers were sent in to the Koyal Society, an in
vestigation of the general changes undergone          by spectra given by alloys
 was commenced.
    A   micrometer    eyepiece was mounted on the observing-telescope of
the spectroscope. With this the following phenomena were observed : —
    I. The lines which remained varied their length as the percentage of
the elements to which they were due varied.
    II. Some of the lines appreciably varied their thickness or brightness,
 or both, in the same way.
    III. In cases where the brightness of a line was estimated through a
 considerable range of percentage composition by comparison with an air
 line, the air-line was observed to grow faint and then disappear as the
 brightness of the metallic lines increased.
    IV. In cases where the brightness or thickness of the line of one
 element was estimated by comparison with the line adjacent of the other
 constituent of the alloy, the point of equal brightness was observed to
 ascend or descend ; this method was used to avoid the uncertainty of
 micrometric measurements of the tips of the lines in consequence of their
 variation in length due to the unequal action of the spark.
    V. In some cases, where the percentage of a constituent was so small
 that none of its lines were visible, there yet seemed to be an effect pro
 duced on the vapour of the opposite pole.
     As these conclusions were derived from coarse alloys, and it was desi
 rable to observe the effect of very fine gradation, Mr. C. Fremantle, the
 Deputy Master of the Mint, was        begged to allow observations to be made
 on the gold-copper and silver-copper coinage alloys ; and he immediately
 responded most courteously to the request.
    Examples of the behaviour of some coarse alloys of silver and lead are
 given ; they were irregular in their action ; but it was observed that silver
 lines remained     in the alloy as long as from -05 to '02 per cent.   of silver
 was present.      The alloys, however, were very unequal. Experiments on
  cadmium and tin alloys are described, the cadmium forming 10, 5, 1-0,
  0-15 per cent. In the last but one cadmium line was permanent ; in the
 first at least five were seen.     In an alloy of 0-099 per cent. of cadmium

 with  a mixture      of lead, tin, and zinc constituting the rest of the alloy, the
 behaviour of the cadmium lines was sensibly the same as in a mixture of
 0-l per cent of cadmium and 99*9 of tin.
    In  the  Mint specimens the         same phenomena were observed en petit as
 the coarser alloys showed en grand.           In  a gold-copper   alloy Yihij increase
 in the gold made the lines shorter, and          a  similar increase in the copper
 made them longer.
    In  the silver-copper alloy an increase of ttsW m the silver lengthened
 the lines, a similar increase in the copper shortened them.
    These    phenomena can be explained by assuming such alloys to be
 different   physical things, and that the spark acts upon the alloy as a
 whole as well as upon each vapour separately.
    Thus, in these Mint alloys, copper is common to both, and their melt
 ing-points are     : —
             Gold. . . . 1200° (Pouillet).
             Copper. . 1200° to 1000°, the precise point not determined.
             Silver . . 1000° (Pouillet).
    The intermediate position          of copper explains the different      action on
its lines of gold and silver.
                II.    The Method of photographing Spectra adopted.
    A camera    carrying a 5 x 5-inch plate and a 3-inch lens of 23 inches focus,
replaced    the  observing-telescope of the spectroscope.           The lens focused
from 3900 to 4500 very fairly upon the plate. The beam passing through
collimator and prisms was, as in Mr. Butherford's researches, very small.
As the electric arc in its usual vertical position gave all the lines from
pole to pole, the lamp was placed on its side, and the arc used in a hori
zontal position, the slit being vertical.          The dense core of the arc then
gave all the short lines         in  the  centre  of  the field, the longer ones ex
tending beyond them on either side. In order to obtain a scale, it was
resolved to photograph the solar spectrum immediately adjacent to the
metallic spectrum under examination.
    To effect this a portion of the slit was covered up while the solar
spectrum passed through the free part, and then the part used for the
solar spectrum was covered, while the formerly covered part was opened
for the metallic spectrum.            This was effected by a shutter, with an
opening sliding in front of the slit ; a diagram of its action and form is
given.
    The arrangement of the spectroscope, heliostat, &c. for obtaining the
sun's light is described.        The image of the sun was brought to a focus
between the poles of the lamp by an extra lens interposed between the
lamp and the heliostat.
   The use of the shutter enables us to compare either two or more
spectra upon a single plate        ; or the solar spectrum may     be compared    with

two metallic spectra, being made to occupy the position between the
two.
                 III.   On the Lines coincident in different Spectra.
    The bearing of the former papers on the lengths of the lines of the
elements is briefly recapitulated.
    The examination of the various spectra of metals and alloys indicated
the great impurity of most of the metals used, and suggested the possi
bility of the coincidences observed by Thalen and others being explained
in the light of former work.
    It is observed that coincidences are particularly numerous in the
spectra of iron, titanium, and calcium, and that nearly every other solar
metallic spectrum has one or more lines coincident with lines of the last
element. These coincident lines are, as a rule, very variable in length and
intensity in various specimens of the metals in which they occur, and are
sometimes altogether absent.                       i
    One of the longest calcium lines, that at wave-length 4226-3, is also seen
in the strontium spectrum as a line of medium length ; and 4607"5, a very
long line in strontium, appears in calcium as a short line. Another very
long strontium line, 4215-3, is asserted by Thalén to be seen in calcium ;
 but the author has never seen it till lately, and then only in a specimen of
 calcium known      to contain strontium.
    We have here, then, a case of coincident lines, in which the one that
is long and bright in one spectrum is short and faint in the other, and a
 case of a line said to be coincident in two spectra being, though always
 visible in one, sometimes absent in the other of them, and only appear
ing in it when the two substances were mixed. The hypothesis of im
purity at once explains the whole        case, even  without the third line, which
renders the fact of mixture certain.
    The longest lines of calcium occur in iron, cobalt, nickel, barium, stron
 tium, &c. ; and the longest lines of iron occur in calcium, strontium, ba
 rium, and other metals.
    Other cases are adduced ; and the following general statements are
 hazarded, with a premise that further inquiry may modify them.
     1 . If the coincident lines of the metals be considered, those cases are
rare in which the lines are of the first order of length in all the spectra
to which they are common : those cases are much more frequent in which
they are long in one spectrum and shorter in the others.
    2. As a rule, in the instances of those lines of iron, cobalt, nickel,
 chromium, and manganese which are coincident with lines of calcium,
 the calcium lines are long, while the lines as they appear in the spectra
 of the other metals are shorter than the longest lines of those metals.
 Hence we are justified in assuming that short lines of iron, cobalt, nickel,
 chromium, and manganese, coincident with long and strong lines of cal
 cium, are really due to traces of the latter metal occurring in the former
 as an    impurity.

    3. In  cases  of coincidences of lines found between various spectra the
line may    be fairly assumed to belong to that one in which it is longest
and brightest.
    A  description of some photographs of spectra is then given, a photo
graph of the coincident lines of calcium and strontium being amongst
them, and proving that strontium occurs in the sun ; and the section
concludes with a brief description of the method employed in making the
new map, showing lengths and thicknesses, and enumerating coincident
lines.    This is done thus    : papers are pasted on to photographs of the
solar spectrum on glass ; the lengths of the lines of the metallic spec
trum under examination (e. g. that of iron) are marked on this paper in
prolongation     of the solar lines to which they correspond. They are then
copied upon a map; and another piece of paper being fixed down, another
spectrum is proceeded with in the same way.
   IV.   The preliminary inquiry into    the existence of elements in the Sun not
                                 previously traced.
    The previous      researches having shown that the former test for the
presence or absence of a metal in the sun, namely the presence or ab
sence of its brightest or strongest lines in the average solar spectrum, was
not conclusive,    a preliminary search for other metals was determined on ;
and as a guide, Mr. R. J. Friswell was requested to prepare two lists,
showing broadly the chief chemical characteristics of the elements traced
and not traced in the sun.
    The Tables showed that, in the main, those metals which had been traced
formed stable compounds with oxygen.
    The author therefore determined to search for the metals which formed
strong oxides, but which had not yet been traced.
    The result up to the present time has been that strontium, cadmium,
lead, cerium, and uranium would seem with considerable probability to
exist in the solar reversing layer.        Should the presence of cerium and
uranium be subsequently confirmed, the whole of the iron group of metals
will thus have been found in the sun.
    Certain metals forming unstable oxides, such as gold, silver, mercury,
&c. were sought for and not found. The same was the case when chlorine,
bromine, iodine, &c. were sought by means of their lines produced in tubes
by the jar-spark.        These elements are distinguishable       as a group  by
forming compounds with hydrogen.
    It  is observed that certain      elementary and compound gases effect
their principal absorption on the most refrangible part of the spectrum
when they are rare, and that as they become dense the absorption
approaches the less-refrangible end — that the spectra of compounds are
banded or columnar, the bands or columns lying at the red end of the
spectrum — that the absorption spectra of chlorine, iodine, bromine, Ac.
are columnar, and that these are broken up by the spark just as the band

   1873.]         Mr. J. N. Lockyer     on Spectrum- Analysis.              513
  spectra of compounds are broken up — and that it is probable that no
  compounds exist in the sun.        The following facts, gathered from the
  work already accomplished by Entherford and Secchi, are stated.
     There are three classes of stars : —
     1. Those like Sirius, the brightest (and therefore hottest ?) star in the
 northern sky, their spectra showing only hydrogen lines very thick, and
  metallic lines exceedingly thin.
     2. A class of stars with a spectrum differing only in degree from those
  of the class of Sirius ; and to this our sun belongs.
     3. A class of stars with columnar or banded spectra indicating the
  formation of compounds.
     The question is asked whether all the above facts cannot be grouped
  together in a working hypothesis, which assumes that in the reversing
  layers of the sun and stars various degrees of " celestial dissociation
                                                                               "
 are at work which prevents the coming together of the atoms which, at
 the temperature of the earth, and at all artificial temperatures yet attained
 here, form the metals, the metalloids, and compounds.
     In  other words, the metalloids are regarded as quasi compound bodies
  when in the state in which we know them ; and it is supposed that in the
 sun the temperature is too great to permit them to exist in that state in
 the reversing layer, though they may be found at the outer portions of
 the chromosphere or in the corona.
     It is suggested that, if this hypothesis should gain strength from sub
 sequent work, stony meteorites will represent the third class of metal-
 loidal or compound stars, and iron meteorites the other or metallic stars.
     The paper concludes as follows : —
     " An interesting physical speculation connected with this working
 hypothesis is the effect on the period of duration of a star's heat which
 would be brought about by assuming that the original atoms of which a
 star is composed are possessed of the increased potential energy of
 combination which this hypothesis endows them with. From the earliest
 phase of a star's life the dissipation of energy would, as it were, bring
into play a new supply of heat, and so prolong the star's life.
     " May it not also be, if chemists take up this question, which has
                                                      I
arisen from the spectroscopic evidence of what have before termed the
plasticity of the molecules of the metalloids taken as a whole, that much
of the power of variation which is at present accorded to metals may be
traced home to the metalloids ?      I need only refer to the fact that, so far
as   I can learn, all so-called changes of atomicity take place when metal
loids are involved, and not when the metals alone are in question.
    " As instances of these,     I may refer to the triatomic combinations
formed with chlorine, oxygen, sulphur, &c. in the case of tetrad or hexad
metals.     May not this be explained by the plasticity of the metalloids
in question ?
    " May we not from these ideas     be  justified in defining a metal, provi
                                                                2 s 5}

same as the radiation spectrum, while the metalloids are substances the

the plasticity of these latter comes into play, and we get a new mole
cular arrangement.         Hence are we not justified in asking whether the
change    from   oxygen to ozone is but a type of what takes place in all
metalloids?"

       OBITUARY NOTICES OF FELLOWS DECEASED.
    Wiixiam John Macquoen Eaioootb was born at Edinburgh on                 the
5th   July, 1820. He was the son of David Bankine (a lieutenant in          the
Eifle Brigade, and a younger son of Macquorn Bankine, of Drumdow, of
a  well-known family in the county of Ayr), and of Barbara Grahame, one
of the daughters of Archibald Grahame, of Dalmarnock, a banker in
Glasgow. He was educated partly at Ayr Academy, partly at the High
School of Glasgow, from which he went to the University of Edinburgh ;
but he derived much of his instruction from his father, and, like most
men who have made any real mark in science, he owed the greater part
of his knowledge to his own energy and industry. In 1836 he received
a gold medal for an essay on the Undulatory Theory of Light, and in
1838 he gained an extra prize for his essay on Methods of Physical
Investigation.       Shortly after this date he entered upon the profession of
Civil Engineering, as a pupil of Sir John McNeill, under whose direction
he was employed from 1839 to 1841 in various schemes for waterworks
and harbour-works in the north of Ireland, and on the Dublin and
Drogheda Railway. At this time he invented a method of setting out
curves which still bears his name.         From 1844 to 1848 he was employed,
under Locke and Errington, on the construction of the Clydesdale
Junction Eailway, and subsequently upon various            schemes promoted by
the Caledonian Railway.          In 1845-46 he was engineer of the proposed
Edinburgh and Leith waterworks, a scheme which was defeated by the
rival Edinburgh Water Company.                In 1852, he and the late John
Thompson were joint engineers of the well-known works by which
Glasgow is supplied with pure water from Loch Katrine. In November
of 1855 he was appointed Eegius Professor of Civil Engineering and
Mechanics in the University of Glasgow : he retained this chair until
his death, which occurred on the 24th December, 1872.
    It is difficult to determine whether Bankine takes his highest place as
an original investigator, or in respect of his great success in digesting
the scientific knowledge of himself and his contemporaries into a form
available for common use.         His works have the very rare merit of being
 thorough,   both   in a   scientific   and in a practical sense.  With great
 originality of treatment,       and    frequently of research, his text-books
 exhaust the useful theory of his subjects, and his results are always
 reduced to a form in which they can be actually used. His practice as
 an engineer had made him fully alive to the important difference between
 the crude     results  of theoretical     reasoning from principles and the
 reduced formula adapted         to   the  data obtainable from observation or
 specification.   There is probably no scientific writer to be compared with
 him in the three aspects of the extent covered by his treatises — their
 scientific accuracy and exhaustiveness and their immediate adaptation to
 the use of practical men, who may be utterly unable to follow the
 reasoning by which he arrived at his formulae. There are persons who
 think that the path-finder in science is of a higher and rarer order of
    vol. xxi.                                                        h

intelligence than the road-maker.       There are those who think otherwise ;
who consider that the latter frequently displays the broader and more
masculine intellect.      However this may be, all rational men agree in
awarding the highest meed of praise to those who can both find the path
and make the road, — who can say to the little children of science, so far
can you follow me — and to the maturer minds, from that point you may
extend my paths.        Of these men was Bankine.
    Bankine's most important contributions to science are in the dynamical
theory of heat, in the theory of the steam-engine, in that of waves in
liquids,   especially of sea-waves, and on the resistance and rolling of
ships.     He   was among the earliest students in this country who were
able to understand what was meant by thermodynamics.            He contributed
largely   to  the extension  and settlement  of the  theory, and, probably to a
greater extent than any other person, to its reduction to rules adapted
to the practice of engineers; indeed he may be considered one of the
founders of the science.       In the study of waves in liquids, he and Mr.
 William Froude appear to have been the first persons who successfully
worked out a possible theory of waves of finite displacement in the sea :
all the previous researches were either incomplete in theory or limited
to infinitesimal disturbance.      Eankine and Froude, working indepen
 dently of one another, appear to have been the first to arrive at a definite
 demonstration      of the mechanical possibility of the trochoidal ware.
 They were not the first to suggest that the trochoid was the clue to the
geometry of the sea-wave : Gerstner and Scott Eussell had already done
 that; -but it was Froude, in the 'Transactions of the Institution of
Naval Architects,' and Bankine, in the ' Transactions of the Royal
 Society,' who first gave proof that it complied with all the conditions of
 fluid motion, except that of the absence of molecular rotation.
    His study of the resistance of ships appears to have been suggested to
 him by an application addressed to him and to Professor (now Sir
William) Thomson by bis friend James Robert Napier, for advice as
                                                                              to
the power necessary to propel vessels of any form. Professor          Thomson
 then called attention to the defect in existing theories, with reference
to the resistance of water to    a ship's progress, from not taking account of
 the viscosity of the fluid.      Professor Bankine stated that if the re
 sistance outside a ship was the same as that inside a water-pipe, the
 power required to propel a certain vessel would be so and so, naming
                                                                               a
 power of about two thirds what Mr. Napier had estimated
                                                                         to be
 necessary.     Alluding to this, Professor Eankine wrote, in August 1858,
                                                               "

 a great body      of experiments   on the engine-power required to propei
 steamships of various sizes and figures at various speeds.        From those
 results  I  deduced a general formula for the resistance of ships haviBg
 such figures as usually occur in steamers, which, on the 23rd of    December.

1857, 1 communicated       to the owner of the experimental   data  ; and he
has   since applied it to practice with complete success."     This circum
stance   no doubt led to his addressing himself to the theory of ships.
With this object in view, he investigated the form and mechanical work
both of sea-waves and of waves in canals, the waves which accompany
ships, the loss of work consequent on the formation of divergent waves,
the stream-lines or lines of motion of water flowing past a ship, the
effect of the combined oscillation of a ship and a wave, the steadying
effect of keel-resistance, and many other important points of the hydraulics
of a ship.     On nearly all these points he did important original work,
although    in many of them the credit must be shared between bim and
others who were working abreast of him —notably Sir W. Thomson and
Mr. W. Froude. He also studied the question of propulsion, and placed
its theory on a sound basis. This branch of knowledge owes more to
Eankine than to any other writer.
   His principal published works are his ' Manual of Applied Mechanics,'
a volume of about 640 pages, published in 1858 ; his ' Manual of the
Steam-Engine and other Prime Movers,' a volume of 580 pages, pub
lished in 1859 ; his ' Manual of Civil Engineering,' a volume of 780
pages, published in 1862 ; his
                                   '
                                     Manual of Machinery and Millwork,' a
volume of 580 pages, published in 1869 ; and his book of ' Useful Rules
and Tables,' published in 1866. Besides these, he was the corresponding
editor of, and principal contributor to, the great work of ' Ship-building,
Theoretical and Practical,' by Watts, Napier, Barnes, and Eankine,
published in 1864-66. All these treatises have the great merits of being
exhaustive, dropping out or avoiding no part of their subject, of bringing
down their scientific information close upon the very date of their
publication, and of having all their results reduced to a workable form.
When it is added that they are terse and concise almost to a fault, and
that they cover the whole of the ground from simple addition to the appli
cation of elliptic functions id pure mathematics, and from the common
lever to the ellipsoids of stress and of rotation, and to the friction of
gases, in applied mathematics, some idea may perhaps be formed of the
immense mass of knowledge which Rankine succeeded not only in ac
quiring, but in reducing to a shape available in the every-day work of
 practical men.
    As an instance of the wide generality of his interest in scientific
 research, may be mentioned his papers in the 'Engineer' of 1869, in
which     he explained the curious dynamical   theory of the bicycle,  or two-
 wheeled velocipede, which had just then come into general use.         These
 papers are still the most complete treatise on the subject.
    The joint report of Professor Rankine and Dr. Stevenson Macadam
 on the accident which took place in 1872 at the Tradeston Elour-Mills,
 by the explosive firing of air charged with flour-dust, is also a most re
  markable proof of his power to handle work of a miscellaneous character.
     In the ' Catalogue of Scientific Papers,' compiled under the care of the

                                            iv
   Royal Society , Rankine is credited with eighty papers down to the year
   1865. He has published a very considerable number once that date.
  His last, and one of his most important contributions to the Philo
  sophical Transactions is that
                                      " On the Mathematical
                                                                Theory of Stream
  lines," read before the Royal Society on the 10th February, 1870. This
  paper contains a remarkably complete investigation of the lines of motion
  of particles of liquid in flowing past certain solid bodies, such as ships, and
  of the mechanical      as well as the geometrical character of the disturbance.
     It is  satisfactory to reflect that his labours met with full recognition
  during his lifetime from the scientific bodies best qualified to judge of
  their merits. In 1849 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of
  Edinburgh.       In   1850 he acted as Secretary to Section A of the British
  Association,    which then met at Edinburgh.          In 1845 he was elected a
  Member of the Philosophical Society of Glasgow, and in 1853 a Fellow of
  the Royal Society of London.            In 1854 he was awarded the Keith
  Medal of the Royal Society of Edinburgh for researches in Thermo
 dynamics.       In 1855 he was appointed one of the Visitors of Edinburgh
  Observatory, and in the same year Regius Professor of Civil Engineer
 ing and Mechanics in the University of Glasgow. He was also President
  of Section G of the British Association when it met in Glasgow in 1855.
  In 1856 he received the honorary degree of LL.D. of Trinity College,
 Dublin. In 1863 he was awarded the gold medal of the Institution of
 Engineers in Scotland for a paper
                                          " On the Liquefaction of Steam ; " and
 in the same year he was President of Section A of the British Association
 at Newcastle-on-Tyne.          In 1867 he was again President of Section G at
 Dundee. In December 1870 he was appointed a member of the Admiralty
 Committee on Ships of War, which arose out of the loss of H.M.S. 'Cap
 tain,' and he contributed largely to the scientific part of the report.
     His great industry and success in the field of science were never
 allowed to interfere with the ordinary duties owing to society, or with
 those sacrifices of time which all men are called upon to make for the
 gratification of others.       Thoroughly genial in company, affectionate and
 beloved in his family circle, careful and yet liberal in the relations of
 business, amiable and even       in temper, it was  as great a pleasure as it was
 an honour      to be counted among his friends.         He has not unfrequently
 sung a song of his own writing to music of      his  own  composing ; and, what
is more, the voice, the music, and the words were all worth listening to.
     His illness began by a failing of the eyesight, which was at first sup
                                                                                 of
posed to be local, but which afterwards proved to be but a symptom
more deeply seated disease.         Under treatment, he recovered from a    severe
attack of illness     in October   1872, and up to within five days of his death
no unfavourable symptoms occurred : then a change took place j
                                                                                he
rapidly lost the power of speech, and the sensibility of the right side.
He died on the 24th December, 1872.
    He was never married. His only brother died while he was yet young,
and he lost his father and his mother a year or two before his own death.

     John Bishop was bora on the 15th September, 1797, and died on the
29th September, 1873.       He was the fourth son of Samuel Bishop, Esq.,
of Pimperne, in the county of Dorset, and received his education at the
Grammar School of Mr. Longman at Childe Okeford in the same county,
where he remained several years. He was originally intended for the
legal profession ; but negotiations for this object having been broken off
through some misunderstanding between the contracting parties, he pur
sued for some time the idle but agreeable life of a country gentleman, and
his favourite field sports, hunting and shooting.    When about five and
twenty years of age, he was induced by his cousin, Mr. John Tucker, a
surgeon of Bridport, to enter the medical profession ; after a short pre
liminary study and practice at Bridport, he came to London, where he
entered at St. George's Hospital under Sir Everard Home. During his
studentdays he attended the lectures of Sir Charles Bell, then in his zenith,
of Mr. Guthrie, Dr. George Pearson, and the Chemical Courses at the
Boyal Institution.     In 1824 he obtained the diploma of the Boyal College
of Surgeons, and in 1851 was elected a Member of the Council of the
College, where he retained a seat for nearly twelve years.  In 1844, having
previously published a paper in the Philosophical Transactions on the
Physiology of the Human Voice, he was elected a Fellow of the Boyal
Society, and a Corresponding Member of the Medical Societies of Berlin
and Madrid. About this time he also obtained from the Boyal Academy
of Sciences, Paris, two prizes for memoirs on the Human and Comparative
                                                                              '
Anatomy and Physiology of Voice. He contributed to Todd's * Cycloptedia
the articles " Larynx," " Motion," and " Voice," and was the author of
works on Distortions of the Human Body, on Impediments                     of
Speech,    and  on  Hearing and Speaking      Instruments.     These  works,
together with several minor contributions to medical literature, gained for
Mr. Bishop the well-deserved reputation of a careful and skilful observer,
and are remarkable for the evident pains taken by the author to examine
and do justice to whatever had been written by others upon the subject
 he had under consideration, and, where practicable, to prove by mathe
 matical demonstration    every theory he himself advanced.
     During his career Mr. Bishop held the offices of Senior Surgeon to the
 Islington Dispensary, Surgeon to the Northern Dispensary, to the St.
 Pancras Dispensary, and to the Drapers' Benevolent Institution.     In 1852
 he was elected President of the Medical Society of London, and held the
 offices of Trustee, Councillor, Orator, and Lettsomian Lecturer to the
 Society.    He was also for many years, and at the time of his death, one
 of the managers of the Russell Institution. He was a man of considerable
 energy of character; and although undemonstrative in his manner, entered
 zealously into any business he undertook, and exercised great personal
 influence upon his colleagues.     His judgments, deliberately formed and
 carefully expressed, carried considerable weight with them, and influenced

the decision of many a council meeting.       He had the tact of opposing
without irritating ; and even those to whom on questions of public business
he might find himself opposed, were ever ready to do justice to the honesty
of purpose and singleness of aim by which he was actuated.          Of many
and varied attainments, an etnhusiastic admirer     of music and of art, con
versant with continental as with English literature, he continued until
within a few months of his death to take an active interest in all the dis
coveries and achievements of modern science.         The philosophical bias
given to his mind by the eloquent teachings of Sir Charles Bell remained
with him to the last, and was manifested both in his writings and in his
conversation.
    Full of years, tended by those he loved, conscious of having gained and
 maintained to the last an honourable if not distinguished reputation, at
 Btrangeways-Marshall,    Dorset, within a few miles of his birthplace, this
 estimable life drew to a close. It is no exaggeration to say that by all
 who were acquainted with him Mr. Bishop was respected and esteemed ;
but only those who knew him intimately can bear full testimony to the
kindly feeling and genial worth that preeminently characterized the subject
of this imperfect memoir.
    Bald win FraWcis     Dttppa  was the eldest    son of Baldwin     Francis
Duppa, B.A. (Oxon.), and Barrister-at-law.       His parents spent the first
few years of their married life abroad ; and their eldest son and first child
was born, February 18, 1828, at Eouen in Normandy. His early taste for
experimental investigation involved young Duppa in a most disastrous
accident ; for when he was only seven years old he poured the contents
of a powder-flask into the fire, causing an explosion which shattered his
hand, blinded him for some time, and deprived him of the use of a thumb
for L'fe.
   He received his early education at the celebrated school of M. de Fellen-
berg at Hof wyl near Berne, where he was the intimate companion of Henri
the grandson of De Saussure.       Here he acquired a good knowledge of
French, German, and Swiss-German, and spoke the first two languages
 at that time so well that in returning from Switzerland he was twice
taken for a runaway from school (once for a French boy and once for a
 German), and had some trouble     to persuade the diligence officials to let
 him pass. To these languages he subsequently added Italian and Arabic.
It was one of the features at Hofwyl that each boy should learn some
useful trade during play hours ; and young Duppa took up carpentering,
becoming very expert in the making of ornamental boxes and other small
articles.   To this early development of mechanical skill was doubtless
due some of that extraordinary manipulative power and fertility of in
vention which afterwards characterized his laboratory work.          Quickly
seizing upon the essential conditions for the performance of a given
chemical operation, the prompt construction of the
                                                        necessary apparatus,

                                              vii
out of any materials which happened to be at hand, seemed to cost him
no trouble : glass, wood, and metal were all alike made to obey his hand ;
and the suggestion of an experiment, chemical or physical, had not usually
to wait many hours for its realization.
    Duppa retained to the last a great affection                for this school, often
speaking of the happiness of the life he led there and of the excellency
of the training, in the highest terms, and contrasting it with an English
school to which he was afterwards             sent, where he was very unhappy and
learnt nothing.       At Hofwyl there were no rewards and no punishments
strictly   so called,  and the pupils were encouraged to cultivate habits of
observation.
    When only twelve years old he lost his father, who died at the early
age of thirty-seven.        He was now removed from the Swiss school after
spending only three years there ; nevertheless he always contended that
he received his education at Hofwyl.               After leaving the English school
he had some private tuition, and then proceeded to Cambridge, where
he made the acquaintance of Prof. W. Hallowes Miller, for whom
he ever afterwards        retained a warm regard.            He left Cambridge with
out taking a degree, and began to read for the bar ; but finding the
sedentary work utterly repugnant to his tastes, he abandoned it and
went to Italy for three years to recruit his health, which was, even at
this time, by no means strong.              Here he turned to account the know
ledge of mineralogy which he had acquired at Cambridge, and made a
small collection of rare and interesting minerals.                Returning from Italy
in the year 1854, he determined to devote himself to the study of
Chemistry.        With this view he entered the Royal College of Chemistry
as a pupil of Dr. Hofmann in the autumn of 1855.                      We find him in
 1857 engaged upon his first original investigation on the action of sul
phuric acid upon salicylic acid, by which he obtained sulphosalicylic acid*.
He afterwards prepared and investigated bromide of titanium. On
leaving the College of Chemistry he fitted up a laboratory in his country
seat at Hollingbourne near Maidstone, where, in conjunction                             with
Mr. W. H. Perkin, he commenced a series of most interesting and im
portant investigations on the substitution products of acetic, malic, and
succinic acids, which culminated in one of the greatest achievements of
synthetical chemistry — the artificial production of tartaric acid.                   These
researches are described in seven memoirs published in the Philosophical
Magazine and the Journal of the Chemical Societyt.
    Finding his residence at Hollingbourne severed him almost entirely
from    scientific  associates, he abandoned his private laboratory, came
  in 1860 to reside in London, and worked for some months in the
laboratory of Dr. Frankland at St. Bartholomew's                   Hospital.        Here he

  devoted himself in the first instance to a study of the modern delicate
  methods of gas-analysis.     Over these his great manipulative skill soon
  gave him the complete mastery.       At that time Frankland was engaged
  n the investigation of the action of zincethyl upon boric ethylate ; and in
  this research Duppa eagerly joined.       The first results were recorded in
  a joint paper communicated to the Eoyal Society in July 1860*.                 In
 this paper, the discovery of boric ethide, boric etho-diethylate, and boric
 etho-dihydrate was announced, and the chief properties of these bodies
 described.    The materials    for this paper had scarcely been obtained,
 when Duppa's health became so seriously impaired that he was obliged
 to leave England and spend a couple of years in Italy and Algeria,
 whence he returned in 1863 and rejoined Frankland, who had, in the
 mean time, been translated      to the laboratory of the Eoyal Institution.
  Here, in the quiet of a gloomy room in the basement, the two chemists,
 free from the wearing duties of teaching the elements of the science,
 devoted themselves heart and soul to original research ; the inventive and
 constructive skill of Duppa, aided by the liberality of the Managers of
 the Institution, soon transformed this gloomy cell into a laboratory
 which might be fairly regarded as a model of convenience for the class
 of work carried on in it. At first the neighbours were loud in their
 complaints of bad odours ; but it was discovered that these could be
 obviated   by securely closing the windows of the laboratory, which
 was done. The atmosphere inside was thus rendered anything but
 agreeable ; it was, indeed, sometimes so highly charged with vapours as
 almost to prevent the eye from penetrating from one side of the room to
 the other : but this was not found to be an unmitigated evil ; it effectu
 ally prevented those interruptions to work which are so common in
London ; for no non-worker could bear in the room more than a few
minutes, and rarely visited it a second time.          One visitor nearly fainted,
and had to be quickly removed to fresh air to revive him.           Thanks to the
Eoyal Institution Eesearch Fund, and to the Government Grant admi
nistered by the Eoyal Society, the means for the purchase of apparatus
and chemicals were never wanting.
    From this laboratory there issued in three years no less than fourteen
papers, of which Duppa was the joint author, descriptive of original re
searches, and published in the Philosophical Transactions,               the Pro
ceedings of the Eoyal Society, and the Chemical Society's Journal.
    These researches related, first, to the synthetical genesis of acids of
the lactic, acetic, and acrylic series ; secondly, to the production of com
pounds of mercury with the organic radicals methyl, ethyl, and amyl :
thirdly, to the synthetical formation of ketones ; and fourthly, to the
transformation     of organo-mercury compounds             into organo-zinc com
pounds.     The records of these researches constitute the best testimony

 to the enthusiastic  zeal with which Mr. Duppa prosecuted chemical iu-
 vestigatiou duriug these years.
    In 1867 Dr. Frankland resigned his professorship at the Koyal
 Institution ; and Mr. Duppa accompanied him to the private laboratory at
the Government College of Chemistry, which was then in its old quarters in
 Oxford Street ; but the meagre resources of this laboratory could not,
 even in his hands, be turned to account for the prosecution of these in
 vestigations, and the work had to be abandoned in          despair ; or rather
it was postponed in anticipation of the completion of the new laboratories
at South Kensington, which had been promised from year to year. At
length, early in the present year, the new research laboratory was par
tially completed, and Duppa, all eagerness to recommence the work so long
in abeyance, took a house in London, solely to enable him to prosecute
his chemical labours.      Alas ! it was too late. Before he could again
 resume that which always afforded him so much pure pleasure, he was
attacked    by the malady which prematurely        cut short his useful life.
He died of consumption at Budleigh-Salterton, Devonshire, on the 10th
of November,    aged forty-five years, retaining his interest in experimental
science to the last.     A few hours before his death he dictated a long
letter, accompanied    by a diagram, to Professor Tyndall on a curious
optical phenomenon which he had recently observed.
   Mr. Duppa was elected a Fellow of the Koyal Society in 1867. He
married in 1869 Adeline Frances Mary Dart, the only surviving child of
J. H. Dart, Esq., Barrister-at-Law, of Beech House near Kingwood, Hants.
He leaves a widow and one child. He was a warm-hearted and faithful
friend, and, as a landowner and Justice of the Peace in Kent, he
was well known and much esteemed. His devotion to science did not
prevent his taking a deep interest in art.       He was a painter of no in
considerable ability ; and from his frequent wanderings in search of
health in France, Spain, Switzerland, Italy, Algeria, and Madeira he
always brought home his portfolio well filled with beautiful and in
teresting sketches, in which he sometimes embodied the effects of ancient
and modern volcanic and glacial action with great vividness and truth.
   Having a small private fortune, he never applied for nor held any
scientific  appointment.      He always entertained a disinclination to
lecturing and public speaking. Had this been otherwise, he could scarcely
have failed to make his mark as a lecturer on his favourite science ; for
in conversation he had few rivals in popular scientific exposition, and in
the laboratory perhaps none in devising appropriate experimental illus
trations of chemical phenomena.         He was one of that small band of
enthusiastic and disinterested    amateur labourers who have performed so
large a proportion   of the original scientific work of this country, and of
whom England may justly feel proud.
