I. "    The Absorption-spectra of the Alkaloids."                 By W. N.
        Hartley,     F.R.S., Professor of Chemistry, Royal College of
        Science, Dublin. Received November 19, 1884.
                                    (Abstract.)
     While    studying the molecular constitution of various organic
substances      by means of their action on the ultra-violet rays in the
manner described in the
                                  "
                                    Philosophical Transactions," vol. 170,
p. 257, 1879, it was considered of importance           to ascertain whether
absolute physical measurements could not be substituted               for the
uncertain chemical         reactions and variable physiological tests at
 present    employed    as  a means of detecting the alkaloids in medico
 legal examinations.        About forty alkaloids and derivatives there
 from have been examined, authentic specimens having been pro
 cured from the chemists by whom they were prepared. Solutions were
 carefully made of the same strength in most cases, only diactinic
 solvents,    most generally alcohol, being employed.         The cells with
 quartz sides for holding the solutions were of various thicknesses,
 ranging from 1 mm. to 20 mm.            The electrodes employed to give a
 well-defined spectrum consisted, one of an alloy of tin with 25 per
 cent. cadmium, the other of lead with cadmium in the same propor
  tion.    Spectra are thus obtained with lines of the same intensity,
  numerous and evenly distributed throughout a spectrum extending

 from wave-length 4414-5 to 2145-8. The prominent lines of cadmium
 are distinguished by their extension across the spectrum from pole to
 pole, while those of lead are on one side only and those of tin on the
 other.   As a weaker continuous spectrum fills the intervals between
 the lines, there is no difficulty in obtaining accurate measurements.
 To secure well-defined spectra the photographs were taken with the
 solutions placed in front of the slit, upon which the rays from the
 sparks were concentrated by a quartz lens of 2 inches diameter
 and 3 inches focal length.     The spectra were measured by means of
 an ivory scale applied to the surface of the photographs ; this had
bevilled edges and was divided thereon into hundredths of an inch.
 The linear measurements are termed scale numbers and are arbitrary,
but they were reduced to wave-lengths by the use of an interpolation
curve.    The oscillation frequencies were also read off on a second
curve whenever it was considered desirable to record them.             The
wave-lengths     were taken from those published in the " Philosophical
Transactions," vol. 175, p. 63, 1884, but for use in recording these
measurements the fractions of a tenth-meter were disregarded.          The
total number of lines employed, including two or three air-lines, was
seventy. For the convenience of those who maybe engaged in similar
work, the wave-lengths of the lines and their reciprocals are given
on page 3.      The wave-lengths of a magnesium line and a calcium
triplet are also inserted, as it is sometimes convenient to refer to them.
   The absorption curves which have been drawn differ from those
figured in my previous communications, owing to the use of wave
length numbers.       The curves have been made continuous, and so the
necessity for shading has been avoided ; but very careful descriptions
of the spectra are furnished in addition, so that no detail has been
omitted.    Nearly all the samples of alkaloids examined were obtained
from Messrs. T. and H. Smith and Co., of Edinburgh, Mr. David
Howard, of the firm of Howard and Sons, of Stratford, and Dr. C. R. A.
Wright, F.R.S. The bodies may be divided into two groups, those
which exhibit spectra with absorption-bands         and those with con
tinuous spectra.

  The    conclusions to    be drawn from this investigation are the follow
rag:—
                                                                      B 2

4               The Absorption-spectra    of the Alkaloids.     [Dec.  llr
    1. The absorption- spectra offer a ready and valuable means of ascer
taining the purity of preparations of the alkaloids, and particularly
of establishing their identity.
    The quantity of some of the alkaloids present in a solution may be
estimated by means of the absorption curves.
    The different character of the various specimens known as aconi-
tines may be recognised ; thus the comparatively harmless base may
be distinguished from those of great physiological activity by its
transmission of a continuous spectrum, while the three specimens of
physiologically active aconitines are distinguished from one another by
their characteristic absorption curves.
    That the three active aconitine bases are substances each with a
 different chemical constitution, is a conclusion confirmed by optical
 examination.
    The purity of quinine and absence of any admixture of cinchonine
can be readily determined by reason of the latter substance being
much less diactinic than the former ; but for the same reason quinine
cannot be estimated in presence of cinchonine.      Drugs of such potency
as aconitine,  morphine,   quinine, strychnine, &c, which ought to be
prescribed only when of absolute purity, should have their exact
nature and degree of purity guaranteed by an examination of their
absorption-spectra.
    2. In comparing   the spectra of substances of similar constitution,
it is observed that such as are derived from bases by the substitution
of an alkyl radical for hydrogen and acid radicals for hydroxyl, the
curve    is not altered in character,    but may vary in length when
equal weights of substances are examined.           This is explained by
the absorption-band     being dependent upon    the compactness of struc
ture of the carbon and nitrogen nucleus of the molecule, and because
equal weights are not molecular weights.        Examples are afforded by
 morphine    and codeine (methyl-morphine), diacetyl-code'ine,        and
tetracetyl-morphine.
    3. Bases which contain oxidised radicals, as hydroxyl, carboxyl, or
 methoxyl, diminish in diactinic quality in proportion to the amount of
 oxygen they contain.     Examples are papaverine, narceine, narcotine,
 and oxynarcotine.
     The apo-derivatives are less diactinic than the parent bases in a
 degree which indicates that the molecular weights have been nearly
 doubled.    Examples are apo-morphia and pseudaconitine.
    4. Bodies with the pyridine and quinoline nucleus exhibit absorp
 tion-bands extending between wave-lengths 350 and 280, those with
 a benzene nucleus generally from 290 to 260, or rays even more
 refrangible ; while the aconitines and opium bases, likewise strychnine,
 give evidence of a benzene nucleus, the cinchona bases, with piperine
 and brucine, appear to contain a nucleus of quinoline or pyridine.

 1L  " On the Function of the Thyroid Gland." By Professor
       Victor Hobsley, B.S., M.B., F.R.C.S. Communicated by
       Professor M. Foster, Sec. R.S. Received December 5,
       1884.
                       (Preliminary Communication.)
   Up till the year      1883 the      function of the thyroid gland was
 unknown, and considered to be of slight importance, at least to the
 adult animal.
   The theories concerning      its function were —
                                                   " Phil. Trans.," 1844, &c.,
   (1.) The one propounded by Mr. Simon,
\iz., that the thyroid body acted as a regulator of the circulation in
the brain, and possibly manufactured          some substance which was of
primary importance for the nutrition of the central nervous system.
   (2.) That it was a true gland, and secreted a mucinous albuminoid
into the cavities of its acini, the secretion being reabsorbed by the
lymphatics.
   (3.) The thyroid gland has also from time to time been compared to
the spleen as an haemapoietic organ.
   Although the intimate relationship of goitre to cretinism has been
well known for many centuries, the fact that excision of the partially
goitrous thyroid in comparatively healthy people was followed by
severe   symptoms of cretinism was first announced last year by Pro
fessor Kocher, of Berne, who collected 160 cases in which the opera
tion had been partially or wholly performed.            In the latter class of
his own cases he found the patients, without exception, had become
cretinous.
   The symptoms described by Kocher were recognised by Dr. Semon*
as similar to those of Myxcedema, and he advanced the theory that the
conditions were allied.     My experiments have proved the truth of this
view, since    I  have produced the condition of myxcedema by simply
excising (with strict antiseptic precautions and operating so as to
avoid all nerve trunks) the thyroid gland in the monkey.
   Schilf in Geneva, Wagner in Vienna, and Sanquineco and Canalis
in Turin, have made similar experiments on dogs, but they do not
appear to have found the myxcedematous condition ; simply, it
appears, because, for one reason or another, their animals did not
survive the operation        long enough to develop the pathological
changes.
   However, they show that in the dog careful ablation of the thyroid
gland is followed by severe nervous symptoms, which commence a
few hours, or days, after the operation, by fibrillar contractions and
                       • " Brit. Med. Jour.," Not. 30, 1883.

                              Prof. Victor     Horsley.                [Dec.  llr
 tremors in all the muscles of the body. These tremors soon become
 clonic spasms, and ultimately paroxysms of true tetanus, as a result of
 which the animal dies a few days after the operation.
     It is clear then that in dogs the thyroid gland has an intimate con
 nexion with the central nervous system.
     In the monkey, excision of the thyroid, just as in the dog, may be
followed immediately by fibrillar contractions of the muscles of the
extremities, but, as a rule, the animal remains perfectly well for five
days.
    The tremor at its first appearance is uniform, and has a wave rate
of 8-10 per second.
    In forty-eight hours, as a rule, it becomes paroxysmal, i.e., exhibits
recurring exaggerations, the paroxysms being of variable duration
and interval, but giving a new character to the tracing, owing to the
powerful movements of the limbs, &c.
    The uniform tremor persisting between the paroxysms now has, as
a rule, a wave rate of 16 to 20 per second.
    These symptoms persist, as a rule, about twenty days ; they then
decline, the paroxysms disappearing slowly, but ceasing before the
constant tremor.
    During the whole of this time there is          rigidity and paresis* of the
muscles affected.
    Moreover, the symptoms of the disease termed Myxoedema                    by
Dr. Ord, and ordinary cretinism are gradually developed.
    For—
    The animal becomes gradually more and more imbecile and apathetic,
sitting, as it does, huddled up and taking no notice of anything, in
strong contrast to its customary vivacious state.
    It exhibits swellings of the skin of the face, abdomen, &c, due to
infiltration of the tissues by mucin. (This change, visible to the
naked eye, has been chemically established by my friend Dr. Halli
burton, B.Sc., whose results are published in accompanying table.)
    The salivary glands become enormously hypertrophied, and the
parotid gland, which normally secretes a watery, serous fluid, now
takes up a muciparous function,! and produces quantities of mucin.
    This increase of function is interesting, as probably offering a clue
for further investigation into the physiology of secretion.
    The blood is profoundly changed : there is a decrease of red cor
puscles, and a primary increase of the leucocytes, followed by a
decrease, oligemia thns resulting. Moreover, it contains mucin in
proportion to the duration of life after the operation, and the serum
albumin is diminished.

  The temperature, slightly raised by the operation, becomes variable,
and then after about twenty-five days, gradually sinks far below the
normal,     and the animal dies comatose.
  It is proved by examination of the parts that in the operation the
thyroid gland only was removed, the surrounding structures being
uninjured ; consequently the thyroid gland may now be looked upon
as being of extreme importance in the animal economy, and especially
in relation to three points —
  (1.) The nutrition of the nervous system.
  (2.) The existence of mucin in the body.
  (3.) The composition of the blood.

       and their Relation to the Peritoneum."            By C. B. Lock-
       wood.    Communicated by W. S. Savory,           F.R.S. Received
       November 18, 1884.
                                (Abstract.)
    The paper begins by explaining that it records an endeavour to
elucidate the course and relations of the abdominal blood-vessels upon
developmental grounds.      The earliest stages of the development of the
midgut and its mesentery are first described ; and it is shown that
vessels extend at very frequent intervals from the dorsal aorta to the
intestine, reaching the latter by way of the mesentery.        The develop
ment of the stomach is mentioned, and the gastric artery is identified
as one of the original arteries of the mesentery.        The effects which
the various alterations in the position of the stomach have upon its
blood     supply are discussed, and are considered to account for
peculiarities in the course of the gastric artery. The splenic artery is
reviewed next, and it is explained how both it and the spleen are deve
loped between the layers of the mesogastrium ; evidence is adduced
 to show that the vessel, even in the adult, reaches its destination by
 passing through the mesogastrium, and it is maintained that this
 fact determines the relations of the artery to the greater and lesser
 cavities of the peritoneum.    Next the very long arterial loops of the
 great omentum are discussed ; as the omentum is nothing but the
 elongated mesogastrium it is argued that they represent the original
 vessels of that fold. The hepatic artery comes next, and the pro
 trusion of the liver from the midgut is described, and afterwards the
 development of the lesser omentum.        The hepatic artery is shown to
 be one of the original arteries of the mesentery of that part of the
 gut from which the liver grew.        This fact is shown to explain the
 relations of the vessel to the peritoneum and foramen of Winslow,
 and also it is made use of to explain certain abnormalties of the
 artery. It is pointed out that as the original function of the hepatic
 artery in the embryo is to supply the bowel so it continues to afford
  branches to it in the adult. The arteries of the small intestine and
 pancreas are reviewed.      With regard to the latter it is explained
 how    the organ is developed from the duodenum, and extends along
  the mesoduodenum into the mesogastrium where it impinges upon
 the spleen and its artery ; this, it is argued, accounts for the sources
  of its blood supply.     The manner in which the pancreas becomes
  situated behind the peritoneum instead of between the layers is after
  wards attributed to the unfolding of the peritoneum between the
  mesogastrium     and the transverse      mesocolon    (i.e., the original

   1884.]     On Limnocodium Sowerbii, Allman and Lankester.               9
  mesentery of the transverse colon before it becomes related to the
  omentum).       The colic arteries are briefly dismissed with the excep
  tion of the middle ; this vessel is discussed at greater length
  owing to the doubts which exist concerning the development and
 anatomy of the transverse mesocolon.             An attempt is made to
  refute the adhesion theory advocated by Haller, and to explain how
  it is quite possible for the mesocolon to consist of two layers instead
 .of four.
     In conclusion the following principles are deduced : —
     First. That the arteries of the abdomen, including the splenic and
 hepatic, were originally derived from the dorsal aorta for the supply
 of the midgut.
     Second. That they reach their destinations by passing through the
 mesentery.
     Third. That they participate in all the changes           the mesentery
 undergoes.
     Fourth. That if an organ is developed in the mesentery or from
 the gut, it will obtain part at least of its blood supply from the
 vessels of the mesentery or gut, and that these will conform to the
preceding rules.
     It is finally remarked that although these observations have only
been applied to the human subject, yet they appear so simple and so
likely to be true that it is probable that they have a much wider
applicability.

         Sowerbii, Allman and Lankester.               By Alfrkd GlBBS

        College, London. Communicated by E. Ray Lankester,
        M.A., F.R.S. Received December 8, 1884.
     It is now four and a-half years since the Medusae of Limnocodium
were discovered by Mr. Sowerby, in the Victoria tank in the gardens
of the Royal Botanic Society, at Regent's Park.
     Since that time Professor Lankester has continued to make obser
vations and experiments, in which         I  have assisted, with the view of
elucidating their life-history and the conditions of their somewhat ano
malous occurrence. -We discovered, however, nothing which threw any
light upon the subject.        On November 27th we had an opportunity of
seeing the tank at the Botanical Gardens, immediately after the with
drawal of the water, and        I  then collected and examined at Professor
Lankester's request      a large quantity of the sediment and portions of
various roots and other submerged objects.

                             The Hydroid Form.
   I  discovered upon some of the root filaments of the plants of
Pontederia which were growing in the tank in great profusion, an
organism, which in its method of growth somewhat resembles an
encrusting sponge. It occurs very abundantly upon some of the
roots, and is not to be found upon others.        I am unfortunately unable
to say whether the roots upon which it occurs were near together
or scattered through the tank.        I  have not seen it upon any young
roots, while on the other hand it is most abundant upon the oldest
and blackest roots.      Where most abundant there are four or five

 pieces of different size and shape upon any one filament.        The smallest
 pieces are mere knobs, and about -j^y of an inch long ; the largest are
 prolonged into three or four lobes, about a of an inch long.
    No tentacles are present. They may develop subsequently.                 The
 basal portion tends slightly to spread over its area of attachment, this
 portion half encircling a root-filament.
    There is no trace of a true perisarc, but the surface is covered with
particles of mud and other debris, which become glued together by
some secretion of the animal, and form a sort of tubular casing.               In
some specimens which        I have mounted I have observed this casing
slipping off, owing to shrinkage of the animal.
   The tip of a lobe usually projects beyond this tube, but sometimes
in specimens placed in cold water it withdraws itself sluggishly into
the tube.
   The organism does not exhibit any active movement, but upon irri
tation there is a slight contraction, such as described above, and
accompanying this there may be an expulsion of fluid and minute
particles from the extremity of each lobe, demonstrating the existence
of an aperture to each, which presumably serves as a mouth.
   The animal throws off nematocysts when irritated.
   Preparations of the stained animal mounted whole and serial sec
tions have revealed further points in its structure.
   The ectoderm cells are fairly uniform throughout, and present
numerous nematocysts.
   The endoderm cells are much modified in the " mouth
                                                                  "

at the apex    of each  lobe, being   set very closely together,  and   staining
very deeply with carmine.
   In preserved specimens there is only a very minute lumen, leading
from the terminal aperture.
   Lower down the endoderm cells have a clear swollen appearance,
and almost fill up the enteric cavity.          In the basal region the endo
derm cells are normal, and the cavity is well developed, and may
contain particles. The peculiar arrangement of endoderm cells near
the apex may have no special significance, but it somewhat suggests in
appearance the rudiment of a sub-umbrella found in such forms as
Hydroctinia, Podocoryne, and Hippopodius, figured by Ed. Van Beneden,
and more recently by Weissmann.*

   During the summer of 1883        I  discovered both in water taken direct
from    the  tank  at   the Botanic Gardens and in jars in which the
Medusae had been kept alive for some time, minute vesicles consisting
of ectodermic and endodermic layers, surrounding a closed central

cavity in which particles were           apparently undergoing digestion.
Between     the ectoderm      and endoderm     more or less gelatinous tissue
was always developed, separating the two layers.             I was prevented
from carrying my observations very far, owing to the sudden dis
appearance of all the Medusae from the tank.           I therefore propose to
reserve further details for a future occasion.           It may, however, be
useful as a guide for further observations if       I state that I ascertained
these vesicles to be formed by a nipping off of the genital sac after the
liberation of the ripe spermatozoa.        I kept these vesicles in isolated
vessels and examined them from day to day for four or five days,
during which they underwent certain changes, but these changes were
somewhat irregular, an irregularity owing possibly to the unfavourable
conditions, possibly to the lateness of the season, all Medusae being
about to disappear.
   The mere fact that all the Medusae      I  could keep long enough under
observation    threw off all their genital sacs in a similar way, and that
these vesicles lived for so long a time without disintegrating, points
to this being some regular process of reproduction.
   I repeated part of these observations during last summer, but was
unable to continue them, owing to the short period during which the
Medusae flourished this year.

                                General Remarks.
   That this new and in many ways most remarkable hydroid, appear
ing in fresh water in great quantities, in the tank where Limnocodium
appeared, and upon the roots of a plant which was introduced just
before Limnocodium appeared, is a phase in the life-cycle of Limno
codium seems so highly probable, that we may take it for granted at
present.     Incontestable proof will,     I  hope, be furnished next spring
by tracing its further development.
   As it seems extremely probable that during next summer we may
be able to explain fully the life-cycle of this most interesting orga
nism, it is not necessary to devote much time now to speculating upon
 what that cycle will probably be.
    The connexion of the organism with Pontederia, first suggested by
 Professor Lankester,     seems to be borne out by the fact that only upon
 the Pontederia    roots can we find the hydroid form.       That the Limno
 codium  did not establish itself at Kew may be owing to the fact that
 there was no Pontederia in that tank.
    In dealing with the hydroid form here described, we must remember
 that Limnocodium is undoubtedly one of the Trachomedusae.                 No
 trachyline   form   has before  this been  shown   to be connected  with any
 hydroid condition, but we know less about the Trachomedusae than

 about   the  Medusae    derived   from Gymnoblastic      or Calyptoblastic
 hydroids. Direct development has been shown to occur in two or
 three genera of the Trachylinsa (Geryonia, JEgineta, &c), whereas
 regarding the life-cycle of the other forms we know nothing.
    The hydroid here described is now in an immature condition. It
 may be a creeping stolon, which when further developed will resemble
 other hydroids ; it may turn out not to be comparable to other
 hydroids, and to be a fixed sporosac of some kind ; but if it grows into
 an adult form resembling the form at present known, it may serve as
 the type of a new group of hydroids related to the Trachyline
Medusoids.

as these   notes on the fossil plants must necessarily be at the present
stage, they will,    I  trust, serve to disclose how enormously increased
our knowledge must become when the study of these plants shall
have been completed.            An interpretation of them, very different to
that   current prior to the investigations undertaken by means of the
grant, is now possible, affecting questions far beyond the immediate
issues.    That this preliminary notice may be confined to the briefest
treatment that the subject admits, I have refrained from encumbering
it with purely geological matter, and as far as possible I have avoided
theoretical considerations.             The former I have embodied in two
papers to be laid before the Geological Society, and the latter             I have
already   discussed    in  a lecture    to the Belfast  Field  Naturalists' Club, I
am happy to think with the result that many of the subjects pointed
out as requiring further investigation have already received attention
that bids fair to set some of the most unsettled questions at rest.
                                       Balhjpalady.
   The collection     I have    made consists of several hundred specimens,
procured mainly from the piles of ore waiting shipment on the quays
at Belfast, as well as in situ in the quarries.            Mr. Stuart, F.L.S., has
since collected for the Belfast Museum, and has allowed me to make
the   fullest   use   of the specimens, but          I  have not yet thoroughly
examined the collections            in  Dublin    previously made by Mr. Baily.
 The present collection could be largely and easily supplemented.               The
 plants   occur   in   a  ferruginous       and  indurated    sandy clay, and the
matrix is not very favourable for the preservation of the fine vena
tion of   leaves.
   Ferns. — These      are    very rare.       A   macerated    pinna indicates   a
Pteris,  with undulating mid-rib and crenate margin, belonging pro
bably to   an Arctic fossil species. Other fragments agree with Benitzia
minima,    Saporta and Marion, from the Heersien stage of Gelinden.
    Conifers.
              — These are relatively very numerous, and six plates and
a half have already been published of them by the Palaeontographical
 Society.    The Cupressinece are represented by a very abundant form,
 indistinguishable      from the existing Cupressus torulosa of the Hima
 layas, and  probably identical with the Chamcecyparis belgica of Saporta
 and Marion.       The somewhat starved Crtjptomeria, formerly Sequoia
 Du Noyeri, is the only member of the Taxodiece, and seems identical
 with the Sequoia subulata of the Arctic so-called Upper Cretaceous.
 Some twigs look like Taxus.             There are two Pines, both characteristic
 of the warmest regions in which Pines now exist ; there are some
 leathery   cones referable     to Tsuga, and a seed very possibly of Abies.
  All except  the  latter   and  Taxus are very abundant. Mr. Baily includes
  Taxodium in his list, but       I  do not know upon what grounds, and the

16        Mr. J.  Starkie Gardner.     Fossil Plants and  the  [Dec. 18,
figure of Torellia rigida, by Baily, is certainly no more than a frag
ment of a monocotyledonous leaf.
    Monocotyledons. — These are of the usual character, proving that
several reedy plants are present.     One of these is evidently the plant
known as Typha latissima, and in some cases the reticulated venation
is exquisitely preserved.
    Dicotyledons. — The leaves of about five-and-twenty species of trees
or shrubs have been obtained, a fourth of which may perhaps even
tually prove determinable.       There is fruit or foliage of an Aluns,
apparently identical with the Arctic fossil A. Kefersteini.    The most
abundant leaf does not seem distinguishable from Celastrophyllum
Benedeni, Saporta and Marion, of the Gelinden Heersien, and one of
the widespread type of leaves known as Cinnamomum is represented.
The same water-lily, Nelumbium Buchii, Ett., that is met with at
Monte Promina and in the Aquitanian of Switzerland, is also present
here.    Of the remainder, the pieces of MacClintochia and of the oak
like leaf of Glenarm Quercus grcenlandica (?) deserve notice, and are
relatively of small size. Most of the leaves in this deposit are in fact
small, and none are palmate or lobed.
    The most remarkable fossil is an echinatod globose body, which
appears to be a fruit varying in size from a pea to a damson.        It is
sprinkled in great profusion over some of the slabs, in the shape of
very deep cavities, which    I for some time thought to be air-bubbles.
The larger ones seem to have been lobed. All other fruits, even the
fir-cones, are highly compressed, but this one is not in the least so,
and must have thoroughly resisted pressure until the beds were quite
consolidated.     No trace of lignite, nor of other matters, remains in
the casts, though the impress seems that of an organic body, yet it seems
hardly possible to imagine any kind of plant to which it could have
belonged, so variable in size and of such strange consistence must it
have been. In spite of its organic look, there must remain doubt as
to whether these cavities may not be due to the removal of some
inorganic crystalline body.
                                  Glenarm.
    The mine whence these fossils are obtained had been under water
for several years at the time of my first visit. The collection made by
Mr. Baily for the British Association was from the spoil-bank, and
also a few possessed by Mr. Gray.      Mr. Swanston accompanied me on
a second visit, and fragments       obtained by us from the spoil-bank
decided me to get the mine freed from water if practicable.   Mr. Walter
 Jamieson, of the Eglinton -Works at Glenarm, kindly assisted, and a
 fortnight's work enabled me to dig specimens from the bed in situ.
    Ferns. — A week's work fortunately put me in possession of several

      1884.]         Aye of    the Tertiary Basalts  of  the  Atlantic.            17
     well-preserved      pinnoe of a fern, seemingly        identical with Pterin
      Grcenlandica, Heer, and very characteristic of the Arctic Tertiaries.
        Conifers.
                   — The only conifer and the prevailing plant is a Cryptomeria.
     The branchlets are densely tufted and sub-parallel, forking at very
     acute angles, and frequently bearing cones. There is apparently no
     character    to distinguish it from the existing species.        It was named
     Sequoia   Du   Noyeri by     Mr. Baily, and  doubtless   some   of  the foliage
    from Arctic Tertiaries referred to Sequoia may also belong to it. The
    range of the existing genus is so restricted and definite, that its dis
    covery in a fossil state in Ireland is of special interest.
       Monocotyledon*. — These are abundant, but afford no recognisable
    characters.      Two or three diverging rush leaves side by side on the
    matrix sometimes almost appear to be a fragment of a palm leaf, and
    I cannot resist the suspicion that Heer may have been misled by a
    similar appearance into describing palms as occurring in the Tertiary
    flora of Greenland. They would, however, not easily be mistaken by
    one accustomed to collect fossil palms in the field.
       Dicotyledons. — The prevailing form is a large pinnatified deciduous
    leaf, with a close and even texture, such as that of the Plane, Chestnut,
    or  Tulip-tree. It is very variable in form, though scarcely more so
    than many of the Oaks, which it most resembles, or even the Spanish
    chestnut.     Pealings of a thin bark are not uncommon, and this with
    the absence of anything like acorns leads to some hesitation in adopt
    ing Heer's determination of leaves, which are almost its counterpart,
    as Quercus Furuljelmus, from Alaska, and Quercus            Grcenlandica, from
    Atanekerdluk.        Fragments of this one leaf have been named from
    Ireland alone as Platanus Guillelmce, Acer, Quercus, Sassafras; and pro
    bably Alnus Kefersteini. Though there are no fruits to furnish a clue
    to its genus, it was probably a tree of large dimensions.
       A rather smaller and more uncommon leaf has simple margins and
    more leathery texture, but cannot probably be determined generically.
    The most interesting leaf is that known as MacClintoclcia,or Daphnogene
    Kanii, a lanceolate leaf, with three or more mid-ribs, connected by an
    irregular network of veins. The examples are very fine indeed in
    this locality, a perfect leaf measuring nearly a foot in length, while
    some imperfect ones seem as if they may have exceeded this to double.
    The same species occurs in the Arctic floras and in the Heersien stage
    of the Lower Eocene of Gelinden.              Its true affinities seem still
    unknown, but      it  does not seem to have been an evergreen, and some
    how suggests rather a shrubby than an arborescent growth. A small
    ovate   dicotyledonous leaf, devoid of character, has         been figured    as
     Fraxinus, by Mr. Baily, and other genera mentioned           as   occurring in
     these beds are Corylus and Bhamnus.         Nothing came     to light while    I
     was working at the bed to suggest either of these            genera except a
     fragment in the spoil-bank, which might possibly represent the former.

                              Hie Lough Neagh Beds.
   The flora of these beds presents characters that are difficult to
reconcile.        The beds have been pierced to a depth of nearly 300 feet
without base, and their accumulation must therefore represent a vast
interval of time, during which many changes in the character of the
flora of the surrounding country may, or I might venture to say
must, have taken place.           The flora is evidently one of very great
variety, and almost entirely dicotyledonous.          Though plant remains
appear    to  be   abundant   throughout  the entire  thickness,   we are only
acquainted with them through their impressions in ironstone nodules,
picked up on the shore of Sandy Bay, and these it seems likely are for
the most part from the upper beds of the formation.              I have deter
mined but very few of them.
   Ferns. — Two species have been described by Mr. Baily : one,
Lastrrea stiriaca, ranges in time from the Middle Eocene to the
Miocene, and in distance from Greenland to Switzerland and Devon
shire, where it abounds at Bovey Tracey.             The second, Goniopteris
Bunburii, Heer, is rare at Bovey, but commoner at Bournemouth, and
does not,    I  think, occur in Greenland.
   Conifers.
               —  I have not seen any conifer myself, but Mr. Baily's list
mentions Sequoia Couttsice, which I think may be a form of the
Cupressus of Ballypalady ; Ephedra also occurs.
   Monocotyledons. — The most interesting discovery            is that of a
Dioscorea, identical with one of the most abundant and characteristic
leaves at Bournemouth, mentioned sometimes as a Cinnamon.                 It is
also met with in the Aquitanian stage of Switzerland, and seems to
occupy and denote a very definite zone of age, as it is wanting in the
newer English Eocenes.
   Dicotyledons. — One nodule contained         several leaves of Platanus,
identical with the Reading form and characteristic in England of the
Reading beds, below the London Clay. Another leaf is that known
as Corylus Macquarrii, from Mull and Greenland.                  On the other
hand, there are remains of the Cinnamomum lanceolatum of Bovey and
Bournemouth, not hitherto found to the north. Two well-marked fruits
are present, which can be referred unhesitatingly to the genera Alnus
and Nyssa.         The number of small-leaved dicotyledons referable pro
bably   to   living genera, give the flora a relatively modern aspect, but
many of them,        I am convinced, are identical with plants of Greenland
and Gelinden.          The flora, as a whole, cannot he newer I think than
the Middle Eocene, and it is the first important link connecting the
Middle Eocene floras of England with those of the far north.

 1884.]          Age   of  the Tertiary Basalts      of  the Atlantic.             19
                               Ardlun Head (Mull).
    The specimens exhibited are the result of one day's work.               I believe
that some of the larger leaves obtained were perfect, but they broke
in transit, owing to the brittle nature of the apparently hard matrix.
 Those previously      collected   are too fragmentary, and good specimens
might easily be obtained by quarrying away the basalt.                 As the bed
is extensive, collections       might be made from different spots, and
 greater variety of plants procured.             The leaf-bed is clearly in the
 track of an    ancient river, whose former bed must          be exposed    in other
 parts  of  Mull.
    Ferns.— The only one is abundant, but represented by torn frag
 ments, owing to the original tender consistence of the fronds.                 It is
 no less plentiful and broken up in some of the Greenland beds, whence
 it was described by      Heer   as Hemit elites.     This was corrected by Pro
 fessor  Newberry to     Onoclea   sensibilis, the only species of a genus now
 wholly confined     to North America.           It is unknown from any other
 locality  in Europe.      The jointed and striated stems of Equisetum are
 also  abundant.
    Conifers.
              — A number of short pieces of branchlets have been found
 at  Mull by Mr. Koch, and at Canna, which cannot be distinguished
 from    the   Ballypalady Cryptomeria.             Linear leaves, possibly of
 Sciadopitys or an Abies, are rarer.           The specimen originally figured
 by Edward Forbes as Taxites Camplelli still remains unique, though
said by    Lyell to   be the most abundant          conifer.   It was claimed by
 Heer as Sequoia Langsdorfii,       and was one of the three species which led
him to consider      the deposit to be of Miocene age.          It is a coniferous
branchlet with distichous foliage, and without definite generic cha
racter.     Similar foliage from Disco has also been determined to be
the    same   species, but on what basis is not apparent.                Plenty of
distichous    foliage, but of different type, has been found at         Mackenzie
Biver and Spitzbergen, but it hardly follows that because               these were
referable to Sequoia, all distichous foliage must be equally              so.    The
genera Taxus and        Taxites   have been almost expunged from lists of
Tertiary fossils, yet the extreme antiquity of Taxus cannot be doubted,
and there is no reason to exclude it from Tertiary floras, for it has a
wide distribution now and many species.              Sequoia forms considerable
groves, and where met         with fossil, occurs in abundance ; but the Yew
is  solitary, and while the fruits of the former, if associated, could
not escape detection, the berries of the latter might easily be over
looked.
    Monocotyledons.   — There is the usual proportion of reeds and rushes
inseparable    from plant-beds formed by river-side.
    Dicotyledons. — The upper part of the bed is choked with large
leaves of a roughly palmate form, seemingly to the exclusion of all
                                                                     C  2

20        Mr.   J.  Starkie Gardner.        Fossil Plant* and   the   [Dec.  18,
others, unless the great size of the leaf forms so favourable a cleavage
plane that no smaller leaves get exposed. The leaf is cordate, imper
 fectly lobed, serrate, with much the same venation and texture as the
Lime or the Mulberry.           It is so large that no perfect specimen has
yet been obtained, though there need be nodifliculty in doing so. The
leaf varies from imperfectly cordate to trilobed.           It is the Platanites
hebridicus of Edward Forbes, and Flatanus aceroides, according to
 Heer, but many species seem included under the latter name, only
some among them belonging truly to Platanus. The Mull leaf is quite
unlike Platanus, and of altogether different texture.           The prevailing
and almost the only leaf in the lower half of the bed is that figured
as Rhamnites by Forbes.          It is an oblong leaf, with simple margin and
feather veined, varying in length from 1 to 3 inches, and could hardly
be determined without some further clue. There are also leaves known
as Corylus Macquarrii, also found at Lough Neagh, a leaf like a Myrtle,
another Greenland leaf known as Corylus possedentatus, an ovate leaf,
probably Corntis hyperborea, with seven mid-ribs, and two or three
other indeterminable fragments.
    A remarkable, but not singular, fact about these floras is the great
differences between the appearance and composition of the several
groups of plants from Ballypalady, Glenarm, and Ballintoy. Dismiss
ing the latter, which merely contains           small leaves of MacClintockia
and a hazel-like leaf, we notice that the remaining two present a very
strong contrast in point of the relative luxuriance of growth of the
plants contained in them. The Glenarm plants were large leafy trees
and shrubs, while the Bally palady leaves are much smaller, and a large
proportion of the plants are coniferous.               They possess, however,
enough species in common to establish their relative synchrony, and
they are practically on the same horizon : but these very species have
quite a different aspect from the two localities, the Cryptomeria fruit
and foliage especially being dense and luxuriant from the one, and
poor and starved from the other.            Moreover, the Pines and Cypress,
so   abundant      at  Ballypalady,    are completely absent from Glenarm.
 The differences are in fact just such as a great discrepancy in the
 altitude of the stations might produce, but in view of the fact that
 both sets of beds were in all probability deposited in one river channel,
 and of the horizontality of the Basalt flows, no such considerable
 difference of level could be possible in so short a distance.         The rela
 tive luxuriance at Glenarm must therefore have been due to a shel
 tered aspect, soil, and other favourable conditions, and the possibility
 of such causes modifying to an extent where resemblance almost
 ceases, two floras that are contemporaneous, and comprise many of the
 same    species,   and within a few miles of each other, teaches what
 excessive    caution    we should use in drawing inferences from fossil
 plants.    These     three  floras, which    are below    the  horizon of    the

1884.]           Age   of the  Tertiary Basalts   of  the Atlantic.          21
rolnmnar Basalts, agree in one particular ; they are all characterised
by the presence of the peculiar triple nerved leaf called MacCliniockia.
The flora of Lough Neagh differs considerably from the others.             The
plant-beds, instead of being only a few feet thick, exceed 300 feet in
thickness, and as only the upper part of the mass is accessible, those
collected may be of newer relative age, as their aspect indeed suggests.
The most      typical of the older Basaltic plants are absent, but some of
the minor leaves are common to Ballypalady and also to Mull, and I
do not think they can be placed higher in the Tertiary series than
Eocene, and they certainly       do not appear to me to be Pliocene, as
supposed by the Geological        Survey of Ireland. The Mull flora, being
among the columnar Basalts, is stratigraphically newer than those of
Antrim, with the probable exception of the Lough Neagh beds, and
 MacClintockia is absent from it.
    We thus see that the three floras of greatest antiquity, though differ^
 ing widely from each other in other respects, are all characterised by
 the presence in them in abundance of MacClintockia, whilst those
 which we have        stratigraphical evidence for believing to be of newer
 age are destitute of anything resembling it.
    Now MacClintockia only occurs in one stratum whose age has been
 fixed wholly independently of plants.         This is the Heersien stage of
  Gelinden, a stage very low down in the Eocene of Belgium, and older
 than any Eocene represented in England.           Our floras from the Wool
  wich aud the Reading beds are now tolerably well known.             They are
 younger    than   the  Gelinden  flora, and  contain   no MacClintockia,  just
 as we have remarked with the younger floras of the Basalts, but the
 prevailing type in them, a Platanus, does occur at Lou»h Neagh.
  Here we have fossil evidence of precisely the same nature that we have
  been accustomed to regard as conclusive when dealing with anything
  bnt vegetables — MacClintockia characterises the Heersien stage in the
  only locality in which a flora of that age is known, and it is not met with
  elsewhere or at any other horizon in Europe.          There is not a particle
  of other positive evidence as to the age of the Antrim Basaltic floras,
  except that they are posterior to an horizon in the White Chalk, but
  the physical grounds for assigning a high antiquity to the Basalts are
  overwhelming. This is not the place to enter into them, and I have
  recently stated them at some        length.  The floras cannot be Miocene,
  for they   have not a single plant in them common to any European
  Miocene deposit, and if Eocene, they must, in the absence of anything
  contradictory, be placed in the only Eocene horizon in which pre
  cisely the same plants are found.         The same with the Lough Neagh
  beds; stratigraphically they appear to be newer than the rest ; they
  contain a particular plant that the others do not, and this plant is
  eminently    characteristic of the Reading series of the Eocene and of
  no uther,   for it is absent from the older flora of Gelinden, just as it

is in Antrim, and from all the newer floras of the Eocene.             I have
chosen the commonest and most striking types to base my argument
upon, for the sake of brevity, but     I  could support them by reference
to the other plants which, so far as       I have examined them, entirely
support   them.
    Were the belief in the Miocene ages of these beds not so deeply
rooted,  it would be unnecessary to prove      what is self-evident. Where
the ages of Tertiary rocks have been decided upon plant evidence
alone, we should, I think, accept them for the present with great
reserve.     MacClintockia seems, so far as we know, to be an extinct
and striking type which had a definite range in time, but many of
the plants associated with it have persisted to the present day almost
without modification.     Still, their presence in England may be equally
indicative of a definite age of rock, though it would not do to extend
the use of their presence as standards of antiquity to strata in their
own existing habitats.      Thus, Onoclea sensibilis represents a definite
stage in Mull, but as     a United States fossil, where it still lives, we
cannot say that its occurrence proves strata to be contemporary with
those of Mull.      So with Osmunda javanica,          Chrysodium aureum,
Araucaria Cunningham*, Cryptumeria japonica, Taxodium distichum,
and many others, still living ; they mark a definite horizon here, or
period at which they flourished, and then disappeared, but in course of
their subsequent migrations they may have appeared in other countries
at quite different dates, and to draw comparisons as to the relative
ages of rocks from their presence in them might be most misleading.
    I have not been to Greenland, and I do not therefore know how the
plant-beds occur there. Some of the plants are identical with those of
the Antrim Basalts, some with those of Mull, and some with plants from
 Lough Neagh. Whether these are from one horizon or from several             I
do not know, but they are embedded in different qualities of rock, and
presumably therefore come from different levels.            Not a shadow of
stratigraphical evidence has been brought forward for assigning them
to any particular stage of the Tertiaries, but it would seem natural to
classify them rather with the most tropical of the Eocene periods, that
of the London Clay, than with any other, as their presence so far
north, when so high a temperature prevailed in our latitude, presents
little or no physical improbability. The London Clay period was pre
ceded in England by a relatively very temperate climate, and the
plant-beds of Greenland are preceded by an unfossiliferons zone,
marking a period when no floras were in existence so far north.
There is already abundant evidence that many plants and animals
passed from Europe to America by way of these high latitudes during
the Eocene, and evidence of every kind points to some of the plant-
beds at least being of early Eocene age.        The Icelandic fossil plant-
beds I have ascertained to be on an altogether different and far newer

bear a resemblance to some of those said to be Miocene of Central
Europe; but as for the Greenland plants brought home by Whymper
and by  Colomb, they have no Miocene characters whatever, and there
should  be no hesitation in referring them to the same ages as the
Basaltic floras of our own country.

gill-slits    present, no
                is          " Tornaria " stage being passed through.            I
have since had an opportunity of observing        the further development
of   this  form  until     becomes
                               it     a mature animal possessing from
thirteen to forty pairs of gill-slits.       The remarks which follow
contain a preliminary account of the steps by which this condition
is   reached.
   At the time of hatching, the body of the animal consists of four
regions: (1) a conical proboscis bearing at its apex            tuft of long
                                                                     a
cilia ;(2)    very short
                    a      collar- region    followed
                                               ;        by (3)     dilatation
                                                                           a
of  the body, in the dorso-lateral      regions of which a pair of gill-
openings   soon appear.      Immediately behind these gill-slits             a is
transverse ring of cilia, which separates the third region from (4) the
anal region.   The opening of the mouth            still ventrally directed,
                                                      is
and the anus opens at the dorsal side of the posterior surface in the
middle line.
  The following are the external changes which then occur —                :
  (1.) The transverse ring of cilia disappears, being absent in larvae
possessing two pairs of gill-slits. The apical tuft of cilia also dis
appears.   The cilia which cover the whole body increase in size, and
unicellular glands appear in the skin, especially of the proboscis,
giving    a speckled appearance.
           it                      The tissues become gradually more
transparent, presumably from the consumption of the yolk particles
with which the cells had previously           been filled.
     (2.) As the cilia disappear, a remarkable temporary organ aDDears
in    the form of a conical process, or tail, arising from the posterior

24              Mr. W. Bateson.    On the Development      of   [Dec. 18,
ventral surface, immediately below the anus. The skin of this organ
is wrinkled by five to seven wrinkles, and is full of large glands,
probably secreting mucus. It serves as a strong sucker, by which
the animal can be kept in position.         Its presence is possibly cor
related to the fact that at this period of larval life the animals creep
up to the surface of the sand, protruding the conical proboscis at the
bottom of the shallow pools in which they live.       As the heat of the
sun beating upon the sand-flats at low tide is very great, it is probably
important that the larvae should not be washed out of the pools by
the tide, and so dried up, which is prevented by the presence of this
sucker.     The whole organ atrophies soon after seven gill-slits are
acquired, at which stage the body is long enough to be coiled round
foreign bodies.
    (3.) As the animal increases in size, the animal becomes more and
more flexed upon its ventral surface.       This condition is never lost
throughout life, the body of the adult being twisted in a right-
handed corkscrew spiral, which cannot be completely straightened
without stretching the tissues.
    (4.) The constriction at the base of the proboscis increases until
the stalk in a specimen possessing four gill-slits is not more than
 2-i^ inch in thickness.
    (5.) In the third region of the body a constriction appears imme
diately in front of the gill-slits.      This constriction is especially
developed on the dorso-lateral aspects.        It is posteriorly directed,
passing from above downwards.       The skin of the region thus marked
out between the gill-slits and the original collar region becomes
 thicker, and never acquires the transparency of the rest of the body.
At the period at which three gill-slits are present it grows backwards,
gradually forming an opercular fold over half the first gill-slit ; sub
sequently in the adult it covers the three anterior pairs of gill-slits.
 These gills thus open into a small atrial cavity.       The skin of the
collar becomes filled with mucous glands, and acquires a bright
orange colour.       The collar is thus made up of two portions of
 different origin, and, as will be shown, its cavity is lined by meso-
blast derived from both the second and also from the third pair
of mesoblastic sacs.
     (6.) As a result of the deepening of the constriction between the
proboscis and collar, and by a forward growth of the lower limb of
 the latter, the mouth is anteriorly directed when three pairs of gill-
 slits are present.
                          —
     (7.) In larvae with 2 3 pairs of gill-slits, the first appearance of
 the division of the alimentary canal into three regions may be observed.
 This division is apparent as soon as the skin becomes transparent, and
 is very conspicuous owing to the presence of a bright yellow-brown
 secretion, probably of hepatic character, in the middle or stomach

region,     which may thus     be  distinguished from the pharyngeal region
in front and the intestinal tract behind.         In the walls of the former
the gill-slits are placed.      They increase in number from before back
wards, throughout larval and adult life.         Their openings are at first
circular, but afterwards become horse-shoe shaped, owing to the
downward growth of a process from the dorsal margin of their open
ings.      This process (the "valve" of Spengel) appears about a week
after the first appearance of each gill-slit.        By the continual dorso-
ventral elongation of the gill-slits, together with an antero-posterior
compression, their openings become U'suaPe(l-
    The digestive region is yellow-brown in colour.                Its walls are
thrown into a spiral fold, giving it a sacculated appearance when seen
in transparent specimens.          The intestinal region is straight, and long
cilia may be seen working in its interior, causing an outward current.
 The anus is now dorsal, and can only be closed by an indrawing of the
 intestine.
     (8.)   A large vesicle may be seen pulsating in the base of the pro
 boscis, as described in Tornaria by previous observers.           In the dorsal
 middle line is a longitudinal vessel, which contracts peristaltically,
 like that of B. minutus (Spengel).           These contractions       appear to
 have no constant direction.          The vascular movements are not corre
 lated to movements of the body.            No contractions were seen in the
 ventral vessel, though their absence was not satisfactorily shown.           No
 further points of importance can be seen in an examination of the
 larvae as   whole objects.
     It has been stated by Spengel with regard to B. minutus, that water
 is taken into the body cavity of the proboscis at the proboscis-pore,
  and into that of the collar by the two ciliated funnels which open
  into  it.   My own observations do not confirm either of these state
  ments ;    on the contrary, particles of Indian ink or carmine held in
  suspension in the water cannot be found to enter into either of these
  cavities, while if placed artificially in them are driven out at all three
  of these   points.    On the other hand the particles are carried into the
  alimentary canal by the ciliary currents, and are more or less expelled
  thence at the gill-slits.       Spengel's statement of the absence of the
   pore   described by Kowalevsky and Agassiz, at the apex of the pro
   boscis, is true for all the species which   I have examined.

      Alimentary     Canal. — As mentioned above, the mouth is anteriorly
   directed.    The gill-clefts arise as saccular paired evaginations from
   the  pharynx which come into contact with the skin. The two layers
   coalesce, become very thin, and then break down, forming openings
   into the alimentary canal, which are at first circular.      In young speci

mens (1 — 2 gills) a rod of hypoblast, solid in front, and behind con
taining a lumen opening into that of the pharynx, is gradually
constricted off from the hypoblast in the dorsal middle line of the
pharynx. This hypoblastic rod grows forward into the proboscis cavity,
pushing in the mesoblastic lining.         The lumen opens into the gut
throughout life. In B. Kowalevskii the opening is slit-like, and extends
through the middle third of the collar.         A complicated structureless
skeleton is secreted by it on its ventral side, which is continued pos
teriorly into two diverging horns, which lie in the walls of the fore-
gut. This skeletal structure in B. Kowalevskii differs slightly from
that described by Spengel for B. minutus.          In young larvae the cells
of this hypoblastic rod are columnar, but they gradually become
irregular, vacuolated, and enclosed in a sheath, eventually in larvae
with seven or more gill-slits presenting an appearance precisely
comparable to that figured by Scott for the notochord of young
Lampreys,     and by Balfour for that of young Elasmobranchs.              It
becomes narrowed in the region of the proboscis stalk, where the
skeletal structures secreted by it attain their maximum thickness.
When isolated it is found to consist of hard cartilaginous tissue. It
serves to support the proboscis stalk, and to stiffen the wall of the
collar ; also as an attachment for the muscles of the collar and pro
boscis. This is the statement of its function which is also made by
Spengel.
    From its development, position, histology, and function, it appears
to me to be comparable with the notochord of the Chordata, and by
this name it will be hereafter alluded to. This view of its homology
is supported by the presence in the Enteropneusta of many other struc
tures pointing to vertebrate affinities.
    The Nervous System. — The commencing separation of the central
nervous system at the time of hatching as a solid cord in the dorsal
middle line of the collar extends itself anteriorly as far as the collar-
fold, and posteriorly to the region of the first gill-slit.      In advanced
 larvae (ten gill-slits) its anterior end  contains   a canal  opening to the
exterior in the dorsal middle line at the anterior end of the collar-
fold. This canal will be spoken of as the neural canal, and its pore
as the neural pore.      As far as it is possible, in the absence of figures,
 to follow Spengel's account of the development of this structure in
 Tornaria, it appears to take place by the invagination of a median
 furrow in this region, the neural canal being thus present from the
 beginning. [As Spengel states, in B. minutus, &c, the lumen is
 posteriorly not continuous, but is broken up by strands of nerve
  cells.]  This also holds for the anterior end in B. Kowalevskii.
     The rest of the nervous system, excepting that at the base of the
 proboscis, does not appear till much later (three to four gill-slits).
 Its position has been already described. Its origin in each case is due

1884.]             BalanoglossuS Kowalevskii (Agassi;),             Sfc.            .27
to the       formation of fibres and occasional ganglion cells from the
lowest layer      of the skin.
      The   Body-cavities. — I have already described the formation of the
proboscis body-cavity from a single anterior pouch of the archenteron,
having two posteriorly directed horns.   On the left of the proboscis
stalk (one to two gill-slits) an internal thickening of the epiblast
arises.      A
            cavity appears in this structure, which becomes open to
the exterior.    Subsequently it opens internally to the left horn. This
opening is the proboscis pore.     Spengel states that in B. Kupfferi a
similar pore is also present on the right side. In connexion with
this fact      I
             may mention that in a single specimen of B. Kowalevskii
(seven gill-slits), which was also otherwise abnormal, I found this
double arrangement.
   The two collar body-cavities coalesce in the adult on the ventral
side, the septum remaining dorsally.   Their cavities are prolonged
into two horns,    which run in the proboscis stalk side by side with the
posterior horns of the anterior body-cavities.
    Into the collar body-cavity opens the pair of ciliated funnels leading
to the exterior, mentioned     by Spengel.     He describes them without
a figure as arising from the anterior gill-pouch.           In B. Kowalevskii
they   arise as  thickenings  of the mesoblast,     lining the inner fold of
the posterior limb of the collar.      These thickenings become hollow
and strongly ciliated, opening with the first gill-slit into the atrial
cavity formed by the collar fold.      In B. minutus this atrial cavity is
reduced to a minimum ; the posterior skin of the collar runs, there
fore, directly into the skin of the first gill-slit.    It appears that these
funnels are of an excretory character.     This view is supported by the
fact that Hatschek has recently mentioned the presence of an excretory
tube opening with the first gill-slit of Amphioxus on the left side.
The posterior pair of mesoblastic pouches remain separate throughout
life, lining the whole body-cavity posterior to the collar.        They send
forward a pair of horns between the notochord and the neural cord as
far as the proboscis pore.
  The first blood-vessel arises as a splitting in the septum formed by
the adjacent walls of these two horns, and is continued forwards with
their growth.    This remains throughout life as the dorsal blood
vessel.      The ventral       blood-vessel   is formed as a split in the ventral
septum between the  third pair of body-cavities.
  The dorsal vessel is continuous with the cavity which is correctly
described by Spengel as immediately overlying the notochord in the
proboscis. This cavity is filled with coagulum, its walls are muscular,
and it would seem to me to be the true heart.      The space overlying
it,    which     is   called   by Spengel
                                              " the heart," contains,      as   he has
described,       a variable quantity of loose           cellular tissue. This may
possibly be       of glandular character

glandular body which is attached to the end of the notochord.            As
far as could be observed through the body wall of the living animal,
the pulsations in this region are those of the tube lying immediately
upon the notochord.      Moreover, this structure gives off all the blood
vessels of the body, both according to Spengel and from my own
observations, while none of them are supposed to arise from the
glandular portion, which has besides no distinct muscular wall.

appearance closely comparable to the so-called
being perforated by a network of blood-vessels (Spengel).
    The posterior body-cavities are prolonged into the cavity of the
temporary tail, remaining separated by the vertical septum.
    It may be desirable to discuss briefly the new light which these facts
throw upon the affinities of the group Enteropneusta.
    In 1881 Metschnikoff published a detailed comparison of Balano-
glossus with the Echinoderms,      comparing Tornaria with Bipinnaria,
showing     that  the  resemblance   is close, and concluding with the
suggestion that Balanoglossus should be included among the Echino-
dermata in a separate division,
                                    " Bilateralia." The branchial struc
tures he compared to the openings from the body cavities of
 Echinoderms.      This view, as thus expressed, receives no support
 from further observations, and would now appear to be untenable.
    As mentioned above, all the Enteropneusta possess a supporting
structure which is comparable with the notochord in every way,
except in extent and in the persistence of its connexion with the
alimentary canal. Its resemblance to that of Amphioxus is especially
striking, for in Amphioxus the notochord projects a long way in frort
 of the mouth.      It moreover possesses gill-slits which are not only
 without parallel, except among the Chordata, but also in structure,
 position, and development, agree exactly with those of Amphioxus, in
 which the slits acquire the same (J -shaped form.
    The agreement in the position of the blood-vessels and skeleton of
 the gill-bars is also very close.  The fact of their gradual increase in
 number from before backwards throughout life is another common
 feature.
    The position and mode of origin of the central nervous system is
 also similar in both forms ; the invagination of the dorsal cord in
 Balanoglossus being, however, only partial, while that of Amphioxus
 is complete.
    The mesoblastic pouches suggest the same resemblance, differing
 only from those of Amphioxus in number, being one median and four
 lateral, while those of Amphioxus are one median and twenty-eight
 lateral. As   I have already pointed out, the fate of this anterior pouch
 is in the two animals closely similar. In both it is divided into two as
  the notochord grows forward. In Amphioxus the division is complete,

1884.]           Balanoglossus       Kowalevskii (Ayassiz),      §-c.          2i!
while in Balanoglossus           it is partial.     In both, the backwardly-
projecting     horn   upon the left side   becomes   lined by ciliated columnar
cells and opens to the exterior.              Moreover, in both animals this
opening    has  a definite   relation  to the  nervous system.     In Amphioxus
                   "             "
it becomes the        olfactory    pit (Hatschek), while in Balanoglossus it is
surrounded by a mass of nervous tissue.                Finally, the collar folds,
especially of B. Kowalevskii, would appear to be comparable with the
commencing atrial folds of Amphioxus, for the most anterior gill-slits
open   into the cavity which is thus enclosed.
   The pair of ciliated funnels opening from the collar body cavities
to  the atrium has been compared above to the excretory tube mentioned
by Hatschek      in   a similar position in Amphioxus.
   A pair of tubes has          been described by Lankester in Amphioxus
opening into the back of the atrial cavity, communicating with the
dorsal body cavities.         It may be remarked that if the collar fold of
li. Kowalevskii were prolonged backwards, as the atrial folds are in
Amphioxus, the two collar funnels would then be carried backwards,
and have a relation similar to that of these tubes which, as suggested

   To recapitulate : Striking resemblances to the Chordata and especi
ally to the Cephalochord            type are to be found in the following
structures   : —
   (1.) The notochord.
   (2.) The gills and branchial        skeleton and blood supply.
   (3.) The central nervous system.
    (4.) The origin of the mesoblast.
    (5.) The peculiar fate and remarkable             asymmetry of the anterior
poach.
    (6.) The atria.
    (7.) The excretory funnels.
   In each of these cases, excepting that of the branchial structures
and the excretory         funnels, the condition is that which would be
produced     by a partial or arrested       development     of the corresponding
 structure in Amphioxus.
    The above considerations          appear to justify us in including the
 Enteropneusta among the Chordata.               I would, therefore, tentatively
 suggest the following table : —
              Chordata : — Hemichordata (Enteropneusta).
                              Urochorda (Ascidians).
                               Cephalochorda (Amphioxus).
                              Vertebrata.
    It is not now proposed       to enter into a more detailed discussion of the
 morphology     of   the  group, or of the light which an acceptance of this
 suggestion throws on the origin of the Chordata.               A fuller examina

 and development, is reserved for a subsequent occasion.
     It may, nevertheless, be advisable to point out that since, according
                                                        "

 follow that the water vessel of Bipinnaria is prima facie comparable
 with the asymmetrical anterior body cavity of Amphioxus.

       University College,    London.      From   the  Physiological Labo
       ratory, University College.             Communicated       by E. A.
       Schafer, F.R.S.       Received December 4, 1884.
   Cardiac inhibition    of a very profound character can be reflexly
induced   in the eel with a facility that is quite astounding.
   Slight stimulation of either gill brings about an immediate arrest
of the heart's action, an arrest that may last for several minutes
provided the stimulation be continued.           Gentle friction or pressure
very readily leads to the same result ; indeed, a mere touch is some
times sufficient.    A weak interrupted current is likewise effective;
also a thermal or chemical       stimulus.    If water be injected through
the gill apertures at considerable pressure so as to distend the branchial
chamber, inhibition of the heart's action is similarly induced.
   Stimulation of the fifth branchial arch (which carries teeth but no
gill) has the same effect.
   The branchial nerves are the paths that conduct the afferent impulse
to the medulla, whence it passes as an inhibitory impulse down the
vagus nerve and along the cardiac branch to the heart.           Stimulation
of the central end of a cut branchial nerve leads to the same result
as  stimulation  of the gill, and if one vagus nerve be cut, stimulation
of a branchial    nerve on the same side can still arrest the heart, pro
vided the vagus nerve on the other side be intact.         Section of all the
branchial nerves obviates the occurrence of cardiac standstill as a
result of gill stimulation, and, of course, destruction of the medulla or
section of both vagi has a    similar effect.
   The   administration   of  ethor   or chloroform does not suspend the
operation of this mode of reflex inhibition, provided the amount of
the anaesthetic    be not so great as to arrest all manifestations of
activity in the medulla, e.g., the respiratory acts. Neither removal of
the various parts of the brain above the medulla, nor section of the
spinal cord immediately    below the medulla, prevents the occurrence of
cardiac arrest.
   This phenomenon of reflex cardiac inhibition as a result of gill
stimulation is one that occurs with almost perfect constancy, and
usually with a readiness and profoundness that are very striking.          It
occurs in the uninjured animal, as may be seen by watching the area
of cardiac   pulsation on the ventral aspect of the body, while the gill
is stimulated by pressure or in any other way.         The recommencement
 of the heart's action is often delayed for a considerable time (half a
 minute or longer) after strong stimulation of the gill has been dis

'.Y2                   Dr.  J. A. Mc William.     On the           [Dec.  18,
continued.       One or more respiratory movements are often excited at
the same time that cardiac arrest is brought about.           Stimulation of
the gill apertures and of the internal surface     of the branchial  chamber
also gives rise to cardiac inhibition, though in a much less marked
degree than does stimulation of the gills.
     The phenomenon of cardiac inhibition as a result of gill stimulation
is not confined to the eel.    I have found it to be well marked in various
other fishes — carp, perch, rudd, and others.
     Stimulation of the skin of the head is also effective in bringing
about an arrest of the heart's action.      The application of pressure or
slight friction, or a weak interrupted current, or a thermal stimulus,
leads readily to this result. If the skin be removed, slight stimulation
ceases to have any effect unless pressure be applied over the branchial
chamber — an inhibitory effect is then obtained by the gills being
affected.      Severe injury of any part of the head after removal of the
skin may still (apart from any influence upon the gills) bring about
cardiac inhibition.      Stimulation of the fifth nerve is followed by a
similar result.      The administration of ether or chloroform seems as a
rule    to  prevent the occurrence of cardiac arrest as a result of slight
stimulation of the skin of the head ; this occurs when the quantity
of ether that has been used is quite insufficient to suspend the activity
of the medulla, or to prevent the arrest of the heart which follows gill
stimulation.
     Gentle compression of the animal's tail between the fingers is
generally followed by standstill of the heart.          So also is the appli
cation of electrical or chemical stimulation       to  the same part.    The
inhibitory result is obtained by irritation of the integument covering
the caudal fin as well as of that covering the muscular part of the
tail. If the skin be removed gentle mechanical stimulation ceases to
have any effect ; electrical stimulation is apt to spread to the spinal
cord.      The area of skin over which stimulation is effective generally
extends from the tip of the tail forwards about one-eighth of the
distance to the vent.
     Muscular movements along the animal's body are induced at the
same time as the cardiac standstill.
     The path along which the afferent impulses pass to the medulla is
the spinal cord.      Section of the cord above the point of stimulation
prevents the occurrence of a cardiac inhibitory result.
     Direct stimulation of the spinal cord is a very powerful means of
arresting the heart's action, and the same result occurs at whatever
part the cord is stimulated.        The cardiac effect is accompanied by
vigorous contraction of the muscles generally, including those of
the pectoral fins. But when an interrupted current is employed to
stimulate the cord, the question may be raised whether some escape
of the current to the neighbouring structures may not occur, e.g.t

 1884.]        Reflex Action      of  the Cardiac Nerves in Fishes,            33
whether the current may not (if a strong current be used) spread to
the sympathetic nerves lying along the aorta on the ventral aspect
of the vertebral column.           Any such source of error can be avoided
by employing mechanical           stimulation of the cord by means of      a wire
passed some distance up the spinal            canal, so as to destroy the cord at
that part.
   Moreover,      if  an interrupted current of the same strength as before
be applied to the empty spinal canal at the point where the cord was
formerly stimulated, it is found to cause no inhibition at all, though
it is quite as free as before        to pass into the sympathetic nerves and
other neighbouring structures.            It is clear then that the interrupted
current which caused inhibition when applied to the cut end of the
spinal cord caused        inhibition by stimulating the cord itself, and not
by   its effect upon any neighbouring structures into which it might
have spread.
   When direct stimulation of the cord is employed                as a means   of
inducing reflex cardiac inhibition, the accompanying               movements of
the   skeletal   muscles occur so spasmodically that it is impossible to
observe any order of succession in their generation.
   But when the animal appears to be in a sluggish and depressed condi
tion, stimulation of the tail is often followed by a struggling movement
which begins in the region of the stimulated point, and slowly passes
along     the body towards the head. When this wave of movement
passing along from the tail reaches no further than the middle of the
animal's length, no cardiac inhibition occurs, but when it traverses
the   whole length of the body, along to the head, cardiac inhibition
occurs, and removal of the          brain above the medulla does not obviate
this   result.    The wave of muscular movement passing along the body
from    tail to head (as a result of stimulation of the tail) is not simply
a contraction wave propagated by the muscular tissues ; it indicates a
wave of activity passing           over the motor cells of the spinal cord.
Section of the spinal cord at once arrests the transmission               of the
movement in question.          It would seem that when this phase of activity
passing    along   the  cord  reaches   the medulla, the vagus centre is thrown
into action together with the neighbouring motor centres, e.g., the
respiratory centre, the centre for movement of the pectoral fins, &c.
It must be remembered that in these experiments the animal is made
fast on a board.        In such circumstances, the struggling movements
possibly    attain   an  intensity much greater than is commonly the case
in the normal condition of the animal.
   When the wave of action passing along the spinal cord fails to
reach the medulla, the vagus centre would seem to bo unaffected,
since no change in the heart's action is discernible.          And when irrita
tion of the tail fails to produce any reflex movements, it also fails to
 bring about cardiac arrest. The result of the application of a stimulus

to the tail is not always the same.        After the tail has been repeatedly
stimulated, with the effect of causing reflex muscular contraction
and cardiac inhibition, a phase (of exhaustion) often occurs, during
which stimulation fails to bring about either reflex movements or
cardiac arrest.
    The effects of      the administration of strychnine (by hypodermic
injection)   are   in  accordance   with the phenomena already described.
After strychnine poisoning convulsive movements occur, as in the
frog, in response to stimuli of a very trivial character.         But in the
eel, the advent of each convulsive attack          is accompanied by a tem
porary arrest of the heart's action.        The vagus centre seems in this
instance also to be thrown into action in company with the ordinary
motor centres.
    Again, when experimenting with an eel, struggling movements of
the animal occasionally occur without any apparent cause.               These
movements, if confined to the tail part, are accompanied by no per
ceptible change in the heart's action, but when they involve the whole
length of the animal or the part next the head, cardiac arrest occurs
at the same time — just as cardiac arrest accompanies the struggling
movements resulting from stimulation of the skin of the head or
tail. When the motor centres of the cord and medulla (including the
respiratory centre) are paralysed in consequence of a prolonged
administration of ether or chloroform, the vagus centre also seems to
be hors de combat.        Reflex inhibition of the heart does not then occur
as a result of the stimulation of any part, though direct stimulation
of the vagus nerve readily leads to prolonged inhibition.
    It will thus be seen that stimulation of the skin of the head and of
the tail of the eel is peculiarly effective in causing reflex inhibition of
the heart's action.       The skin of the head and tail are shown to be
possessed    of a   specially high sensibility by results other than cardiac
arrest.    For if a vigorous uninjured eel when lying quiescent on a
board be lightly touched on the head with the finger, reflex movements
of a more or less extensive and complex character are immediately
manifested.       Similar results are obtained by holding between the
fingers or very gently compressing the tail ; the resulting movements
are sometimes confined to the candal region, while they at other times
affect the whole length of the animal.           But when the intermediate
 tract of the eel's body is tested in the same way, it is found that no
 visible effects of any kind follow the application of gentle pressure
 to the skin.       The skin of the animal's body seems to be quite irre
 sponsive   to   stimuli   which produce striking effects when applied to
 the head or tail.
    It would seem then that cardiac arrest is most readily excited by
 stimulation of those cutaneous surfaces which are prone to yield reflex
 movements as a result of similar stimulation.         In other words, stimn

1884.]        Reflex Action    of the   Cardiac Nerves in Fishes.              35
lation of those regions of the skin which most readily lead to reflex
excitement of the spinal and medullary motor centres also leads most
readily to excitement of the vagus centre.
    Stimulation of the parietal peritoneum very readily gives rise to
reflex cardiac   arrest.
    Tapping the ventral aspect of the abdomen of an intact eel is
commonly followed by more or less marked slowing of the heart's
action.     And when the abdominal cavity is being laid open, the heart
generally stands still for a considerable length of time.            When this
standstill has passed away, the introduction of a finger-tip into the
abdominal cavity so as to come into contact with the parietal peri
toneum is frequently followed by a temporary cardiac inhibition.                If
the abdominal      parietes be now fixed apart so as to expose the cavity
fully, it can be readily observed that stimulation of the parietal portion
of the peritoneum is a very effective cause of reflex cardiac arrest.
Application of slight friction, a weak interrupted current, or a hot
wire to tho internal surface of the abdominal parietes, almost invari
ably brings about cardiac inhibition in a very marked degree.               Con
traction of the neighbouring trunk muscles commonly occurs at the
same time ; such contraction at times involves the muscles along the
 whole length of the body. These muscular contractions (accompanying
 the reflex cardiac arrest) occur on both sides of the body, and are
evidently a reflex effect of the peritoneal stimulation.          A very weak
 interrupted current is sufficient to bring about the results mentioned :
 such a current as is obtained from the secondary coil (of a du Bois-
 Reymond's induction machine, with the Helmholtz modification) at a
 distance of 11 cm. from the position where it covers the primary coil
completely, whilst tho battery used is a single Daniell's element.
 The effect on the heart's action caused by stimulation of the parietal
 peritoneum seems to occur more readily in response to a weak inter
 rupted current than to slight mechanical stimulation.
    If the parietal peritoneum be stripped off from the subjacent tissues
 at any part where reflex inhibition is found to be readily excited, the
 application of the electric current to the same spot — now denuded of
 its peritoneal covering — fails to exert any influence on the heart's
 action, unless the current spread to one of the spinal nerves.           But if
 the electrodes be moved to another part of the abdominal             parietes —
 to a part where the peritoneal                            —
                                      layer is still intact the same cardio-
 inhibitory phenomena as before can be readily observed.            Mechanical
 and thermal stimulation give similar results.
    The afferent impulses generated by stimulation of the parietal peri
 toneum seem to pass to the medullary vagus centre chiefly through
 the spinal cord.    Section of the upper part of the cord obviates the
 cardio-inhibitory effect of peritoneal stimulation.           Section of the
 vagus    nerves  below    the  origin   of  the  cardiac  branches    does not
                                                                  D  2

prevent    the inhibitory result. Curiously enough, stimulation of the
visceral   peritoneum has an entirely different and indeed an entirely
negative result ; it is followed by no perceptible change in the heart's
action.     Even strong interrupted currents, and strong mechanical,
chemical, and thermal stimuli applied to the visceral peritoneum, seem
to be quite without effect on the cardiac beat.        Powerful electrical
stimulation of the whole thickness of the walls of the stomach and
intestine has no perceptible effect on the heart. Pinching, crushing,
and tearing of these parts are equally ineffective ; and so are chemical
and thermal irritants.
         I
   Here must advert to an experiment described by Marshall Hall in
 " Todd's Cyclopaedia of Anatomy and Physiology "
                                                            (article Heart).
 He states that when the stomach of an eel was crushed by a violent
blow with a hammer, the heart stood still for a considerable length
of time, and this even though the animal's brain and spinal cord had been
previously destroyed. From this he argues that the cardiac action can
be inhibited by impulses originating in the stomach, and acting upon
the heart without the mediation of the cerebro-spinal system at all.
         I
   Now have many times violently crushed the stomach of an eel by
means of large and strong pliers, and I have never observed any
cardiac arrest resulting therefrom.     This statement holds both in the
case of eels that have had their brain and spinal cord intact, and
in eels that have had these organs destroyed.     It would seem therefore
that the cardiac inhibition observed by Marshall Hall was in all pro
bability not simply due to the crushing of the stomach — to which he
ascribes it.    It must have occurred as a consequence of some effect of
the blow other than the crushing of the stomach.        Indeed, his method
of experiment was such as to render possible the agency of many
causes other than those strictly dependent on the injury of the
stomach ; his method rendered possible the excitation of many nerve
impulses besides those generated by the stomach injury.         For a severe
blow delivered with a hammer upon the intact stomach of an eel would
necessarily injure various other structures, and would at the same
time give rise to a considerable amount of jar. Injury of such struc
tures adjacent to the stomach as might be effected by a hammer blow,
cannot be put down as the efficient cause of the reflex cardiac arrest,
since powerful stimulation of these parts (applied so as to obviate the
accompaniment of jar) gives rise to no effect at all on the heart's
action, provided the brain and spinal cord have been previously
destroyed.      After destruction of these organs    I   have, however, in
several instances observed a well-marked inhibition of the heart's
action as a result of sudden jarring of the animal generally — such
jarring as may be caused by forcibly striking the board on which the
eel rests.     This result does not occur in all cases, but in some
instances    I have seen it in unmistakable form.       Such a jarring was

1884.]       Reflex Action     of  the  Cardiac Nerves in Fishes.             37
probably caused by Marshall Hall's blow upon the stomach, and to
such jarring may, it seems to me, with most probability, be attributed
the   cardio-inhibitory phenomenon which he describes.
    Stimulation of the air-bladder and the other abdominal organs
appears to be without effect on the heart's action.             The abdominal
organs seem, in fact, to be the only parts of the animal from which
cardiac inhibition cannot by powerful stimulation be excited.               And
similarly with regard to reflex movements, little or no effect is mani
fested in response to the most powerful stimulation of the abdominal
organs.
   Stimulation of the abdominal         sympathetic   nerves seems to have no
influence on the cardiac      action.
   Stimulation     of the central end of the right or left vagus nerve below
the   origin of the cardiac branch causes well-marked reflex inhibition,
provided the nerve be stimulated in that part of its course where it
lies along the gullet.        Stimulation of either vagus nerve below the
gullet, i.e., after the nerve has passed from the gullet on to the
stomach, seems to have no cardio-inhibitory effect.              Stimulation of
the inner and outer surfaces of the gullet itself appears to be without
effect on the heart ; whilst the application of a very weak current to
the vagus nerve lying along its outer surface, most readily brings
about a prolonged      arrest  of the cardiac action.
    Stimulation of the first spinal nerve, or any of its branches, gives
rise to marked inhibition of the heart.         Many of the branches of this
nerve can be very easily isolated, as they pass to the muscles on the
ventral aspect of the body anterior to the pectoral fins.           Stimulation
of the central end of any of the spinal nerves is often followed              by
cardiac arrest.
   Irritation of the mucous membrane of the mouth seems in most
instances to lead to cardiac arrest.        This can easily be shown by intro
ducing any pointed instrument into the mouth and scratching the
mucous membrane.          General muscular movements are usually induced
at the same time as the cardiac inhibition.
   Irritation of the pharynx seems to be still more effective as regards
its influence in suspending the cardiac action.
    Severe injury of almost any part of the animal — with the exception
 of the abdominal organs — is usually followed by a more or less pro
 longed standstill of the heart.        This result is generally accompanied
by more or      less extensive   and   continued  movements of the skeletal
 muscles.    Injury of the pectoral fins seems in many instances to be
 more effective in causing reflex inhibition than does injury of the body
generally, excepting of course the specially effective parts (i.e., head,
 tail, parietal peritoneum, and gills) already mentioned.
    I have  on many occasions investigated the effect of stimulation of
 the   great lateral nerve upon the cardiac movements.              This nerve

38                    Dr.  J.  A. McWilliara.         On  the           [Bee. 18,
originates from the bunch of nerves which make up the vagus.                     It
separates from the other portions of the vagus near the skull ; it then
passes along the lateral surface of the animal, pursuing the same
general course as the lateral line, though for the greater part of its
course at a considerable     depth from the surface, embedded among the
 muscles.     In the eel it does not extend to the tail, as it does in some
fishes (e.g., carp) ; it terminates at a variable point, sometimes about
the junction of the caudal third with the rest of the body, sometimes
in the middle third of the animal's length.
   Section of this nerve is followed by no visible effect. And stimula
tion of its central end      seems  to exert no marked          influence  on the
cardiac action.
   The sudden placing of an eel in the vertical position with the head
downwards, sometimes leads to a temporary cardiac arrest, provided
the circulation be intact. Movements of the animal occur at the same
time as the inhibition of the heart, and when no such movements
result from the placing of the animal in the position referred to, the
cardiac inhibition also fails to occur. And even in the cases where
cardiac inhibition (accompanied by movements of the animal) does
occur, the inhibition is usually a very temporary one. The heart is
not kept at a slow rate during the whole time that the vertical
position is maintained ; in fact, there is generally, after a little time,
a slight acceleration of the heart's rhythm beyond what was seen when
the animal was in the horizontal position.             In the vertical position
(with   the  head  downwards)    the  heart  is  much     distended with blood,
and fails to empty itself at each beat. And section of both vagi does
not seem to have any effect upon the gorged condition or slightly
accelerated rate which the heart exhibits while the above-mentioned
position of the animal is maintained.
   When the eel is held in a vertical position with the head upwards,
the heart becomes small, pale, and empty, or almost empty.                Its rate
of  action  remains  unchanged,    or after a  little  time   becomes somewhat
slower than in the horizontal position ; the latter result (a somewhat
slowed rate) seems to be the one that more commonly occurs.
   Reflex arrest of the heart — brought about in any of the ways
mentioned —does not depend upon alterations in blood-pressure.                   It
occurs after section of all the large blood-vessels.
   The eel's brain can be readily exposed by removing the cranial roof
by means of a pair of strong scissors or a bone forceps.               The effects
of stimulation and removal of the various parts can then be tested.
   Stimulation of the cerebral hemispheres has no apparent effect
either with regard to the condition of the heart or of the skeletal
muscles.     And removal of these parts seems to have no marked
effect.
   Stimulation of the optic lobes leads to very striking results             ; the

1884.]       Reflex Action    of  the  Cardiac Nerves in Fishes.          39
heart    stands still, while strong contraction of the skeletal muscles
occurs.     These results are got by the application of very weak
interrupted     currents  ;  and   also   by mechanical stimulation.    The
effects produced      do not    seem     to be due to a spreading of the
stimulating current to the medulla ; the currents used are extremely
weak, and, moreover, stimulation of the cerebellum (which lies much
nearer the medulla than do the optic lobes) gives no effect at all or
only a very    trivial effect compared to that obtained from the optic
lobes.    If the interrupted current applied to the optic lobes spread to
the medulla,      it ought surely to spread as readily or indeed much
more readily to the medulla when applied to the cerebellum.
   Removal of the optic lobes seems to lead to a change in the
readiness with which stimulation of certain parts leads to reflex
cardiac inhibition.      The application of slight friction or weak
electrical currents to the skin of the head seems (after removal of the
optic lobes) to have no effect on the heart's action ; neither does
slight irritation of the mucous membrane of the mouth, nor irritation
of the gill apertures.      Very severe injury of any of these parts may
still, however, lead to cardiac inhibition.
    Removal of the optic lobes also seems in many instances to lead to
an acceleration of the rate of the heart's action.
    Stimulation of the medulla is highly effective in causing prolonged
suspension of the cardiac action. A rapidly interrupted current is not
essential ; a current with interruptions at the rate of two or three per
second is effective.    Removal of the medulla abolishes all the pheno
mena of reflex cardiac inhibition.
    After removal or destruction of the medulla, the heart rhythm is
generally accelerated to a considerable extent.         A similar change in
the rate of cardiac action can usually be observed as a consequence of
section of the vagi.       It would seem then that during the time the
animal is experimented on with intact medulla and vagi, the heart's
action is under a continued controlling influence which renders its
rhythm slower than it would be were it not for this controlling
influence exerted by the medulla upon the heart through the medium
 of the vagi nerves.     And this controlling influence is manifested when
 the eel is left uninterfered with for a considerable        time, and when
 the animal appears to be in a perfectly quiescent state.       However, the
 means which are employed to        fix the animal, and  the incisions which
 have been made to expose the heart and brain, may be sources of
 irritation which by sending afferent impulses to the medulla, keep the
 vagus centre in a state of slight but continued           activity. And if
 extensive injuries have been inflicted, e.g., if the animal is cut across
 at the middle of its length,          the continued controlling influence
 exerted by the central nervous organs on the heart is, as a rule,
  decidedly more marked.         This controlling influence is much more

 40                    Dr.  J. A. McWilliam.      On the            [Dec. 18,
  strongly evidenced when the optic lobes and medulla are both intact
  than when the former parts (the optic lobes) have been removed.
     That such a controlling influence is at times present in a very
  marked degree, is evidenced by the fact that section of the vagi
 sometimes leads to a very great change in the rapidity of the heart's
 action.    The number of beats occasionally increases from a rate of
 15 per minute before section of the vagi, to a rate of 40 per minute
 after section of the vagi.        Changes in the degree of continued
 controlling influence   exerted  by the central nervous system upon the
 heart seem to play a very important part with regard to the after
 effects which are manifested as consequences of reflex arrest of the
 heart.   When the cardiac action recommences after reflex inhibition
 the beats are at first slow, but soon increase in rate and frequently
 attain for a time a much greater rapidity of rhythm than was
 manifested before the reflex inhibition occurred.       At the same time a
 slight increase of the force of the auricular beats may occur.         These
 changes in rate and force seem to be in very many cases due for
 the most part to a diminution of the constant controlling influence
 which acted upon the heart before the inhibition was caused. It
would seem that strong action of the medullary inhibitory centre
 (exerted by afferent impulses) and leading to cardiac standstill, is
followed by a phase of markedly diminished activity of that centre —
a diminution which involves a relaxing of the control exerted upon
the heart, and a consequent increase in the rate of the heart's beat and
occasionally also of the auricular force of contraction.           That such
a diminution of the medullary controlling influence is frequently
the main cause of the after-acceleration following reflex inhibition,
is supported by a number of considerations ; among others, by the fact
that in many instances where such after-acceleration is well marked
as a result of reflex inhibition, no after-acceleration         at all occurs
after inhibition from direct stimulation of the vagi or of the sinus.
    The state of excitement into which the medullary vagus centre is
thrown by strong afferent impulses (from the gills and ether parts)
seems to persist for a considerable time after the stimulation (of
the gills, &c.) is discontinued.    For the heart frequently remains quies
cent for half a minute or more after gill stimulation is discontinued ;
whereas after direct stimulation of the vagus nerve the heart
recommences very shortly after the stimulation is discontinued.
Free administration of ether or chloroform leads to complete loss
of reflex inhibition as well as of reflex action generally.           Cardiac
arrest can still be readily observed as a result of direct stimulation of
the vagus nerve. A smaller amount of these anaesthetics induces
a condition much resembling that seen after removal of the optic
lobes.    There are no voluntary movements.         Reflex action upon the
qeart    or   skeletal   muscles    cannot   be   excited    by   very  slight

 1884.]       Reflex Action    of  the Cavdiac    Nerves in Fishes.            41
mechanical     or electrical stimulation of the skin of the head, or by
very   slight stimulation   of the gill apertures or of the mucous mem
brane of the mouth.           Weak irritation, which formerly produced
striking results, now seems to have no effect on these parts.             Cardiac
inhibition and reflex contractions of the skeletal muscles may still be
excited     by severe injury of the parts mentioned, or by ordinary
stimulation of the gills, tail, parietal peritoneum, first spinal nerve, or
trunk of the vagus nerve where it lies on the gullet.
   When the heart has been acting very slowly (in consequence of the
controlling influence of the central nervous system) prior to the admin
istration of ether, the rate of action usually increases to a very
marked     extent even when the amount of ether used has not yet been
enough to paralyse     the reflex activity of the medulla, but when it has
induced a condition similar to that seen on removal of the optic lobes.
   It will be seen from the experiments described, that reflex inhibition
of the eel's heart is often excited by peripheral stimulation which
leads at the same time to reflex action of the skeletal muscles.              The
vagus    medullary   centre   is  often   thrown   into  a  state of activity by
impulses which at the same time set into activity the motor centres of
the medulla and cord generally.           Such results may be brought about
by stimulation of the skin of the head or tail, by stimulation of the
gill apertures, or of the mucous membrane of the mouth, and by
 severe injury of any part of the body               excepting the abdominal
 organs.
    On the other hand,    stimulation of certain parts can lead to cardiac
 inhibition without any other indications of reflex action.                   The
 medullary vagus     centre   may   as  a  result of  peripheral  stimulation   be
 thrown into a state of excitement without the participation of any of
 the motor centres of the medulla or cord ;                sometimes with the
 participation of one    or  more of the neighbouring medullary centres
 (e.g., the respiratory).      Such results are commonly            obtained by
 stimulation of the gills, of the fifth bronchial arch, of the first spinal
 nerve, or of the vagus nerve as it passes along the oesophagus below
 the heart.     Stimulation of these parts frequently leads to prolonged
 inhibition of the heart without the occurrence of any other indication
 of reflex action.

 destroyed or anaesthetics were administered             before any operative
 proceedings were resorted to.)

                               (Abstract.)
   After a short account of the researches of Sir William Thomson
and Professor G. Wiedemann, on the loss of energy of a wire when
vibrating torsionally, the author proceeds to describe his own experi
ments on the same subject.    The wire under examination was clamped
at one end into a stout brass block, which was secured to the extremity
of a strong iron bracket projecting from a wall. A wooden box nearly
600 cm. in length and 12 cm. square inside, protected the vertically
suspended wire from currents of air. The box rested upon another,
which measured about 40 cm. each way, provided with a glass window
in the front, and a door at the side, which latter was opened only
when it was necessary to make a readjustment of a vibrator attached
to the lower extremity of the wire, and capable of moving freely in
side the box.    The bar of the vibrator was either clamped or soldered
to the lower extremity of the wire, and on it were suspended two cylin
ders of equal mass and dimensions ; by sliding the cylinders backwards
or forwards on the bar the moment of inertia of the whole vibrator
could be altered without changing the mass. The torsional vibrations
of the wire were observed by the aid of mirror, scale, and lamp, so
that, as the length of the wire was upwards of 600 cm., and the
diameter rather less than 1 mm., very small molecular displacements
were produced when the wire was vibrating.
   It was found necessary to allow the wire to rest, after the adjust
ments had been made, for a length of time varying with the nature
of the metal from one day to several weeks ; as though great care was
taken in arranging the wire, it was impossible in many cases to avoid
imparting subpermanent torsion, which gradually came out under the
influence of rest and repeated oscillation.
   Very great care was taken both in starting the vibrator and in
taking the observations, the results of which showed that the diminu
tion of amplitude could in most cases be determined with considerable
accuracy.
   The various   causes of the loss of energy of a vibrating wire are
pointed  out  in the paper, and subsequent experiments proved that all
of these are practically neglectable, except the resistance of the air
and the internal molecular friction of the metal.      A full account is

 1884.J       Stress and Strain on the Properties      of Matte?:          43
given    of the method of eliminating from the results the effect of the
resistance of the air, which with some metals plays a very unimportant
part in diminishing the amplitude as compared with the internal fric
tion, but with others, especially under certain conditions, is to be
credited with almost the entire loss of energy.
    A mathematical investigation of the loss of energy which would be
experienced by a wire vibrating under the influence of torsional elas
ticity, if the internal friction of solids were like that of fluids, proved
with reference to the proportionate diminution of amplitude (a) that
it should be independent of the amplitude ; (6) that it should vary
inversely with the vibration-period. From the experiments it followed
that though the condition (a) was satisfied, (b) was not, so that when
the moment of inertia of the vibrator was altered without any change
of mass, instead of the proportionate diminution of amplitude being
in the inverse ratio of the vibration-period, it seemed to be to a con
siderable extent independent of the period.
    " The                          "
            fatigue of elasticity     (a term first used by Sir William
Thomson), according to which a wire which had been kept vibrating
for several hours or days through a certain range, came to rest much
more quickly when left to itself than when set in vibration after it
had been at rest for several days, was next the subject of investiga
tion, and it was found that this elastic fatigue never showed itself
when     the wire, whatever might be the metal of which it was
composed, was vibrated through amplitudes            sufficiently within the
limits of elasticity, but, on the contrary, repeated oscillation was in
this case always attended with diminution           of loss of energy, the
diminution being subpermanent.            No trace of elastic fatigue was
discernible in the case of most of the metals examined so long as the
vibrations did not exceed in amplitude the limits of the scale, but
with nickel it was necessary to confine the amplitude to 100 scale-
divisions, in order to avoid
                               " fatigue of elasticity."
   Moderate permanent extension was found to diminish the loss of
energy of a copper wire and to increase that of an iron wire, provided
a  rest of one day was allowed     ; recent permanent     extension increased
in both cases the loss of energy.      The difference between copper and
iron in the above respect is no doubt due to the greater "coercive
       "
force      of the   latter.  Moderate permanent torsion had a much
greater effect    than   permanent extension in increasing the loss of
energy of an iron wire.
    An examination of the effect of passing an electric current of from
 1 to -3 ampere through a vibrating iron, nickel, or tin wire ended in
proving that such a current, though capable of producing sensible
circular magnetisation of the first two metals, had no sensible effect
 on the loss of energy of any of them.
    During the investigation it was thought advisable to make experi

 44           Stress and Strain on the Properties         of Matter. [Dec. 18,
 ments on the loss of energy of a vibrating magnet, and the following
 facts were elicited : —
    (a.) The loss of energy of a vibrating magnet, like that of a
 vibrating iron wire, is lessened by repeated oscillations, and, after the
first adjustment, or after a slight jar, is lessened by rest only. Repeated
 oscillation produces a subpermanent diminution of loss of energy.
    (6.) The diminution of amplitude due to magnetic causes only is
 like that due to the resistance of the air, and follows the same law,
 namely, that for different vibration-periods the diminution is inversely
 as the period, and therefore is in this respect quite unlike the
 diminution of amplitude resulting from internal friction.
    During the whole of the experiments a most careful watch was
 kept upon any effect which change of temperature might produce in
 the loss of energy, and it was discovered that whilst with wires of
 tin, lead, aluminium, silver, platinum, nickel, unannealed piano-steel,
 zinc, copper, brass, German silver, and platinum-silver the loss of
 energy became greater when the temperature was raised ; with iron, on
 the contrary, the loss of energy was diminished by the same cause.*
    The marked difference between the effects produced on the loss of
 energy of annealed iron and of the other metals, by rise of temperature,
 caused an extended investigation to be made with annealed iron wire
 with the following results : —
    (a.) The loss of energy of a torsionally vibrating iron wire is
permanently diminished to a very large extent by repeated heating to
 100° C. and cooling combined with long rest.
    (b.) The loss of energy is very considerably diminished temporarily
 by rise of temperature, the value of the logarithmic decrement at the
 temperature 0" C. being about twice as great as the value at 100° C.
 The loss of energy at the temperature of 100° C. of an iron wire
 which has been repeatedly heated to 100° C. and cooled to the
ordinary temperature of the room is so small that it may be almost
entirely accounted for by the resistance of the air.
    An examination was also made of the effect of change of tempera
ture on the torsional rigidity of the metal, and it was found that this
change could be represented by the formula —
                     n=r0(l--0001443i--0000015804«2),
 where r/ and    r0 represented the torsional rigidity at t° C. and 0° C.
respectively.     Both from the observed torsional rigidity and from that
calculated from the formula, it was found that the decrease of the
torsional rigidity caused by rise of temperature from 0° C. to 100° C.
 is only about half of that got by Kohlrausch when making a similar
investigation. The great discrepancy above alluded to can only have
arisen from the different treatment of the iron previously to the actual

testing,   repeated heating and cooling, combined with oscillations for
a   great number of hours and long rest, having had the effect of
rendering the iron much less susceptible to alteration of torsional
rigidity from change of temperature.
    At the present stage of the inquiry it is impossible to arrive at
any definite conclusion       as to any relationship between the viscosity of
metals and    their specific electrical resistance.      It would seem indeed
that in the case of the pure metals, those which have the greatest
viscosity,   such as lead and tin, are those whose specific electrical
resistance is comparatively great, but even with the pure metals so
many circumstances        influence the loss of energy that a much more
extended investigation must be made ere one can write with sufficient
certainty on the point.         In the case of the alloys, German silver,
platinum-silver,    and   brass,   the values of the logarithmic decrements
do not seem to be greater than those pertaining to their components,
whereas as regards specific electrical resistance we know that this
is not so. Again we encounter the curious fact that whereas with iron
the electrical resistance   is more increased   by rise of temperature than is
the case   with any other metal, the logarithmic       decrement is on the con
trary decreased by the same cause.
    A review of the whole experiments shows that the loss of energy
 due to internal     friction of a torsionally vibrating wire does not
accord with laws of fluid friction, but with those of external friction,
inasmuch as the loss of energy from internal friction, like that from
external friction, is to a great extent independent of the velocity.
 Whether with external as with internal friction the loss of energy
 would be independent       of the pressure provided the molecules of the two
 surfaces  were   brought into very close proximity, remains yet to be
decided.

 "
   in the theory of Linear Differential Equations there are two important
 classes of functions of the coefficients which have remarkable analogies
 to the invariants of Algebraic Binary Quantics."             He then proceeds
 to determine    the forms of such       functions,  and   to  give examples of
 their application.     Soon after the publication of the abstract of

of criticoids, and suggesting that it might be convenient to compare
his results with those obtained by Sir James Cockle, to whom the
theory of criticoids is due.

James Cockle's results                              object of this communica
tion is to show that there is not only similarity, but absolute identity,
the two classes of functions considered by Professor Malet coinciding
in every point with the ordinary and differential criticoids discussed
by Sir James Cockle.        The researches of the latter mathematician on
this subject have appeared at intervals of time in papers scattered and
often fragmentary, in different journals during the last twenty years
and more.      I propose here to reproduce and present in a connected
form the principal portions of those researches ; and in order to
facilitate the comparison of results, I will generally adopt the notation

By a critical function of the roots or coefficients of an algebraic eqna-
tion is meant a function which remains unaltered when each of the
roots is increased or diminished by any quantity whatever, or which
remains unaltered when x + h is substituted for a; in a given equation
in x; it is in fact what Professor Cayley calls a semin variant, that is,
a function which             is reduced to zero by one only of the operators

and       this   is   identical with Professor Malet's equation (2).
     8.   In the same paper the author defines what he means by criticoids,
and       indicates the different methods by which these functions may be
calculated.        He says, " A criticoid stands in the same relation to                               a
factorially transformed  linear differential equation that     critical                    a

general quantoid, the degrees of the criticoids being the greatest
suffices which occur in them respectively. These criticoids are called
basic; they are so called                of their simplicity. " In each
                                          on account
only one single differential coefficient occurs, and into each the
coefficient of greatest suffix and the differential coefficient enter only
linearly, neither being multiplied into the other or into any differential
or other non-numerical coefficient."       There are no quadricriticoids
which are not functions or multiples of H, and no cubicriticoids
which are not functions or multiples of        but all functions of

fessor Malet's proof of the general theorem on which the doctrine of
criticoids rests, showing that as the transformation      of a quantic by a
linear substitution leaves the critical functions unaltered, so the trans
formation of a quantoid by       factorial substitution leaves the criticoids

it is more direct, perfectly general, and easy of application ; moreover,
it determines the criticoids in their simplest, that is, basic forms.
   10. Besides the class of functions hitherto considered, there is
another class of a criticoidal nature, the discovery of which is also due
to Sir James Cockle.     Treating the term Critical as generic, we have
at least two species, namely, the algebraical critical species, now com
monly known as seminvariants, and the differential critical species, or
criticoids, of which there are- at least two varieties, namely, the
ordinary, and that which Sir James Cockle calls the differential
criticoid. But in fact both varieties are differential criticoids, the
true distinction between them being that one set of functions remains
unaltered when the quantoid is transformed by factorial substitution,
and the other when the transformation is effected by change of the
independent variable. With the latter, Professor Malet's second class
of invariants may be readily identified.

assigning particular numerical values to n. Further,              shown in      it    is

seem to partake more of the nature of seminvariants             or critical
functions.    If we  agree  to call an expression critical when     remains                it

unchanged          after a change of one variable, and ultra-critical when it
go    remains after a change of more than one, then seminvariants and
invariants are respectively critical and ultra-critical algebraical func
tions.       Criticoids may          be called      ordinary, or of the first class, when
the dependent variable is changed, and extraordinary, or of the second
class, when the independent variable is changed.                           A criticoid, whether
of the first or second            class,   is  in the   nature    of  a seminvariant,       not of
an invariant ; it does not correspond with an invariant.                            It is critical,
not ultra-critical.            In differential expressions we have critical functions
or criticoids.           But we have not in general ultra-critical functions, or,
as it is proposed to call them, Invaroids.                       To obtain such functions it
is necessary          to change two variables, the dependent and the indepen
dent.       In a recent letter          to me Sir James Cockle suggests that in a
limited number of cases                it may be possible by means of semicritical
relations*        to form invaroids, that is, ultra-critical functions of the
calculus        analogous to the invariants or ultra-critical functions of
algebra.         Such functions may have a place in the general theory, but
 it is  not necessary to pursue the subject here.
     17. In tracing out the analogies between algebraical and differential
 eqnations, Sir James Cockle has been led to consider another class of
criticoidal       functions, namely, those connected with partial differential
equations.t            How the criticoidal functions of the first and second
 class may be combined, what are the uses of criticoids, and what is
 the part they play in the                      theory of the solution of differential
 equations,J          are    points    illustrated       by numerous examples in the
 memoirs        from which           I  have drawn most of the materials of this
 communication.

    The paper describes in detail experiments of which preliminary
notices have already been published in the " Proceedings of the Royal
Society," vol. 34, p. 39, and in the
                                                    " Philosophical Magazine,"
November, 1883.          The experiments relate to—
    (1.) The magnetic susceptibility of iron and steel, the form of the
magnetisation curve, and the changes of magnetism caused by cyclic
changes of magnetising force.
    (2.) The influence of vibration on magnetic susceptibility and reten-
tiveness.
    (3.) The influence of permanent strain on magnetic susceptibility
and retentiveness.

the orders 1 and 2.    For other applications of the theory, see Cockle " On Primary

    The experiments were conducted on pieces of metal which gave as
near an approach     to the  condition of uniform magnetisation as is prac
tically attainable.    In some cases rings were used in a manner similar
to that employed by Stoletow and Rowland, except that in the present
case the process of magnetisation      was effected in a series of sudden
steps,  the total  magnetisation  being  found by summing up the induc
tive effect of the steps.      In most cases, however, the author used
straight pieces of wire, whose length was 300 or 400 times their
diameter.     These permitted the use of a direct magnetometric method
of observation,     and consequently the magnetising force could be
applied   and  removed    continuously and slowly, instead of by sudden
steps.   Preliminary experiments had satisfied the author that wires of
this length gave as near an approach to uniform magnetisation             as
could be practically obtained by using rings.
    Curves are given which show the behaviour of iron and steel in
various states of temper, when subjected to a first application of mag
netising force, and also to subsequent cyclic changes of magnetising
 force, such    as complete or partial removal and re-application, or
reversal.    The curves are drawn by plotting either        the intensity of

                     :
tion to the physical state of the piece under examination are pointed
 out.   Curves so drawn invariably exhibit the static lagging action to
 which the author (in    a former paper) gave the name " hysteresis," any
 cyclic change of    $ giving rise to  a  more or less nearly closed loop in
 the curve. Attention was previously drawn to these loops by Warburg,
 who also anticipated the author in pointing out their important phy
   meaning, namely, that the area of loop, or — /|<il),

 the energy expended (per unit of volume) in performing the cycle of
of
magnetisation which the loop describes. In the present paper numer
ous absolute measurements of this energy are given, especially of the
energy which    thus dissipated in each reversal of the magnetism of
                is
a piece of iron or steel.  These show that while the dissipation of
energy    by reversal  of magnetism     is very much smaller in soft iron
than in hard    iron or steel, even in the latter its amount    very trifling,
                                                                is

electromagnets must be due chiefly to other causes than this static
hysteresis, and is, in fact, due almost wholly to the induction of so-
called Foncault currents in the cores. The relation of this hysteresis
to Weber's theory of molecular magnets, as extended by Maxwell, is
discussed, and the insufficiency of Maxwell's extension noticed.
    By vibrating a piece of soft iron during the application and
removal of magnetising force, the effects of hysteresis are almost entirely
removed, and the iron is then found to possess almost no retentiveness.
But when the application and removal of magnetising force are
effected without mechanical disturbance, the retentiveness of soft
iron is found to be even greater than that of steel. In some cases
93 per cent. of the whole induced magnetism of a piece of annealed
iron was found to remain, on the complete removal of the magnetising
force.   It is pointed out that there is no discrepancy between this
result and the well-known fact that a short iron core of an electro
magnet retains almost no magnetism when the current in the magnet
is interrupted. In that case the ends of the magnet itself, after the
interruption of the current, exert a sufficient reversed magnetising
force to destroy almost entirely the residual magnetism.        But when
tested under    the  conditions   which   give uniform  magnetisation and
avoid the demagnetising influence of the ends, soft annealed iron is
more retentive than even the hardest steel.
    Examples are given showing that the influence of permanent set in
the curve of magnetisation is so marked as to give a criterion by
which a strained piece may be readily distinguished from an annealed
piece of metal, and that strain diminishes very greatly the magnetic
retentiveness of iron.
    Numerical values of the coefficients of permeability (fi) and of sus
ceptibility (k) are given for a number of samples of iron and steel,
 and the relation of these coefficients to £J and $ is exhibited
graphically after the manner of Rowland. The greatest value of n
refers to soft annealed iron while under mechanical vibration, and is
about 20,000.
    The next part of the paper deals with the effects of stress (consist
ing of longitudinal pull J on the magnetic susceptibility and retentive
ness of iron, and the subject is taken up in two different ways.         In
 one the magnetic effects are observed when a load hanging from the
wire under examination is gradually applied, removed, and otherwise
 varied, the wire being then either kept in a magnetising field of
 constant value, or freed from all magnetising force.         In the other
method the load is kept constant, and magnetising force is applied,
 removed, and otherwise varied.       The two methods give results which
 would   be identical were  it not   for (1) hysteresis in the relation of
 magnetism to load, in a constant field, and (2) hysteresis in the rela
 tion of magnetism to field, under constant load. The relation of mag-,

1885.]             Experimental Researches in Magnetism.                  Gl
netism to varying load in a constant field is examined at great length,
both in soft annealed wire, and in wire hardened by stretching, and
the effects, which are very complex, are exhibited graphically.         They
also afford an easy criterion by which a stretched piece can be distin
guished    from an annealed piece, and, both in stretched and annealed
metal, they exhibit static hysteresis, which can be more or less com
pletely wiped out by mechanical vibration.           The connexion of the
author's present work with the earlier results of Villari, and the
extensive researches of     Sir W. Thomson, is pointed out.
    Numerous     curves are given, showing the relation to      j to ^ when
the process of magnetisation       is conducted while the piece under test
is maintained     in a constant state of stress. These show very clearly
the position of what Thomson has called the " Villari critical point,"
or   point at which the sign of the effect of          stress on magnetism
becomes reversed ; and it is shown that this          reversal is associated
rather with a particular value of magnetisation      than with a particular
value of magnetising force, the same reversal        being found to occur
when the magnetism        dealt with is wholly residual.
    Instances are given of very curious molecular reminiscences of
previous loads, which were found to exist even when the previous
loading had been performed at a time when the metal was entirely
destitute    of magnetism, and although the loads whose effects were
 found to    remain were much less than loads previously applied to the
 same wire, and were consequently          unable to produce mechanical
 change of any ordinary kind.        These residual effects of former loads
became visible on the next magnetisation        of the piece. It is shown
 that these effects of previous loads can be almost obliterated by sub
 jecting the wire to vibration before beginning to magnetise it.
    The ratio of residual to induced magnetism in soft and hardened
 iron and steel has been examined for various degrees of magnetisation,
 with the result of showing that the ratio passes a maximum when
 the magnetisation is moderately strong, and then falls off as the state
 of so-called saturation is reached.     The influence of the presence of
 stress on this ratio and on residual magnetism           generally has also
 been   investigated.
    The last part of the paper deals more briefly with the effect of tem

 mann and others.      The present experiments were specially directed to
 discover whether there is hysteresis in the relation of magnetism to
 temperature     when the temperature suffers cyclic changes. Careful
 experiments on both induced and residual magnetism have led the
 author to conclude that within the range of temperature dealt with
 by him, there is no perceptible hysteresis in the relation of magnetism
 to temperature.      Curves are also given exhibiting the process of mag

were made, during 1881-1883, in the Laboratory of the University of
Tokio, Japan, with the help of Japanese students, Messrs. Fujisawa,
Tanakadate, Tanaka, and Sakai, to whom the author is indebted for
much valuable assistance.     The results have been. almost without

   The    first part of the paper which appears at present restricts
itself to the consideration of the Tesseral, Tetragonal, and Rhombic
systems.      By means of a well founded assumption in regard to the
stress-distribution in crystals of the above systems, the equilibrium
conditions are deduced which further involve that the boundary of
the configuration must either be plane or spherical.
   It also appears that the statical conditions of the agency which
causes crystallisation are the same as those so well investigated for
gravitation and electricity.
   The paper is divided into three chapters.          The first chapter treats
of the " Foundation of the Assumption."              The assumption is that
the stress upon any particle can only be transmitted in six direction-
lines respectively at right angles in pairs to the three crystallogra-
phic axes — it is a consequence of the internal structure which is
shown to be analogous to that of an ordinary cannon-ball                  pile by
means of the cleavage properties,           the external form       and    inertia
relations of crystals.
   The second chapter — " Derivation of the Force Function — applies
                                                                      "

to effect this it was necessary to deduce some peculiarities of the
force function in a system of uniform density in equilibrium, and
subject to internal forces when referred to the three principal axes of
 inertia through the mass centre.          The character of the attracting
 agency here    becomes evident.

IV. " On      some Applications of Dynamical Principles to Physical
       Phenomena."           By    J.   J. Thomson, M.A., F.R.S., Fellow
       of Trinity College, and Cavendish Professor of Physics in
       the University of Cambridge.                 Received December 16,
       1884.
                                       (Abstract.)
    In this paper an attempt is made to apply dynamical principles
to study some of the phenomena in electricity, magnetism, heat, and
elasticity.     The matter (including, if necessary, the ether) which takes
part in any phenomenon is looked upon as forming a material system,
and the motion of this system is investigated by means of general
dynamical methods, Lagrange's equations being the method most
frequently used. To apply this method, it is necessary to have
coordinates which can fix the configuration of the system, so in
the first part of the paper coordinates are introduced which fix the
configuration of the system, so far as the phenomena we are consider
ing are concerned, i.e., we introduce coordinates which can fix the
geometrical, the electrical, the magnetic, the heat, and the strain
configuration of the system ; we call these, coordinates of the x, y, z,
u, and w types respectively.             Some of these coordinates only enter
the expression         for  the   kinetic   energy through their differential
coefficients,    and may be called gyroscopic             coordinates, as such
coordinates      are of frequent occurrence in problems about gyro
scopes.
    The terms which involve the x, y, z, u, and w coordinates in the
expression for the kinetic energy will be of fifteen different types.
    There will be those terms which are quadratic functions of the
differential coefficients of the x coordinates, and corresponding terms
for the y, z, u, and w coordinates ; so that there are in this set terms
of five different types, all of which may exist in actual dynamical
systems.       There are ten types of terms involving the products of
 differential coefficients of two coordinates of different kinds. These
 types are considered in order, and it is shown that we have
 experimental evidence for the existence of only two of them, viz.,

those  which involve the product of the differential coefficients of
coordinates of the x and w and of the y and z types.  Thus we may
write those terms which depend on the coordinates x, y, z, u, w, in
the expression for the kinetic energy of any real dynamical system,
in the form
                                                           -

when the    term {xx}i* + - - - indicates a quadratic function of the
differential coefficients of the coordinates of the x type.
   Each of these terms is separately considered, and the physical
phenomena to which              it
                        corresponds are deduced.     The method used
may be illustrated by considering a term of the form
                                               {   X/i}\A,
when X     and /t may         be any   of the five types of coordinates which we
are    considering.
    Then,     if T   be the   kinetic energy,             we have by    Lagrange's equations

                —
 of the type z i.e., a magnetising force along the wire equal to
 so  that when a current flows along a twisted wire it magnetises it ;
 this effect has also been observed. Thus, from the original experi
 ment, we have been able, by the use of Lagrange's equation, to deduce
 two other phenomena.         It is shown in the paper that the method
 indicates a great many relations between various physical phenomena.
 Some of these have been observed, but there are several which seem
 not to have been investigated ; as an example of the latter, it is proved
 that from the effect observed'by Villari and Sir William Thomson,
 namely, that when the intensity of magnetisation is below a certain
 value, an increase in the strain of a magnetised soft iron is accom
 panied by an increase in the magnetisation, it follows that when the
  magnetising force is small, a soft iron bar will contract instead of
  expanding on magnetisation.
     Lagrange's equations were applied with great success by Maxwell
  to obtain the equations of the electromagnetic field.
     It is also shown that the effects due to the potential energy of a
  system A can be produced by the kinetic energy of a system B con
  nected with A, if the configuration of B is such that it can be fixed
  by gyroscopic coordinates.      And thus we may look on the potential
  energy of any system (A) as being the kinetic energy of a gyro
  scopic   system (B) connected      with A, and so regard all energy as
  kinetic.     If we do this it     will simplify some of the dynamical
  principles very much. We may take the principle of Varying Action
  as an example : if all the energy is kinetic, its magnitude will remain
  constant by the Conservation of Energy, and then the principle of
   Least Action takes the very simple form that, with a given quantity of
  energy, any material system will, by its unguided motion, pass from
  one configuration to another in the least possible time, where, in the

    In a paper on the Origin of the Fibrin Ferment, published in
"Proc. Roy. Soc.," vol. 36,     I  showed that there exists, dissolved in
 the plasma, a body which can give rise to fibrin ferment.
    I have    proceeded with my investigations, and have succeeded in
 making     some  additions to our knowledge of this subject, which            I
 here describe.      As my researches are not complete,      I  confine myself
 to as  brief an account as possible.
    The subject is best studied in the blood of peptonised dogs.            But
 as I showed in the above quoted paper, similar results are obtained
 from normal      salt plasma, so that the results are not peculiar to
 pepton blood.      The body, the presence of which gives rise to fibrin
ferment, can be isolated from pepton plasma in the following very
simple manner: — The plasma having been completely freed from all
corpuscular elements by means of the centrifuge, is cooled down to
about 0°.      The plasma, which was previously perfectly clear, becomes
rapidly turbid, and after standing for some time in the cool, a very
decided flocculent precipitate forms.        I have already described this
observation in a short note,        " Ueber einen neuen Stoff des Blut-
Plasmas," in du Bois Reymond's " Archiv fur Physiologic," but it is
necessary for me to allude to it here.
   Now it is this body which gives rise to the fibrin ferment.         So long
as the former is present in considerable           quantity the latter clots
readily on passing through it a stream of carbonic acid, or on dilution,
and at the same time a very considerable quantity of fibrin ferment
makes its appearance.
   By prolonged cooling the greater part of this substance can be
removed, and with its gradual removal the plasma clots less and less
readily with C02, and less and less ferment is formed, till finally it
becomes practically incoagulable, i.e., forms only a faint trace of fibrin
after several days.      If some of the substance be again added to the
plasma,    it regains its power of clotting with C02.
    (The    substance  must be added before it has stood very long        :  see
 tmder.)

 70     Dr. L. C. Wooldridge.          A Neic Constituent     of the  [Jan.   8,
    It must be understood that the plasma, previous to the passage of
 the C02, is quite free from fibrin ferment, so that there can be no
 question of the ferment being mechanically removed by the pre
 cipitate.
    Moreover, that it is really the body removable by cold which gives
rise to the fibrin ferment, and not any second body which is mechani
 cally carried down with the former, is shown by the fact that the
 diffusion of a large quantity of inert finely-divided precipitate through
 the plasma, and its subsequent removal by the centrifuge, does not in
 any way do away with the power of the plasma to clot.
    It is therefore justifiable to assume that when pepton plasma clots
 readily and completely with C02, it must contain this new body in
 some quantity,     and that when   it will not clot, or only very imperfectly,
 after  repeated treatment    with C02 or dilution, this new body must be
 present in very small quantity.
           I
    Now have found that the behaviour of pepton plasma with C02
varies very considerably with the diet on which the animal is fed, and
whether the animal is fasting or has recently been fed. In some cases
it clots readily, in others practically not at all.
    Out of eight dogs fed on very lean meat only one gave a plasma
 which clotted at all fully, and in this case the clotting went on for
two days.       From all the others the plasma, in spite of repeated treat
ment with C02, only gave rise after two or three days to a scarcely
perceptible fibrin membrane.         The animals were killed about eighteen
hours after the last meal.
    Of six dogs fed on fat and meat for several days all gave a plasma
which clotted rapidly and fully in from twenty minutes to one hour
after the C02 treatment.          The animals were killed about eighteen
hours after being      fed.
    Of two dogs fed on bread and meat both gave a readily coagulable
plasma.
    One day's feeding on fat does not produce any effect ; that is the
blood of a dog thus fed behaves like that of a dog fed on a lean meat.
    A dog fed for some days on fat and meat, was for five days previous
to being killed put on fat alone ; as a consequence it practically
starved, as    it ate scarcely anything.     The blood from this dog clotted
very incompletely.
    Simple starvation for three days did away with the influence of fat
in another case.
    These results only hold good for dogs in health.           In a dog with a
suppurating wound, kindly placed at my disposal by Mr. Horsley,
the plasma, in spite of a lean meat diet, clotted with very great
rapidity, and contained an enormous quantity of the new body. All
the other dogs were healthy, but were badly nourished when they
came into my hands.

   It is necessary      for these experiments    that the peptonisation should
be complete.
  For                              of these results,
           the complete understanding                        I
                                                     must return to a
further consideration of this new constituent of the plasma.
  The turbidity which appears on first cooling the plasma, if
examined microscopically,  is found to consist of a great number of
minute pale transparent bodies of a rounded shape, much resembling
small organised bodies, such for instance as the stroma of the red
corpuscles, except that they are of very various size, but generally
much  smaller than red corpuscles.          They have   a great tendency to   run
together into granular masses.
   At first the precipitate is soluble on re- warming the plasma slightly,
but  it soon undergoes change, and loses the power of redissolving by
heat.    If the substance be collected by means of the centrifuge it
forms a disk or thin membrane at the bottom of the tube, much
reminding one of fibrin, but closer examination shows that it presents
marked differences from the latter, and that, in truth, it much more
closely resembles the peculiar      viscid body obtained by destroying
leucocytes with dilute alkalies, &c.
   On longer standing,       however, it becomes in most cases still
further changed, and is then undistinguishable        from ordinary fibrin,
swelling   in  dilute HC1 like the latter.  For  further  details as to the
properties of this substance, I refer to my paper quoted above.
   We have already seen that this substance gives rise to fibrin fer
ment, but it does more than this in inducing coagulation.
   Pepton plasma is not coagulable with fibrin ferment.          If we take
some plasma rich in this new substance, and by means of
                                                                C02 induce
coagulation, we obtain, on removing the clot, a serum which has the
power of inducing exceedingly      rapid coagulation in a new portion of
plasma, and this, when the serum has regained its alkalinity.          This
serum    contains ferment, but inasmuch as ferment is not sufficient
to induce     coagulation, it must also contain some other substance.
Now leucocytes have exactly the same power.             They give rise to
ferment, but they also give rise to the other substance necessary for
coagulation.
  We see,         therefore, that we have dissolved     in the plasma    a body
exerting    the same influence       on the induction of coagulation     as the
leucocytes.
  I think this is  the strongest chemical proof that can be brought
that the leucocytes break down to make, at any rate, a part of the
proteid constituents of the plasma, and have shown above the influ
ence which diet, &c, has on the extent     of this process, a fact of
obvious    interest for the question of assimilation.
  There     is,however, another important conclusion         to be drawn from
these   observations,     viz.,   that   one must admit,   in addition   to   the

possibly affording an explanation of the observations made by Osier,
Bizzozero, Hayem, and others. I refer of course to the granules, Blut-

      Male Milk Glands of Echidna hystrix." By WlLHELM
      Haacke, Ph.D., Museum Director to the Public Library,
      Museum, and Art Gallery of South Australia, Adelaide,
      and late Assistant Director to the Zoological Institute,
      Jena. Communicated by the President. Received Novem
      ber  12, 1884.
   On the 3rd of August, 1884, a number of living specimens of
Echidna hystrix were brought to Adelaide from Kangaroo Island,
where they had been captured some days previously.         I was unable
to procure more of them than two, a male and a female, as the others
had been disposed of before        I heard of them.     But those two
afforded me the good fortune of making a discovery that, in our
 days, perhaps no naturalist would have expected to make.        I found
an egg in the mammary pouch of the female, and was thus enabled
to prove that Echidna is really an oviparous mammal.
   This discovery was made on the 25th of August ; it was announced,
and the egg was exhibited at the meeting of the Royal Society of
South Australia on the 2nd of September ; the scientific society
referred to being the first one on record, the members of which had
an opportunity of examining an egg laid by one of the Monotremata.
   On September 14th    I killed and dissected the female Echidna that
had laid the egg. Neither the pouch nor the oviducts nor the uterus
contained any more ova, but all the female organs were well developed.
Only the right ovary contained what evidently was a corpus luteum,
but there was only one. This corpus luteum deserved its name, as it
was orange coloured instead of having a pale fleshy tint as is the
case with the ovisacs still containing undeveloped ovula ; it was not
quite so large and round as the largest of the ovisacs.

1885.J            Mammary Pouch, fyc,        of Echidna hystrix.            73
    The Echidna egg, when taken out of its mother's pouch, unfortu
nately burst, and it was found to be almost wholly decomposed inside.
The    mother having been worried by being captured and during
captivity accounts for the state the egg was found in.             As the shell
of the egg broke so soon I am unable to give the egg's dimensions
as   accurately     as  could  be  desired ;  however, I think   I  am nearly
correct     in stating its length    as 15 m.m., and its width as 13 mm. ;
it  will thus be seen that the egg is nearly globular in shape. In a
preliminary notice to the
                                  " Zoologischer Anzeiger " the dimensions
given are somewhat incorrect.
    The shell of the egg was parchment-like, like that of the eggs of
many reptiles.        Its outer surface was considerably smoother than the
inner one.       Its thickness was about     \ mm.
    The   inner surface of the egg-shell was covered with a loose mem
brane    which on microscopical examination showed a network of what
I  supposed to be blood-vessels ; no other trace of an embryo could be
discovered.
    It will have been observed already that        I speak of one
                                                                   " mammary
             or " marsupium " only, whereas Professor Owen described as
         "

pouches      two semilunular fossae, at the fundi of which he found the
orifices of the mammary glands (" Phil. Trans.," vol. 155).             But as
the mammary          pouch serves at one period as an incubator for the
"marsupial ovum," it must at least at this time have a shape enabling
it to undertake this function.         Accordingly, we find in my specimen
one deep pouch large enough to hold, although not wholly to conceal,
a gentleman's        watch, having its fundus in the median plane of the
body     towards     the cloaca, and running out into shallower fossae
 towards the mammary areolae, beyond which towards the anterior
end of the body it gradually disappears.              The skin forming the
 ponch is thinner than that of the rest of the ventral integument,
and the pouch and its lips are covered more thinly with hair, the
latter being shorter, however, and standing thicker on the mammary
 areoUe, where very conspicuous tufts of hair are easily to be observed.
 Although the marsupial integument is devoid of subcutaneous muscles,
 the animal can considerably        modify the shape of the pouch, probably
by   the  surrounding integumentary muscles.
    Quite recently Professor Gegenbaur ("Morphologischer Jahrbuch,"
 1884) examined two adult females of Echidna setosa for the existence
 of mammary pouches, but without success.              He, therefore, inclines
 to think     that the pouches are only periodically developed organs.
Although I have not sufficient evidence to prove this supposition,           I
 believe it is the correct one ; how could the statements of Professor
 Owen, of Professor Gegenbaur, and of myself otherwise be reconciled ?
 I believe the pouch attains its greatest development during the time
 it serves as incubator for the egg, and it consists of a pair of semi

   The examination of two male Echidnm which had an opportunity
to carry out during September led me to what I believe is another new
discovery.     Respecting the mammary glands of Ornithorhynchus Pro
fessor Owen (" Phil. Trans.," vol. 122, 1832) says :— " In the male both
Dr. Knox and Professor Meckel have been unable to detect these glands,
and after a careful scrutiny with the same view in a well preserved
specimen of that sex,    I have not succeeded in detecting more than a
few minute lobules occupying a space of about four lines in situations
corresponding to those in the female, but the nature of which, from
the total absence of corresponding foramina on the external surface
of the integument, may still be doubted."
                                                             I
   Furthermore, in the "Zoological Record" for 1876 read: — " C.
Creighton suggests that the glandula femoralis, which opens by a
long duct on the spurs of the male in Ornithorhynchus and Echidna,
may prove to be the homologue of the mammary gland of the female."
" J. Anat.
             Phys.," xi, pp. 29-31.
   This latter quotation of a certainly original suggestion shows that
up to the end of 1876 nothing could have been known about the
unmistakable homologue of the mammary gland of the female which
1 recently discovered in two male Echidnm, and        I am not aware that
any new facts to elucidate this question have been published up to
the present time.
   I was, therefore, not a little surprised to find in the two male
Echidnm    I  examined, in situations corresponding to those in the
female, similar tufts of short hair quite as plain as those indicative
of the mammary areolae in my female.             On the animals being
skinned,  I  found without any difficulty rudimentary mammary glands.
In the largest of my two specimens the one mammary gland forms a
mass about 8 mm. long by 4 mm. wide, the lobules being about
2 mm. long.       The other gland is a little larger.      The glands are
built after the same plan as the female glands, and contain a con
siderable number    of lobules.
   My  anatomical    preparations and the Echidna egg discovered by me
will remain in the Adelaide Museum.
   In conclusion, I should not forget to mention that I am aware of
Mr. W. H. Caldwell's discovery of the oviparity of the Monotremata,
made about the same time as it seems at which my discovery was
made, and that the British Association at their Montreal meeting
received the information of Mr. Caldwell's discovery about the same
date at which my Echidna egg was exhibited at a meeting of the
Royal Society of South Australia.                        I

          1884.
      At Professor      Lankester's suggestion    I have submitted to chemical
 analysis     the  cartilages occurring in Sepia and in Limulus.
      The basis of the cartilage is a chondrin-like body which gives the
 reactions of mucin and gelatin ; indeed chondrin, as it occurs in the
 ordinary hyaline cartilage of vertebrates, is now regarded by many
 as a mechanical mixture of these two bodies.              But in the cartilages
 of     the  two invertebrates       in question the gelatinous element is
 exceedingly        small,  and   no  gelatinisation occurs on the cooling of
 the hot watery extract.
     In addition to this, however, the cartilage of both these animals
differs from that of vertebrates           in containing a certain small per
centage of chitin.          In the case of Limulus 1'01 per cent., and of
 Sepia P22 per cent. of chitin in the dry state is present.
    I have     also demonstrated     that chitin exists in the liver of the king
crab,     though     whether    in the  connective tissue or in the liver cells
themselves        I  cannot say. The connective tissue element is very
abundant in the liver of this animal, and it seems probable, looking
at the part         that chitin plays as a supporting structure in these
animals, that it really forms in this instance a partial basis for the
connective tissue.
    The    way in which chitin was demonstrated to exist was the same
in   all three cases, viz.    : —

   I   prepared some of this body from the chitin contained in the
exoskeleton of cockroaches, and also obtained from Professor Lan-
kester some crystals of the same body which Professor Gamgee had
kindly sent him.
   I  was thus enabled to compare the crystalline body                I had obtained
from the invertebrate cartilage with that of the pure hydrochlorate
of glycosamine, and they were found to agree in the following
points    : —
       a.   Crystalline form : rhombic prisms of the monoclinic system ;
              measurement of the angles gave the same result in all cases.
       b.   Action of polarised light : nil.
       c.   Solubilities : easily soluble in water, soluble with difficulty in
              alcohol.
   These results are especially interesting as showing that chitin is
not a body which is exclusively epiblastic in origin, but in these three
instances at least occurs in mesoblastic structures.

   A complete account is here given of the experiments briefly referred
to in the Preliminary Note,* and of others on the same plan of more
recent date.       As regards the method, it may be sufficient to add to
what was there said, that the electric currents were estimated by com
paring the difference of potential generated by the current in travers
ing a known resistance with that of a standard Clark cell, the value
of the cell being known by converse operations, in which the current
was measured by a special electromagnetic apparatus.f                      Allowance

being made      for temperature, the determination of the currents by this
method was      abundantly accurate and very simple.
   The results are grouped in three series, of which the first two were
considered in the Preliminary Note.            In both of them the same tube
was used, the principal difference being that in the first the light
traversed    the tube three times, and in the second but once. In the
third series another tube was employed, and some improvements in
respect to thermal insulation were introduced.             The readings were
taken with a double image prism in place of the ordinary analysing
nicol, a substitution by which it is believed some advantages were
obtained.
   From the      fifteen sets of observations of Series I, we find as the
rotation   of sodium light in bisulphide of carbon at 18° corresponding
to a difference        of potential equal to unity C.G.S. the value '04203
minute.      From the four observations of Series          II  we get in like
manner '04198 minute, and from the seven observations of Series            III
-04202 minute.         The last value is adopted as the most probable.
   In an appendix some remarks are made upon polarimetry in general,
especially in relation to the half-shade method.         A device proposed by
M. Becquerel for augmenting           the precision with which rotations can
be determined with the aid of a half-wave plate is considered, and the
conclusion is arrived at that no advantage can thus be obtained.
 III. " Absorption-spectra Thermograms."                By Captain Abnet,
       R.E., F.R.S., and Colonel Festing,                  R.E.     Received
       December 31, 1884.
    When   employing      a grating for visual work, the choice of a medium
 which shall absorb the overlapping parts of orders of the spectrum
 other than that under examination          is a comparatively simple affair.
 When working photographically, however, it becomes necessary to
 know what invisible rays the medium will cut off.           For instance, in
 investigations     in  the  infra-red  of the  spectrum,  we  have found it
 necessary to ascertain whether media which absorb the blue and allow
 the red rays to pass would also transmit the above-mentioned parts of
 the  spectrum.
    Photography would seem to be the simplest method of experiment
 ing in this direction ; but the results not being quantitative, as are
 those obtained by a thermopile, we found it better to work with that
 instrument.
    It should  be remembered        that we were dealing with the infra-red
  part of the  spectrum,    in  which  the energy is so great as to be well
  shown by   the thermopile ; in the more refrangible part the indications

of the thermopile       are so feeble      that photography        would be more
serviceable.
   The absorbing media usually used were : —
   1. A solution of potassium dichromate.
   2. Ruby glass combined with orange glass.
   3. Deep orange glass alone (often called "stained red").
   4. Iodine dissolved in an aqueous solution of potassium iodide.
   5. Iodine in alcohol.
   6. Iodine in carbon disulphide (the violet rays being absorbed                       by
canary glass).
  7. Dyes of different kinds, combined with coloured glasses.
  8. Deep coloured cobalt glass and orange glass.
     Of     the 1st and 3rd were employed when the green rays had
          these
not to be cut off ; the 2nd, 4th, and 5th when the whole of the more
refrangible end of the spectrum down to the orange had to be absorbed,
while the 6th cut off very nearly the whole of the visible spectrum.
The dyes employed were soluble in either alcohol or water.
   With No. 8 (deep cobalt and orange glasses) a very long exposure
to the dark rays was found necessary to obtain a satisfactory impres
sion on a sensitive plate.
   In these experiments we used the thermopile described in our paper
in the " Proc. Roy. Soc." (No. 232, 1884). The source of radiation
was an incandescence lamp maintained by a Grove's battery of 40 cells,
the filament being approximately at the temperature of 1650°.
   An image of the filament was thrown by a lens on the slit of a
collimator, behind which was the dispersing prism. The rays emerging
from this were collected by a second lens into a spectrum at a definite
distance from the prism, and the thermopile was passed along this
spectrum, as described in our paper above mentioned.     The absorbing
media were placed in front of the slit of the collimator, glass cells
one-eighth of an inch of internal thickness being used for containing
the liquids.
   The thermogram of the radiation unabsorbed, except by the prism
and lenses, was first made (see Curve I, figs. I and II). An empty
cell was next placed in front of the slit ; the thermogram (Curve VI,
fig. II) shows that no special, but a general absorption has been pro
duced.*    A comparison of Curves II, III, and V with Curve I, in
fig. I, shows the absorption of radiant energy by orange glass, ruby
glass, and cobalt glass respectively.
   Through the kindness of Messrs. Chance Brothers we can state
that the orange colour is given by the oxides of silver and antimonv
combined, whilst the ruby colour is due to cuprous oxide.        The

                                                   for reflection from the two  inner
surfaces of the glass, so that all comparisons are made under similar conditions.

cobalt   colour, as is well known, is given by cobalt.               A glance at
the curves shows why any combination           in which the last is employed
would necessitate a prolonged         exposure, as it will be seen that it
entirely absorbs the   infra-red rays about the part of maximum energy.
The use    of this glass should therefore be avoided, if possible, when
the  infra-red rays are to be used in photography.
   In a paper by Captain Abney, which appeared in the " Philosophical
            "
Magazine       (vol. x, 1880), it was shown that reversal of the photo
graphic image was caused by rays of low refrangibility.               If a photo
graphic plate    which  has been exposed to      white light in the camera be
subsequently exposed to radiations of low        refrangibility, as for instance
to light passing through a combination of ruby and orange
                                                                         glass, we
should expect that there would be a gradual extinction of the effect
of the white light.     This is true in practice, though it rarely happens
that the after exposure to such radiation is sufficiently prolonged to be
hurtful. A case, however, might arise when a knowledge — or perhaps it

80                       Capt. Abney and Col. Festing.               [Jan. 15
should rather be said an appreciation — of this fact would be of practical
use.   In such a case the visible radiation coming through a combina
tion of cobalt and orange glass might be successfully employed.
   Curve IV is the absorption-spectrum thermogram of a green glass,
which obtains its colour from a combination of cupric oxide and
iron oxides.        An examination of the prismatic spectrum photo
graphed through such glass has led us to suspect that green glass is
transparent to certain rays of very low refrangibility.           The thermo
gram fully     confirms    this.  Some   four years ago one of us  proposed to
the Meteorological Committee of the Royal Society the use of green
glass for thermometer bulbs, in the belief that it totally absorbed the
infra-red rays. This is now found to be a mistake, and some other
colouring matter must be sought for for this purpose.
   Fig. II  illustrates some interesting facts in connexion with absorp
tion.   Curves     I  and VI, as already stated, are the thermograms of the
lamp   without      and    with an empty glass cell in front of the slit.
Curve VII is the absorption thermogram of benzene. As far as
Scale No. 6 there is no appreciable absorption, but from that point
there is a drop in the curve, which proves to be coincident with the
radical band of the group of benzene compounds, which we mapped
                              " Phil. Trans.,"           At a point between
photographically (see                           1882).
7 and 8 on the scale absorption again commences, and although of
some small extent, is appreciable as far as the end of the thermogram,
thermal action being traceable nearly down to Scale No. 20, or wave
length 27,000. This point we presume to consider of some importance,
for we have shown that there is reason to believe the existence of some
compound of the aromatic series between us and the sun, as the
radiant band is coincident with a very strong line in the solar spec
trum.    The solar spectrum as determined by the thermopile being
coterminous in this direction with that of the incandescence lamp, had
it been found that benzene cut off the lower part of the latter, our
belief as to the indications of benzene in the solar spectrum would
have been much shaken.
   Curve  VIII     is the thermogram of a deep-coloured solution of iodine
in alcohol.      This terminates near Scale No. 16. We found a slight
dip near Scale No. 6 ; this was too slight to be conveniently shown on
the diagram.         It is coincident in position with the alcohol radical
band.    The    thermogram of uncoloured alcohol is the same as that of
Curve VIII, with the exception that some further thermal action in
the visible part of the spectrum has to be registered.
   Curve IX is the thermogram of the absorption-spectrum of a satu
rated solution of common salt in water.          Rock salt, as is well known,
allows nearly     all  radiation to pass, and it seemed desirable to ascer
tain what effect        it would have in solution. The effect of the salt
appears   to   have     been a mitigation of the absorptive power of the

No. 10,  which is that due to i-inch of water, the absorption being equi
valent to what would have been produced by a diminished                   thickness
of water.    This is a fact of some importance theoretically, and has
been  confirmed by experiments with other solutions.
   Curve   XI is that due to the absorption of iodine               in an aqueous
solution of potassium iodide.        Compared with Curve X it shows that
the molecular structure of potassium iodide is such that it intensifies
the absorption due to water alone, no trace of the spectrum being
found beyond Scale No. 14.

tion of iodine in carbon disulphide.       It differs from the carve dne to
the empty cell only in the visible and shortest wave-length portion of
the invisible spectrum, as might be expected. We have also examined
plain   carbon disulphide and carbon tetrachloride, but have found
only small traces of absorption with these liquids.
   We have found that alum solution gives a curve which differs but
little from No. XI in the least refrangible part of the spectrum ; the
alum seems to     intensify the absorptive power of the water in which it
is dissolved.    It has been so often stated that an alum solution cuts
off all rays of low refrangibility (or as it is incorrectly and commonly
           '" heat rays
said, all                ") that we were not prepared for the compara
tively small effect that it produces.       It may be said that, roughly,
one thickness of a saturated solution of alum in water is equivalent to
a double thickness of water, and not more.           Judging by the thermo
grams, even this would be an exaggeration of the truth ; but the use
of glass in the cells, prisms, and lenses diminishes the effect as found
 when the total radiation is taken directly.
    We may add that dyes seem only to absorb in the visible spectrum,
and to have but little, if any, action in the invisible regions.
    The positions which we assign to the maxima of energy in the
different absorption spectra of glasses do not agree with those that
 have been published ; but as ours are the result, not of one set of
experiments, but, in some cases, of dozens, we feel fairly confident
 as to their correctness.
 IV. "Observations on the Upper Partial Tones of a Pianoforte
       String, struck at one-eighth of its Length." By Alfred
       James Hipkins (of John Broadwood and Sons, London).
       Communicated by Alexander             J. Ellis,   F.R.S.   Received
       January     7, 1885.
    This is a postscript to my paper on the harmonics of such a string,
 read   on the 20th of November,          1884.     According to Professor
 Helmholtz's theories, the tone of a struck string is compounded of a
 number    of simple partial tones, with the ratios of their frequencies  as
 1, 2, 3, 4, &c.    The harmonics are themselves also compound tones of
 which    the primes or lowest partials are the partials of the original
 tone.    These are produced on damping the other partials by touching
 them at a node        Now, in my former paper,        I showed that by so
 touching I could bring out twenty different harmonics of the string,
 and among these the 8th and 16th.        Young's law, however, makes an
 harmonic impossible to produce, if its node is the point struck. Hence
 the string being struck at one-eighth of its length, no 8th or 16th

 84        The Upper Partial Tones       of  a Pianoforte String.     [Jan. 15,
 harmonics      should   be audible,   simply because the 8th partial wonld
 thus   be damped.      But    as they were heard    in my experiments, it was
 objected that they were created by the system of stopping with a
  piece of felt at the exact node, which was the plan that I adopted.          I
 therefore endeavoured to find an independent mode of determining
  what partials were present without having recourse to " resonators,"
 against which others have raised similar objections, for if the 8th
 partial did not exist, there could be no 8th harmonic.
    No doubt existed respecting the presence of the first four partials,
 and the chief interest centred about those near to the 8th.                 On
 referring to the table in my last paper, it will be seen that, when the
 piano was tuned in the equal temperament, e", b"\>, e'" were sharper
 than the 5th, 7th, and 10th partials wonld be, and           f"  much flatter
 than    the   11th   partial, and  that g", c'", d'"  were very nearly of the
 same pitch as the fith, 8th, and 9th partials.        This led me to flatten or
 sharpen     the strings of those notes on the piano to a small extent,
 leaving the original note untouched, and taking care to damp the
 unison strings of all the notes with the tuner's " wedges," so that
 only one string of each note sounded. The following were the results
 of   sounding the original note simultaneously with the others in
succession : —
                    "
    The " beats of untouched e" with the bass c of 135-2 vibrations
were very rapid, but by flattening the e" slightly, the beats became
 slow and very distinct. This unmistakably proved the existence of a
 simple tone nearly of the pitch of this flattened e", in the compound
tone of c.       That is, the beats established the existence of the 5th
partial.
    Similarly, on very slightly flattening g", the beats were quite
distinct, hence the existence of the 6th partial was established.
    The i"b had to be rather more flattened, but then the beats came
out clearly, establishing the 7th partial.         And on producing the 7th
harmonic by touching the strings at a node, the beats were recognised
as precisely the same.
    The c" was flattened very slightly indeed, and while c was struck
loudly, this flattened c" was struck lightly.            The beats were much
fainter, but quite distinct and well heard by all present.          The result
was that the existence of the 8th partial on the c string, struck at
one-eighth of its length by a pianoforte hammer, was fully established.
The reason of its existence may be the elastic nature of the hammer,
which necessarily affected the string on each side of the node. But
the important point is that, although the c string, struck at one of
the nodes of the 8th partial, was untouched at any other of its nodes
(as it was touched in three of those nodes successively in the experi
ments of my last paper), the 8th partial clearly existed.            The beats
also came out with the 8th harmonic when produced.

1885.]           Observations on the Chromatology    of Actiniae.          85
    In   the same way, the 9th partial was proved       to exist, though the
beat was     still faint.    The beats for the 10th partial (flattening e'")
were better.
    On sharpening       f", the beats of the 11th partial were just sensible.
They     lasted   such  an extremely short time that they were recognised
with difficulty.         It therefore did not seem worth while to try
further.
    These     experiments conclusively proved the existence of the 5th,
6th, 7th,      8th, 9th, 10th, and 11th partials on a pianoforte string
struck      with a pianoforte hammer at one-eighth of its length, and
that the 7th        was   comparatively  powerful,  while  the 8th and    9th,
though faint, were distinct.         The node of the 7th was 0-8 inch from
the striking place, and that of the 9th was 0-6 inch, so that the 9th
was more affected than the 7th, but the 10th was            l'l inch from the
striking place, and hence probably was less affected            than  the 9th.
The curious point is that the 8th partial was most decidedly not
destroyed.
   These     experiments were all witnessed by Mr. A. J. Ellis, and one
of Messrs.      Broadwood's principal tuners, Mr. Pryer, who altered the
pitch    of the strings as required.

   In this paper       I  have given the results of an examination of the
following Actiniae,       mainly with regard to the spectroscopy of their
colouring matters,        viz., Actinia mesembryanthemum,     Bunodes crassi-
torn.it,   Bunodes     ballii, Sagartia bellis, Sagartia dianthus, Sagartia
parasitica, Sagartia viduata, Sagartia troglodytes, and Anthea cereus.

86             Observations on the Chromatology    of Actinia;.   [Jan. 22,
    The presence of a colouring matter in Actinia mesembryanthemum,
which can be changed into alkaline haematin, haemochromogen, and
acid and alkaline haematoporpbyrin is proved by appropriate tests,
hence this Actinia contains a pigment nearly related to haemoglobin.
The same colouring matter has been found in Bunodes crassicornis,
 Sagartia dianthus (in small amount), Sagartia viduata (traces), and a
closely connected pigment in Sagartia troglodytes, both in ectoderm
and endoderm.
    Another colouring matter is found which is special to this species
in Sagartia parasitica; it is capable of existing in the oxidised and
reduced state, and is found in the ectoderm, while in the interior of
the animal a pigment changeable into haemochromogen was detected ;
the spectroscopic characters of the former are described in detail.
    In the mesoderm and elsewhere in Actinia mesembryanthemum and
in Bunodes crassicornis, a green pigment occurs which is undistingnish-
able from biliverdin.       It gives the same play of colours (in solution)
with nitric acid, and the same changes of spectra which accompany
the colour changes with that reagent in the case of biliverdin from
the bile of vertebrates.      The presence of a chlorophyll-like spectrum
has been detected     in  the tentacles of Bunodes ballii and Sagartia bellis,
as well as in Anthea cereus (in which last it had been previously
detected by former observers), and this spectrum has been found to
belong to the
                   " yellow cells " which are found abundantly in the
tentacles and elsewhere in these species. The various solutions of
this colouring matter give the same spectra in all three. Professor
Lankester's and Mr. Sorby's statement that this spectrum is similar to
chlorofucin has been verified by a comparison with a solution of
chlorofucin from Fucus serratus.
    This colouring matter has been shown — contrary to the opinion
 expressed by Krukenberg — to be quite different from enterochlorophyll,
 also from plant chlorophyll, and other animal chlorophylls.
    In every case the " yellow cells " are proved to have a cellulose wall,
 and to contain starch.                               4
    There are various new facts ascertained which cannot be explained
 by means of a short abstract.
    The conclusions arrived at may in part be summed up as follows : —
    (1.) Actinia mesembryanthemum contains a colouring matter which
 can be changed into haemochromogen and haematoporphyrin, this is
  present in the other species mentioned above, and from its characters
 it is provisionally named Actiniohmmatin.
     (2.) It is not actiniochrome (a pigment found by Professor Moseley
 in the tentacles of Bunodes crassicornis), as its band occurs nearer the
 violet than that of actiniochrome.          Moreover, both actiniochrome
 and actiniohaematin can be extracted with glycerin, in which the latter
 is convertible into haemochromogen, but the former remains unchanged.

Actiniochrome is generally confined to the tentacles, and is not respi
ratory, actiniohaematin occurs in the ectoderm and endoderm, and is
respiratory.
    (3.) A special colouring matter is found in Sagartia parasitica,
different from either of the above, and this too exists in different
states of oxidation.       It is not apparently identical with that obtained
by   Heider from Cerianthus       membranaceus.
    (4.)  In the mesoderm and elsewhere in Actinia mesembryanthemum
and    other species, a green pigment occurs which alone and in solution
gives all the reactions of biliverdin.
    (5.) Anthea cereus, Bunodes baUii, and Sagartia hellis, yield to
solvents a colouring matter resembling              chlorofucin, and all the
colouring matter, which in them shows this spectrum, is derived from
the "yellow cells," which are abundantly present in their tentacles
and elsewhere.      It is not identical with any animal or plant chlorophyll,
as is proved by adding reagents to its alcoholic solution.
                   "                "
    (6.) When        yellow cells       are present, there appears to be a
suppression of those colouring matters which in other species are of
respiratory use.
    All readings are reduced to wave-lengths, and the spectra described
illustrated by means of sixty-five maps of spectra.               The "yellow
cells" are also drawn alone and stained with iodine in iodide of
potassium,    and with Schultze's      fluid.

        Transference of Food Materials from the Intestine into the
       Lacteals." By E. A. Schafer, F.R.S.                 From the Physio
       logical Laboratory, University College,           London.      Received
        January   12, 1885.
    In consequence of the discovery that in many of the lower Metazoa
the   ingestion of food particles is the result of an amoeboid activity of
individual cells of the organism, and that digestion and assimilation
may also     occur within the protoplasm of cells thus endowed with
amoeboid     activity, attention has of late been directed to the part
which such cells may play in promoting absorption                from the ali
mentary canal      of  Vertebrates.
    It is well known that lymph-cells occur in large numbers in the
 mucous membrane of the intestine, which is everywhere beset with
 them ; besides which they form the nodular masses of the solitary
 and agminated glands.         It is also known that they are found extend
 ing between the columnar epithelium-cells          which line the intestine,
  sometimes in considerable number.           Since this is the case, and since,

 88       Prof. E. A. Schafer.       The Proteids  of  the Chyle    [Jan. 22,
 moreover, they are amoeboid and capable of altering their shape and
 position, and of taking up particles with which they may come in
 contact,   I was long since led to infer that they might probably be
 regarded as active agents in effecting the transference of fat-particles
 from the columnar epithelium to the lacteals.           This inference was
 based   upon the following experiment, which        I  have often repeated.
 An animal is killed during digestion of food containing fat and whilst
 absorption is freely proceeding.      On examining the small intestine it
 is found that the columnar epithelium-cells, the lymph-cells of the
 mucous membrane, and the lacteal vessels, are all occupied by particles
 of fatty matter.      This fact can be readily substantiated by the mere
 examination of the fresh tissue, but it becomes strikingly manifest if
 a piece of the mucous membrane is placed in a 1 per cent. solution
 of osmic acid for a few hours, and after subsequently macerating in
 water for two or three days, is broken up with needles in a drop of
 glycerine.    The fat-particles being now stained black are very con
 spicuous,   and  it is easy to recognise their presence in the epithelium-
 cells, where they are often of considerable size, and in the lymph-cells,
 where they are generally small.
    Sections of the intestinal mucous membrane, and especially longi
 tudinal sections of the villi, also show the fat-particles in the epithe
lium-cells, in the lymph-cells, and in the lacteals, but none in any
other structures.      The inference seems, therefore, unavoidable that the
 amoeboid lymph-cells are the carriers of the fat-particles.
    Nor is this view in itself an improbable one or without analogy.
 For the intussusception of particles is one of the most characteristic
phenomena exhibited by amoeboid cells, which will carry such incepted
 matters along with them in their slow movements from place to place.
 When vermilion is injected into the blood-vessels, the particles of
pigment are taken in by the white corpuscles of the blood, and when
these emigrate from the vessels the particles are carried with them,
and may thus reach the radicles of the lymphatics. In the alveoli
of the lung and in the smaller bronchial tubes, amoeboid cells are
constantly to be found filled with inhaled carbon particles which they
have taken up from the mucus by which these particles have been
intercepted.     These cells are seemingly white corpuscles which have
emigrated from the blood-vessels, and they pass back again into the
lung-tissue between the epithelium-cells of the alveoli, carrying with
them the fine particles of carbon, and eventually also reach the
radicles of the lymphatics in which the carbon is deposited.          Never
theless, the view in question has not until lately met with any general
acceptance, probably partly owing to the fact that contrary statements
regarding the path of fat-absorption have been made by distinguished
authorities, partly because it seemed to be an isolated instance of the
participation of amoeboid cells in absorption.

1885.]            and   the Transference    of Food Materials.               80
    Bat this is no longer the case. In very numerous instances it has
now been      shown that amoeboid cells are actively concerned in the
transference and assimilation of nutriment.             Observations on this
point have chiefly been made upon animals low down in the scale of
organisation, but have not been confined to these. For it has been
demonstrated that a similar process occurs also in some fishes, whilst,
as regards      both normal and pathological tissue-absorption,         strong
evidence has been adduced in favour of the active agency of lymph-
or white blood-corpuscles in the production of these changes.
    The views of physiologists        upon the subject of absorption would
seem, in fact, to have taken a fresh direction, and the importance of
the part played in the process by amoeboid cells is coming to be very
generally recognised.         This being the case, I have been led again to
turn my attention to the question of intestinal absorption in Verte
brates, considering it with reference not only to the mode of passage
of fat into the lacteals, but also to the possibility of other alimentary
substances being conveyed in a similar manner.              With this object  I
have devoted a considerable amount of time at intervals during the
last two or three years to a renewed investigation of the subject,
with the assistance of a grant derived from the Government Grant
Fund. The principal results arrived at in this investigation         I propose
now briefly to lay before the Society.
    By far the most important of these results is the establishment of
the fact that during absorption of food from the intestine the lymph
corpuscles migrate in large numbers into the lacteals, and these for
the most part become disintegrated          and dissolved in the chyle.   This
 is the case not only after a meal containing fat, but also after feeding
 with substances devoid of that alimentary principle ; it is, therefore
a phenomenon      of general occurrence during absorption, and the carry
 ing of fatty particles into the lacteals after a meal containing fat by
 the immigrating leucocytes, must be regarded          as merely incidental to
a more    general function.
    The  number of leucocytes which thus pass from the tissue of a
 villus into its lacteal, is often so great that the blind end of the villus
 may be almost blocked by them.            Lower down, however, i.e., nearer
 the attachment     of the villus, there are only very few to be seen, and
 some of these are only the more persistent          nuclei of corpuscles, the
 protoplasm   of  which    is  already  dissolved.   Others  are seen swollen
 and partially   disintegrated, and, indeed, in preparations in which the
 cells have been fixed by the action of osmic acid, every stage of dis
 integration may be traced.
     This immigration and solution of numerous leucocytes in the con
 tents of  the lacteals must be the means of conveying a large amount
 of proteid material, derived from their dissolved protoplasm and nuclei,
  into the chyle.    And any other material which may be mechanically

90       Prof. E. A. Scliafer.     The Proteids  of the Chyle    [Jan. 22,
or otherwise incorporated with their protoplasm must also be set free.
In this way the fatty particles which they contain during absorption
of a meal containing fat become released and suspended in the chyle,
and it is probable that amyloid matters are also in part thus conveyed
to that fluid.
    The   cause  of the solution of the immigrated leucocytes in the chyle
of the commencing lacteals is not easily discovered, but it is not diffi
cult to imagine more than one way in which it might be brought
about. It is known that a solution of peptones when added to the
blood or lymph, produces disintegration and solution of many of the
white corpuscles.        And it is by no means unlikely that peptones
which have passed by diffusion into the lacteals may produce a
similar effect upon the immigrated amoeboid cells. Moreover, after
the blood is drawn many of the white corpuscles undergo solution in
the plasma in consequence of changes in its physical or chemical
condition which are inappreciable to the most delicate tests.       And an
increase of alkalinity in the blood which fails to produce any change
whatever in the easily influenced coloured corpuscles will speedily
 produce the disintegration of most of the colourless cells.
    As to the origin of these immigrant cells, it may be regarded as
 certain that they have passed inwards from the epithelium. Leu
 cocytes are constantly seen, often in considerable number, between
 the epithelium-cells of the villi (where they may even lie close to the
 free surface), and also between the fixed ends of the epithelium-cells
 and the basement membrane, as well as in the tissue of the mucous
 membrane itself.       In fat-absorption all these leucocytes, as well as
 those which have passed into the lacteals, contain fatty particles, and
 these particles are not found elsewhere in the tissue of the mucous
 membrane.       Since there is no continuity of the protoplasm of the
 lymph-cells one with another, the fat-particles in those which are
 more deeply seated must have been carried along by the amoeboid
 movements of the cells which contain the fat.        In this case, then, it
 seems scarcely possible to come to any other conclusion than that the
 fatty particles are taken up by the leucocytes from the epithelium-
 cells, and perhaps in part directly from the intestinal cavity, are
 conveyed to the lacteal, and there become set free by the breaking
 down of the carrying cell.
     The presence of the fat thus serves to trace the course of the
 leucocytes in the villi.     But there is no reason to believe that their
 course is at all different even in the absence of fat, for they are still
  seen between the epithelium-cells, and they still pass into the lacteals.
  It is fair, therefore, to assume that they play precisely the same part
  whatever the nature of the aliment.
     A further question as to the origin of the leucocytes involves the
  explanation of the production of a constant succession to take the

 1885.]            and  the Transference of Food Materials.               5)1
place of those which have passed into the lacteal.          With regard to
 this, it may safely be affirmed that they are continually undergoing
                                                          I
multiplication by division. No one has, so far as am aware, ever
doubted that the lymph-corpuscles           are thus capable of renewal,
although it has been generally believed that their mode of division is
direct, i.e., unaccompanied      by those peculiar changes in the nucleus
which have been termed karyokinetic or karyomitoic. This has,
however, been settled by Fleming, who has shown that the cells of
lymphoid tissue multiply abundantly by karyomitosis.         This multipli
cation by division will apply to the leucocytes which lie between
the    epithelium-cells as well as to those in the mucous membrane
proper.      It is doubtful whether there is any addition caused by
emigration of white corpuscles from the blood-vessels ; certainly it
is not by any means considerable.
     It is a most important question whether any amoeboid cells are
 produced by division of the columnar epithelium-cells.          That these
 cells do divide is certain ; in confirmation    of other observers I have
 seen abundant evidence of the occurence of karyomitoic figures in
 them ; but    I am not yet able to say what is the result of such division,
 although    I am  strongly disposed to think that they may give origin to
 amoeboid cells.     Several instances can be cited of the origin of meso-
 blastic amoeboid cells from hypoblastic epithelial cells in the embryo,
 which seem to favour this view.
     Taking for granted that the leucocytes multiply by division, the
 newly produced daughter cells will naturally be relatively small with
 scanty protoplasm.         Being freely supplied with nutrient material
 during    the  absorption of aliment, either directly from the intestine
 or indirectly from the columnar epithelium-cells      (which are probably
  the primary agents in effecting absorption from the intestinal cavity),
 their protoplasm probably in part assimilates, and in part stores up
 this material and rapidly grows.       Wandering now towards the centre
  of the villus (urged it may be by the stream of fluid which is passing
  at this time in that direction) the cells enter the lacteal, and there
  become dissolved,     and again set free not only the proteid matters
  which they have assimilated and converted into protoplasm, but also
  all other material, whether in the form of definite particles or not,
  which may have been taken up in addition and carried by them into
  the lymphatic vessel.
      The preparations upon which the observations and inferences which
  are here briefly recorded      are based have been made chiefly from
  mammals, especially from the rat, in which the shape of the villi and
  the size of their lacteals render it relatively easy to obtain successful
   sections.   Many, however, are from the frog, in which the facts can
   be very clearly made out on account of the size of the elements, and
   in which also the comparative slowness of the process of absorption

92           Rev. C. Trotter.       Physical Properties of Ice    [Jan. 29,
enables one more readily to study it in its different stages ; although,
on the other hand, the number of leucocytes which are passing into
the lacteals and there undergoing disintegration is much less at any
one period than in the mammal.

   It will   be remembered       that   in  a  paper
                                                     " On the   Descent of
Glaciers," read to the Royal Society           on the 19th of  April, 1855
                                                     " Phil. Mag.," vol. x,
(" Proc. Roy. Soc.," vol. 7, pp. 333—342 ;
pp. 60 — 67), Canon Moseley proposed a new theory to account for the
phenomena of glacier motion.          The theory was suggested, as is well
known, by the observation of the gradual descent of a sheet of lead
resting on a roof of moderate slope, and exposed to considerable
diurnal variations of temperature.         According to it the descent of a
glacier  is due to the alternate expansion and contraction of the ice in
the direction of the length of the glacier under the influence of vary
ing temperature ; gravity assisting the downward and opposing the
upward movement of the mass.
   This paper was effectively answered by Forbes (" Proc. Roy. Soc.,"
vol. 7, p. 412), and the theory has never been accepted by persons

1885.]                    and on  the  Motion   of Glaciers.                   <>3
conversant with glaciers.           The fatal objection taken by Forbes was
that in a glacier, considered as a whole, there is no such variation of
temperature, and consequently no such alternate expansion and con
traction of the ice as Moseley's theory presupposes.             The question of
the temperature        of the interior of a glacier will be considered further
on.       It will   be sufficient to state here that theory and experiment
lead alike to the conclusion that the variations of temperature due to
the alternations       of day and night, and even of summer and winter,
are     local and superficial only, the great working mass of the glacier,
as    it may be termed, being at a sensibly constant temperature.            This
fact had been brought out in the controversy                 which arose out of
                     " dilatation "
 Charpentier's                      theory of glacier motion.
      The late Mr. W. R. Browne, who recently came forward as a
 defender of Moseley's hypothesis (" Proc. Roy. Soc.," vol. 34, pp. 208
— 217), appeared to admit this fact, but argued that the upper layers
 of ice in expanding and contracting may drag with them the lower
 layers, or at least cause the upper layers to shear over the lower ones.
 Without discussing the possibility of such action in the general case,
 it may be sufficient to make two remarks.
      (1.) As the motion of a glacier is continuous during the year, it
 must on Canon Moseley's hypothesis be caused by the diurnal as dis
 tinguished from the annual variations of temperature.              Mr. Browne
                                     "
 quotes Dr. Rae as saying,             We know that ice 2 or 3 feet or more
 thick contracts very considerably in a few hours by a sudden fall of
  15 or 20 degrees of temperature."         Now the cold of a summer's night
  in the Alps is far less intense than that of a " cold suap
                                                                        "
                                                                           in the
  American north-west, while it is very difficult to believe that even a
  very considerable expansion or contraction of the upper 2 or 3 feet
  of a glacier can affect the motion of a mass several hundred feet
  thick.
•
      (2.)  In many of the glaciers which move most rapidly the upper
  layers of     ice are intersected by a system of transverse crevasses at
  short    intervals. These extend so far as effectually to prevent any
  interaction between portions of the surface layer at any considerable
  distance from one another.
      Moseley     did not make any satisfactory       answer to the objections
  brought against his theory, but in 1869 and the following years he
  put forward a somewhat formidable            objection to the current gravi
  tation     theories  of glacier motion.        His   paper  was read    to  tho
   Royal     Society on January 7, 1869 ("Proc. Roy. Soc.," vol. 17,
              " Phil. Mag.," vol. xxxvii,
   p.  202;                                 p. 229), and was followed up by a
   series of communications to the
                                         " Philosophical Magazine," of which
   the most important are to be found in vols, xxxvii, pp. 363 — 370,
   and xxxix, pp. 1 — 8.        The gist of the objection is that the resist
   ance of ice to shearing is many times greater than the shearing force

  94            Rev. 0. Trotter.       Physical Properties of Ice         [Jan.   29,
  which can     be produced in a descending glacier by gravity; and that
 therefore    the   shearing which the measurements of Forbes aud others
 have shown to be an essential part of the motion of a glacier cannot
 be produced by gravity alone.
    Mr. W. Mathews (" Alpine Journal," vol. iv, pp. 411 — 427), Mr. J.
 Ball (" Phil. Mag.," vol. xl, pp. 1 — 10), and others replied to Canon
 Moseley, but none of the answers were altogether complete, though
 both the above-mentioned authors clearly pointed out the weak point
 in Moseley's argument.
    Moseley's objection is no doubt decisive if the shearing strength of
 ice as deduced from his experiments represents even approximately
 the resistance to shearing under the actual circumstances of glacier
 motion.       But, as Mr. Mathews pointed out (loc. ext., p. 426), the
 time during which the shearing force acted is an important element
 in the experiments.         Moseley found (" Phil. Mag.," vol. xxxix, p. 8)
 that  when     the   shearing took place in three minutes the shearing
 strength was about 118 lbs. per square inch, while when the operation
 lasted thirty minutes the result was about 112 lbs. per square inch.
 In one experiment the ice sheared in thirty-six minutes under a force of
 about 98 lbs. per square inch.           Mr. Mathews pertinently remarks,
   I
 " am curious to know what weight would have sheared the ice if a
 day had been allowed for its operation."           I have attempted to answer
 a question of      this kind  in  the  experiments recorded in the present
 paper.
    In  the section of the paper which immediately follows                  I   have
 given a short notice of the most important recent experiments upon a
 small scale which bear upon the question of the viscosity of ice.                In
 Section    III I   have  described  my  own  experiments    on  the subject.      In
 Section IV      I   have dealt with the objection to the viscosity of ice
 drawn from        its supposed inextensibility. In V I have discussed a
 novel argument of Mr. Browne's in support of a high value of the
 shearing strength of ice.          In VI I have discussed the question of
 the probable temperature of different parts of the glacier, and of

        II.  Previous Experiments bearing upon the Viscosity of         Ice*
    Since the date of Canon Moseley's papers a good many experiments
have been published which tend to show that ice will change its form
   * By viscosity, I understand the property in virtue of which bodies change their
form under the continued influence of forces which would be insufficient to cause an
immediate change of form of similar amount. Probably nearly all, if not all, sub
stances have more or less viscosity; but by a viscous solid maybe understood a
substance in which a large change of form is produced by adequate forces in a time
which is neither exceedingly small nor enormously great.

under the influence     of moderate forces applied continuously for a con
siderable time.      In some of these, small bodies, mostly metallic, were
forced into or through masses of ice. These experiments may be set
aside as irrelevant.      They were, or may have been, simply instances
of the melting of ice through the lowering of the freezing point
by pressure, and of subsequent freezing where the pressure is less.
In fact some of the most striking results have been very properly
published as examples of this action (cf. "Nature," vol. v, p. 185;
vi, 396).     The remaining experiments are for the most part experi
ments on the bending or twisting of masses           of ice either under the
influence of their own weight only or by means of superimposed
weights of moderate size.        Bianconi seems to have made some experi
ments   of  this kind as early as December, 1866, but he did not publish
his results until 1871, when his early experiments, as well as others
 made in January and February of that year, were published in the
 "Memorie della Accademia di Bologna," Serie 3a, vol.         i,   pp. 155 —
 166.   In the meantime Mr. W. Mathews had made and published
 some interesting experiments         in the winter of 1869-70     (" Alpine
Journal," vol. iv, p. 426 " Nature," vol.
                            ;                   p. 534). In these the influ
                                                    i,
 ence of temperature was very marked.         The middle point of a plank
of  ice   6feet long and 2f inches thick, the ends of which were sup
 ported, sank  7   inches in about as many hours during a thaw. A some
 what thinner plank of the same length sank only about 3£ inches in
 nearly three days of frosty weather.        Results similar in kind were
 obtained by Tyndall (with glacier ice) ("Nature," vol. iv, p. 447),
 Pfaff     Phil. Mag.," vol.
          ("                    1,p. 335), and others.    Pfaff quotes Kane
 as having been       the first to make such observations, but gives no
reference.
     These experiments show conclusively that the continuous action
for   a considerable time of comparatively        small forces will produce
effects upon ice which the same forces are quite incapable of pro
ducing in a short time, but they do not necessarily throw much light
upon the actual processes which take place in a glacier.
   When a glacier     is descending in the usual river-like manner in     a
straight and uniform bed and down           uniform slope, the central part

take place by the ice shearing along cylindrical surfaces whose gener
ating lines are parallel to the direction       of flow of the glacier.   In
Canon Moseley's experiments, and in those of my own which are re
 corded below, the motion        essentially the same, the shearing taking
                                 is
 place, approximately    at all events, uniformly in one plane.       On the
 other hand, when a beam of ice sags under the influence of its own
 weight the motion     is  much more complicated.       Assuming that there
 is nowhere any change of density, but that the transformation takes

 place exclusively by shearing, the direction as well as the extent of
the shear will vary from point to point, and a simple observation of
the flexure of the beam will not give a direct measure of the shearing
strength of ice at any point. Moreover, the experiments were all
made either during frosty weather, when the temperature of the ice
 experimented     upon was variable, and the conditions therefore very
 different from those which obtain in the interior of a glacier, or else
 in a warm atmosphere while the ice was thawing rapidly, and the
experiments could not be carried on for any considerable         time under
unchanged conditions.
                            III. New Experiments.
    Under these circumstances        it seemed desirable that fresh direct
 experiments on the shearing strength of ice should be made under
 conditions differing as little as might be from those under which ice
actually shears in the interior of a glacier, and it occurred to me that
such experiments might be advantageously made in one of the arti
ficial grottoes which are now excavated year after year for the benefit
of tourists in several of the more accessible Swiss glaciers. It seemed
that it would be possible in this way to carry out experiments upon
 glacier ice at a nearly uniform temperature of about 0° C., and under
conditions as nearly resembling the interior of a glacier as we can
hope to attain to in experiments on hand specimens of ice.
    I accordingly spent part of the long vacation of 1883 at Grindel-
wald, and made a series of experiments in the grotto on the right
bank of the lower glacier, in order to see whether            I could obtain
direct  evidence   of  shearing  under   the influence of forces comparable
with those which Canon Moseley admits to be capable of being pro
duced by the action of gravity in a moving glacier.
                    Situation of  the  Experimental Grotto.
   The entrance to this year's grotto was at the base of a cliff of ice
which I estimated at about 25 metres high. It was, by a rough
barometrical comparison with Grindelwald, about 1275 metres above
the sea-level, and about 75 metres above and perhaps 300 metres
distant from the place where the glacier, now reduced at this point to
a comparatively narrow tongue of ice, plunges into a deep and narrow
gorge.
   At the time of my arrival in Grindelwald (June 27) the grotto, the
floor of which sloped slightly upwards, penetrated for about 18 metres
nearly in a straight line, making an angle of about 55° with the face
of the ice cliff, and then for about 8'5 metres further in a direction
making an angle of about 3° only with the face of the cliff. It was a
gallery nearly 2 metres high, and rather more than a metre wide.

1885.]                   and on  the Motion  of Glaciers.                     97
I    had a lateral     gallery excavated to contain my apparatus at the
extremity       of the  main gallery, and on the side opposite to the edge
of the glacier.         This was of the same height as the main gallery,
and about 3 metres long.           The entrance was of the same width as
the main gallery, but the end was somewhat wider, perhaps 1'7 metre.
This lateral gallery was shut off by a rough door of planks from the
main gallery, which was afterwards extended for a few metres beyond
the entrance to the side gallery.        The place in which my experiments
were conducted was therefore some 18 metres from the edge of the
 glacier, 25 or 30 metres below its upper surface, and probably at
least an     equal distance above its bed.
     There were some       longitudinal crevasses of considerable size on the
lower    part of the glacier, and it is probable that one of these was not
very    far from the experimental gallery.          I infer this from the fact
 that there     was perceptibly more light in the side gallery than in the
 main   gallery at the point where the side gallery branched off from it,
 and the      light increased sensibly during the time (rather more than
 five  weeks) that my experiments lasted.           I attribute this increase of
 light to     the melting of the side of a crevasse, and am disposed to
estimate the distance from the end of the experimental gallery to the
 nearest crevasse at from 5 to 10 metres.         After the first few days      I
 kept   maximum        and minimum thermometers          on the wooden     frame
 which     supported my apparatus.        The extreme readings were 0° C.
 and 2°     C. The temperature of the air and the gallery must have
 been raised from time to time by the presence of myself and others,
 particularly      when a light was used, but for the greater part of the
  time the temperature        of the air can scarcely have differed sensibly
  from 0°   C.
     The pieces     of ice used in my first experiments were part of the
  material excavated from the side gallery.             In the last   I   used a
  block hewn out expressly from the interior of the glacier.            I always
  chose the most solid and transparent,        and therefore presumably the
  hardest and strongest, pieces       I could find.    The blocks hewn by the
  pick were cut roughly to the required size and shape with a coarse-
  toothed saw ; they were finished with a carpenter's plane set so as to
  cut a  rather coarse shaving.
      The apparatus      used was in principle the same as Canon Moseley's.
  My   apparatus was, however, disposed symmetrically so as to produce
  a shear in two parallel planes simultaneously.          I was thus enabled to
  simplify the arrangements for fixing the apparatus, and to make my
  measurements       more easily and accurately.      Each of three pieces of
  board, AB (fig. 1), had a square notch cut in one side, so that when
  the short bar, CD, was fixed in its place by two screws, the whole
   formed a    block with a square hole in its centre.     A  hook by which the

 at right angles to that of the board (see fig. 2).
    Two of these blocks were suspended from a cross-piece     (see fig. 2).
                                  Fie. 2.
The distance of the hooks on the cross-piece was so adjusted that
there was just room between the two hanging-blocks         for the third
block to move freely up and down.      A square bar of ice, ab, was then

                             and the Motion  of Glaciers.                     99
passed    through the three square holes, a weight was hung on to the
middle block,      and the whole left hanging up in the grotto^ Thin
plates   of cork were interposed between the ice and the wood where
the pressure     was greatest.     At the close of the experiment the weight
was    removed,   and   the  wooden blocks with the bar of ice removed to
the edge     of the glacier for examination.           The weights used were
stones   taken from the moraine, the weight being ascertained in each
case   by a Salter's spring balance.
   As the shear      to be observed would probably be small, and some
melting,     at least of the surfaces exposed to pressure, was to be
expected,    it was necessary to fix fiducial marks in the substance of
the ice.    Several forms of wooden and metal plugs and pins were tried,
but   did not remain sufficiently firmly fixed to make accurate measure
ments     possible.    I  ultimately obtained satisfactory results by boring
three   small cylindrical holes in a horizontal plane at about the points
marked c, d, e    in fig.  2
   A small     American twist drill about 2 mm. diameter, fitted to a
carpenter's brace, made very uniform holes with sharp edges which,
under favourable        conditions, were very permanent and admitted of
accurate measurements being made.            Before boring the holes I applied
the edge of a steel straight-edge         to the ice. This melted a narrow
straight groove in the line a, b, and by taking care to keep this line
in the median plane of the body while boring, it was not difficult to
secure that the axes of the holes should be very approximately            in one
plane, so that no appreciable error would be caused if the surface of
the bar melted or had to be reworked           before the straight-edge was
reapplied at the close of the experiment, and the displacement of the
 middle hole noted.        My working place on the moraine was not very
 convenient,    and it was not quite so easy as it looked to apply a
 straight-edge    accurately to the edge of the holes on the slippery
 surface  of the melting block of ice, but a little experience taught me
 the  necessary precautions, and in my later experiments the measure
 ments   agreed very well together and appeared to be quite satisfactory.
    In my first experiments the middle block was rather more than
5 cm.   thick, the outer blocks about 2-5 cm. The apertures were rather
more    than 5 cm. square.       As it was not necessary to drive home the
screws    which attached block CD to         AB    (fig. 1),  it was possible to
take   in a bar 5 cm. deep as well as the     cork plates.

appeared a good deal crushed, and the holes were not recognisable

about 0-5 cm. The middle hole d was uninjured, the shearing sur

    I  believe that the shear in (2) was rightly measured, but that it
had taken place chiefly after the bar had been considerably reduced
by melting, and the shearing force per sq. cm. considerably increased.
    In  the course of the above preliminary experiments               I came to the
conclusion that it was desirable to make use               of  a larger bar, and to
carry on the experiment for a longer time.             I  accordingly had a fresh
set   of blocks   made   with   holes  11   cm.  square.    The middle block was
10 cm. thick, the side ones 5|.
    A bar of ice was cut from a freshly excavated block and carefully
prepared.       Two rows of three holes were bored in it, and the position
of the centre hole of each row carefully verified.                 Cork plates were
introduced between       the  ice and   the   wood  on all  sides.   The apparatus
was hung up on July 18, and left undisturbed till August 4.
    Bar 11-5 x 10 5' cm., weight 48 kilos.
    On examining the bar on August 4 the holes were found in perfect
condition, the melting had been slight and regular.                The thickness of
the bar      had  been   reduced    from    10'5  to  10   cm.     There  had been
rather more melting where the pressure was applied, so that the
ultimate depth along the planes of shearing was ] 0'5 cm., so that the
 final shearing surface was 2 x 10 x 10'5=210 sq. cm. The measure
 ments of the two rows of holes agreed well, and gave a shear of
 -075 cm.

 varied    the                                I
               experiments further ; but can feel no doubt that in the last
 experiment a distinct shear of an amount not very different from
 that which     I have  given, had taken place.          The measurements        were

carefully made, and were perfectly concordant, and experience had
shown me the precautions necessary to obtain an accurate result.
  The shearing force employed was, indeed, rather more than double
that which,    according to Canon Moseley's calculations, is exerted by
gravity  in  the  Mer de Glace, near the Tacul ("Phil. Mag.," xxxvii,
p. 369); but it is about one twenty-fifth of his smallest value of the
shearing strength of ice, and the amount of shear is larger than is
implied in any of the ordinary cases of glacier motion.
   I may mention that in spite of the low temperature of the grotto
the exposed ends of the bar were rendered partially opaque by a
number of fine cracks, showing a tendency in the ice to break up into
angular fragments such as may be observed in the partially disinte
grated ice on the surface of a glacier (the Gletscherkorner of Heim
and others) ; the parts, however,      which were inclosed within the
wooden blocks and had been effectually protected from radiation,
had preserved their transparency quite unimpaired.
   I think then that there is little doubt that under conditions closely
resembling those of the interior of a glacier, and under the influence
of forces comparable with those which gravity is capable of exerting
in a glacier, hand specimens of ice shear in the same manner as a truly
viscous solid would do.

the changes of form of ice under the influence of moderate forces are
avowedly very slow.         The formation of crevasses shows that they are
too slow to allow the glacier to take its new shape in all cases without

metre for every 60 metres of vertical thickness of the glacier.               And
it is much the same with the system of diagonal crevasses due to
differential motion.        It  is true that the daily linear extension required
to prevent fracture is in such cases usually very small, but a small
extension of an inelastic mass like that of a glacier would seem to
 require molecular displacements which are much more complicated
than those involved in a slight yielding of an elastic solid.                If no
yielding were possible, systems of diagonal crevasses would be as
universal as differential motion.          What is really proved by the often
quoted observation of Tyndall ("Glaciers of the Alps," i860, pp. 317
— 18), as to the extreme narrowness of crevasses when they are first
formed, is that ice is not capable of any appreciable elastic extension
before it gives way.          Such want of elasticity is often very charac
 teristic of  viscous   as  distinguished from strictly solid bodies.
   I believe, therefore, that the weight of evidence tends to show that
ice at or about 0° C., is just as truly viscous as pitch or sealing-wax
at temperatures at which they are brittle but yet capable of yielding
to the continuous application of a very moderate force. The viscosity
of ice, however, probably diminishes very rapidly with the tempera
ture.     M. Person (" Comptes Rendus," xxx, pp. 526 — 528), quoted
by   Forbes,    infers from experiments on the latent heat of fusion of
ice that ice begins to soften at about —2° C.             Ice just before it melts
appears    to  be  quite   soft.    When   during  the   preparation of the bars
for the experiments described in this paper, I had occasion to inter
rupt for a few minutes my work in the comparatively warm atmo
sphere of the moraine, I was repeatedly struck by the difference
between the sensation caused by the first one or two cuts with the
plane, and that experienced after half a millimetre or so of the
melting surface had been removed. Many persons must have noticed
the way in which a piece of ordinary clear ice which has been
wrapped in a coarse linen cloth on a summer's day adheres to the
cloth, and has the marks of the threads impressed upon it. It may
be said that this is an instance of the lowering of the melting point
by pressure and subsequent freezing ; but when it is considered that
the phenomenon may be observed when 1 lb. per square inch is a
liberal estimate of the pressure exerted, so that the lowering of the
freezing point would be about '0005° C., and the melting of 1 mgrm.
of ice would produce sufficient absorption of heat to cool down about
320,000 mgrm. of ice to the new melting point, it seems more natural
to suppose that the ice just before it melts passes into a soft some
what sticky condition like that of sealing-wax at about 100° C. It is
scarcely surprising that this condition is not more often obvious, as it
is difficult to touch the melting ice with anything which will not
convey to     it heat enough      to produce complete liquefaction.

    The supposition that, while ice at 0° C. is sensibly viscous, the vis
cosity diminishes rapidly with the temperature, is in complete
accordance with the facts of the changes which take place in a
glacier during the winter.            The terminal melting ceases, but the
advance of the end of the glacier into the valley is very slow, and
possibly ceases altogether in the depth of winter.               Higher up the
forward movement of the surface continues, though at a slower rate
than in summer, and though the glacier does not lengthen much in
winter, it thickens considerably, and the surface rises, often through
many feet, so as to make up         (in a glacier which is neither increasing
nor diminishing) for the enormous surface waste of the summer.
This is exactly what we should expect if the great working mass of
the glacier retained the same mobility in winter as in summer, while
the surface layers and the extremity had their resistance to change of
form very greatly increased.           The whole movement of a glacier in
winter is closely parallel to that of a lava stream when it is beginning
to cool, when the outer crust and the terminal portion have become
solidified    while the great mass remains semifluid         ; the   stream con
tinues to advance,       but only slowly, while the lower portions        increase
in   thickness like those of a glacier in winter.
                   V. Mr. Browne's Argument from Ice Cliffs.
    Mr. Browne in the paper which has been above referred to (" Proc.
 Boy. Soc," vol. 34, p. 210) brings forward an additional argument
 in favour     of a large shearing strength of ice.          He calculates the
 shearing strength necessary in order that a            vertical ice cliff of a
certain height may be able to stand, and finds about 30 lbs. per square
 inch to be    the minimum strength consistent with the existence of ice
 cliffs 300 feet high.      The argument would be perfectly sound if for
              we read " stand permanently," but as it is put it is liable to
 "
    stand
           "
 the same objections as Canon           Moseley's direct experiments upon
 shearing.
     Crevasses    300 feet deep are said to exist, but an individual crevasse
 is by no means a long-lived structure.           When the bed of a glacier
  widens suddenly below a projecting vertical face of rock, we some
 times   find a  cliff bounding the glacier for    some  little distance below
 the   projection.    It  never, however, extends very far, and when the
  glacier-bed widens gradually the ice spreads out so as to fill the wider
  bed without any cliff being formed at all.
     The spreading      out of a glacier like the Rhone Glacier where it
  emerges from a gorge on to a comparatively           open space, which Mr.
  Browne strangely enough quotes (loc. cit., p. 215) as favourable to
  Canon    Moseley's view, is in itself a convincing proof that ice at 0° C.
  will not stand permanently         in a vertical cliff of any considerable
  height;   it gives way gradually, but still it gives way.

                                                          " Bergschrund."
     Throughout this discussion it has heen assumed that the tempera
ture of the great mass of a glacier does not differ much from 0° C.
It seems desirable to examine the reasons for this assumption, to
consider whether it is liable to any important exceptions, and if so to
deduce their consequences.        I do not know that there is in what
follows much that is substantially novel, or that is seriously contro
verted, but it may be worth while to formulate in a systematic shape
what has hitherto been contained in a number of isolated remarks or
suggestions scattered through glacier literature.
     It is obvious that no part of a glacier can be at a higher tempera
ture than 0° C., for the simple reason that ice or snow cannot exist
at a higher temperature.
     The suow which is the ultimate source of the glacier ice falls at
temperatures which may vary from 0° C. downwards.            Snow weather
is, however, not usually very cold weather, and it is probable that
falls of suow at a very low temperature are exceptional.
     The surface of a glacier may sometimes become very cold by
radiation, but ice is a very bad conductor of heat, and dry suow is still
worse.      There is no reason to suppose that the cold of a summer
night can penetrate many inches into the glacier, and it is improbable
that the cold of winter can be felt at more than a few feet below the
 surface, since the whole glacier is in winter covered with suow.         On
the other hand, on a warm summer day a very large amount of heat
 is absorbed in the upper layers of a glacier, and is carried into the
 lower layers by the water which sinks into the mass.        It is clear that
 so long as water at 0° C. sinks through suow or neve at 0° C., it will
 descend unchanged, neither giving up nor receiving heat.            When it
 meets with snow or neve at a lower temperature, it will be partially
 frozen, and its latent heat of freezing will warm the suow or neve up
  to 0° C.    Forbes found (" Eleventh Letter on Glaciers," Edinburgh,
  "New Philosophical Journal," October, 1846, reprinted in "Occa
  sional Papers," pp. 169, 170) that the mean daily waste of the
  surface of the Mer de Glace opposite the Montanvert during hot
  weather in July and August, 1846, was 3-62 inches per day, while
  higher up between 1' Angle and Trelaporte it was 2-73 inches. Now as
  the latent heat of fusion of ice is about 80 calories, and the specific
  heat of ice about '5, the heat required to melt a cubic inch of ice
   would raise about 160 cubic inches through 1° C. No doubt in the
  upper regions of neve the heat absorbed is a good deal less ; the air
   is colder, and a smaller proportion of the solar radiation enters, and
  is absorbed by, the glacier.     On the other hand, in these regions the
  whole    of the water produced by melting must sink into the glacier,

 1885.]                   and the Motion   of Glaciers.                   105
and its latent heat    of fusion must be used in warming the glacier so
long as any stratum is below 0° C.
     The amount of heat which reaches the glacier from the interior of
the earth is no doubt insignificant in amount when compared with
that which reaches the upper surface of the glacier, but it is important
as necessarily warming and eventually melting the lowest stratum of
the glacier.     Forbes (" Travels in the Alps," 1843, p. 364) quotes an
estimate of M. Elie de Beaumont, according             to which the annual
 flow is sufficient to melt about 6£         mm.   of   ice. This would be
sufficient to raise about 1-040 metres of ice 1° C.          Considering that
the winter's cold cannot possibly penetrate to the bed of the glacier,
this is quite sufficient to ensure that the lowest stratum shall be at
the temperature      of about 0° C.      I cannot lay my hand upon any
more recent estimates of the flow of central heat from the earth, but
I believe that M. de Beaumont's would be regarded as correct at
 least so far as the order of magnitude is concerned.
     We may say then with confidence that the ice which rests directly
upon the bed of the glacier is at the temperature of fusion correspond
ing to the pressure at the spot, i.e., usually very slightly below 0° C.
 Neglecting these small variations, and leaving out of consideration
for the present the extreme upper portion of the glacier, we may say
 that the surface of contact of a glacier and its bed is part of an
 isothermal surface of 0° C.       The upper surface of the glacier during
 a summer's day, when melting is everywhere          going on, must also be
 an isothermal surface of 0° C.        At night this upper isothermal will
 descend a few inches into the ice, and in winter perhaps a few feet.
 The portions above this upper isothermal          will be at temperatures
 below 0° C.     Disregarding   as  before the small  differences of melting
 point due to pressure, there can be little doubt that throughout the
  lower part of the glacier the whole space between these isothermal
  surfaces will be filled with ice at 0° C.    In the upper portions of the
  neve it is possible that there may be one or more regions in which the
  temperature is below 0° C.      These will be bounded by isothermals of
  0° C, which in summer will necessarily be closed surfaces, except pos
  sibly at the extreme upper end of the glacier ; in winter they may
  be in some places continuous with the cold region above the main
   upper isothermal of 0° C.
     We may now consider the state of things near the extreme upper
  limit of the glacier.
     In a large number of instances the neve basin which forms the
  upper reservoir of the glacier is bounded by a steep and comparatively
   narrow rocky ridge, against the lower part of which a relatively
   shallow mass of neve or snow rests at a high angle; the other side of
   the ridge is very frequently the boundary of another glacier.          The
   mean temperature of the air at such elevations is low, and though the

 106        Rev. C. Trotter.     Physical Properties of Ice      [Jan. 29,
rocks  will in  some  places and at some times receive and absorb a
large amount of solar radiation, they will also radiate freely into space.
 The amount of central heat flowing into such a wedge of rock through
its comparatively narrow base cannot be large, and there can be little
doubt that the mean temperature of the upper portions of such a
ridge will  be below 0° C.    It seems   clear that in such a case the iso
thermal surface of 0° C. which follows the common surface of the
glacier and its bed, must somewhere leave the surface of the rock and
strike across the ridge, so as to be continuous with the isothermal
surface at the lower surface of the glacier on the opposite side.        In
such a case the most probable point for the isothermal to leave the
surface of the rock will be about the place where the ridge begins to
rise steeply.   The winter isothermal of 0° C. within the rock      will be
below, but probably not far distant from the summer one.
   Now in such a typical system of glaciers as I have been describing
there is almost invariably a deep chasm in the neve at about the
point at which I have supposed the isothermal to leave the surface
of the rock. This chasm, which penetrates obliquely into the neve,
and is often nearly continuous for long distances, is familiar in Alpine
literature as the " Bergschrund."

   In the annexed diagram, A is the rock of supposed mean tempera
ture greater than 0° C. ; B the rock of supposed mean temperature less
than 0° C. ; C the neve; D the "Bergschrund."            The dotted lines
give the trace upon the plane of the paper of the supposed winter and
summer isothermals of 0° C.
   I am not aware that any observations of the motion of the extreme
upper portions of a glacier have been made, but I do not think that
any one who is familiar with glacier scenery will have much doubt
                         " marks the limit
that the " Bergschrund                       between the moving and the

fixed parts     of the glacier.     It appears that the snow or neve above
      "                " does not move downwards as a
the     Bergschrund                                           glacier, but that
the snow which falls upon it slides down from time to time in ava
lanches over the surface, usually choking up the
                                                           " Bergschrund " in
the spring.      On the other hand, everything below the " Bergschrund "
moves forward, slowly indeed but still moves forward, with the glacier.
There is, however, no marked difference, at any rate in the'conditions
of the surface layers, between the snow or ndve above and below the
"
    Bergschrund," so that it seems at first sight paradoxical that the
neve on the steep slope should remain at rest while that on the less
steep slope below is in motion.           I believe the essential difference to
be in the temperature      of the lowest stratum which is in contact with
the rock.      When the temperature is 0° C. the neve is soft and vis-
cons, and therefore yields gradually even to a very moderate pres
sure.    The forces acting upon the lower stratum of neve in the upper
and steeper portions are greater, but the neve in contact with the
rock is hard frozen and unyielding.              No doubt the neve' above the
"Bergschrund" is usually of comparatively small depth, but even a
comparatively thin layer of neve will advance slowly in true glacier
fashion when it rests upon a gently sloping bed in the hollow of a
mountain      side, and so receives enough central heat to keep the lowest
stratum in a soft condition.        This is well seen in some of the so-called
glaciers of the second order.
    If the regions of neve below          0° C. which have been previously
 spoken   of exist in the moving portion of the glacier, they may not
 improbably      move on with very little change of form, riding as it
 were upon the warmer and softer substance below.             Before they can
 reach the lower part of the glacier and be transformed           by regelation
 into compact ice their temperatures must have risen to 0° C., and they
 cannot again fall below this temperature except close to the surface of
 the  glacier.
                          VII.    Concluding Remarks.
    The   general result of the foregoing paper seems to be that the
 fuller consideration of the physical properties of glacier ice leads to
 essentially the same conclusions as those to which Forbes was led
 forty years ago by the study of the larger phenomena of glacier
 motion — that is, that the motion is that of a slightly viscous mass
 partly  sliding upon its bed, partly shearing upon itself under the in
 fluence  of gravity.    To say this is, however, by no means to deny
 the importance of regelation         in the economy of a glacier. To rege
 lation mainly we must attribute the gradual passage of suow through
  the form of neve into ice, the healing of crevasses, and the possibility
  of comparatively rapid and violent changes of form in portions of a

108     Dr. J. A. Mc William.    Tlie Structure and Rhythm      [Jan. 29,
glacier in which unusually powerful forces may     be supposed to   be at
work.    Moseley's argument, however, seems to be    decisive against the
belief that the ordinary comparatively undisturbed descent of a
glacier along a moderately sloping bed takes place by fracture and
regelation.    Moseley's value of the shearing strength of ice, which
has been shown to be enormously too great as a measure of the re
sistance of ice to slow shearing, would appear on the other hand to be
an inferior limit to the resistance to the shearing fracture which must
precede regelation.     Moseley has at any rate done good service by
calling attention to the comparatively small intensity of the shearing
force of gravity in the ordinary descent of a glacier. It would hardly
have occurred to one fresh from the study of Forbes to look for
evidence of the viscosity of ice in hand specimens exposed to mode
rate shearing forces in a laboratory.

       by Professor Schafer, F.R.S.            Received January 14,
       1885.
    I.  On the General Arrangement and Structure   of the Eel's Heart.
   The pulsation of the eel's heart can easily be seen externally on the
ventral surface of the body a short way behind the pectoral fins.
There are no rigid structures of any kind between the integument
and the heart. When the very tough and resistant skin is cut through
and the great lateral muscles are separated from each other, the peri
cardium is seen, loosely adherent to the surronnding tissues.         The
pericardial cavity being laid open, the various parts of the heart,
abundantly lubricated with fluid, come into view.       The organ is not
freely suspended in the pericardial chamber, but is attached to the
walls of that chamber by numerous and considerable bands, which
vary in size and arrangement.          The bands connected with the
ventricle pass chiefly to the lateral and dorsal aspects of that part ;
they generally communicate with one another, forming a plexiform
arrangement, and they tend materially to restrict the locomotion of
the organ during systole.     These bands are for the most part fibrous ;
they convey, however, large blood-vessels to the ventricle.         These
blood-vessels come from the dorsal part of the pericardial chamber
and climb up in the fibrous bands on to the moving ventricle to

1885.]        of  the Heart in Fishes,    especially that  of the Eel.      109
ramify on its surface.          The partial fixation of the ventricle by the
bands mentioned is probably in relation with this peculiar mode of
blood-supply.         There are generally two such vessels passing on to
each    side of the ventricle.     These vessels are arterial ; they are dis
tributed to the outer part of the ventricular wall ; they do not supply
the whole thickness of the ventricular muscle.              The greater part of
the ventricular substance is spongy (like the ventricle of the frog)
and is permeated        by the venous blood passing through the heart ; the
outer     part, however, is much more dense and compact in structure,
and is supplied with arterial blood by the special system of vessels
mentioned        above.     Veins are also seen upon the surface of the
ventricle ; they run upwards and backwards to terminate near the
mitral orifice, opening there into the tubular vessel which connects
the ventricle with the remaining parts of the heart.
     The ventricle is also attached to the bulbus arteriosus, to the
 auricle, and to the sinus, by means of fibrous bands, which vary con
 siderably in number and arrangement.              A series of such connexions
 between      the auricle and the ventricle exists around the mitral
orifice.
     The   auricle is attached dorsally near the middle line by several
 short    thick bands, which pass to it from the dorsal aspect of the
 pericardial chamber ; there are also some slender threads, which pass
 to its ventral and lateral surfaces.          The auricle is similarly con
 nected to a slight extent to the sinus, and the sinus has some con
 nexions with the lateral parts of the parietal pericardium.
     The sinus is placed dorsally, and is almost concealed by the over
 lying auricle.       It receives, besides other vessels, the right and left
  jugular veins, which enter it from above.
     Between the terminations of the two jugular veins, there is a part
  of the sinus marked off from the rest by a slight fold — best dis
  tinguished     when the heart is well filled with blood.         This part is
  physiologically distinct ; it may be termed the
                                                         " interjugular part of
  the sinus."       It becomes continuous with the dorsal wall of the
  auricle.
      The  ventral wall of the sinus passes on to be directly attached to
   the ventricle at the mitral orifice.      The proper auricular tissue does
  not form    a complete chamber ; it forms the lateral and dorsal parietes
   of a chamber,    the floor of which is chiefly made up by the prolonged
   ventral wall of the sinus.      (This prolonged ventral wall of the sinus
   corresponds to the
                          " basal wall " described by Gaskell in the tortoise
   heart.)   The auricle appears as a sort of appendage or diverticulum
   bulging laterally and dorsally from the prolonged ventral wall of the
   sinus.   The auricle is not directly contiguous to the ventricle, but is
   separated from the falter by a short intervening tubular vessel, some
    what resembling the canalis auricularis of the mammalian             foetus.

orifice, which is placed a little below the middle of the dorsal aspect
of the ventricle.

   When the circulation is going on this disposition of the parts of the
heart is rendered extremely obvious by the differences in colour pre
sented by the various portions.             The sinus is of a blue colour ; the
auricle is dark red ; the ventricle is of a lighter red tint. When the
ventricle is turned upwards, the blue ventral prolongation of the sinus

1885.]          of the  Heart in Fishes, especially that of    the  Eel.       Ill
forming        the floor of the auricular chamber        is very apparent ; and
when the fibrous threads attaching the external surface of the auricle
to that of the ventricle around the mitral orifice are divided, the blue
intervening tubular vessel is plainly seen.             The connexion of this
vessel    (canalis auricularis) with the ventricle is seen, under the micro
scope,    to be chiefly established by connective tissue. There is, however,
muscular        continuity as well ; for the ventricular substance and the
muscular        wall of the above-mentioned vessel (canalis auricularis) are
connected by an extremely narrow and prolonged isthmus of muscular
tissue.
     II.   On the Spontaneous Rhythm of the Heart as a whole and of its
                                   Various Parts.
     The normal contraction of the heart begins by a distinct simulta
 neous beat in the right and left jugular veins, near their termination
 in the    sinus.    This spot may   be denominated    the  " ostial part " of the
 sinus.      Thence the contraction     passes along the remaining part of the
 sinus    to the    auricle, and then to the ventricle.        The mitral orifice
 being placed, not at the upper end of the ventricle, but a little above
 the middle of its dorsal aspect, the contraction of the ventricle begins
 at this part, and affects the middle portion of the ventricle before it
 passes    over the upper and lower ends.
     The normal       order of contraction seen in the heart can easily be
 reversed       by direct stimulation of the ventricle.        Contraction then
 begins    at the stimulated point and spreads over the whole heart          ; the
 ventricle first contracts, then the auricle, and lastly the sinus.           This
 reversed     mode of contraction usually ceases to be seen whenever the
  stimulation of the ventricle is discontinued ; in some instances, how
  ever, it persists for a short time longer.
     The passage      of  a constant  current through the ventricle is      some
  times able     to cause that part to contract first, and so to lead to a
  reversal    of the normal order of contraction of the parts of the heart.
     During the continuance of the reversed mode of cardiac contraction,
  the circulation       becomes much obstructed ; the auricle and sinus
  are distended with blood.        For the auricular beat occurs before the
  ventricular beat has ended, and the        auricle is unable by its systole to
  force the    blood into a contracted ventricle.
     A regular contraction of the auricle leads very readily to a beat of
  the ventricle.       A partial contraction affecting only the part of the
  auricle   remote from the ventricle is not followed by a ventricular con
  traction; a partial contraction affecting the part of the auricle
   adjacent to the ventricle is usually followed          by a ventricular beat,
   just as  if a regular beat of the whole auricle had occurred.
      But    apart from the occurrence of a preceding auricular            beat, a

 112     Dr. J. A. McWilliam.     The Structure and Rhythm        [Jan. 29,
ventricular contraction may occur in sequence to a sinus beat without
the intervention of a contraction of the proper auricular tissue at all.
This is evidenced by the state of matters observable in a mode of
cardiac action which frequently presents itself as a result of certain
conditions — especially nervous influences — to be afterwards described.
                       I
 The phase to which refer is that in which contraction of the sinus,
followed by contraction of the ventricle, occurs once or many times
without any auricular contraction at all. Here the contraction is first
seen in the sinus ; after an appreciable pause it passes over the
ventricle, the whole auricle meanwhile remaining perfectly motionless.
Moreover, if the ventricle is made to contract first (e.g., by direct
stimulation), the contraction is after a short interval propagated
 to the sinus, the auricle being perfectly quiescent as before.    And the
presence    of  the proper auricular tissue is not at all necessary for the
transmission of the beat between sinus and ventricle.        For the whole
of the auricle proper can be removed without interfering with the
propagation of the contraction from the sinus to the ventricle — pro
 vided the direct anatomical connexion of the sinus and ventricle be left
intact — that connexion which has been described as a prolongation of
the ventral wall of the sinus to the ventricle (basal wall) . In the
absence of all the auricular tissue the ventricle continues to respond
regularly to each beat of the sinus. That the ventricular beats here
 observed are really consequent on the preceding sinus beats — that the
action of the ventricle is not an independent automatism, can be
readily shown by detaching the ventricle from all connexion with the
sinus tissue. When such is done the ventricle either stands still or
goes on beating at a much slower rate than the sinus, and with a
rhythm independent of that of the sinus.
    It is obvious then that contraction may readily pass from sinus to
 ventricle, or from ventricle to sinus, without the intervention of any
 of the proper auricular tissue. And this condition seems to obtain
not only in the heart of the eel but in that of many other fishes as
 well, e.g., salmon, carp.
    On the other hand, contraction can be readily propagated from the
sinus to the ventricle, and vice versd, through the auricular tissue,
 without the presence of the direct anatomical connexion (basal wall)
between sinus and ventricle.       For if this connexion be completely
 divided it will be found that the contraction can pass with the greatest
regularity from the sinus over the intact auricle to the ventricle.
 And partial section of the auricle shows that a very slender strip of
auricular tissue is sufficient to allow the transmission of the contrac
tion to take place. A " blocking " of the contraction can easily be
brought about by further section or by carefully applied pressure —
just as Gaskell has found to be the case in the heart of the tortoise.
And many of the conditions which Gaskell has described with refer

1885.]        of  the   Heart in Fishes, especially thai   of the Eel.       113
ence to     blocking in the tortoise heart     seem to obtain in the eel's heart
as   well.    If the    means   employed   to  bring about blocking have been
kept within certain limits — if the section has not been carried too far
or if the pressure applied has not been too great — the blocked con
dition usually passes off after a time, and the normal propagation of
the contraction is again evident.          The recovery of the tissue from the
blocked condition can         be  materially accelerated by the application of
the     normal    salt solution, and a similar beneficial effect is often
apparent      after    the cardiac action has been arrested for a time by
stimulation of the vagus nerve.
     The normal sequence of the events constituting a cardiac beat is
often in the course of prolonged           experiments seen to become inter
rupted.       The change which presents itself with the greatest fre
quency is a failure of the ventricle to respond to each beat of the
other parts of the heart.           Such failure often occurs without any loss
 of excitability in the ventricular tissue : the condition often seems to
 be one in which the propagation          of the contraction from the auricle
 to the ventricle is interrupted.         The ventricle then seems to remain
 quiescent, not because it is incapable of contracting, but because the
 contraction     is not transmitted to it from the auricle and sinus. The
 failure of transmission seems to occur at the junction of the ventricle
 with the rest of the heart — at the mitral orifice.            This fact is of
 interest when considered in relation with the peculiar character of the
 muscular connexion between the ventricle and the rest of the heart
 —a connexion which is established by means of an exceedingly nar
  row and prolonged isthmus of muscle substance.                Whether or not
  this peculiarity in structural arrangement           is the cause of the fre
  quent failure of conduction         at this part is a question on which it
  would be premature to make a decided statement.
      A similar failure of the ventricular sequence can usually be
  brought about by repeatedly heating the whole heart or the sinus
  and auricle alone.        Heat causes a great acceleration of the beat
  with a simultaneous          enfeeblement.     When the contractions of the
  auricle and sinus have thus been rendered extremely weak, a com
  plete suspension of the ventricular action is commonly seen.             When
  the auricular beats begin to recover            their strength, the ventricle
  again begins to respond          to each auricular beat, even though the
  auricular rate be still very rapid ; the ventricle contracts in sequence
   to each auricular beat if the auricular beats           are tolerably strong.
   The strength of the auricular beats seems to be a very important
   factor in regard to the question of the transmission of the contraction
   to the   ventricle.    And this statement is borne out by a number of
   facts —  among others by a result which is often seen when the
   auricular beats are rendered          excessively weak in consequence of
    their being elicited in rapid succession by artificial stimulation.       In
       vol. xxxvin.                                                     I

  114      Dr.  J. A. Mc William.      The Structure and Rhythm        [Jan.  29,
  such     circumstances    the ventricular action     is often completely sus
  pended until such time         as the  auricular contractions are slower and
  consequently stronger.
      When failure of the ventricular sequence has occurred, the normal
  order of events can often be restored for a time — (1) by applica
  tion of salt solution to the junction of the ventricle with the rest of
  the heart;      (2) by passage of an interrupted current through the
  same part ; or (3) by stimulation of the vagus nerve, leading to car
  diac standstill, followed by a phase during which the normal ventri
  cular sequence is restored. Whether this result of vagus stimulation
  is due to a direct beneficial effect on the tissues or to the rest which
  has been afforded to the various parts, is not at present clear.
     Failure of the ventricular sequence seems to be at times associated
  with a depressed excitability of the ventricle itself.
     All the parts of the heart when isolated from one another can mani
 fest the property of automatic rhythmical action, though this property
 is possessed by the different portions of the organ in very different
 degrees. The excised ostial parts of the sinus go on beating at the
 ordinary rate of the heart's rhythm. The interjugular part when
 isolated exhibits (after a short pause) an independent rhythm which is
 slower than that of the ostial parts.        The prolongation of the sinus to
 the ventricle comes next with regard to rhythmic power ; then the
 auricle ; and finally the ventricle. As regards the property of inde
 pendent rhythmic contraction then, the various parts of the heart
 form a descending series, the highest term of which is the ostial
 part of the sinus ; the lowest term is the ventricle.
     The high rhythmic power possessed by the sinus constitutes it the
leader in the series of events that make up the cardiac beat.              Each
contraction originating in the sinus of a normal intact heart spreads
 over the remaining parts of the organ, and thus leads to a rate of
action in these parts identical with that in the sinus — a rate of action
 very much more rapid than they could exhibit in virtue of their own
independent rhythmic power.
     III.   Some   Points in the Behaviour    of the Heart with regard to the
                           Results of Direct Stimulation.
    I   shall here deal chiefly       with the phenomena exhibited by the
ventricle, reserving the consideration of the results obtained in the
case of the auricle until the influence of the cardiac nerves has been
discussed.
    A single stimulation applied          to the ventricle is followed by a
single    responsive   beat.   If  the ventricle  experimented on forms part
of an intact heart, the result of a single excitation is to cause a re
versed beat of the heart, the ventricle          contracting first. And if the

1885.]       of   the  Heart in Fishes, especially that of  the   Eel.       115
circulation is going on, a peculiar dark bulging of the ventricular wall
occurs at the stimulated part ; this bulging occurs towards the latter
part of the systole which results from the excitation.           This phenome
non occurs with great constancy and in well-marked form in all cases
where the     circulation is intact and the ventricle is well filled with blood.
It is not seen in the bloodless ventricle. The momentary or continued
application of pressure may cause the same result, even though the
pressure be too weak to act as a direct stimulus leading to contrac
tion of the part where it is applied ; the bulging may occur at the
spot where pressure has been applied, even though the contraction of
the heart occur in the normal fashion.         The rationale of the phenome
non in question seems to be that in the area where a direct stimulus or
even pressure insufficient to act as a direct stimulus has been applied,
the muscular contraction        is much impaired in efficacy, and as a result
that area is unable to resist the high intra- ventricular pressure which
occurs during systole.          The area in question, therefore, becomes
dilated with blood forced into it by the vigorous contraction of the
rest of the ventricle ; hence the dark bulging apparent on the sur
face. A somewhat          similar bulging is occasionally to be seen in the
ventricle of the frog as a result of strong direct stimulation.
    The application of a strong direct stimulus (e.g., an induction shock)
to the ventricle is able to elicit a forced beat at almost any phase of the
cardiac cycle.        In a spontaneously-acting heart the occurrence of a
forced    beat from ventricular stimulation is usually followed by a pro
 longed    diastolic interval before the appearance of the next sponta
 neous beat.       In an intact and normally acting heart this diastolic
 prolongation     observable   on a ventricular tracing is not due directly to
 the properties of the ventricle ; it is due to the conduct of the leading
 part of the heart — the sinus.       For the rate of contraction of the ven
 tricle  of an intact heart is determined       by the sinus — in which the
 contraction     of the heart originates.     The property of exhibiting a
 prolonged diastolic interval after a forced beat is not, however, pecu
 liar to the sinus.      It is equally well seen in the case of an isolated
 automatically-acting auricle or ventricle.          A similar phenomenon
 has been described in the case of the entire frog-heart,         and has there
 been attributed by some         observers to an influence of the nervous
  mechanism.
     The  contraction which occurs after the prolonged diastolic interval
 is  frequently of markedly increased size.
     When the heart is intact and the circulation going on, the form of
  curve yielded by an artificially excited ventricular beat (resulting
  from direct stimulation of the apex of the ventricle) is quite distinct
  from that traced by a beat which occurs in normal sequence to an
  auricular beat ; and the naked-eye characters of the beats obtained in
  the  two instances are quite different.
                                                                      i 2

Tracing shows difference in curves of normal and artificially-excited (reversed)
      ventricular beats.      The two right-hand beats are spontaneous ones ; the two
      left-hand beats were caused by direct stimulation of the ventricle with single
      induction shocks.
    The     muscular        tissue of the isolated ventricle            presents some
characters      that are similar to those of the frog's ventricle, and some
that are markedly different.
    1 shall proceed to refer briefly to some            points in the behaviour of
the eel's ventricle with regard to
           (1.) Single stimulations, electrical and mechanical.
           (2.) Faradisation with strong and weak currents.
           (3.) The constant current.
With regard to the              effects of single stimulations       on the quiescent
ventricle, minimal stimulation is at the same time maximal — as in the
frog's ventricle.         Induction shocks obtained with one Daniell's cell in
the primary circuit , when the secondary coil of the Du Bois Reymond's
induction machine completely covers the primary coil, give the same
strength of contraction as do shocks obtained when the secondary
coil is 10 cm. removed from the first-mentioned position.
   When the isolated quiescent ventricle is made to contract regularly
by induction shocks at certain definite intervals (e.g., 10 seconds)
there is, as a rule, no progressive augmentation of the contraction
force up to a maximum — no staircase of beats ("aufsteigende Treppe"
of Bowditch), like that which is so conspicuously seen in the ventricle
of the frog in similar circumstances. In the quiescent ventricle of the
eel's heart the maximum beat is almost invariably obtained at once;
 Tracing showing beats obtained from an isolated quiescent ventricle by stimulating
                 it at intervals of 20 seconds with single induction shocks.
 the beats elicited at regular intervals by a long consecutive series of
 shocks are almost always of exactly the same size, provided the interval
 between the successive shocks is sufficiently long to allow full recovery

of the    muscular tissue from the effects of the preceding contraction.
If   the shocks   follow each other too rapidly, the curves obtained assume
the character of a descending series, resembling in the main a fatigue
trace of an ordinary voluntary frog-muscle — at least as far as the
progressive diminution in the size of the beats is concerned.             When
the ventricle has thus been reduced to a condition of fatigue, if the
interval between the shocks be lengthened, the beats will for a time
show a progressive increase in force, as more time is now allowed for
the recovery of the tissue from the effects of contraction.          Whenever
the recovery from the fatigued condition is complete, the beats remain
of fixed strength, showing no alteration whatever as long as the con
ditions under which the experiment is conducted remain constant.
    Mechanical stimulation of the quiescent ventricle gives the same
results.
    Only in one ventricle (amongst a large number examined) have                I
                            " beneficial effect of contraction." And in that
seen    any trace of the
 case   the ventricle had sustained considerable mechanical injury before
 the   experiment was begun.
    In order to test further the properties of the ventricular muscle
 with regard to the production of a staircase of beats in response to a
regular     series of    stimulations,   I  have   many   times   repeated    the
 experiment     on  a quiescent ventricle   in the uninjured state filled with
 normal blood.        For this purpose the ventricle of a normally acting
 heart was rendered        quiescent by stimulation of the vagus nerve — a
 proceeding which, by arresting the action of the other parts of the
 heart, leads to ventricular standstill without (as will be explained in
 the following pages) influencing in any way its contraction               force.
 The standstill of the ventricle           occurs simply as a result of the
 quiescence of the other parts of the heart from which the rhythmical
 contractions are normally propagated to the ventricle.          An uninjured
 ventricle that has been rendered quiescent in this way is presumably
 in a more normal state than an isolated             ventricle artificially fed
 outside   the body.
     Such   a  ventricle, excited at regular intervals by a series of
 mechanical      or electrical stimulations, gives a series of beats of
 precisely equal     strength,   the commencing     beats of the series being
 maximal, and      differing in no respect from the subsequent ones.
    With regard to the effects of faradisation          upon the ventricular
 tissue, some remarkable results are obtained.
     A surprising influence is found to be exerted by the rate of inter
 ruption in the faradising current.
     It is well known that in the case of ordinary voluntary muscle
  when a slowly interrupted current is applied, the muscle contracts
  at the rate at which the shocks are sent in.       And when a more rapidly
  interrupted current is employed, the muscle exhibits a more rapid

118     Dr.  J. A. Mc William.     The Structure and Rhythm       [Jan.  29,
succession of contractions — in response to the more rapid series of
shocks ssnt into it. In short, the rate of contraction depends on the
rate at which the stimulations are applied ; the quicker the series of
shocks sent in, the quicker is the series of responsive contractions.
    In the eel's ventricle the phenomena are of a strikingly different
nature.     For a slowly interrupted current is found to cause a much
more rapid series of contractions than does a rapidly interrupted
current of precisely equal strength.         When a rapidly interrupted
current is sent through the quiescent ventricle (of an eel's heart), the
rate of contraction induced varies within certain limits according to
the strength of the current employed.         When a rapidly interrupted
current (e.g., sixty shocks per second) is used of such a strength as
to cause a slow series of ventricular beats, it is found that a diminution
in the rate of interruptions (e.g., to six per second), at once leads to
the appearance of a much more rapid series of ventricular beats. The
number of contractions resulting from the application of the slowly
interrupted current is much greater than that caused by a rapidly
interrupted current ; the influence, moreover, of the former is much
more lasting than the influence of the latter. A much closer approach
to a tetanic condition is induced by a slowly interrupted current than
by a rapidly interrupted one.       And this statement holds with regard
to (1)    the  ventricle of  an intact heart; (2) the isolated quiescent
ventricle; and (3) the isolated automatically-contracting         ventricle.
It holds also with regard to various rates of interruption in the
stimulating currents.       A current interrupted ten times a second is
much more effective than one interrupted fifty times a second.           The
rule holds, then, that — within certain limits — a slowly interrupted
current, whether galvanic or faradic, produces much more striking
effects than a rapidly interrupted one, the influence of the latter
 being much less powerful, and, at the same time, of a less enduring
character. It is not necessary when dealing with a slowly interrupted
 current that the shocks be sent in at any particular phases of the
 cardiac beat ; a series of shocks is simply sent in without regard to
 the state of the organ at the moment when each shock is sent in.
    A very striking difference is also evident in the results obtained by
 the continued application of a weak interrupted current to the
 ventricle as compared with the repeated temporary application of the
 same current.      The latter is commonly able to induce a fairly rapid
 series of ventricular contractions when the former has no apparent
 effect at all or merely causes a very slow succession of beats.
    These remarkable differences in the effects of interrupted currents
 are manifested not only in the case of the ventricle, but in the auricle
 and sinus as well — in all the portions of the cardiac muscle.
    As a result of the application of weak interrupted currents, I have
 observed no marked effect upon the ventricle of the eel's heart.     There

Tracing shows the contractions     excited in an isolated quiescent ventricle by stimu
      lating it with a rapidly  interrupted  current (50 interruptions per second).
Tracing shows    the result of stimulating the same ventricle with a slowly interrupted
          current (5 interruptions per second) of precisely the same strength.
is no   evidence whatever of its having the slightest effect in weakening
the contractions — a result which has been shown to follow the appli
cation of a weak interrupted current to certain cardiac tissues, e.g.,
 the  auricle of the tortoise and the ventricle of the frog.
    In the case of the intact heart with the normal circulation going
on, the passage of a constant current through the apex of the ventricle
 has been seen to be accompanied by a reversed order of contraction
of the parts of the heart, the apex of the ventricle — through which
 the current is passing — being the portion which initiates the systole of
 the whole organ.
                         IV.   Action of the Cardiac Nerves.
    All the nerve impulses affecting the heart appear to pass along the
 vagus nerve trunks.
    Stimulation of the peripheral end of a cut vagus nerve exerts upon
 the heart an inhibitory influence of a very powerful nature.                       The
  inhibitory phase is often followed by a phase during which the heart's
  rhythm is accelerated.           Such an accelerating after effect of vagus
 stimulation is, however, slight in degree and variable in occurrence.
     Stimulation of either the right or the left vagus is effective.
     When continued stimulation of one vagus fails at length to keep
  the heart quiescent any longer, stimulation of the other vagus usually
  causes a further inhibition of the cardiac action.
     The latent period of vagus stimulation appears to be short.
     The vagus has a very low minimal stimulation ; a very weak inter
  rupted current such as is insufficient (when applied to the peripheral

120     Dr. J. A. Mc William.     The Structure and Rhythm       [Jan. 29,
end of a cut vagus nerve) to cause contraction          of the oesophagus,
leads readily to cardiac standstill.
   Single induction shocks to the vagus nerve have no distinct effect
on the heart's action unless the shocks are very powerful.
    When arrested by vagus stimulation, the heart stands still in a
state of diastole, and — when the circulation is going on — the whole
heart, but more especially the auricle and sinus, become greatly
distended with blood, if the inhibition be of any considerable dura
tion.    The great veins also become much gorged ; they are very
capacious, whilst the presence of dilatations upon the jugular veins
(jugular sinuses) allows of the accommodation of a large amount of
blood.
   The effects   of cardiac standstill on the circulation can readily be
observed by fixing the transparent part of the animal's tail under a
microscope, and then inducing inhibition of the heart by stimulation
of the vagus nerve, or simply by pressing on the gill — a proceeding
which causes reflex cardiac arrest. When the heart stands still, there
is a very gradual slowing of the blood-current which at length comes
to a state of complete stagnation ; this result is not arrived at until
the cardiac action has been completely stopped for a period of from
one to two minutes.        When inhibition has passed away, and the
heart's   action   has recommenced,    the   blood-flow   is very speedily
restored  ; the change is a much more rapid and abrupt one than the
change   observed   when the heart was brought to a standstill ; the first
recommencing beat causes a distinct movement of blood in the capil
laries of the tail.
    High intra-ventricular systolic pressure and distension of the heart
with blood (caused by clamping the branchial artery) do not obviate
the inhibitory effects of vagus stimulation.
    The eel's heart presents some striking peculiarities as regards its
mode of recommencing action after it has been arrested through the
medium of the inhibitory nerves.
    It will be remembered that in the case of the frog, toad, rabbit,
dog, when the heart's action goes on after an inhibitory standstill,
the various parts of the heart recommence action in the fashion in
which they normally beat.          Thus in the frog, when the cardiac
action recommences after a period of inhibition, the heart beats
present their usual characters as regards the order of succession ;
the contraction first affects the sinus, and then passes over the auricles
 and ventricle successively.    In the eel the mode of recommencing is,
 after slight inhibition, similar as a rule to that seen in the other
animals mentioned, — the contraction begins in the sinus (ostial part)
and passes over the rest of the heart in the normal fashion.           But
after profound inhibition the renewal of cardiac action presents
 features of an entirely different and very peculiar character.        For

   contraction    of the different part is, as a rule, markedly changed, and
   moreover, the contraction           is for the first few beats restricted to
  certain   parts of the organ.         The remaining parts of the heart remain
  quiescent    for  a time,  and   then   come to participate in its activity ; the
   order of contraction generally remains modified, and it is only after a
   considerable though variable period that the ordinary succession of
   events   again obtains in the contracting heart.
      The   part in which spontaneous contractile             activity usually reap
  pears    after profound      inhibition    is not   the ostial part of the sinus
  (which ordinarily leads the rhythm of the heart), but the interjugular
  part of the sinus, which ordinarily contracts               second in the series,
  i.e., in succession to the leading ostial part.          The recommencing con
  traction   is commonly — at least after powerful inhibition —confined for
  one   or more beats      to the interjugular parts;        it often extends, how
  ever,   at the first beat from the interjugular             part to the ventricle.
  The    beating   of  the  interjugular part,      soon  at  least accompanied by
  responsive ventricle beats, goes on for a short though variable time
  without the slightest movement being perceptible in the auricle or in
  the ostial part of the sinus.          After a time the contraction originating
  in the interjugular part of the sinus spreads over the ostial part of
  the    sinus, and soon afterwards          over the auricle    as well   as over the
  ventricle, so   that the whole heart is now in action, though the order of
  contraction     of its various parts is not identical with that normally
  present.     For instead of the systole being initiated by the ostial beat,
  it is now initiated by the interjugular beat.                 Soon, however, the
  ostial beat regains the precedence and the normal order of events is
  restored.
      These phenomena         seem    to depend (1) on the unequal influence
  exerted    by vagal stimulation on the different parts of the heart ; (2)
  on the    high inherent rhythmic power of the interjugular part; and
  (3) on the existence of the anatomical               and physiological connexion
  between the sinus and ventricle already mentioned.                  The ventricle is
  not directly affected at all by vagus stimulation ; its excitability and
  contraction force remain quite unimpaired.                 The interjugular part
  and the    path between it and the ventricle are less profoundly affected
 than are the auricle and ostial parts ; the former parts recover more
 readily from the inhibitory influence                than do the latter.        Early
 released from inhibitory        control,   the  interjugular part,    in virtue of its
high      rhythmic power, begins to beat, and the contraction is soon
propagated to the excitable ventricle.               Hence the appearance of the
peculiar form of recommencement seen.
    In various fishes besides the eel (e.g., carp)               I  have observed a
somewhat similar           mode    of   recommencing      action    after inhibition.
The sinus and ventricle usually contract once or several times before

122   Dr.    J. A. McWilliam.     The Structure and Rhythm     [Jan. 29,
any movement     was perceptible in the auricle.     I
                                                     have not seen a
distinct division of the sinus into ostial and interjugular parts in
any fish except the eel.
  During the inhibitory standstill the condition of the various parts
of the heart, as evidenced by the results of direct stimulation, is
strikingly different from that observed in the hearts of those animals
in which cardiac inhibition has been chiefly studied.
    In the frog-heart, for example, a single direct excitation applied to
the heart during the inhibited phase produces a single beat ; the con
traction begins at the stimulated point and extends over the whole
organ.    And this result is obtained whether auricle or ventricle is
stimulated.     In the eel's heart the state of matters is more complex.
The ventricle resembles the frog-heart in giving a single beat in
response to a single excitation ; its irritability and contraction force
seem to be quite unaffected.      The interjugular part, except when the
heart is most powerfully inhibited, remains excitable to direct stimu
lation.   And contraction excited in the interjugular part is usually
propagated to the ventricle, whilst the auricle remains perfectly
quiescent ; contraction excited in the ventricle is commonly propagated
in a similar fashion to the interjugular part. The ostial part of the
sinus is, during strong inhibition, quite inexcitable to direct stimuli
of all kinds, and so is the auricle. The result of nerve stimulation has
evidently in this instance been the peculiar one of temporarily abolish
ing the irritability of the muscular tissue. Such a result is quite
incompatible with the old conception of vagal action, viz., that the
vagus inhibited the motor discharges from the cardiac ganglia, and
so brought the muscular tissue into a state of quiescence.         If such
 were the case the muscle ought of course to respond readily to direct
 stimulation. And this the auricular muscle signally fails to do.
    It has been mentioned that during the inhibited state direct stimu
 lation of the ventricle readily causes contraction of that part ; the
 contraction originates at the stimulated point and spreads over the
 rest of the ventricle.    It does not pass over the auricle. The non-
 participation of the auricle in the contraction cannot be explained by
 the assumption of a block between the auricle and ventricle preventing
 the contraction being propagated.       For if such were the case, if the
 auricle remained quiescent merely because the contraction failed to
 reach it,   the auricular muscle ought to respond readily to direct
 stimulation. But   it   has been shown that the auricular muscle is
 quite inexcitable,  and that
                            it   is in such state as to be quite incapable
                                         a
 of responding to any contraction impulses that might reach it.

Effects    of Vagal Stimulation on the Properties of the Muscular Tissue
                        of the different Parts of the Heart.
    In the investigation of these effects the cardiac action was regis
tered by means of a simple arrangement                  of the graphic method.
Simultaneous tracings of the            auricular   and  ventricular action were
obtained by means of two writing levers suspended in the horizontal
position by slender elastic bands ; these levers were brought into con-
nexion with the auricle and ventricle respectively by threads.                    In
order to prevent locomotion of the heart it was sometimes necessary
to afford a fixed point by holding in a clamp the bands passing into
the dorsal aspect of the auricle.
    At times a simultaneous record of the contractions of the auricle
and ventricle was obtained by a single writing lever : (1) by attaching
the threads from the auricle and ventricle to the same lever, or
(2) by connecting the lever by the auricle alone (by means of a
thread), and then firmly fixing the apex of the ventricle.                      The
 auricular and ventricular beats are then recorded on a single
tracing.
     I shall  take each part of the heart in succession, and briefly con
 sider the effects observed      in each.
         (1.) Effects of Vagus Stimulation      on the Ventricular     Muscle.
     A large      number of experiments have clearly shown that the
 ventricle is not directly affected by stimulation of the vagus nerve.
      As has been already mentioned, the automatic rhythmic power of the
  ventricle is low, and the ordinary rate of action of this part in the
  intact heart results not from the spontaneous rhythm of the ventricle
  itself, but in consequence of the rapid action of the sinus and auricle,
  from which parts the contraction is propagated to the ventricle.              The
  ventricular contraction is started off by the other parts of the heart ;
  its inherent rhythmic power remains latent.             It is obvious then that
  an arrest of the action of the other parts of the heart would at once
  lead to a suspension        of the ventricular activity. The ventricle,
  deprived of the impulses which ordinarily start off its contraction,
  must necessarily stand still until such time as the starting off impulses
  come again into play, or until its latent automatic rhythm begins to
  manifest itself — an event which, in ordinary circumstances, would not
  occur for a very considerable length of time. So that with regard to the
   suspension of the ventricular rhythm caused by vagus stimulation,             the
  removal    of the normally   efficient  cause  of that rhythm     is the reason  of
  the ventricular     standstill, i.e., the ventricle stands still because the
  other parts of the heart have stopped action.
      The excitability of the ventricular muscle during inhibition of the

124     Dr.  J. A. McWilHam.         The Structure and Rhythm            [Jan.  29,
heart seems      (from a comparison of the results obtained by direct
stimulation in the normal and inhibited states) to be unchanged.                  A
contraction    can   be elicited  by  a  direct   stimulus     applied during   the
inhibitory standstill quite as readily as in the normal condition of the
heart.
    Upon the contraction force of the ventricular muscle, stimulation
of the vagus nerve seems to be entirely without effect.
Ventricle  tracing showing inhibition   resulting from stimulation of vagus   nerve.
                     The recommencing   beats are seen to be large.
    When    a heart which is beating at a fairly rapid rate is slowed by
very   gentle   vagal stimulation, the ventricular beats are larger pro
portionately to the slowing — up to a certain maximum.                The increase
in the force of the beats is dependent on the slowing ; it occurs when
the heart is slowed by means other than by vagal influence, e.g., by
the application of cold to the sinus.             It is the converse of what
occurs during rapid action of the heart, such as may result from the
application of heat to the sinus, or may follow vagal inhibition as an
after effect.    During rapid action of the heart the ventricular beats
become    smaller in proportion to the increased rates, until at length, if
 the acceleration is excessive, the recording lever writes a mere wavy
 line on the smoked paper.
    When the heart is arrested by vagus stimulation, and the ventricle
is made to contract by a direct stimulus, the force of the beat so elicited
 is, even during the most powerful inhibition, quite as large as the
 ordinary beats occurring spontaneously before the standstill.              Indeed
 an artificial beat elicited     during inhibition is generally larger than
 the spontaneous beats occurring before inhibition, just as the beats
 occurring during a very slow cardiac rhythm are larger than those
 seen during a quicker rhythm.           A rapid artificial rhythm induced in
 the ventricle during inhibition of the heart shows a diminution in the
 size of the rapidly recurring beats, corresponding to what is seen in a
 rapid natural rhythm.

      the period of inhibition.
                (2.) Effects of Vagal Stimulation       on the    Auricle.
    The    auricle, though possessing an inherent rhythmic power of its
own, has this independent rhythm masked and rendered latent (like
the lower rhythmic power of the ventricle) by the more rapid rhyth
mical lead of the sinus.          The auricle then is, in consequence of the
rapid action of the sinus, made to heat at a considerably quicker rate
than it would otherwise do in virtue of its own inherent rhythm.
    When the vagus is strongly stimulated, and the whole heart
brought to a standstill, the auricle becomes relaxed, and a marked
diminution of its ordinary tone is evident.              It stands still not merely
in the way the ventricle does because of the arrest of the dominant
 part which normally starts off its contraction,             but because of a pro
 found    influence    directly exerted on its muscular         tissue.    Its inherent
 rhythmic      power is markedly depressed, for vagal stimulation can keep
 the   auricle    in a motionless state much longer than would              be required
 for the    exhibition of its independent rhythmic power. If the auricle
 merely stopped in consequence of the stoppage of the sinus, and if
 the inherent auricular rhythmic power was intact, an independent
 action would very soon be exhibited by the auricular tissue.                       It is
 obvious that this inherent automatic rhythmic property is held in
 abeyance      by vagal stimulation.
    Moreover, there occurs in the auricle a striking depression of the
  excitability     of the muscular tissue as tested by direct stimulation.
  The   auricular excitability is, during strong inhibition, annulled for
 the time being.         Such a loss of excitability does not depend on over
  distension of the auricle with blood during the cardiac standstill ; it
  occurs in the bloodless auricle as well.            As the inhibitory phase is
  passing away direct stimulation of the auricle leads to localised con
  traction    in the stimulated      area.    These     contractions      seem    to   be
  localised   in consequence of the great depression of excitability which
  still pervades     the auricular tissue, and prevents the contraction from
   spreading over the whole auricle as it would do in the normal state.
   Very weak stimulation of the vagus nerve causes a distinct depres

 sion of the auricular excitability without any absolute suspension of
 that excitability. Very weak vagal stimulation is often able to cause
 the auricle to beat more slowly than the rest of the heart, or to stop
 action for a time while the other parts of the organ go on beating.
    At high     temperatures (29 — 33° C., &c.) the auricular excitability to
 direct stimulation does not seem to be depressed during cardiac stand
 still brought about by vagus stimulation.
  If                                                                    7ffjfj     .
Tracing of auricle showing vagal inhibition.       The beats marked + were elicited by
       direct stimulation (single induction shocks) applied to the auricle before its
       action had recommenced.      It will be seen that the auricular beats continue to
       be of diminished size for some time after the spontaneous       action has recom
       menced.
    Vagal stimulation is also able to depress very markedly the contrac
tion force of the auricular muscle. Any beats that can be elicited by
strong direct stimulation (when the inhibitory phase is passing away)
are much diminished in size, and the beats with which the auricular
action recommences are as a rule very small ones ; they gradually
increase till they regain the normal size. The depressing effect on the
contraction force accompanying vagal inhibition occurs both in the
intact heart and in the bloodless auricle ; it is not due to over-disten
sion during the inhibitory period.
    The conduction power of the auricle is, during inhibition, tempo
rarily abolished.
Tracing showing the contractions of both auricle and ventricle. The large beats
      are those of the ventricle ; the smaller ones between the large beats are those
      of the auricle    The effects of vagal inhibition are shown.      The recommenc
      ing auricular beats are much diminished in size ; the recommencing ventricular
      beats are large.
   These primary depressing effects of vagal stimulation on the- auri
cular tissue are by far the most constant and powerful ones ; the
secondary accelerating effects are slight and variable.                   The increase

 1885.]     of  the  Heart in Fhhes, especially that of     the Eel.      127
in the rate   of the auricular action, which is at times seen as a secondary
effect  of vagal stimulation, does not depend on the auricle itself, the
inherent auricular rhythm being latent ; the acceleration depends on the
increased rate of action of the sinus which leads the cardiac beat.
   I  shall here mention some results obtained          by the application of
electricity to the auricular tissue.
   Single induction shocks (as well as mechanical or thermal stimuli)
applied to the normal auricle during its diastole cause a single con
traction, accompanied       as in the ventricle by  a bulging of the auricular
wall at   the point of stimulation.
   The passage      of a weak interrupted current produces some peculiar
effects  in  the   auricle.   For when an interrupted current of suitable
strength is sent through any part of the auricle, that part immediately
stands still, becoming       distended with blood, while the rest of the
auricle    goes   on beating as before. By gradually increasing the
strength    of the current a wider and wider area can be inhibited,
until at length the whole auricle becomes arrested, while the sinus
and ventricle may still go on beating.          Any escape of the current to
the  sinus  will, however, cause     a stoppage of the whole heart.
   When local inhibition is brought about in the auricle in the way
mentioned,     there is a marked change in the excitability of the inhi
bited area, as well as a suspension of its rhythmic activity. Its excita
bility to    direct stimulation is greatly depressed or temporarily
annulled ; the application of a direct stimulus commonly fails to induce
any contraction.       The inhibited tissue seems to be in a state similar
to that into which the whole auricle         is thrown by stimulation of the
vagus nerve.       The action of the inhibited area is not usually resumed
for some little time after the discontinuing of the inhibitory current.
   When a      projecting corner of the auricle is dealt with, and the
electrodes are applied at the points indicated by the letters E and E,
 only part of the projecting piece of auricle is, as a rule, thrown out
 of action.    The shaded part becomes arrested, while the remainder
 goes on contracting in unison with the rest of the auricle.

128     The Structure and Rhythm     of  the Heart in Fishes.   [Jan. 29,
   Poisoning with curare (a minimal dose) prevents the occurrence of
local inhibition in the auricle as a result of the passage of a weak
interrupted current.    And when an isolated piece of auricle exhibiting
an independent rhythm is subjected to the influence of a weak inter
rupted current, its behaviour differs markedly from that of the
same piece of tissue whilst it formed part of an intact auricle, for in
the case of an automatically contracting isolated piece of auricle the
application of a weak interrupted current produces no inhibitory
effect. When the current is strengthened a depression of the contrac
tion force is induced, but the rhythm remains unchecked, unless,
perhaps, by very strong currents. The rhythm may even be accelerated,
and when very strong currents cause an apparent standstill, it is
doubtful whether this standstill is due to a true inhibition of rhythm.
             (3.) Effects of Vagus Stimulation   on the Sinus.
                       A. On  the Interjugular Part.
   During the inhibitory standstill of the heart the interjugular part
is directly affected by nerve influence ; it does not merely stop action
because the leading parts have stopped.        During vagus stimulation
there is a marked depression of the inherent rhythmic tendency.       The
interjugular part can, by vagus stimulation, be kept quiescent for a
very much longer time than would be required for the manifestation
of the independent rhythm of the part ; there is evidently an inhibition
of the inherent rhythmic property. This depression of rhythmic power
seems to pass off from the interjugular part earlier than it does from
the neighbouring ostial parts.
   As a result of vagal stimulation the excitability of the interjugular
part (as well as its inherent rhythmic power) is depressed. During
moderate excitation of the vagus nerve the interjugular part responds
less readily to a direct stimulus, and during powerful inhibition the
interjugular part fails to contract at all on the application of a direct
excitation.   Moreover, when recommencing action begins after a pro
longed inhibitory standstill, the contraction is often seen to begin at
the dorsal aspect of the interjugular part, and to be for a time limited
to a small area of the tissue ; at each succeeding beat the contraction
extends, and soon involves the whole interjugular part.        Such facts
indicate the occurrence during inhibition of a marked depression of
the excitability of the part.
   As a secondary effect of vagus stimulation, there is sometimes a
distinct increase in the rhythmic power, and probably also in the
excitability of the interjugular part.
   The passage of an interrupted current through the interjugular
part very readily brings about an arrest of the whole heart.       A very
weak current is sufficient for this purpose ; frequently a current too

weak to be       perceived on the tongue causes prolonged cardiac stand
still.
   The passage      of a constant current through the inter j ugular part
appears     to cause an acceleration in the rhythm.
    B. Effects    of Vagus Stimulation   on the Ostial   Parts of the Sinus.
    When either the right or left vagus nerve is stimulated the rhythmic
power of both the right and left ostial parts is completely suspended
for a time.      The excitability to direct stimulation also is temporarily
annulled     ; no contraction is caused by the application of even a power
ful  direct excitation.
   As a secondary effect of vagus stimulation there often occurs a
marked heightening in the rhythmic power of the ostial parts, and a
consequent acceleration of the rate of the heart's action.            Probably
there    is also in some instances   an increase in the excitability of the
ostial   parts.
    Weak or strong interrupted currents applied to the ostial part cause
an immediate arrest of the heart's action, with the usual features of
tiie inhibited state.       Such a result is obviated by the administration
of curare.

    Although this paper is confessedly only a fraction of what is neces
sary to be done in this polymorphic            order, it shows at least how
difficult a group it is to handle.     For the Insectivora are set in the
midst of the other Mammalia — low and high.              They might be called
the    Biological stepping-stones from the Metatheria to the Eutheria.
    One    thing can be done, even now, with our present fragmentary
knowledge of the structure and development of the Insectivorous types
—we can assure ourselves that these types are immediately above the
Marsupials,      that they have the Bats (Chiroptera) obliquely above
them, that their nearest relations must be sought for amongst extinct
Eocene forms, and that, lowly as they are, and arrested and often
dwarfed to the uttermost (so that nature could not safely go further
in that direction), they are rich in prophetic           characters that have
come to perfection in larger and nobler types.
    I think it will not be denied that in the ascent of the types the
 Chiroptera are above the Insectivora, and, as        it were, a sort of special

" new leader " from that stock, and that the Insectivora are more or
less transformed modifications of the Marsupial type.        I suspect that
the existing Insectivora just yield the zoologist one of his groups of
types classed together because he knows not what else to do with them ;
they are not a proper, clear, special branch or "leader" of the Mam
malian life-tree.      They form one group under one designation, just as
the poor of this metropolis form a group ; their special mark is simply
lowliness ; they differ inter se almost as much as the whole remainder
above them differ. The higher forms, however, because of their eleva
tion, can afford to be subdivided again into order after order. If we
could descend and see the transforming and newly transformed
Placentalia of the Eocene epoch, then the morphologist and the zoolo
gist would find common ground ; the taxonomy of the latter, how
ever, would be as useless as the titles and distinctions of modern
society to some undeveloped race of savage men.
    The evidently extreme specialization of the existing Monotremes or
Prototheria, and their manifest close relationship to the Edentata — a
strange lowly group of Eutherians, almost extinct in the old world, and
not potent in genera and species in the new — makes it necessary for
me in the present stage of my research to leave them until I have
mastered both them and the great Marsupial sub-class.         Of the latter,
however,     I can speak already, and as no interpretation of the meaning
of the parts seen in a Eutherian skull can be made until they are read
in the light of the structure of the quasi-reptilian skull of the Mar
supial,  I  shall in this paper compare the two types together, using the
lower and older, as a measure of the higher and newer, types of skull.
    Anatomists     are familiar with the character of the skull in adult
Marsupials ; to these may be added others that have turned up to me
in the study of their development.        When these are seen in the light
of the types outside and below the Mammalia, then that which is
 typical in a high Mammal, as such, can be formulated, and the
 specialization of this great branch of the Vertebrate stock be under
stood.     I  will, therefore, here give a list of the more important and
 striking    cranial  characters of the Marsupials, promising to bring
forward, as early as poscible, figures and descriptions of the skull in
 various stages and in many kinds.          But before making this com
 parison of the characters of the skull in the Marsupials with what
 is seen in the Insectivora,      I will state that in the latter — a mere
 order — the diversity is fourfold that to be found in the Marsupials
 (which are worthy to be put not as a mere order, but as a sub-class), for
 in them, whether they be eastern or western kinds, the uniformity oft
 the whole is very remarkable, as remarkable as the diversity seen in
 the Insectivora.      The problem put to the morphologist, however, is to
 explain why the characters that distinguish a Marsupial from a high
 or Eutherian Mammal are for the most part those which the former

1885.]                      On the    Skull in   the   Mammalia.
possess in        common with the Sauropsida.The residuum of proper unique
Metatherian characters neither to be found      in the higher Mammals, on
the one hand, or in the Sauropsida on the other, is but small.      Another,
and a crucial, difficulty is this — the Sauropsida, which of all others help
us most in the interpretation     of the Marsupial skull, are not those to be
found in low Reptilian, but in the highest Avian, types.         Of all birds
the             are the noblest, and are most marvellously specialized
          Passerinae
for their own peculiar mode of life, having many accomplishments and
high intelligence.  Yet it is from this order of birds that have had    I
most help   in this matter, finding in their skulls special structures
which closely correspond to what is most remarkable in that of the
Marsupials.   There are several characters in the superficial or invest
   elements of the skull of Marsupials that are unlike what we find
    ing
in   the    higher forms of Placental Mammalia,             but which linger in the
lower.
     a.    frontals are very small in proportion to the parietals, and
          The
the  squamosals   are, relatively, especially in the young, inordinately
large — as large as the frontals.
      The lacrymals are not only large, and have generally a facial
     b.
plate, but they have, as a rule, two canals.
      The palatine plates of the maxillaries and palatine bones form an
     c.
extremely hollow or dome-like structure, and by the time the creature
is full-grown much of their substance has been absorbed, so as to leave
larger     or smaller fenestrae   :   thus there   is   an attempt to return to the
schizognathous  condition of these parts seen in many Sauropsida.
     The palatines are often formed of several pieces, very irregular
     d.
patches of bone, and these irregular centres are largely absorbed, or
united with the main parts in the adult skull.
  e. The pterygoids are very small, and have their basicranial parts
limited      on    account of the constant separate development of a large
meso-pterygoid.
    /. The main vomer         often relatively small
                             is                      there  ; nearly always
                                                                   is
a    pairofantero-lateral   vomers protecting the cartilaginous capsules of
Jacobson's       organs, and large postero-lateral and often postero-medial
vomers.         These are very irregular and unsymmetrical, in the young
Cuicut,  especially, in which    find ten vomerine bones.

    i. The angular part of the lower jaw is greatly incurved forming a
remarkable hollow inside.
    In the Endo-cranium there are some very curious structures that
differ from what we find in the high forms of Mammalia, but which
mostly agree with what is seen in the Sauropsida.
    a. The nostrils are sub-terminal, and give off large tongue-shaped
 cartilages to protect Jacobson's organs.
    b. The whole nasal labyrinth is small, especially in the young, not
 more than half as large as in an average placental Mammal, and the
 cribriform plate is less depressed in front, very limited in size, and is
square in form.
    c. The orbitosphenoids   do not form   the presphenoid    by meeting
together below, but the presphenoid is as independent        as the basi-
 sphenoid.
    d. There is no special optic foramen in the orbitosphenoid, but the
 optic nerve passes through the common sphenoidal fissure with the
 orbital nerves and the first branch of the fifth; the second branch,
 like the third, has its own foramen rotundum, as in Man, and many
 other Eutheria.
    e. The next character   is one of the most important ; it is this,
namely, that the orbitosphenoids      are flush with the alisphenoids.
The latter, which are extremely large, ossify a tract of the general
cartilaginous side-wall of the embryonic skull — the highly developed
chondro-crauium — and not a free flap of cartilage, merely continuous
with the basal bar, as in the Eutheria. For in these latter the more
bulky brain pushes out the lower part of the side-wall of the skull,
leaving for some time a band of cartilage, which runs free from the
alisphenoid, passing from the orbitosphenoid up to the super-occipital.
In front, the orbitosphenoid is confluent with the ethmoid, so that but
for the breach in the wall made by the alisphenoid, there would be,
even in placental Mammals, a choudro-cranium very similar to that
of the Skate.     This breach does not take place anywhere among the
vertebrate types until we get above the Marsupials. The other cha
racter just mentioned, namely, the absence of a special optic foramen,
is of similar import ; there is no such a foramen in the " Amniota
                                                                         "
until we are among the placental Mammalia.
     f. The alisphenoid helps to form the drum cavity by developing
behind its small external pterygoid process, a shell-like growth, simi
                                        " of Carinate birds. Thus,
lar to the " anterior tympanic recess                                   as
the squamosal is a labyrinth of air cavities opening into the upper
part of the drum cavity, these and the tympanic recess in the ali
sphenoid greatly enlarge the space for air. Indeed, not only those
parts, but the mastoid region of the auditory capsule, and the sides
and top of the occipital arch, all become pneumatic, as in Crocodiles
and Birds.

    g.  The internal carotids pierce the basisphenoid submesially, that
part of the basis cranii is not perforated in the middle, and the clinoid
processes and cavity for the pituitary body are but little developed.
   h.  The limited,        sub-erect, and flattish cribriform plates, and the
small    frontals, are the necessary correlates of a small brain cavity and
brain.      The occipital plane corresponds with those parts, being sub-
erect ; it forms but little more than a right angle with the general
basi-cranial axis.
    f. In  the   Marsupials as well as in the Monotremes we see the ossi-
cala auditus, in making, so to speak.              In all the sub-divisions of the
class,    Monotremes         or  Prototheria,   Marsupials or Metatheria, and
Placentals or Eutheria, the lower jaw is broken up, the longer part
becoming the persistent mandible, the shorter hind part the malleus,
whilst the     starved and modified quadrate becomes the incus.                 For a
long while in the growing Marsupial the malleus is manifestly                        a
               bone   ;  it is  an  " articulare," with an internal and posterior
compound
                                                                     "
 angular process, as         in the Fowl. On it the " angulare          can be seen,
 and sometimes, as in the half-grown Koala (Phascolarctos),                 a supra-
 angnlare too.       The working mandible, attached to           a new pier on the
jugal and squamosal, is composed of a sort of morphological                  mixture
of a large inferior labal cartilage, a dentary bone, with coronoid and
 splenial regions, and the greater part of Meckel's cartilage
                                                                          — the true
primary     ramus.
    j. Tbe topmost segment of the next arch (pharyngo-hyal) is often
 a "columella,"         and not a stapes. In the early young and embryo
 of the Marsupials it is \/-shaped ; its greater front fork enlarging
 above to form the inverted            base of the columella or stapes, and then
 dwindling      into a rod      ; the lesser hind fork becoming, after a time,
 detached and then          ossified, to form the interhyal.   In fishes the upper
 most element of a branchial               arch (the hyoid is a branchial arch)
 often   forks   ; in the Sturgeon these becomo two separate            pieces,  as in
 this  particular case of the embryo Marsupial.                There is not much
 to  remark    upon in the rest of the hyoid arch, the functional suspen
 sory   part.
     For comparison         with the Insectivora the existing Marsupials do not
 yield me      all the archaic characters I want.            For the existing low
 Eutheria are of course the descendants of Metatheria                     that were
 much more generalised and archaic than any now existing ; these
 latter during the Tertiary Period must have undergone, on their own
 low platform, many adaptive changes that would make them look very
 strange beside the Marsupials of the Secondary epoch, if these latter
  could be restored for comparison with them.
     The best type of Insectivore for general comparison is the Hedgehog
  (Erinaceus europozus), as          it shows the least suppression of parts, and
  the   best  development        of that which is diagnostic,   so to speak, of the

   order. In it the great investing bones of the skall are similar     to those
   of the Marsupial, but the nasal and squamosals are smaller,         and the
   frontals are larger.    In the hard palate there is a considerable   relapse,
  as in Marsupials ; certain tracts of bone being absorbed, but       it has  no
   mesopterygoids, and only /iue vomers, yet the anterolateral         pair  are
  well developed.      Moreover the tympanic region has only     one annulus.
  the outer bone    ; there is no separate os-bullae.   Instead of the latter
  there is a crescentic shell of bone, which grows from the basisphenoid,
  greatly increasing the size of the tympanic cavity.           In the endo-
  skeleton in front of the tympanic cavity there is a remarkable ridge
  of bone growing outwards from the alisphenoid.           That ridge is the
  remnant of the alisphenoidal tympanic wing of the Marsupial, and the
  shell of bone growing from the basisphenoid is the same morpho
 logical element as the separate os-bullae, but it has lost its indepen
  dence.    The higher Mammalian type is fully reached in the thorough
  freedom of the alisphenoid from the general cranial wall.          This cha
 racter, indeed, is intensified into the special diagnostic of an Insecti-
 vore, for it lies almost wholly outside the orbitosphenoid.          Here the
 sphenoidal fissure, which in this case lets out the second branch of the
 fifth, but not the optic nerve — that nerve having its own foramen in
  the orbito-sphenoid — is not a mere gap, but a side passage, or a sort
  of sphenoidal corridor, right and left. In these things the Hedgehog
 is higher than the Marsupial, but in some others it is lower, or more
  archaic.   These latter characters, which suggest an uprise from a
  more general type than the existing Metatheria, are—
     1st. The development of solid hyaline cartilage in the pterygoid
  region, a remnant of the pterygo-quadrate'of the Ichthyopsida.
     2ndly. The presence of a persistent pituitary hole, which is con
  nected with a curiously specialized structure, only seen in typical
 Insectivores, namely, a hollowing out of the basis cranii beneath the
 pituitary region.
     3rdly. A third archaic character, not seen in the existing Marsu
 pials, is the huge relative size, long persistence, and separate distal
 ossification of Meckel's cartilage, so that in the embryo Hedgehog, and
 even in the nestling, the primary lower jaw is as large as in fishes
 generally, scarcely excepting the Selachians.
     The ossicula auditus are typically Eutherian ; we have lost the
 imperforate stapes or columella, the interhyal is very small or absent,
 and the malleus and incus are much like what we find in the higher
 Mammals, generally.        The pneumaticity of the skull is much reduced :
the olfactory region is almost double the relative size of that of a
Marsupial. In the head of another family of the Insectivores, namely,
the Mole (Talpa europma) there is much that is in accord with what
is found in its distant relation the Hedgehog, but in it there are
evident signs of degradation and of relapse into what is Marsupial in

                          Chi the Skull in   the Mammalia.                 135
character.      The nasal labyrinth is relatively immense, and the skull
walls below, laterally,      and behind, are as exquisitely pneumatic as in
the Flying Marsupial (Petaurtis),          the Bird, or the Crocodile.    The
swollen basis cranii, all air galleries within, is so excavated that the
hinder sphenoid,        both base and wings, largely helps the flat single
tympanic to form the drum cavity.            The pituitary hole does not exist,
bat there is a considerable pterygoid cartilage.           The ossicula in the
adult are normal, but a curious special character is seen in the ossi
fication, in the young, three parts grown, of the sheath of the stapedial
artery,  which for a time holds the stapes in its place. It is, however,
absorbed afterwards, but remains in the related genus Myogale.               In
nearly half-grown young Moles the malleus is quite like that of the
                                    " articulare," with
Marsupials ; it is an evident                            copious wild growths
of bone, sub-distinct, which answer to the
                                                     " angulare" and " supra-
            "
angnlare        of a Reptile or Bird. This malleus in its articular part
has two   endosteal and one ectosteal bony centre.
   Meckel's cartilage, long continuous with the Malleus, is nearly as
massive as in the Hedgehog, and has a more distinct separate ossi-
fination   in its sub-distal part,      a long,   independent,   but temporary
hypobranchial      bone.
   The   Mole shows a most remarkable development of the endo-
cranium,     which, twenty years ago, suggested to me that its skull
retained unmistakable Monotrematous characters.              In large young of
the Echidna and Ornithorhynchus the solidity of the chondrocranium is
immense, like that of a Chimmroid Selachian, and the investing bones
are thin and splintery.        I have not made out the mode of ossification
of the inner skull in those types, but in spirit, if not in the letter,
the Mole agrees with them, that is, in the great development and
independence of the inner skull.             The opisthotic bone ossifies the
normal petro-mastoid region, whilst the prootic bony centre begins in
its right place on the front edge of the cartilaginous capsule, and
then runs away from it into the wall of the skull.              Thus there is a
large bony     tract  in the  temporal region    between   the  squamosal and
the large interparietal, which is not one of the ordinary ectocranial
bones, but an endo-cranial bony tract overshadowing and yet imitating
the trne temporal        bone or squamosal.      This bone is represented by
three separate centres in osseous fishes, namely, the prootic, pterotic,
and sphenotic, whilst their true auditory region is partly ossified by
the epiotic aud opisthotic ; the epiotic is only sub-distinct in the
Mole.         I
         If am asked why I dive so far down for my illustrations,
instead of being satisfied with what Reptiles           and Birds would show
me, my answer        is that these are often of no use for comparison, as
they are as thoroughly specialized for their own mode of life as the
Mammalia, generally, and are as completely, and often more completely,
transformed      from the original archaic type or types.      Thus the Mole,

like most of the Edentata lately described by me, suggests as the
root stock of the Eutheria, generally, not Marsupials (Metatheria), as
we know them, but Prototherian forms in which, in ages long past,
the existing Monotremes and Marsupials had a common origin.
The Shrew (Sorex vulgaris) represents another family of the Insec-
tivores, the Soricidae.    It combines the characters of the Mole and
Hedgehog with peculiarities of its own that are manifestly due to
dwarfing ; many things are suppressed, as if there was not room in so
small a skull for their development.        The pituitary hole reappears,
and the pterygoid cartilage, but the tympanic wings of the alisphenoid
and of the basi-sphenoid are gone. The malleus does not show itself
so unmistakably Marsupial, and Meckel's cartilage is slenderer.       The
sheathing alisphenoids      are  well seen,  the  squamosal  is extremely
small, low down, and devoid of a jugal process ; the jugal bone is
suppressed.     The prootic wing is present, as in the Mole.
    So much for the British representatives of these families of the
Insectivora — the Erinaceidae, Talpidae, and Soricidae. The Mascarene
Insectivora are so evidently related to each other, as to suggest, at
once, a common origin ; these are the Centetidae, the largest of which
is the Teurec (Centetes ecaudatus) ; the other genera treated of in
this paper are Ericulus, Hemicentetes, and Microgale.
    These are almost typical Insectivora, but they agree with the
 Shrews in having the jugal bone suppressed ; they are also more
Marsupial than our native kinds. In these types the normal cha
racters of the skull of an Insectivore are combined with a remarkable
 Marsupial tympanic wing to the alisphenoid, but the os-bulloe is not
 free, it is merely an outgrowth of bone from the basisphenoid.       The
pituitary hole is present and in the large species the curious basi-
 cranial excavation ; the optic foramina also and the sphenoidal side
 passages are remarkably developed.         As in the genus Phalangista
 among the Marsupials, and Sorex and Talpa among the British Insecti
 vora, the an tero- lateral vomers are evidently suppressed, or have a
 very temporary independent existence ; the postero-lateral        vomers
 are rather small, as in the Hedgehog.           In the embryo the main
 vomer is relatively as large as in the embryo Whale, and is curiously
 cellular or spongy.    In nestlings this one primary azygous centre has
 broken up into three ; one, the largest, above, and two lesser below,
 sheathing, it as it sheathes, the base of the nasal septum.     Now this
 multiplication of the vomers, proper, is thoroughly Marsupial. It is
 unique, as far as I know, in the mode of its subdivision into secondary
 bony centres.     In the African (Continental) family the Elephant or
 Jumping Shrews (Macroscelidae), as illustrated by the largest forms
 Petrodromus and Rhynchocyon, we have a curious mixture of Marsupial
  or Metatherian and Eutherian characters, so that they are aberrant
 as Insectivores ; the Marsupial characters are most remarkable : —

  1885.]                   On the  Skull in the  Mammalia.                   137
 These are      (1) the absence of an optic foramen in the embryo; (2)
 the    alisphenoids    scarcely overlapping the orbitosphenoids ; (3) the
 tympanic      wings of the alisphenoids are well marked, hollow shells
 in the embryo;        (4) large antero-lateral vomers, and postero-lateral
 vomers, as large as in average       Marsupials, and, as in many of them,
                                                                    " os-bul'ae,"
 meeting and uniting at the mid-line ; (5) a large distinct
 which makes a tympanic cavity as large as, and much like that of,
 Petaurus or Phascolarctos.         On the high Eutherian side we have, in
 the embryo, frontals as large as the parietals, and strangest of all
 Mammalian specialization, a long proboscis, composed of thirty double
 rings of cartilage, a structure quite similar to the proboscis of an
 Elephant.        The mesopterygoids are suppressed, but the pituitary
 hole   is present.
    I   now come to a type for which no place can be found in our
systems of Zoology, but for which the late Professor Peters, in
despair, lodged      with the Insectivora ;  I  refer to the Flying Cat (Galeo-
pithecus).       This genus forms a Family by itself, and yet has only two
species ; it should form an Order, as the Hyrax does.
    These two species of Flying Mammals are full of remnants of what
 is old, and rudiments of the new.            I  put them between the most
archaic (Marsupials)           and some of the most curiously modified
 Entheria, the Frugivorous Bats, and survey them from these two
 widely separate standpoints; but they possess that which neither
 Phalanger nor Bat will account for or explain.
    With a flat, outspread, foliaceous skull, as completely ankylosed as
 that of any bird, and as thoroughly pneumatic in its post-orbital
 region, we have one of the largest and most perfect hard palates ;
 with the upper incisors partly suppressed, the lower incisors well
 developed and utterly nnique, and the premolars and molars strong
for grinding.         The cheek bones and the squamosals are large and
thoroughly Marsupial, so are the small external pterygoid processes
and internal pterygoid bones, and the very large mesopterygoids.
 I find no antero-lateral vomers, but Jacobson's organs and their
protecting cartilages are twice as long as in any types yet examined,
and the postero-lateral vomers are almost as well developed as in
Marsupials, whilst the main vomer is very large.                  The sphenoid
bones     are typically Eutherian, but the basisphenoid has beneath it,
as  in Lizards, a small " parasphenoid ;" this I find only in 0. phillip-
yenns, and as yet in no other Mammal.               As in the Marsupials, the
jugal    or  malar   helps  to form the glenoid cavity, and the squamosal is
as    large as in Cuscus, the lowest of the Eastern Marsupials.              The
single     flat tympanic bone, with its ossified and compressed meatus,
 is  very remarkable ; but this part of the skull corresponds neither
 with    the Marsupials nor the Insectivores, and this is true also of
 several other of its characters.

    Those things in which it agrees with the Marsupials are not the
same as in the Hedgehog ; it differs from both Insectivores and
Marsupials in its own peculiar way, and in some things is more
archaic than either.      This type appears to me to be a waif from a
large group of forms that were beginning to be transformed out of
the Metatheria into the Flying Eutheria (Chiroptera), certain of
which, this living type among the rest, being arrested at the general
level (or platform) of the Insectivora ; they are equal to, rather than
members of, the order Insectivora.         The last type to be mentioned is
the Tupaia, an Eastern form, rather high in position, yet combining cha
racters for the first time seen in the Mammalia, namely, a perfect orbital
ring, with old Metatherian structures, such as the large os-bullae, the
small external and internal pterygoids, and a somewhat absorbed hard
palate.    The last three kinds, Bhynehocyon, Oaleopithecus, and Tupaia,
all  show   a curious mixture of that which looks upwards to the
highest types, and of that which has been retained from the lower and
more archaic forms of the Mammalian class.

I. " The Relation of Bacteria to Asiatic Cholera."                 By E.
           Klein, M.D., F.R.S., Joint Lecturer on General Anatomy
           and Physiology at the Medical School of St. Bartholo
           mew's Hospital, London.        Received January 28, 1885.
    I   propose  to bring before the Royal Society the results of an
inquiry     into the etiology of Asiatic cholera, undertaken, at the
instance and expense of the Secretary of State for India, by myself,
Dr. Gibbes, and Mr. Alfred Lingard while in India. This investiga
tion will be published in extenso by the India Office, but permission
has been granted to us to bring to the notice of the Society some of
the more important points of our inquiry, particularly those regarding
the relation of bacteria to Asiatic cholera.     I shall supplement them
by giving the results of further observations which I have made since
my return from India.
    As is now well known,     Dr. Robert Koch, in an extensive inquiry
into the etiology of cholera in Egypt, Calcutta, and in France,
1883-84, undertaken by him, Drs. Gaffky and Fisher, at the instance
of the German Government, has arrived at certain conclusions, which
briefly stated are these   :
    1. In all persons suffering from Asiatic cholera there occur in the
rice-water stools during the acute stage of the disease certain well-
characterised bacteria, which, on account of their curved shape, Koch
called " comma bacilli."
    2. These comma bacilli are mobile rods, of small size, of about the
 same thickness as tubercle bacilli, but only of half their length ; they
 are always more or less curved, sometimes as much as to form half a
 circle ; they vary in length according to the state of growth ; they
 occur either singly or in couples, in the latter case arranged like
 anS.
     3.  The comma bacilli occur in great numbers in the mucus flakes
 as  well as in the fluid of the choleraic evacuations.   They occur in the
 lower part of the ileum of persons dead in the acute stage almost to

 1885.]           Relation   of Bacteria    to Asiatic Cholera.              155
the exclusion     of other bacteria, and in such great numbers that the
lower part of the ileum may be considered           to contain almost " a pure
cultivation    of comma bacilli."
   4. The    mucous membrane of the ileum,            particularly that of the
lower part, around        and in the lymphatic glands located here — the
solitary and Peyer's lymph-glands — exhibits in typical and rapidly
fatal cases characteristic      alterations : loosening and detachment of
the epithelium of the surface            and of that lining the glands of
Lieberkiihn    ;  swelling of the mucous membrane and congestion of
its blood-vessels,      particularly at the peripheral        portions of the
lymph glands.        These alterations are due to the presence, growth,
and multiplication        of the comma bacilli in these tissues, and the
disease cholera is caused by the production on the part of these
comma bacilli, and by the absorption on the part of the system of a
special  chemical ferment.
   This state of the presence of the comma bacilli in the tissue is best
pronounced in the lower part of ileum ; higher up it is more limited,
and   gradually diminishes, and finally disappears in the upper part of
the small   intestine.
   5. The blood and other tissues are free of any organisms.
   6. The comma bacilli grow well outside the body at the ordinary
temperature      of the room, but better still at higher temperatures up
to 38°   or 40° C. They divide transversely ; after division the two
offsprings may remain joined end to end with shape of an S, and by
farther division they may grow into a spiral-like or wavy form.
They grow well in the mucus flakes taken from the intestine, and
placed on    linen kept in a moist cell ; they grow well on potato, in
broth, in     Agar- Agar jelly, in solid nourishing gelatine mixture
 (gelatine, peptone, and beef extract).         In this latter substance they
exhibit a peculiar and definite mode of growth not seen by Koch on
any other bacteria.        The comma bacilli require for their growth an
alkaline medium ; they are killed by acid, by drying, and various
antiseptic media.
   7.  On account      of their constant      occurrence   in the intestines of
patients suffering     from Asiatic cholera, on account of their absence in
all other diseases of the intestine,       and on account of their peculiar
mode of growth in nourishing gelatine, Koch vindicates for these
comma     bacilli not only an important diagnostic value, but also con
siders them     as the true cause of cholera.
   8.  Since his return to Germany, Koch has convinced himself of the
correctness    of the observations of Nicati and Rietsch, who maintain
that cholera can be produced in dogs and guinea-pigs                by injecting
directly into the small intestine of these animals the comma bacilli
taken   either directly from the choleraic evacuations, or from artificial
 cultivations.
                                                                   m  2

lot!                        Dr. E. Klein.    On the                [Feb. 5,
    Our investigations enable us to say this :
    1. Koch's statement as to the almost constant occurrence of comma
bacilli in the rice-water stools of cholera patients is correct; the
comma bacilli vary greatly in numbers              in different stools and
in   different   cases,  in  some    being exceedingly    scarce, in others
l.umerous.
    2. These comma      bacilli vary greatly in length, some being twice
and three times as long as others, some well curved as much as to
form half a circle, others showing only just a slight bend. The name
comma bacillus is inappropriate, as in reality they are vibrios.
    3. The comma bacilli occur in the mucus flakes of the rice-water
stools as well as in those taken from the ileum of a person dead of
cholera.     The sooner after death the examination is made, the fewer
comma bacilli are found in the mucus flakes ; in several typical rapidly
fatal cases the mucus flakes taken from the ileum and examined soon
after death (from between fourteen minutes and an hour or an hour
and a half) contained the comma bacilli only very sparingly indeed, and
not to the exclusion of other bacteria.         Our investigations do not
bear out Koch's statement as to the lower part of the ileum being in
                                            "a
acute typical cases of cholera almost          pure cultivation of comma
bacilli." In not one of the many post-mortem examinations of typical
acute cases have we found such a state.
    4. The mucous membrane of the ileum of typical rapidly fatal
cases, if examined soon after death, does not contain in any part any
trace of a comma bacillus or any other bacteria, not even in the
superficial loosened epithelium.
    If the post-mortem examination is sufficiently delayed, comma
bacilli and other bacteria may be found penetrating into the spaces
of the mucous membrane.
    The theory of Koch's as to the comma bacilli present in the mucous
 membrane secreting a chemical poison inducing the disease cannot,
 therefore, be correct.
    5. Neither the blood nor any other tissue contains comma bacilli or
 any other micro-organisms of known character.
    6. The behaviour of the comma bacilli in artificial media is not
 such as to justify their being considered as specific.      They grow well
 in alkaline and neutral media, are not killed by acids, and their mode
 of growth in gelatine mixtures, however peculiar, is not more peculiar
 than that of other putrefactive bacteria ; they show marked differences
 when grown in different media, but not more so than the ordinary
  putrefactive    bacteria when compared in their growth with one
 another.     The manner in which the choleraic comma bacilli grow in
  gelatine is identical with that shown by the comma bacilli of the
 mouth of healthy persons (Lewis) in that same medium.
                                 " comma bacilli " occur in other intestinal
    7. Koch overlooked that

1885.]             Relation of Bacteria      to  Asiatic Cholera.               157
diseases,    in the mouths of healthy persons, and as shown recently, even
in some     common articles of food.
    8.   The experiments performed by Koch and others on animals do
not    in the least prove that the comma bacilli are capable of producing
cholera or any other disease.           The results obtained by them are much
easier explained in a manner opposed to that given by Koch and
others.
    9.   There is direct evidence to show that the water contaminated
with choleraic       evacuations, and containing, of course, the comma
bacilli, when      used for domestic purposes, including drinking, by a
large number of persons, did not produce cholera.
    10. The mucus flakes taken from the small intestine                of a typical
rapidly    fatal  case  of cholera   contain  numerous    mucus    corpuscles tilled
with peculiar       minute     straight  bacilli; in this state they are found
when the      examination     is made very soon after death      ;  soon, however,
the mucus        corpuscles     swell   up  and   disintegrate,    and   then  their
bacilli become free.
    The small     bacilli are never missed in the mucus flakes. They are
only one-third or one-fourth the length of the comma bacilli, and
about half their thickness.           They are non-mobile ; they grow well in
Agar- Agar jelly, but show in their mode of growth no peculiarity by
which they could be considered as specific.              When grown on the free
surface of the nourishing material they form spores.
    11. These small bacilli are not present in the blood, in the mucous
membrane of the intestine, or in any other tissue.
    12. Experiments        made with these small bacilli on animals pro
duced no result.
    13. Since my return to London I have ascertained that the comma
bacilli of cholera show two distinct modes of division, one the known
one of transverse        division, and a second one of division in length.
When growing in Agar-Agar jelly at the ordinary temperature of the
room, after some days the bacilli swell up owing to the appearance in
their protoplasm of one or more vacuoles            ; as these vacuoles    increase,
so   the    comma      bacilli become gradually changed first into plano
convex,     then    into   oblong bi-convex, and ultimately into circular
corpuscles.       The longer the original 'comma bacillus, the larger the
 final circle.     These circular organisms are mobile just as the comma
 bacilli, and by disintegration of the protoplasm at two opposite points
 two perfect more or less semicircular comma bacilli are formed.
 Growing the comma bacilli in Agar-Agar                     jelly kept at higher
 temperatures (30-40° C.), they multiply by transverse division only,
 but transferring these to Agar-Agar jelly and keeping this at the
 ordinary temperature of the room, they again gradually change into
 circular organisms, which, by division in the diameter of the circle,
 form two new comma bacilli.

I. ,-Note on the Condensation            of Gases at the Surface of
         Glass."    (Preliminary.)       By J. T. Bottomley, M.A.,
         F.R.S.E.      Communicated       by Professor Sir William
         Thomson, F.R.S. Received January 27, 1885.
   It is well known to those who have endeavoured to obtain, in glass
vessels, the very perfect vacuums first sought after and obtained by
Crookes, and producible by the mercurial pumps, that the operation
is much assisted by heating the glass vessels to be exhausted, and
even the tubes of the pump, to a high temperature.          The difficulty
of removing    the film of air and moisture adhering to glass tubes is
also well known to makers of barometers and thermometers.
   When the Sprengel pump is used for producing a vacuum, and
when a tolerably good vacuum has been produced, so that the baro
metric gauge indicates a presence of one millimetre or half a milli
metre of mercury, the drops of mercury falling in the tube of the
Spreugel give rise to a loud metallic hammering sound ; and they fall
with such unbroken sharpness that those who use this form of pump
are   often troubled by the "fall-tubes"         splitting longitudinally
through a length of several inches — a phenomenon in itself very
remarkable, considering the strength of the tubes and the smallness
of the mercurial drops.       If, while this hammering is going on, the
glass vessel which is being exhausted and the leading tubes of the
 Sprengel pump be heated by passing the flame of a spirit-lamp or of a
Bunsen burner over them, the hammering         immediately ceases, and on
looking closely at the fall-tubes it is seen that they are carrying down
air which the heat has liberated from the glass walls of the appa
ratus.    The ordinary barometer gauge is scarcely sensitive enough to
show an increase of pressure, but the McLeod gauge readily shows it.
   There i3 another well known phenomenon connected with the con
densation of gases and vapours on the surface of glass, viz., the con
densation of a watery film over the glass of electric apparatus, in
virtue of which, at temperatures considerably above the dew point,

onto    wheel. The remainder was of flint glass tubes, drawn out in a
             a
similar way.    The spun glass was carefully parcelled up in paper,

pomp,  which was in excellent order, was then worked rapidly till                        I
had produced a very good vacuum, which by the McLeod gauge gave
me an indication of    M* pressure. The pump was then left for

full of mercury through the pump,     ascertained that the vacuum had

not sensibly deteriorated,  the McLeod gauge giving identically the
same reading as before.    This exhaustion was performed without the
application of any unusual heat to the tube containing the glass
fibres. The temperature of the room was about 56° F.
    1now raised the mercury to the upper level, and allowed to flow             it
through the pump, and the drops fell with the well-known loud
hammering             While this was going on applied a Bunsen burner
                      noise.                              I
   the tube containing the spun glass. In a few seconds the hammering
of to
    the mercury ceased, and on applying the test of the McLeod gauge
the pressure within the pump was found to have risen largely.             did        1
not, however, obtain      measurement with the gauge corresponding to

German glass, showed signs of softening and of falling in            and the    ;
glass fibres were  likewise,  some of them, slightly softened and bent.
   The pump was worked for over an hour, the heating being applied,

in a tube made for the purpose, which fitted on over the up-turned
ends of the five fall-tubes.       At the end of this time the vacuum was
again fairly good, though not so good as it was before the heating
commenced.       The McLeod gauge indicated 12 M. It was seen that
 very little more air was being carried down, and         I  did not wish to
push the vacuum farther than, or quite so far as, the vacuum which
had been obtained before the liberation by heat of the condensed gas.
   The collecting tube was now removed, and the gas obtained was
measured and analysed, so far as it was possible to analyse a quantity
so small.
   The total amount of gas collected was calculated to be, at 15° C.
and a pressure of 760 mm., 0-45 of a cubic centimetre. To this a small
quantity of strong solution of caustic potash was added, and time was
given for absorption.       A small quantity of pyrogallic acid was next
added, and the further absorption observed. The residue was so small
that  I could  do  nothing farther.
   The result of the analysis showed 8'24 per cent. of the whole to be
carbonic acid gas (absorbable by caustic potash).        Of what remained
24'8 per cent. was oxygen (absorbable by pyrogallic acid and caustic
potash mixed).       The residue 75'2 per cent. was, I presume, mainly if
not wholly nitrogen.      I ought to remark that my pump was furnished,
as is usual, with the phosphoric acid drying tube.       The gas, therefore,
which I collected was perfectly dry, and I have no way at present of
ascertaining how much moisture adheres to the spun glass.          In stating
the results of the analysis I have made no correction for moisture
introduced with the potash solution.
   In order to make an estimate of the amount of surface exposed by
the spun glass,   I  measured, with a screw micrometer gauge, the diame
ters of 200 of the fine glass fibres taken at random.       I found them, as
I expected from the care with which they had been prepared, fairly
uniform, and the average diameter was 7-06 hundredths of a milli
metre. Weighing also the 200, and then the whole quantity, I found
the whole number of the fibres to be 6370.         The average length was
10'25  cm.    The   surface  was  thus  1448 sq. cm., or equal to that of a
square 38 cm. in the edge.
   I am preparing for further experiments on this subject, and hope
soon to be able to add to        it observations on the amount and on the
electric conductivity of the film of moisture condensed upon the sur
face of glass.

1885.]                Underground Temperatures,         $-c.
  Having    filled a fresh tube with fresh spnn glass, I carefully
exhausted with     the Sprengel    pump on January 24th, and the
exhaustion was kept up till February 5th, that is, for twelve days.
During this time I frequently tested with the McLeod gauge. A very
slight increase of pressure was found during that interval ; but it was
so slight that I am not able to say that it was greater      than that
which is observed at all times, even with the Sprengel pump in
excellent order, when a vacuum is maintained for several days.
   On February 5th,      Ipassed three or four bottlesful of mercury
through the pump, and had a vacuum of about 0'5 M as shown by
the McLeod gauge.       I
                      then applied heat, and had instantly an abun
dance of gas given off from the spun glass.   This was collected as
before, and analysed.
  The number    of glass fibres was 15,500, giving an estimated surface
areaof 3527 sq. centims.     The amount of gas given off was 0'41 c.c. ;
which is considerably less in proportion than in my first experiment.
  Of this gas it was found that 78 6 per cent, was carbonic acid gas
(absorbable   by caustic potash).  Of the remainder            10 5 per cent. was
oxygen     (absorbed  by pyrogallic acid and potash)           ;   while   89-5   per
cent,    was left unabsorbed   ;    and   may    be   supposed      to be    mainly
nitrogen.
  The very large proportion of carbonic acid gas is remarkable,
and it is difficult to account for, unless we may suppose that it was
taken up by the glass in large quantity during the operations      of
drawing   out the glass into fibres, and enclosing it in the containing
tube — operations  during which there was, in these preliminary experi
ments,   an abundant supply from the blowpipe flames.

  The author    remarks on the difference of opinion between physi
cists and geologists respecting the probable thickness of the outer
crnst of the earth — the former, on the strength of its great rigidity
and the absence of tides, contending for a maximum thickness and
comparative  solidity of the whole mass; while the latter, in general,

strata in mountain ranges, its general flexibility down to the most

recent geological times, and the rate of increase of temperature in
descending beneath the surface, contend for a crust of minimum
thickness as alone compatible with these phenomena.
   The question of underground         temperature, which is a subject
equally affecting the argument on both sides, had engaged the
author's attention in connexion with an inquiry respecting volcanic
action, and he was induced to tabulate the results to see how far the
usually received rates of increase were affected by various interfering
causes — not that most of them had not received due attention,     but it
was a question whether sufficient allowance had been made for them.
   Although Gensanne's first experiments were made in 1740, and
others were subsequently made by Daubuisson, Saussure, and Cordier,
in coal and other mines, it was not until the construction of deep
artesian wells commenced in the second quarter of this century, and
Walferdin introduced his overflow thermometer, and precautions
were taken against pressure, that the more reliable observations were
made and admirably discussed by Arago.          The Coal Commission of
1866 collected a mass of important evidence bearing on the question,
and in 1867 a Committee of the British Association was appointed
to collect further information.      Under the able superintendence of
 Professor Everett, a series of valuable experiments with improved
instruments has been made, and full particulars published in the
Annual Reports of 1868—1883.
    But notwithstanding the precautions taken, and the accuracy of the
experiments, they present very wide differences in the thermometric
gradient, ranging from under 30 to above 120 feet per degree Fahr.
 Consequently different writers have adopted different mean values.
 On the Continent one of 30 metres per degree C. has been commonly
adopted, while in this country some writers have taken a mean of
 50 feet per degree, and others of 60 feet or more.     The object which
the author has in view is to see whether it is not possible to eliminate
 the more doubtful instances, and to bring the probable true normal
gradient within narrower limits.        In so doing he confines himself
 solely to the geological side of the inquiry.
    In a general list, Table I, he gives all the recorded observations in
 the order of date. The list embraces observations at 530 stations in
 248 localities.  The most reliable of these he classifies under three
 heads, in Tables II, III, and IV.
    1. Coal mines.
    2. Mines other than coal.
    3. Artesian  wells and bore-holes.
 To which tunnels are added in a supplement.
   The author then proceeds to point out that the gradients given in
 many of the earlier observations were wrong in consequence of
 neglecting the height of the surface, and from the exact mean annual

temperature of the locality not being known. They also differed
amongst themselves from taking different surface temperatures, and
starting from different datum levels.          To these he endeavours to
assign    uniform and corrected values.
    The essential differences in the results in the several tables depend,
however, upon dissimilar geological conditions, which unequally affect
the    conductivity of the strata, and disturbing causes of different
orders.     In the mines the latter are —
    1. The currents established by ventilation and convection.
    2. The circulation of underground waters.
    3. Chemical reactions.
    4. The working operations.
And in artesian wells —
    1.  The pressure of the water on the thermometers.
    2.  Convection currents in the column of water.
    In the later experiments pressure has been thoroughly guarded
against, but against the subtle influence of the other causes, though
long    known, it is more difficult to guard.
     Goal Mines. — The author then proceeds seriatim with each subject,
commencing with coal mines.         In these he shows that ventilation and
convection currents have rendered many of the results uureliable, as
he shows to have been the case in the well-known instance of the
Dukinfield coal pit.        The circulation of air in coal pits varies from
5000 to     150,000 cubic feet per minute, and tables are given to show
 how this variously affects the temperature of the coal at different dis
 tances from the shaft though on the same level.          As a rule, the deeper
 the   pit the more active is the ventilation, and therefore the more
 rapid the cooling of the underground        strata.      In some pits the in-
 draughted     air has  been known   to form  ice, not    only in the shaft, but
 icicles in the mine near the shaft.
     The cooling effects of ventilation are shown to begin immediately
 that   the faces of the rock and coal are exposed, and as the hotter
 (and deeper) the pit, and the more gassy the coal, the more active is
 the ventilation,    so these surfaces rapidly undergo           a cooling until
 an equilibrium      is established between the normal underground
 temperature     and   the temperature of the air in the gallery.         Judg
 ing by    the effects of the diurnal variations on the surface of the
  ground,   it is clear that when there is a difference of 10° to 12° or
  more between the air in the gallery and the normal temperature              of
  the rock, an exposure even of a few days must tell on the surfaces
  of both coal and rock to the depth of the 3 to 4 feet — the usual depth
  of the   holes in which the thermometers are placed.          The designation
  of  "fresh open faces" is no security, as that may mean a day or a
  week, or more.     The author considers also that so far from the length
  and permanenoe of the experiment affording security, he is satisfied

164     Prof.  J. Prestwich.     Underground Temperatures,       [Feb. 12,
on the contrary that those experiments in which it is stated that the
thermometer has been left in the rock for a period of a week, a
month, or two years without any change of temperature, affords
prima facie evidence of error, inasmuch as it shows that the rock has
so   far lost heat as to remain in a state of equilibrium with the air
at the lower temperature in constant circulation.
    Another cause of the loss of heat which requires some notice is the
escape of the gas, which exists in the coal either in a highly com
pressed, or, as the author thinks more probable, in a liquid state. A
strong blower of gas has been observed to render the coal sensibly
cooler to the touch.    In another case whereas the temperature of the
coal at the depth of 1269 feet was 74° F., at the greater depth of
1588 feet in a hole with a blower of gas it was only 62°.         One wit
ness observed that " the coal gives out heat quicker than the rock.':
There is generally a difference of 2° or 3° between the two.
    On the other hand, the coal and rocks when crushed and in
"          "
   creeps acquire a higher temperature owing to the liberation of
heat by crushing.
    The effects of irregularities of the surface on the underground
isotherms, although unimportant in many of our coal-fields, produce
very decided results in the observations on the same level in the mines
among the hills of South Wales.       Sections are given to show how the
temperature rises under hills and falls under valleys, showing that it
is often essential to know not only the depth of the shaft but the
depth beneath the surface at each station where the experiments         are
made.
    The author therefore considers that to assign a value to an observa
tion we should know — 1. Height of pit above sea level. 2. The
exact mean annual temperature of the place.         3. Depth beneath the
surface of each station.      4. Distance of the stations from the shaft.
5. Temperature      and columns of air in circulation.       6. Length of
exposure of face.     7. Whether or not the coal is gassy.      The dip of
the strata and the quantity of water are also to be noted.
    Very few of the recorded observations come up to this standard,
and the author has felt himself obliged to make a very restricted
selection of cases on which to establish the probable thermometric
gradient for the coal strata.    Amongst the best observations are those
 made at Boldon, North Seaton, South Hetton, Rosebridge, Wakefield,
 Liege and Mons. These give a mean gradient of 49£ feet for each
ilegree F. The bore-holes at Blythswood, South Balgray, and Creuzot
give a mean of 50' 8 feet.
    Mines other than Ooal.—The causes affecting the thermal conditions
of these mines are on the whole very different to those which obtain
 in coal mines.    Ventilation affects both, but in very unequal degrees.
 In mineral mines it is much less active, and the cooling effects are

 1885.]                    Conductivity   of Rocks, fyc.                   Ifi5
proportionately      less.   On the other hand the loss of heat by the
underground       waters   in  mineral mines is very important. In some
mines in Cornwall, the quantity of water pumped up does not exceed
5 gallons, while in others it amounts to 200 gallons per minute.           The
Dolcoath mine used to         furnish half a million gallons of water in the
twenty-four      hours, while at the Huel Abraham mine it reached the
large quantity       of above 2,000,000 gallons daily.        The rainfall in
Cornwall is about 46 inches annually, and of this about 9 inches pass
underground.        In the Gwennap district, where 5500 acres were com
bined    for drainage purposes, above 20,000,000 gallons have been dis
charged in the twenty four hours from a depth of 1200 feet.               This
water issues at temperatures         of from 60° to 68°, or more than 12°
above    the mean of the climate, showing how large must be the abstrac
tion   of heat from the rocks through which the waters percolate.
   Hot    springs are not uncommon in these mines. They are due to
chemical decomposition,         and to water rising in the lodes and fissures
from    greater depths.      The decomposition which goes on in the lodes
near the    surface, and whereby the sulphides of iron and copper are
reduced    ultimately to the state of peroxides and carbonates of those
metals,    is a permanent cause of heat, especially apparent in the
shallower mines.        On the other hand, where the surface waters pass
rapidly through the rocks, they lower the temperature, and give too
low   readings.
   While ventilation,       therefore, reduces the rock temperature, the
water    which percolates through the rock, and more especially through
the  veins and cross-courses, sometimes raise, and at other times lower
the    temperature of the underground springs.           Mr. Were Fox, who
for many      years made observations on the underground temperature
of the Cornish         mines, gave the preference to the rocks, while
Mr. Henwood, an observer equally experienced and assiduous, con
sidered that the underground         springs gave surer results.    Both were
of  coarse   fully alive to all the precautions that in either     case it was
necessary to take to guard against        these causes of interference.
   Taking ten of the most reliable of Mr. Henwood's observations at
depths of from 800 to 2000 feet, the mean gives a thermometric
gradient of 42-4 feet       per degree, but Mr. Henwood himself gives us
the  mean     of 134 observations to the depth of 1200 feet, a gradient of
41o feet     to the experiments in granite, and of 39 feet to those in
slate.
   Taking the experiments of Mr. Fox in eight mineM, varying in
depth from 1100 to 2100 feet, the mean of the experiments made in
the rock give a gradient of 43'6 feet per degree.            The mean of the
two    observers give a gradient of 43 feet per degree.

   Artesian Wells and Borings. — This class of observations      presents
results  much     more  uniform,  and  whereas   the mines observations
were made, the one in crystalline, and the other in unaltered palaeo
zoic rocks, the wells are, with few exceptions, in the softer and less
coherent rocks either of Cretaceous, Jurassic, and Triassic age, which
are much more permeable, and, as a rule, much less disturbed.
   The causes of interference are mainly reduced to pressure on the
instruments    and convection currents.    The early experiments, where
no precautions were taken against these, are, with few exceptions,
uureliable, and must be rejected. The larger the bore-hole the greater
the risk of convection currents, and Professor Everett has shown
that in many cases of deep and large artesian borings, the water
which lodges in them is reduced to a nearly uniform temperature
throughout the whole depth by the action of these currents.        In the
deep boring at Sperenberg, before the introduction of plugs       to stop
these currents,   it was found that the temperature near the top of the
bore was rendered 4'5° F. too high, and at the bottom at a depth of
3390 feet, 4'6°, if not 6-7°, too high by the currents.
   Taking the bore-holes in which the water does not overflow, ami
where, owing to the precautions against these sources, such as those
of Kentish Town, Richmond, Grenelle, Sperenberg, Pregny, and Ostend,
we get a mean gradient of 51-9 feet per degree.
   Overflowing artesian wells should, if we were sure of all the con
ditions, give the best and most certain results.      Taking those where
the volume of water is large, and    the observations made by competent
observers, as in the case of the wells of Grenelle, Tours, Rochefort,
Mondorff, Minden, and others, we obtain a mean of 50'2 feet, or
taking the two sets of wells, of 51 feet per degree.
   The author, however, points out a source of possible error in those
wells, arising from a peculiarity of tubage which requires investiga
tion, and owing to which he thinks the water may suffer a loss of heat
in ascending to   the surface.
   With respect to the extra- European      wells,  more particulars are
required.    It may be observed, however, that the wells in the Sahara
Desert, which were made by an experienced engineer accustomed to
such observations, the mean of eleven overflowing wells, at depths of
from 200 to 400 feet, gave 36 feet per degree.
   Tunnels. — For the Mont Cenis Tunnel, allowing for the convexity
of the surface, Professor Everett estimates the gradient at 79 feet,
and for the St. Gothard, 82 feet per degree. But Dr. Stapff found in
the granite at the north end of the tunnel a much greater heat and
more rapid gradient, for which there seemed no obvious explanation.

Though this axis of the       Alps is of late Tertiary date, the author points
out that it cannot be due to the protrusion of the granite, as the
Swiss geologists have shown that the granite was in its present rela

axis of the Alps, and he suggests that the higher temperature may
be a residue of the heat caused by the intense lateral                pressure and
crushing of the rocks which accompanied that elevation, for in the
crushing of a rigid material such as rock, almost the entire mechanical
work reappears as heat.

 ated   with the mineral      mines is twice as great as that of the artesian
 wells class.      But all the experiments, with the exception of three
  or four, were made with blocks of dried rocks, and those shewed
  a very remarkable difference ; thus, for example, dry New Red Sand
  stone  gave l: 0 00250, whereas when wet         it was increased to     lc O'OOGOO.
  The   author remarks that as all rocks below the level of the sea and
  that  of the river valleys are permanently saturated with water, dry
  rocks are the exception, and wet rocks the rule in nature, consequently
  the inequalities of conductivity mnst tend to disappear.            The power of
  conduction is also greater along the planes of cleavage or lamination
  than across    them, and therefore the dip of the strata must also exer
  cise some  influence on the conductivity of different rocks and "massifs."
  With respect to the foliated and schistose rocks, M. Jannettaz has
  shown that the axes of the thermic curve along and across the planes
  of foliation and cleavage, are     in the following proportions       : —

he considers this   only an approximation to the true normal gradient,
and that the readings of the Coal-mines and Artesian-well experiments
are, owing to the causes he enumerates, still too high. He also dis
cusses   the question whether or not the gradient changes with the
depth. His own reduction of the observations gave no result, bnt he
points out that in all probability the circulation of water arising
from the extreme tension of its vapour is stayed at a certain depth ;
while as it is known experimentally that the conductivity of iron
diminishes rapidly as the temperature increases, this may possibly in
a different  degree apply to rocks.     If, therefore, there is any change,
these indications would be in favour of a more rapid gradient.
   Taking all these conditions into consideration, the author inquires
whether a gradient of 45 feet per degree may not be nearer the
true normal than even the one of 48 feet obtained           by the observa

III.   " On the Connexion between Electric Current and the
       Electric and Magnetic Inductions in the surrounding
       Field." By J. H. Poynting, M.A., late Fellow of Trinity
       College, Cambridge, Professor of Physics, Mason College,
       Birmingham.      Communicated by Lord Ratleigh, M.A„
       D.C.L., F.R.S. Received January 31, 1885.
                                (Abstract.)
   This paper describes a hypothesis as to tho connexion between
current in conductors and the transfer of electric and magnetic in
ductions in the surrounding field.     The hypothesis is suggested by the
mode of transfer of energy in the electromagnetic field, resulting from
Maxwell's equations investigated in a former paper (" Phil. Trans.,"
vol. 175, pp. 343 — 361, 1884).      It was there shown that according
to Maxwell's electromagnetic theory the energy which is dissipated in
the circuit is transferred through the medium, always moving perpen
dicularly to the plane containing the lines of electric and magnetic
intensity, and that it comes into the conductor from the surrounding
insulator, not flowing along the wire.
   Symbolising the nature of the induction by unit tubes drawn in the
direction of the induction in the usual way, i.e., so that there is unit
quantity of induction over every section of a tube, the electric induc
tion is equal to K x electric intensity -=-4^, and the magnetic induction
is equal to /t x magnetic intensity.    The electric induction is the same
                          "
quantity as Maxwell's displacement."           The hypothesis now made

 1885.]              Induction in   the  surrounding Field.               109
cousists in the supposition     that the electric and magnetic inductions
are     transferred   through the medium in a similar manner to the
energy, the     induction being regarded      as propagated   sideways rather
than along the       lines or tubes of induction.      The tubes of electric
induction     move in upon the wire containing       a current, and are there
broken up or dissolved, while the magnetic            tubes, which are ring-
shaped, contract upon the wire and finally           disappear, the places of
the tubes thus lost being supplied by fresh tubes sent out from the
seat of electromotive force.
    Examining the basis of Maxwell's electromagnetic theory, it is seen
to rest    on three principles, viz. : —
    I. The electric and magnetic energies are distributed through the
field   in  a manner     which can   be assigned.    Dividing the unit tubes
into unit cells by level surfaces drawn at unit differences of potential,
each electrical cell, according        to Maxwell, contains half a unit of
energy,     and each magnetic cell    — unit.
                                      Sir
    II. The line integral of the electric intensity round any closed
carve is     equal to the rate of decrease of the total magnetic induction
through the curve.
    III. The line integral of     the magnetic intensity round any closed
curve, is equal to 4w x the current through the curve.
    The second and third principles are modified in a manner suggested
by the supposed movement of the tubes of induction.
    II modified.    Whenever   electromotive force is produced by a change
in the    magnetic field or by motion of matter through the field, the
 E.M.F. per unit length, or the electric intensity, is equal to the
 number      of tubes of magnetic induction, cutting or cut by the unit
 length per second, the E.M.F. tending to produce induction in the
 direction in which a right-handed screw would move if turned round
 from the direction of motion, relatively to the tubes, to wards the
direction of the magnetic induction.
    This will give the result of       II above, if the quantity of magnetic
induction through a curve only alters by the movement of tubes in or
ont across the boundary.       Reasons for the supposition are given.
    III modified.      Using the term magnetomotive force, a term sug
gested     by Mr. Bosanquet, to denote the line integral of the magnetic
mtensity round the axis of a tube of induction, the third principle is
as follows : —
    Whenever magnetomotive force is produced by change in the electric
 field,  or by motion of matter through the field, the magnetomotive
 force   per unit length is equal to 4w x the number of tubes of electric
 mduction cutting or cut by unit length per second, the magnetomotive
 force tending to produce induction        in the direction in which a right-
 handed screw would move if turned round from the direction             of the

electric induction towards the direction of motion of the unit       length,
relatively to the tubes of induction.
     These principles are applied to special cases.
                A  Straight Wire carrying   a Steady Current.
     When a current C is in a wire, C induction tubes are supposed to
close in upon the wire per second, these being, as it were, broken tip
or dissolved, their energy appearing finally as heat.
     This accounts for the constancy of current at all parts of the
wire in the steady state, in so far as it reduces this constancy to a
particular case of the law, according to which there is the same total
induction over all sections of a tube.
    Also, since C tubes are broken up in the wire per second, and the
field is steady, C tubes must move inwards through any curve encir
cling the wire, and this will, by the third principle as modified, give
a line integral of magnetic intensity round the curve equal to 4nrC.
     Since the electric intensity is not produced by static charges, we
must suppose it due to the motion of magnetic tubes.          If E is the
electric intensity, E magnetic tubes must cut any unit length parallel
to the axis of the wire per second moving inwards.
    On the supposition that the tubes bring their energy in with them,
it is shown that the electric and magnetic tubes each account for half
the energy, so that we may suppose that the energy crossing any
surface is equally divided between the two kinds.
    On the supposition that the tubes can be identified throughout
their motion in the insulating medium, their velocities are calculated.
               Discharge of a Condenser through a Fine Wire.
    When the terminals of a charged condenser consisting of two
parallel plates are connected by a wire, the energy which was before
t  he discharge chiefly between the two plates, now appears as heat in
the wire.     The electric induction tubes are supposed to move out
wards from the space between the plates, keeping their ends upon the
plates or wires.     They finally converge upon the wire and are there
broken up.      The hypothesis is in accordance with the doctrine of
 closed currents.    For the total result is equivalent to the addition of
 so many closed induction tubes to the circuit, the induction running
 the same way relatively to the circuit throughout.        When the con
 denser is discharged by imperfect insulation of the dielectric, we may
 represent the process still as a closed current, the two parts of which
  are the loss of induction and its dissipation, but this is artificial, and
  it is more natural to look upon the process as a decay of induction
  without movement of fresh induction tubes inwards, and therefore
  without the formation of magnetic induction. This case is discussed
  at some length, as we can here realize what goes on at the source of

 1885.]                Induction in   the surrounding Field.                  171
energy, and the results suggest         that a similar action      occurs at the
source   of energy or seat of      E.M.F. in other   cases.
                       A Circuit containing a Voltaic Cell.
   The chemical theory of the cell is adopted.            It is first shown that
the difference of potential of the two terminals             in open circuit is
equal to the E.M.F. immediately after closure, because chemical action
will go on     charging the terminals, i.e., putting out energy into the
medium,     until any further charge would require more energy in the
medium than is supplied by the chemical action necessary, according
to Faraday's law of electrolysis.
   The level surfaces are discussed, and       it is supposed that the poten
tials  being in ascending order, zinc, copper, acid, all of the surfaces
pass between      the zinc and the acid, some of them bending round and
passing between the copper and acid, the rest going between the
terminals.      When the circuit is closed, tubes of electric induction,
running from acid to zinc, are supposed to diverge outwards             and close
in on the    rest of the circuit, there running in the opposite direction,
i.e., from copper to zinc.           A divergence of negative tubes being
magnetically equivalent        to  a convergence of positive tubes, the mag
netic relations of the circuit or the direction of the current will be the
same    throughout.       The tendency to a steady state is discussed. The
existence of charges in the circuit is taken to show that the tubes of
electric induction do not enter the wire at the same time throughout
the whole of their length.
      Current produced     by Motion of a Conductor    in a Magnetic Field.
   In this case     it is shown that according to the hypothesis we must
suppose    a  divergence of negative tubes from the seat of E.M.F.
            The General Equations of the Electromagnetic Field.
   The assumption that        if  we take any closed curve, the number of
tubes of magnetic induction passing through it is equal to the excess
of the number which have moved in over the number which have
moved out through the boundary since the beginning of the formation
of the field,    suggests a historical mode of describing the state of the
field at  any   moment.
   Taking L,M, N as the numbers of magnetic tubes which have cut unit
lengths of the axes through a point since the beginning of the system,
those being     considered positive which tend to produce positive electric
intensity, the equations a        =       —     and two others are obtained.

   The    author    having   previously shown (" Quarterly Journal of
Microscopical      Science,"  vol. xvi — New Series), that a laminated
appearance     is produced in hyaline cartilage by imbibition of nitrate
of   silver,  now   shows that the same lamellated structure may be
observed in sections of fresh cartilage stained by Bismarck brown,
and that the lamellae, as brought under observation by both methods,
have approximately the same thickness and general arrangement.
   It seems certain that the matrix of hyaline cartilage is formed by a
series  of lamellae   superposed over each other, their general arrange
ment    being parallel to the free surface of the cartilage.
   Adjoining the zone of ossification, the lamellae are seen to be very
distinctly   separated from each other, and at this part their continuity
is interrupted by the large spaces which correspond to the position of
the cells.

 I. "On a remarkable Phenomenon                of Crystalline Reflection.'
          By G. G. Stokes, M.A., Sec. R.S., Lucasian Professor of
          Mathematics in the University of Cambridge.              Received
          February 25, 1885.
                                 Introduction.
     In a letter to me, dated March       29, 1854,   the late Dr.  W. Bird
 Herapath enclosed for me some iridescent crystals of chlorate of
 potash, which he thought were worth my examination.              He noticed
 the intense brilliancy of the colour of the reflected light, the change
 of tint with the angle of incidence, and the apparent absence of
 polarisation in the colour seen by reflection.
     The crystals were thin and fragile, and rather small.      I did not  see
 how the colour was produced, but I took for granted that it must           be

 1885.]            Phenomenon     of Crystalline    Reflection.              175
 by some internal reflection, or possibly oblique refraction,            at the
 surfaces of the crystalline plates that the light was polarised and
 analysed,    being modified between polarisation and analysation             by
passage     across  the crystalline plate,   the  normal   to which I  supposed
must be sufficiently near to one of the optic axes to allow colours to
be shown,     which would require no great proximity, as the plates were
very thin.       To make out precisely how the colours were produced
seemed to promise a very troublesome investigation on account of the
thinness and smallness of the crystals : and supposing that the issue
of the investigation would be merely to show in what precise way the
phenomenon        was brought about by the operation of well-known
causes, I did not feel disposed to engage in it, and so the matter
dropped.
    But more than a year ago Professor E. J. Mills, F.R.S., was so good
as to send me a fine collection of splendidly coloured crystals of the salt
of considerable size, several of the plates having an area of a square
inch or more, and all of them being thick enough to handle without
difficulty. In the course of his letter mentioning the despatch of tho
crystals, Professor Mills writes: "They (the coloured crystals) are, I
am told, very pure chemically, containing at most 0-1 per cent. foreign
matter.
                                  ....
             They are rarely observed — one or two perhaps now and then,
in a large crystallisation                      I have several times noticed
that small potassic chlorate crystals, when rapidly forming from a
strong solution,     show what   I suppose    to be interference  colours  ; but
the   fully formed crystals do not show them."
   Some time later I was put into communication with Mr. Stanford,
of the North British Chemical Works, Glasgow, from which establish
ment the crystals sent me by Professor Mills had come. Mr. Stanford
obligingly sent me a further supply of these interesting crystals, and
was so kind as to offer to try any experiment that I might suggest as
to  their formation.
   I am informed that at the recent Health Exhibition a stand was
exhibited from the chemical works at Widnes, showing a fine collec
tion of brilliantly coloured crystals of chlorate of potash.          I did not
see  it.   It  would seem that the existence of these coloured crystals is
pretty generally known, but        I  have not seen mention of them in any
scientific journal, nor, so far as       I  know, has the subject been in
vestigated.
   On viewing through a direct-vision spectroscope the colours of the
crystals    which    I had just received from Professor Mills, the first
glance at the spectrum showed me that there must be something very
strange     and unusual   about the phenomenon, and determined me to
endeavour      to make out the cause     of the production of these colours.
The result of my examination         is described in the present paper.

176                Prof. G.'G. Stokes.      )9h a remarkable         [Feb. 26,
               Section  I. — Preliminary Physical Examination.
   1.  It will   be necessary to premise     that chlorate of potash belongs
to the oblique system of crystallisation.         The fundamental form may
be taken as an oblique prism on a rhombic base, the plane bisecting
the obtuse dihedral angle of the prism being the plane of symmetry,
liammelsberg denotes the sides of the prism by P, and the base by C,
and gives for the inclinations of the faces PP=104° 22' and CP=
 105° 35'.     The face C, which is perpendicular to the plane of sym
 metry, is so placed as to bring three obtuse plane angles together
at two opposite corners of the parallelopiped.         The salt usually forms
flat rhombic or hexagonal plates parallel to the C plane, the edges of
the rhombus being parallel to the intersections of the P faces by the
C plane, and the hexagons being formed from the rhombic plates by
truncating the acute angles by       faces parallel to the intersection of the
C plane by the plane of symmetry.
   The plane angles of the rhombic plates, calculated from the num
bers given by Rammelsberg, are 100° 56' and 79° 4', while the
hexagonal plates present end-angles of 100° 56' and four side-angles
of   129°-32'.    These angles are sufficiently different to allow in most
cases the principal plane of a plate, or even of a fragment of a plate,
to be determined at once by inspection.          But in any case of doubt it
may readily be found without breaking the crystal by examining it in
polarised light. There are good cleavages parallel to the two P planes
and to the C plane. The crystals are very commonly twinned, the
twin plane being C.
    2. If one of the brilliantly coloured crystals be examined by reflec
tion, and turned round in its own plane, without altering the angle of
i ncidence, the colour disappears twice in a complete revolution.          The
vanishing positions are those in which the plane of incidence is the
plane of symmetry.         The colour is perhaps most vivid in a perpendi
cular plane ; but for a very considerable change of azimuth from the
perpendicular plane there is little variation in the intensity of the
colour.    There is no perceptible change of tint, but on approaching
t he plane of symmetry       the colour gets more and more drowned in the
white light reflected from the surface.
   3. If instead of altering the azimuth of the plane of incidence a
plane be chosen which gives vivid colour, and the angle of incidence
be altered,     the colour changes very materially.       If we begin with a
small angle the colour begins to appear while the angle of incidence
is still quite moderate.       What the initial colour is, varies from one
crystal to another. As we increase the angle of incidence the colour
becomes vivid, at the same time changing,             and as we continue to
increase the angle the change of colour goes on. The change is
always in the order of increasing refrangibility ; for example, from

                     Phenomenon    of Crystalline  Reflection.             177
red    through green to blue.       Not unfrequently,    however, the initial
tint may be green        or blue, and on approaching      a grazing incidence
we may      get red or even yellow mixed with the blue, as        if  a second
order of colours were commencing.
   4.   The colours     are not in any way due to absorption ; the trans
mitted    light is strictly complementary to the reflected, and whatever
is missing in the reflected is found in the transmitted.             As in the
case of Newton's rings, the reflected tints are much more vivid than
the transmitted, though, as will presently appear, for a very different
reason.
    5.  As Dr. Herapath remarked to me long ago, the coloured light is
 not   polarised. It is produced indifferently whether the incident light
be common       light or light polarised in any plane, and is seen whether
 the reflected     light be viewed directly or through a Nicol's prism
turned in any way.          The only difference appears to be that if the
incident light be polarised, or the reflected light analysed, so as to
furnish or retain light polarised perpendicularly to the plane of inci
dence, the white light reflected from the surface, which to a certain
extent masks the coloured light, is more or less got rid of.
    6. The character of the spectrum          of the reflected light is most
remarkable, and was wholly unexpected.            A direct-vision hand spec
troscope was used in the observations, and the crystal was generally
examined in a direction roughly perpendicular to the plane of sym
metry ; but it is shown well through a wide range of azimuth of the
plane of incidence.        No two crystals, we may say, are alike as to the
spectrum     which    they show, but there are certain features common to
all.    The remarkable feature is that there is a pretty narrow band, or
it may be a limited portion of the.spectium, but still in general of no
great extent, where the light suffers total or all but total reflection.
 As the angle of incidence is increased, these bands move rapidly in
the direction of increasing refrangibility, at the same time increasing
in width.      The character of the spectrum gradually changes as the
angle of incidence is increased ; for example, a single            band may
divide into two or three bands.
    The bands are most sharply defined at a moderate                 angle of
incidence.      When the angle »f .incidence is considerably increased,
the bands usually get somewhat vague, at least towards the edges.
    7. The commonest kind of spectcum, especially in crystals prepared
 on a small scale, which will be mentioned         presently, is one showing
only a single bright band ; and        I will describe at greater length the
 phenomena presented in this case.
    When the angle of incidence is very small, the light reflected from
 the reflecting      surfaces of the crystal shows only a continuous
 sjiectrum.    As the angle of incidence is increased, while it is still
 quite moderate a very narrow bright band shows itself in some part

178                Prof. G. G. Stokes.        On a remarkable     [Feb.  26,
of the spectrum.          The particular part varies from one crystal     to
another    ; it may   be anywhere    from the extreme red to the extreme
violet.    It stands out by its greatly superior brightness on the
general ground of the continuous spectrum, and when it is fully
formed the reflection over the greater part of it appears to be total.
The appearance recalls that of a bright band such as the green band
seen when a calcium salt, or the orange band seen when a strontium
salt, is put into a Bunsen flame. The bright band is frequently
accompanied right and left by maxima and minima of illumination,
forming bands of altogether subordinate importance as regards their
illumination.       Sometimes these seem to be absent, and 1 cannot say
whether they are an essential feature of the phenomenon, which some
times fail to be seen because the structure on which the bands depend
is not quite regularly formed, or whether, on the other hand, they are
something depending on a different cause.
    Disregarding these altogether subordinate bands, and taking
account of the mean illumination, it seems as if the brightness of
the spectrum for a little way right and left of the bright band were
somewhat less than that at a greater distance.
    When the main band occurs at either of the faint ends of the
spectrum,     it is visible, by its superior brightness, in a region which,
as regards the continuous spectrum, is too faint to be seen, and thus
it appears       separated    from   the   continuous  spectrum  by  a  dark
interval.
    When the angle of incidence is increased, the band moves in the
direction of increasing refrangibility, and at the same time increases
rapidly in breadth.        The increase of breadth is far too rapid to be
accounted for merely as the result of a different law of separation of
the    colours,    which in a diffraction spectrum would be separated
approximately according to the squared reciprocal of the wave-length,
while in bands depending on direct interference the phase of illumina
tion would change according to the wave-length.
    8. The transmitted light being complementary to the incident, we
have a dark band in the transmitted answering to the bright band in
the reflected.      In those crystals in which the band is best formed, it
appears as a narrow black band even in bright light. When the band
first appears as we recede from a normal incidence it is extremely
narrow, but it rapidly increases in breadth as the angle of incidence
is increased.
    9. Some of the general features         of the phenomenon were prettily
shown in the following experiment         : —
    Choosing a crystal in which the bright band in the reflected light
began to appear, as the incidence was increased, on the red side of the
line D, so that on continuing to increase the incidence it passed
 through the place of the line D before it had become of any great

1885.]               Phenomenon    of Cryttalline  Reflection.             179
width,   I   viewed through the crystal a sheet of white paper illumi
nated by a soda flame.         A dark ring was seen on the paper, which
was circular, or nearly so, and was interrupted in two places at
opposite extremities of a diameter, namely, the places where the ring
was   cut by the plane of symmetry.         The light of the refrangibility of
D was so nearly excluded from the greater part of the ring that it
appeared nearly black, though slightly bluish, as it was illuminated
by the feeble radiation from the flame belonging to refrangibilities
other than those of the immediate neighbourhood of D. The ends
of the two halves of the ring became feeble as they approached the
plane   of symmetry. A subordinate comparatively faint ring lay in
this  crystal immediately outside the main one.
   10. Suspecting that the production of colour was in some way con
nected with twinning, I examined the cleft edge of some of the
crystals which happened to have been broken across, and found that
the bright reflection given by the exposed surface was interrupted by
a line, much finer than a hair, running parallel to the C faces, which
could be easily seen with a watchmaker's lens, if not with the naked
eye.    This line was dark on the illuminated bright surface exposed
by cleavage, a surface which I suppose illuminated by a source of
light not too large, such as a lamp, or a window at some distance.
The plane of incidence being supposed normal to the intersection of
the cleavage plane by the C faces, on turning the crystal in a proper
direction round a normal to the plane of incidence, the light ceased to
be reflected from the cleavage surface, and after turning through a
certain angle, the narrow line, which previously had been dark, was
seen to glisten, indicating the existence of a reflecting surface, though
it was much too narrow to get a reflected image from off it.               The
direction of rotation required to make the fine line glisten was what
it ought to be on the supposition that the fine line was the cleavage
face of an extremely narrow twin stratum.
   11. On examining the fine line under the microscope, it was found
to be of different thicknesses in different crystals, though in those
crystals which showed colour it did not vary very greatly.                  On
putting    a  little  lycopodium   on  the cleavage  face  interrupted by   the
fine line, it was seen that in those crystals which showed colour the
breadth of the twin stratum varied from a little greater to a little less
than the breadth of a spore. The thickness accordingly ranged some
where about the thousandth of an inch, such being the diameter of the
spores.     The stratum was visibly thicker in those crystals which
showed their bright band in the red than in those which showed it in
the blue.
    12. That the thin twin stratum was in fact the seat of the colour,
 admitted    of being proved by     a very simple  experiment.     It was suffi
 cient to  hold    a needle, or the blade of  a penknife   (I will suppose the

 180              Prof. G. (x. Stokes.    On a remarkable      [Feb. 26,
latter), close to or touching the surface of the crystal while it was
 illuminated by light coming approximately in one direction, suppose
 fi om a lamp, or from a window a little way off, and to examine the
 shadows with a watchmaker's         lens. The light reflected from the
 crystal   comes  partly  from  the upper surface, partly from the twin
 stratum, partly from the under surface, which, however, may be too
 irregular to give a good reflection.     The twin stratum is much too
thin to allow of separating the light reflected from its two surfaces in
an observation like the present, and it must therefore be spoken of as
simply a reflecting surface.
     Corresponding to the three reflecting surfaces are three shadows,
 where the incident light is cut off : (1) from the upper surface,
 (2) from the twin stratum, (3) from the under surface. Where the
 body casting the shadow is pretty broad in one part, as the blade of a
 penknife, the shadows in part overlap.      The shadows are arranged as
in the figure, where the numerals mark the streams of light reflected
from the portions of the field on which they are respectively written,
 1 denoting     the stream reflected from the upper surface, 2, that
reflected from the     twin stratum, 3, that reflected from the under
surface.
     Let the crystal show by reflection, at the incidence at which the
observation is made, say a green colour.       Then this green colour is
seen in the full field 123, though mixed with the white light reflected
from the upper surface.       The green is a good deal more vivid in the
field 23, as the reflection from the upper surface is got rid of. The
green is wholly absent from the fields 3, 0, 13, and 1. The field 3,
and perhaps also the field 13, may show a little of the complementary
red from transmitted light. The distinction between the fields 12 and
123 is not conspicuous, and often cannot be made out.       The distinc
tion, so far as it depends on the third shadow, is strongest between 3
and 0, and next to that between 13 and 1. We are not obliged,
however, to have recourse to the third shadow, which is often difficult
to see ; the first two are amply sufficient.
    Suppose we take a crystal which is broken at the edge so as to
expose a cleavage surface interrupted by the cleavage of the narrow

 1885.]           Phenomenon     of Crystalline Reflection.              181
 twin stratum.     The stratum usually lies a good deal nearer to one
 C face than the other. Now when the two faces are turned uppermost
alternately, and the distances between the first and second shadows
are observed, they are found to be, as nearly as can be estimated, in
the same proportion as the distances from the twin stratum to the
two faces   respectively.
     Again, one of the crystals showed the exposed section of the twin
 stratum slightly inclined to one of the broad faces, which though smooth
 to  the touch did not   give a perfect reflection of objects viewed in it.
 On holding different parts of the blade of a penknife opposite to
 different parts of this face, the distance between the first and second
 shadows was found to vary, as nearly as could be guessed, in pro
 portion to the thickness of crystal between the upper face and the
 twin stratum.
     The conclusion was confirmed by observations     made with sunlight     ;
 but the simple method of shadows is quite as good, and even by        itself
 perfectly satisfactory.
     13. Another useful method of observation, not so very simple as
the last, is the following. A slit, suppose horizontal, not very narrow,
is placed in front of the flame of a lamp at some distance, and an
image of the slit is formed by a suitable lens, such as the compound
achromatic objective of an opera-glass.       The crystal is placed so as to
receive in focus the image of the slit, being inclined at a suitable
angle, usually in a plane perpendicular to the plane of symmetry.
The eye is held in a position       to catch the reflected light, and the
images formed by the different reflections are viewed through a watch
maker's lens.     If the slit be not too broad, the images formed by
reflection from the upper surface, from the twin stratum, and from
the under surface are seen distinct from each other, so that the light
reflected from the twin stratum        may be studied apart from that
reflected from the upper and under surfaces.
    In this mode of observation it can readily be seen, by turning the
crystal in its own plane, and noticing the middle image, which is that
reflected from the twin stratum, how very small a rotation out of the
position   in which the plane of incidence had been the plane of
symmetry suffices to re-introduce the coloured light, which had
vanished in that critical position, which appears to be a position not
merely of absence of colour, but of absence of light altogether ; at
least if there be any it is too feeble to be seen in this mode of
observation, though from theoretical considerations we should conclude
that there must be a very little reflected light, polarised perpen
dicularly to the plane of incidence.
    14.  On allowing a strong solution      of chlorate of potash in hot
water to crystallise rapidly, in which case excessively thin plates are
formed in the bosom of the liquid, 1 noticed the play of colours by

 182               Prof. G. G. Stokes.      On a remarkable        [Feb.  26,
 reflection mentioned      by Professor   Mills as belonging  to the crystals
 in general at    an early stage of   their growth.   This, however,  proved
 to be quite a different and no doubt a much simpler phenomenon.
 The difference was shown by the polarisation of the light, and above
 all by the character of the spectrum of the light so reflected, which
 resembled ordinary spectra of interference, and did not present the
 remarkable character of the spectra of the peculiar crystals.
    15. When, however, the whole was left to itself for a day or so,
 among the mass of usually colourless crystals a few were found here
 and there which showed brilliant colours.          These colours were com
 monly far more brilliant than those of the crystals mentioned in         the
 preceding paragraph, and they showed to perfection the distinctive
 character of the spectrum of the peculiar crystals.          It would have
 been very troublesome, if possible at all, to examine the twinning of
 such thin and tender plates as those thus obtained by working on a
 small scale ; but the character of the spectrum, which is perhaps the
 most remarkable feature of the phenomenon, as well as the dependence
 of the colour on the orientation, may be examined very well ; and
 thus anyone can study these features of the phenomenon, though he
 may not have access to such fine coloured crystals as those sent me
by Professor Mills.
    16. A certain amount        of disturbance during the early stages of
 crystallisation, whether from natural currents of convection or from
 purposely stirring the solution somewhat gently so as not to break
the crystals, seems favourable to the production of the peculiar
crystals.     When the salt crystallised slowly from a quiet solution I
 did not obtain them.
    17.  As it is easy in this way, by picking out the peculiar crystals
from    several crystallisations, to obtain a good number of them, the
observer may satisfy himself as to the most usual character of the
spectrum.       It is best studied at a moderate incidence, as it is sharper
than when the incidence is considerable.          The spectrum most com
monly shows a single intensely bright band, standing out on the
general ground of a continuous spectrum of moderate intensity.
    A few cases seem worthy of special mention.         In one instance two
bright bands were seen, one at each faint end of the spectrum, some
what recalling the flame-spectrum of potassium salts. In another
case a red, a green, and a blue band were seen, reminding one of the
spectrum of incandescent hydrogen.           This crystal in air was nearly
colourless at moderate incidences, but showed red at rather high
incidences.      In another case the crystal was red of intense brilliancy
in the mother-liquor, but was colourless when taken out, even at high
incidences.      Presumably the stratum in this case was so thick that a
steeper    incidence   than could be obtained out of air was required to
develop colour.

 1885.]             Phenomenon     of Crystalline  Reflection.             183
     18. The number       of coloured crystals obtained by crystallisations
on a small scale,      though very small, it is true, compared with the
number of colourless ones, was still so much larger than Professor
Mills's description of the rarity of the crystals had led me to expect,
that I at one time doubted whether the simply twinned crystals which
are so very common, if taken at a period of their growth when one
component is still very thin, and of suitable thickness, might not
possibly show the phenomenon, though the thin twin was in contact
on one face only with the brother twin, the other face being in the
mother-liquor or in air. The circumstances of reflection and trans
mission at the first surface of the twin plate must be very different
according as it is in contact with the brother crystal, or else with the
mother-liquor, or air, or some other fluid ; and yet the peculiar
spectrum was shown all the same whether the crystal was in air, or
immersed in the mother-liquor, or in rock oil.             However, to make
sure of the matter I took a simply twinned crystal, and ground it at a
slight inclination to the C face till the twin piano was partly ground
away, thus leaving a very slender twin wedge forming part of the
compound       crystal, and polished the ground surface.        On examining
the   reflected light with a lens, no colour was seen about the edge of
the   wedge, where the thickness of the wedge tapered away to nothing ;
and that, although the bands seen near the edge in polarised light,
which was subsequently         analysed, showed that had colours been pro
ducible in this way as they are by a thin twin stratum, they would
not have been too narrow to escape observation.
    In another experiment a simply twinned crystal was hollowed out
till the   twin plane was nearly reached. The hollowing was then con
tinued    with the wetted finger, so as to leave a concave smooth surface,
 the crystal being examined at short intervals in polarised light as the
 work went on, so as to know when the twin plane was pierced.              But
 though     in this  case  the twin  plane formed   a secant   plane, nearly a
 tangent plane, to the worked surface, and near the section the twin
 portion of the crystal must have been very thin for a breadth by no
 means infinitesimal, as was shown by examination in polarised light,
 yet no   colours were seen by reflection.     I conclude therefore that the
 production of these colours requires the twin stratum to be in contact
 on both its faces with the brother crystal.
    19.  The fact that a single bright band is what most usually pre
 sents itself in the spectrum of the reflected light (though sometimes
 two or three such bands at regular intervals may be seen) seems to
 warrant us to regard that as the kind of spectrum belonging to the
 simplest form of twin stratum, namely, one in which there are just
 the two twin surfaces near together.         The more complicated spectra

fact in   some  of the crystals which showed the more complicated
spectra, and which were broken across, I was able to make out under
the microscope the existence of a system of more than two twin plans,
close together.    Restricting ourselves to what may be regarded as the
normal case, we have then to inquire in what way the existence of
two twin planes near together can account for the peculiar character
of the spectrum of the reflected or transmitted light.
        Section   II. — Of the Proximate    Cause of the Phenomenon.
   20. Though   I  am not at present prepared to give a complete explana
tion of the very curious phenomenon       I  have described, I have thought
it advisable to bring the subject before the Society, that the attention
of others may be directed to it.
   That the seat of the coloration    is in a thin twin stratum, admits    I
think of no doubt whatsoever.        A single twin plane does not show
anything of the kind.
   For the production of the colour the stratum must be neither too
thick nor too thin. Twin strata a good deal thicker than those that
show colour are common enough ; and among the crystals sent to me
I have found some twin strata which were a good deal thinner, in
which case the crystal showed no colour.
   The more complicated spectra which are frequently observed seem
referable to the existence of more than two twin planes in close
proximity. There is no reason to think that the explanation of these
spectra would involve any new principle not already contained in the
explanation of the appearance presented when there are only two twin
planes, though the necessary f ormulsa would doubtless be more com
plicated.
   Corresponding      to a wave incident in any direction, in one com
ponent of a twin, on the twin plane, there are in general two refracted
 waves in the second component in planes slightly inclined to each
other, and two reflected waves which also have their planes slightly
inclined to each other, the angle of inclination, however, being by no
means very small, as chlorate of potash is strongly double refractin .
The planes of polarisation of the two refracted waves are approxi
mately perpendicular to each other, as are also those of the two
reflected waves ; but on account of the different orientation of the
two components of the twin, the planes of polarisation of the two
refracted waves are in general altogether different from those of the
incident wave and of its fellow, the trace of which on the twin plane
would travel with the same velocity.          In the plane of symmetry at
any incidence, and for a small angle of incidence at any azimuth of
the plane of incidence, the directions of the planes of polarisation of
the two refracted waves agree accurately or nearly with those of the

 1885.]            Phenomenon    of Crystalline Reflection.            185
incident   wave and its fellow.     In these cases, therefore, an incident
wave would      produce hardly more than one refracted wave, namely,
that one which nearly agrees with the incident wave in direction of
polarisation. In these cases the colours are not produced. It appears,
therefore, that their production demands that the incident wave shall
be very determinately     divided into two refracted waves, accompanied
of course by reflected waves.
    It seems evident that the thickness of the stratum affects the result
through the difference of phase which it entails in the two refracted
waves on arriving at the second twin plane.           But whereas in the
ordinary case of the production of colour by the interposition of a
crystalline plate between a polariser and an analyser, we are concerned
only with the difference of retardation of the differently polarised
pencils which are transmitted        across the plate, and not with the
absolute retardation, it is possible that in this case we must take into
account not      only the difference of retardation for the differently
polarised pencils which traverse the stratum, but also the absolute
retardation ; that is, the retardation of the light reflected from the
second relatively to that reflected from the first twin plane.
    21. I have not up to the present seen my way to going further.      It
is certainly very extraordinary and paradoxical that light should suffer
total or all but total reflection at a transparent stratum of the very
 same substance, merely differing in orientation,      in which the light
 had been travelling, and that, independently of its polarisation.       It
can have nothing to do with ordinary total internal reflection, since it
 is observed at quite moderate incidences, and only within very narrow
limits of the angle of incidence.

I. " On the       Extraction of Uric Acid Crystals from the Green
       Gland of Astacus fluviatilis." By A. B. Griffiths, Ph.D.,
       F.C.S., Lecturer on Chemistry and Physics, Technical
       College, Manchester.           Communicated        by Sir RICHARD
       Owen, K.C.B.,      F.R.S.,   D.C.L. Received February 6, 1885.
   The so-called     green glands of the fresh water crayfish lie in the
cavity of the     head  below the front part of the cardiac division of the
stomach.       The openings of these organs are to be found at the base of
each   antenna.     The organ carefully      dissected out of the head of a
freshly    killed crayfish is seen to consist of two principal parts : an
uppermost one      which is a transparent and delicate sac-like body filled
with a clear fluid, and an underlying portion of a green colour,
glandular in appearance, containing granular cells.
   In 1848 Professors Will and Gorup-Besanez                 (see "Miinchen
Gelehrte Anzeigen," No. 233, 1848) said that this organ probably
contained guanin, and from this supposition this green gland has been
considered as a secretory organ.
   The secretion    of this gland is acid to litmus-paper, and on treating
the secretions    obtained from a large number of green glands with hot
dilute sodium hydrate solution, and then adding hydrochloric acid, a
slight  flaky precipitate was obtained, and on examining these flakes
under    the microscope they were seen to consist of small crystals in
rhombic plates.      On treating the secretion with alcohol, these rhombic
crystals   are deposited  ;  they are soluble in boiling water.
   When these       crystals are precipitated       from the secretion   and
moistened      with dilute nitric acid, allozanthine (CsH4N407) is pro
duced, and on heating this body gently with ammonia, reddish-purple

is obtained.   This murexide so obtained crystallises in prisms, which
by  reflected light exhibit a splendid green metallic lustre, and by
transmitted light are a deep reddish-purple.
   On running in a solution of potassium hydrate upon a microscopic
slide containing some of these murexide crystals they were dissolved.
From these reactions it is evident that these rhombic crystals are
deposits of uric add (C5H4N403) from the secretion of the green
gland of the crayfish.
   On examining the uric acid crystals (deposited from the secretion
by means of alcohol) under the microscope, they are seen to be
covered more or less with a very thin and superficial coating of some
brown colouring matter, probably some pigment.
   But, beyond this discovery of uric acid in the secretion of the
green gland of Astacus fluviatilis,            I
                                     have found that on treating the
secretion  with boiling hydrochloric acid a solutiou was obtained
containing in suspension flaky uric acid which was filtered off, and
on allowing the filtrate to cool a few crystals (guanin hydrochlorate)
separate which are soluble in hot water, and on the addition of
ammonia to this hot aqueous solution a precipitate is obtained of
guanin (C5H5N50), the precipitated guanin being made up of num
bers of minute microscopic crystals.  On running in warm dilute
nitric acid (upon the slide) these crystals disappeared, but were
precipitated again on adding a drop of silver nitrate in the form of
the nitrate of silver compound (C6H6N60,AgN03) of guanin.
  I  think this investigation proves that this so-called green gland of
Astacus fluviatilis is a true urinary organ, its secretion containing uric
acid and very small traces of the base guanin : the green gland              is,
therefore, physiologically the kidney of the animal.

rapidly up to about 400°, and remains approximately          constant
between 400° and 500° at 0'62.   If this number is multiplied by 9-1
it gives the atomic heat 5'64.   Glucinum, therefore, belongs to the
same class as carbon, boron, and silicon,   which agree with Dulong
and Petit's rule at high temperatures only.      And the true atomic

   Having lately completed an examination of a series of aconitines
from different sources,     kindly sent to me by Dr. Stevenson, Lecturer
on Chemistry and Medical Jurisprudence at Guy's Hospital, London,
I beg leave to offer the results to the Royal Society.
   The list of specimens, which was accompanied by remarks upon
them, is  the following : —
   No. 1. " Exotic aconitine, probably German, rather inert."
            " A fine specimen of crystallised aconitine,
   No. 2.                                                   special, prepared
by T. Morson and Son, 124, Southampton Row, London."
            " Aconitine, from
   No. 3.                       Burgoyne, Burbidges, and Co., 16, Coleman
Street, London."
   No. 4.   "Nitrate of aconitine."      (This specimen was accidentally
destroyed.)
   No. 5.   " Aconitine of uncertain source."
   Of these specimens only two, namely, No. 2 and No. 3, were found
to exhibit absorption-bands, and the corresponding curves were drawn
from  photographs of their spectra.
   Morson's fine specimen, the crystals of which were one and even two
millimetres in length, was found to absorb the rays at two points, the
two absorptions being equally strong.        It is noticeable that the most

 active aconitines appear to be those with the strongest absorption-bands,
 and of the commercial samples scarcely two yield the same absorption-
 spectra.     The variations in the curves indicate that not only may there
 be considerable differences in their composition, but also in their
 chemical constitution.
    Having prepared some of the tertiary bases in a state of great
 purity, it was considered desirable to examine the spectra transmitted
 by pyridine, piperidine, quinoline, tetra-hydro-quinoline, and quinoline
 hydrochloride. It was found that the addition of six atoms of hydro
 gen to pyridine, and four atoms of hydrogen to quinoline, caused the
 products to become more diactinic.             Hex-hydro-pyridine, otherwise
 piperidine,    shows no absorption-band, as was predicted.               Quinoline
 hydrochloride yields a spectrum differing from that of the base. Sub
 stitution products are less diactinic than the simple bases.
    As a study of these and similar bodies promises to lead to conclu
 sions apart from such as are of importance in this investigation, and
of interest in themselves, a detailed account will be reserved for the
 present.
    The position of the absorption-bands              occurring in the spectra
 transmitted by these tertiary bases may be stated in the following
 manner : —

unfortunately unfinished — of Hermann Kolbe, upon isatoic acid (Isato-

this paper, to infuse      into it the true meaning and spirit of the
deceased.     This difficult task has been made all the lighter for me
from my having had, at the time these investigations                were being

has made to us.      The concluding ones (also in italics) are taken from
remarks made by him which were plainly meant to form a part of this-
communication.

   notwithstanding that      so many facts have been collected with the object
of definitely settling the constitution of isatin, yet arguments of weight
sufficient to support a hypothesis of its rational constitution, or indeed to
raise it above the mere level
                                of a hypothesis, are still wanting.
    The property  of isatin of forming crystalline compounds with the alka
line bisulphites  led to the supposition  of its belonging to the class of alde
hydes or ketones; its property, when in contact with bases, of assimilating
the elements
                of water, and therewith forming isatic acid, from which

stronger acids regenerate isatin, placed it in analogy with oxindol or
cutnarin, fyc., which show a similar behaviour.
   These facts alone, as already remarked, were not sufficient upon which
to   build a solid hypothesis of the constitution of isatin.            That this has
nevertheless been attempted       simply proves how much the necessity was felt
of finding for isatin its proper place among those compounds to which it
is most nearly related.
             Oxidation of Isatin by Chromic Acid.            Isatoic Acids.
    The first experiments upon the oxidation of isatin, which led to the
discovery of the so-called isatoic acid, and also the behaviour of the
latter, have been already shortly detailed.*               Some of the statements
then made as to the supposed composition of the compounds derived
from that acid, require correction.              Since then isatoic acid and its
derivatives have been the subjects of careful investigation.
    If the supposition formerly expressed, viz., that isatin is a com
pound of formyl and nitrogen-benzoyl                  be correct, then one might
expect that it would, by suitable oxidation, be converted into a
carboxylic acid, according to the following equation : —
               (CO,C6H4N)COH + 0             =    (CO,CaH4N)COOH.
                Nitrogen-benzoyl formyl.       Nitrogen-benzoyl carboxylic acid.
   An acid of this atomic composition is in fact formed from isatin ;
this is the compound termed in the preceding communication Isatoic
acid, which name will be retained for it throughout this more com
plete paper.
    The isatin used for its preparation was made in part by myself, by
oxidising (natural) indigo by nitric or chromic acid, and partly pro
cured from Schuchardt (in Gfcirlitz) and from Kahlbaum (Berlin).t
    A solution of chromic acid in acetic acid has shown itself to be
the only suitable oxidising agent for the conversion of isatin into
isatoic acid.        The following mode of procedure, the result of many
trials, has been found to be the best. About 600 grams of glacial
acetic acid (the half of the total quantity to be used), are poured over
100 grams of finely powdered isatin placed in a large flask.                       The
chromic acid (200 grams) is brought, in moderate portions at a time
(each time about one- sixth of the total quantity), into a funnel loosely
stoppered by means of a glass rod, and a part of the remaining
600 grams of acetic acid poured over it ; by lifting up the glass rod,
   •  " Journ. fur Prakt. Chem." [2],    30, 84, and 124.
   t  The  fact, perhaps  already observed   by other chemists, that the isatin got with
<hromic acid is darker than that got with nitric, is explained by the tenacious
adhesion to the first of small quantities of chromic oxide ; by dissolving this pre
paration in hot caustic soda solution and precipitating the filtrate by dilute sul
phuric acid, absolutely pure isatin is obtained from it.

 the solution is allowed     to flow slowly into the mixture of isatin and
acetic acid, which thereby becomes heated.           As soon as the slightest
ebullition is noticeable, the flask must be cooled by ice-water.        After
the mixture has become quite cold, the process is repeated          as above,
 with frequent shaking,      care being taken that the temperature does
not rise above 50°, as otherwise       the product undergoes partial decom
position.
    After each addition of chromic acid, the colour of the liquid, at
first red, becomes darker ; when about the half of the chromic acid
has been    added, a brown flaky substance begins to separate out, the
quantity of which      goes on increasing, and before the whole has been
run in, the bottom     of the flask is seen to be coated with a dirty grey
layer.     After   the addition of all the chromic acid and acetic acid,
the flask, with its dark-brown coloured contents, is allowed, after
frequent shaking, to stand in cold water for 12 hours.           Should this
he neglected, the liquid becomes heated again of itself (the reaction
not being yet at an end), and this must be avoided, as it is accom
panied by partial decomposition.
   At this stage the product contains as yet no isatoic acid. To com
plete the oxidation, the flask with its muddy contents is now allowed
to stand for some hours in water, kept at 40° to 50° ; a higher tem
perature is hurtful.       The contents thus undergo a distinct change ;
the brown flakes vanish, a crystalline substance taking their place,
and the liquid finally acquires the deep green colour of acetate of
chromium.       The product is lastly heated for several hours at about
60° ; during this stage isatoic acid separates out in the form of a
yellow crystalline powder.
    To make this separation as far as possible complete, the whole is
 poured into 500 c.c. of extremely dilute sulphuric acid ; the precipi
tate thus got, after being washed with cold water with the aid of a
filter-pump, and spread out on paper to dry, is almost quite pure isatoic
acid.    The yield from 100 grams isatin is 80 grams, i.e., 72 per cent.
of the calculated amount.          It is finally obtained absolutely pure by
one crystallisation from boiling acetone.          Other solvents are unsuit
able for the purification of isatoic acid ; water, which, even when warm,
dissolves it with difficulty, causes decomposition, with evolution of
carbonic acid.      Ethyl and methyl alcohols etherify at the boiling
temperature     a part of the isatoic acid, as may be easily recognised from
the agreeable odour which the crystals acquire.             Even the minute
quantities of methyl alcohol which acetone contains show their pre
sence in this way.
    Isatoic acid crystallises from hot acetone (of which about 23 parts at
the boiling temperature        are required for the solution of 1 part of
acid) in hard yellow prisms, which appear to be almost rectangular ; it
 melts at 230°, with decomposition,           carbonic acid being given off,

   Adopting my idea of the composition of isatin, the process of its
oxidation by chromic acid when the above conditions are observed
proceeds, therefore, in this way, that the formyl of the isatin is
changed to carboxyl, whereby nitrogen-benzoyl         carboxylic acid is
formed.   (See Equation, p. 194.)
   The chemical behaviour of isatoic acid, so far as I have studied                it,   is
in complete harmony with the supposition that           nitrogen-benzoyl
                                                       it   is
carboxylic acid. Of special importance for the right interpretation                      of
its chemical constitution are its close relations to anthranilic acid, i.e.,
o-amidobenzoic   acid.   It   isreadily and completely changed into the
latter (or its derivatives)    by various reagents, carbonic acid being
separated and the elements of one molecule of water assimilated.
This transformation of isatoic acid into anthranilic acid shown        is                by
the following equation — :
           (C6H4N,CO)COOH       +   H20 = (C6H4NHa) COOH           +   C02.
   The two atoms of hydrogen of the water combine with the atom                          of
nitrogen, which thereby becomes trivalent to amide the oxygen atom
                                                             ;

                         Action of Water on Isatoic Acid.
    As already mentioned, isatoic acid undergoes decomposition by pro
longed      boiling with water, carbonic acid being evolved.         The dark-
coloured powder which separated out on cooling,                 yielded, after
crystallisation from alcohol of 50 per cent., beautiful needles of
anthranilic acid (melting point 145°), from which, by solution in
hydrochloric acid, the characteristic compound of the latter with
anthranilic acid, melting at 191°, was obtained.
                Behaviour of Isatoic Acid towards Mineral Acids.
    If  isatoic acid be gently warmed with ordinary strong hydrochloric
 acid,  decomposition with foaming (evolution of carbonic acid) ensues;
 the crystalline      mass obtained on evaporation is again dissolved in
 hydrochloric acid, in order to destroy all the isatoic acid. The residue,
 after solution in water, yields, on cooling, colourless prisms of the
 hydrochloric-anthranilic acid, containing one molecule of water.

   The transformation     of the isatoic acid into the hydrochloric-
 anthranilic acid is complete, as given by the above equation, in which
 the hydrochloric acid, as taking part in the reaction, must be in
 cluded.
   Tolerably concentrated sulphuric acid acts upon isatoic acid in
exactly the same way as hydrochloric acid does ; the product is the
sulphuric-anthranilic acid, which can in this way be easily got beau
tifully crystallised in large quantities. The anthranilic acid separated
from        it gave an analysis corresponding to its composition.
   Dilute nitric acid acts upon isatoic acid in a manner analogous to
the above two acids, while concentrated turns it into a nitro-deriva-
tive which is described below.
   Hydrochloric acid gas, acting upon the alcoholic solution of isatoic
acid, decomposes it in such a manner that carbonic acid escapes,
while the ethyl ether of anthranilic acid is formed. Hydrochloric acid
gas was led to saturation, with gradual warming, into alcohol hold
ing finely-powdered isatoic acid in suspension ; the resulting clear
solution solidified, on cooling, to a mass of pale-yellow needles, which,
after washing with alcohol or, better, ether, were analysed. The

    This compound is only slightly soluble in cold alcohol, and not at
all in ether. It melts at about 170°, and can be sublimed by cautious
heating, but not altogether without decomposition.        When brought
in contact with water, hydrochloric-anthranilic ether is decomposed
into its constituents ; the oil which here separated out, and which after
washing with water and drying over chloride of calcium, was dis
tilled, is the ethyl ether of anthranilic acid, a strongly refracting
liquid boiling at about 260°.

                         Action of Bases upon Isatoic Acid.
    Basic    substances decompose isatoic acid likewise with evolution of
carbonic acid      ; since this takes place even at a low temperature, it
has not been found possible to prepare salts of isatoic acid, as these
undergo immediate decomposition into salts of carbonic and of anthra
nilic acids.*
    Isatoic acid, when heated with baryta- water, yielded besides car
bonate      of baryta the salt of anthranilic acid, which was extracted by
saturating the solution with acetic acid and then shaking up with
ether ; its melting point, as well as that of its hydrochloric acid com
pound, conclusively proved that it had been formed.
    The action     of ammonia       on isatoic acid is to this extent different, that
not the      ammonium       salt of anthranilic acid, but its amide, which, so
far as my knowledge goes, is not yet known, is formed.
    Isatoic acid is readily taken up by aqueous ammonia ; the solution
immediately contains carbonate of ammonia, and after some time
solidifies to a mass of         yellow crystals, which, after being redissolved
 in hot   water, separate out from the latter in glancing mother-of-pearl
 plates ; the mother-liquor yields, on evaporation, a further quantity.
 This compound, which is extremely soluble in warm water and in
 alcohol,    melts at 108°, and distils, with slight decomposition, towards
 300°.     Chloroform is a capital solvent for it, and from this it crystal
 lises in large white plates ; it is difficultly soluble in ether and hardly
 at  all in benzol.

   A   solution of caustic soda converts anthranilic amide slowly and
hydrochloric acid very quickly, into anthranilic acid (or its salts).
   The same conversion of isatoic acid into this amide is brought about
by the action of ammonia gas on the dry (isatoic) acid ; at about 60° a
vigorous action, with strong foaming, begins, and in a short time the
whole is converted into anthranilic amide.                 The formation of the
latter in this, as well as in the preceding case, is seen by the following
equation      : —
               (C6H4N,CO)COONH4           = C6H4NH2,CONH2 + C02.
          Ammonic isatoate 0ivpothetical).         Anthranilic amide.
   Anilin acts upon isatoic acid in an analogous manner to ammonia.
A mixture of equivalent molecules of both was warmed to 60°, at
which     temperature the action, under strong foaming,* began and
completed itself.        The resulting clear solution solidified on standing
for a short time, to a mass of glancing plates ; these crystals, after
being pressed and washed with a little dilute hydrochloric acid, to
free them from any adhering aniline, separated out from solution in
benzol,     in which they         are difficultly soluble, in white        colourless
needles    melting at 130°.

Addition of water to the solution of the acid in alcohol, or in the
mixture of alcohol and acetone, precipitates it.
   The chemical behaviour* of nitro-isatoic acid corresponds generally
with that of isatoic acid, the former being however more stable towards
water, acids, &c., than the latter. Just as isatoic acid yields with those
reagents anthranilic acid, so does the nitro-derivative give a nitro-
anthranilic acid, which corresponds with one of the two known com
pounds of this composition, and therefore explains the function of the
nitroxyl in the original nitro-isatoic acid.
   If the latter be evaporated along with aqueous hydrochloric acid,
carbonic acid is evolved ; the residue (which contains no hydrochloric
acid in chemical combination)            yields, upon recrystallisation      from
alcohol, a strong acid which forms yellow needles, is difficultly soluble
in water, easily in alcohol and ether, and not at all in chloroform and
benzol ; it melts between 265° and 270° with decomposition.
   The same acid is formed, although more slowly, by the continued
boiling of a mixturo of water and nitro-isatoic acid. As is shown by
the properties of the product — as given above — but especially by the
composition of the baryta salt prepared from it (see the analysis of
the same below), we have here to do with the nitro-anthranilic acid
already obtained in a different way by Hiibnerf and by Griess,J the
so-called    m-nitro-o-amidobenzoic     acid or (e-nitro-amidobenzoic       acid).
   The barium salt prepared from the above by means of baryta
water, precipitation of the excess of barium by carbonic acid, and
 evaporation of the filtrate, crystallises in sharp reddish-yellow needles.
According to the analysis, it is nitro-amidobenzoateof barium +3 mol.

                           Reduction of Nitro-Isatoic Acid.
   On treating nitro-isatoic acid with tin and tolerably concentrated
hydrochloric acid, with gentle warming, much carbonic acid besides
hydrogen escaped, which led one to suppose that a reduction product
of the above nitro-amidobenzoic            acid was formed, and this was verified
by the    examination of the resulting solution.             In this there was con
tained the hydrochloric acid salt of a diamidobenzoic acid, which, from
its relation to the above nitroanthranilic acid, may be termed amido-
anthranilic     acid.    Its formation is shown by the following equation : —

    The above solution was first freed         from tin by means of sulphuretted
 hydrogen,     and     then,   in order   to  prevent decomposition setting in
during the subsequent evaporation, a few crystals of acid sulphite of
soda were added.*           Notwithstanding this, the solution became brown-
 coloured,   and deposited, when sufficiently concentrated, a salt likewise
 dark   in colour, which after pressing was recrystallised from hot water
 containing a     little hydrochloric acid.        The pale-yellow salt thus got,
 crystallising     in small prisms, has the composition of hydrochloric-
 diamidobenzoic       acid   : C6H3(NH2)2COOH.2HCl.

  Attempts to isolate the free diamidobenzoic acid from the above

crystallises free of water, and which is also obtained direct from the

 The formation of a-nitrosalicylic acid from isato acid, as described
above, is easily explained upon the supposition that the anthranilic
acid (amidobenzoic acid) generated from the latter is nitrated by the
nitrous acid, and that in this nascent nitro-amidobenzoic                     acid the
amide is replaced by hydroxyl.

    The foregoing research explains the behaviour of isatoic acid sub
stantially only in one direction.           Other experiments are now being
made, by means of which the changes induced in this compound by
 suitable   oxidising and reducing agents are to be made clear, in order
thereby to      gain new foundations for the right perception of the
 chemical constitution of isatin and compounds derived from it.
    We possess      in  the substance   obtained  by the oxidation   of indigo, and
 named by me      isatoic acid, a nitrogen compound which seems to be specially
fitted to shed    light upon the question whether nitrogen can act not only as
 a di-, tri-, tetra-, and penta-valent element (as in nitric oxide, ammonia,
 nitrous acid, and nitric acid), but also as a monovalent one. The mode of
formation and the chemical behaviour of this isatoic acid gain
                                                                            — through
 the conception that      it is benzoylcarboxylic acid, in which     one of the five
 phenyl hydrogen atoms is replaced by an atom             of  monovalent      nitrogen,
 and through the further supposition that isatin is its corresponding alde
 hyde —such a simple and, from all points of view, satisfactory explana
 tion, that only one already prejudiced by the idea tha t nitrogen can only be
 trivalent can    feel himself satisfied by the supposition that the molecular
 weight of   isatoic   acid must be doubled, i.e., that it is a dibasic acid. None
 of the facts which up till now       I  have discovered support this hypothesis ;
 on the contrary, by the supposition that isato           acid contains 1 atom of
 monovalent    nitrogen as substitute for 1 atom of hydrogen, they all obtain
 the simplest and least strained explanation in such a degree that, in the
 publication of my research on isatin and isatoic acid and their derivatives,
 I have    not discussed       the question whether the    nitrogen in them          may
 possibly be   polyvalent.
    N.B. — Benzoyl carboxylic acid is usually termed phenyl glyoxylio
 acid, so that        nitrogen-benzoyl     carboxylic acid = nitrogen- phenyl
 glyoxylic    acid.

        The existence       of this phenomenon has been a matter of doubt ever
since         the   year   1831, and the question
                                          has been examined by many
investigators.             In
                    the present paper are described a series of methods-
 by means of which its reality has been determined.        Other methods
are given for measuring     the amounts of such " resistance," either
collectively at the two electrodes of an electrolytic cell, or separately
at      each          Modes of obviating the interference of polarisa
                electrode.
tion, and  of securing success in the measurements, are also described.
  The influence of various circumstances upon the phenomenon were
investigated, viz., strength and density of current total resistance       ;                       ;
density of current and size of electrode  composition of the electrolyte
                                                           ;                                       ;
strength of ditto      combined electrolytic cells
                                ;                     temperature     and
                                                                       ;                   ;
chemical corrosion.    The relations of the phenomenon to size of plate
   voltaic cells, to the positive and negative plates respectively, and
to in
   strength of current in those cells, were also examined, and the
results are given.
       following are the chief facts established by this research —
        The                                                                                    :

 in     different cases, exists at the surfaces                of mutual     contact of metals-
 and       liquids in electrolytic and voltaic cells.                That this " resistance"

  varies largely in amount with different metals in the same solution,
  and with the same metals in different solutions ; in dilute solutions of
  mineral   acids of different strengths, or of different temperatures, and
  is usually small with easily corrodible metals which form quickly
  soluble salts, and large with those which are not corroded ; and is dis
  guised in the case of those which by corrosion form insoluble salts.
     The results of the experiments also show that the same voltaic
 current was " resisted " in different degrees by every different metal
  when employed as an anode, and when used as a cathode ; also by
  the same metal when used as an anode and cathode respectively ; and
 that the proportions of such "resistance" at an anode and cathode
 of the   same metal, varied with every different metal in every different
  electrolyte (and strength of electrolyte), and at every different tem
  perature ; and that the resistance at the anode was usually smaller
 than that at the cathode ; in some cases, however, where a film was
 formed upon the anode, an apparently reverse effect occurred ; that
 a current from a given positive plate of a voltaic cell was differently
 resisted by every different metal used as a negative plate in that cell ;
 and that by rise of temperature " transfer-resistance " was usually
 and considerably reduced.
                                                                "
    They further show that this species of " resistance           was largely
 reduced by increasing the strength of current ; and was thus con
spicuously distinguished from ordinary conduction-resistance of the
 electrolyte.    In consequence of this effect, " transfer-resistance " was
 greatly influenced by every circumstance which altered the ordinary
 resistance, and thereby the strength of current. The usual effect of
 diminishing the density of current alone, by enlarging both the elec
 trodes and keeping the strength constant, was to diminish the
 " transfer-resistance ;" and of
                                     enlarging one only, was to diminish it
at that electrode and increase     it at the other, the effect being   greatest
at the altered electrode ; but the influence of density was very much
 smaller than that of strength of current. The current was usually less
" resisted," and larger with a small
                                            positive plate and a large nega
tive one, than with those sizes reversed. Alterations of size or kind
of metal at one plate of an electrolytic or voltaic cell affected the
" transfer-resistance " at the other,
                                              by altering the strength and
density of the current.
    "Transfer-resistance,"     therefore,   appears to vary, not only with
every physical and chemical change in the metals and liquids, but
also with every alteration in the current.         Such " resistance " throws
light upon the relative functions of the positive and negative plates
of voltaic cells, and illustrates the comparatively small influence of the
negative one in producing strength of current.          Nearly all these con
clusions are based upon results           represented  by average     numbers
obtained by series of experiments.

II. " Note on Rev. Robert Harley's paper, ' Professor Malet's
         Classes of Invariants identified with Sir James Cockle's
         Criticoids."      By John     C. Malet.      Received March         7, 1885.
    In                               " On a Class of Invariants "
          1882, a paper of mine                                         appeared in
          Philosophical Transactions," in which I used, for the determina
the
       "
tion of theorems, two classes of functions of the coefficients of linear
differential      equations.     In consequence of     a communication      from the
Rev. Robert        Harley, I appended to the paper the following note : —
    " Since the
                     publication of the abstract of this paper, the Rev. R.
Harley has mentioned to me that the first class of functions treated
of here have [has] been already investigated               by Sir James Cockle;
having consulted the memoirs I was referred to by Mr. Harley,                       I
think little similarity will be found between Sir James Cockle's
results and mine.        — J. C. M."
    One omission         I certainly made,* through ignorance, in this note,
and     I  regret it ;  I did  not notice that the second class of functions had
also been treated of by Sir James Cockle ; this omission, however,
appears to me to be a slight one, for anyone treating of the first class
would almost as a matter of course be led to treat of the second also,
and the existence of the functions is so obvious as hardly to need
proof, and the determination            of them was with me a process of cal-
cnlation carried on as far as was necessary for the purposes of my
 paper.
    As far as concerns the mere existence of these functions, certainly

III.   " The   '
                 Paralytic Secretion of Saliva." By J. N. Langley,
                             '
       M.A., F.R.S., Fellow and Lecturer of Trinity College,
       Cambridge.         Received March 16, 1885.
   It was shown by Claude Bernard that section of the chorda
tympani nerve in the dog, causes, after an interval of about twenty-
four hours, a slow " paralytic " secretion of saliva from the sub
maxillary gland      ;  the secretion   continues     for several weeks, and is
accompanied by         a  gradual   diminution      in  the size of the gland.
Heidenhain confirmed these observations, and he found further that
the effect was not confined to the gland on the side of the body on
which the nerve had been cut, but extended also to the corresponding
gland of the opposite side of the body, so that section of either chorda
tympani nerve caused a continuous secretion from both sub-maxillary
glands.     Since Heidenhain's paper in 1868, nothing has, so far as I
know, been published on this subject.                I  purpose to give a brief
account of some observations which were made by me several years
ago, and which may serve to recall attention to certain curious facts
touching both nerve and gland physiology.
    Since the secretion, which takes place on the side of the body on
which the nerve is cut, is called the " paralytic " secretion, we will call
the corresponding secretion, which takes place on the opposite side
of the body, the " anti-paralytic," or more briefly the "antilytic"
secretion.*
   I  will consider first the paralytic and antilytic secretions during
the first day or two of their occurrence.                 During this time the
   * A fuller account will be published in the forthcoming number of the " Journal
of Physiology."

1885.]               The " Paralytic      Secretion of Saliva.            213
paralytic secretion is stopped for several hours at least, by cutting
the sympathetic        nerve-fibres running to the gland ; the antilytic
secretion is made slower by cutting the chorda tympani, and is
stopped by       cutting, in addition, the sympathetic fibres on the carotid,
that is, the secretion ceases      in each case when the nervous connexions
between the gland and the central nervous system are severed.
From this it follows that the paralytic secretion in its early stage is
caused by nervous impulses passing from the central secretory centre
down the sympathetic nerve to the gland, and that the antilytic
secretion is similarly caused by nervous impulses sent out from the
central secretory centre, but passing in part down the chorda tympani
nerve which is here intact.
     Since the paralytic secretion is more copious than the antilytic
secretion, it follows that the nervous impulses sent out by the secre
tory centre on the side of the body on which the chorda tympani is
cut, are of greater intensity than those sent out by the secretory
centre of the opposite side.         Thus, section of one chorda tympani is
 followed by a change in the central secretory centre of such a nature,
that it continuously sends out nerve-impulses tending to produce a
 secretion from the sub-maxillary glands ; the change, however, is not
equal on the two sides, but is more profound on the side of the body
 on   which the chorda tympani has been cut.
     That the central nerve-cells concerned in producing the secretion
 are not in their normal condition, can be shown in another way.            It
 is well known that in a normal animal, dyspnoea causes, when the
 chorda tympani nerve is intact, a secretion of saliva from the sub
 maxillary gland.        Now, in the stage of the paralytic and antilytic
 secretion    spoken of above, when they are produced by stimuli sent
 out by    the central nervous system, dyspnoea causes a much more rapid
  flow of saliva, and causes it sooner than it does normally; moreover,
  the effect of dyspnoea is greater on the paralytic than on the anti
  lytic secretion.     Hence, then, section of one chorda tympani causes
 an    increase of irritability in the central secretory centre, the increase
  of  irritability being greater on the side of the body on which the
 chorda tympani       nerve has been cut.
      Since  a venosity of blood greater than normal, will, in a normal
  animal, serve as a stimulus to the central nerve-cells, and cause a flow
  of saliva, it is probable that if the irritability of the nerve-cells be in
  creased, the normal venosity of the blood will serve as a stimulus to
  the   nerve-cells, and cause a flow of saliva.      Hence  I think it is not
  uureasonable     to suppose that the paralytic and the antilytic secretions
  in their early stages are essentially similar to the dyspnoea secretion
   of the normal animal, and that they are proximately caused by the
   central nerve-cells,     in their state of increased irritability, being
   stimulated by the blood supplied to them.        This view is confirmed by

                                  Mr.  J. N. Langley.                      [Mar.   19,
the effect of apnoea ; during apnoea both the paralytic and the anti-
lytic secretions stop.
    The antilytic secretion is, as far as I have observed, solely of
central origin, since it ceases on severing the nerves connecting the
gland with the central nervous system ; according to Heidenhain,
however, it continues after the nerves have been severed.
    The paralytic secretion is only in its early stage of central origin,
very soon local changes come into play, rapidly increase in intensity,
and continue long after the central changes have ceased to be effective
to produce a secretion. Thus, then, the paralytic secretion in its later
stages continues undiminished after section of all the sympathetic
fibres running to the gland.            When the chorda tympani and sympa
thetic fibres are simultaneously cut, the paralytic secretion which
follows is of course of local origin only. There are two ways in which
the secretion of local origin might be brought about, either by a change
in the gland-cells of such a nature that in their abnormal nutritive con
ditions they secrete continuously, or by a change in a local secretory
centre analogous to that which takes place in the central secretory
centre. Heidenhain is inclined to adopt the former view, and, on
general grounds, it does not seem to me unlikely that gland-cells, nor
mally secreting in response to nervous impulses only, should in certain
circumstances secrete continuously without such impulses ; but in
 this particular case there are I think fair grounds for believing that
the secretion is caused by nervous impulses sent out by a local se
cretory centre.
    These grounds       I  will briefly   state.   On the course of the nerves
between the lobes and lobules of the gland there are many nerve-
 cells. It is highly probable that some at any rate of these nerve-cells
 are connected with the secretory nerves, since the chorda tympani
 nerve- fibres, unlike the nerve-fibres of the skeletal muscles and those
 sweat glands, degenerate very slowly after severance from the central
 nervous system.         In the cat the chorda tympani fibres on the duct,
 near its entrance into the sub-maxillary gland, produce a secretion
 when stimulated, two to three weeks after the nerve trunk has been
 cut.*
     Further, the secretion of local origin is increased by dyspnoea, is
 stopped by apnoea, and by anaesthetics when given in considerable
 excess.     That is, the paralytic secretion, when it is produced by
    * Pilocarpin causes a secretion for more than six weeks after section of the chorda
 tympani, but no conclusion with regard to the condition of the nerves can at present
 be drawn from this, since it is possible that pilocarpin acts directly on the gland-
 cells.
    During the paralytic secretion produced by section of the chorda tympani,
 stimulation of sympathetic nerve causes a flow of saliva very much as if the gland
 were normal.

 1885.]              The " Paralytic" Secretion of Saliva.                 215
changes    occurring locally, is affected      by dyspnoea,    by apncea,  and
by anaesthetics    in the  same way as    it is when produced by nervous
impulses sent out from the central secretory centre        ; and this strongly
suggests   that the secretion in the former       case also is brought about
by nervous impulses, proceeding       in this instance from a local secretory
centre.
   I conclude,   then, that section of the chorda tympani causes an in
crease  in irritability, both in a central and in a local secretory centre,
during which increase of irritability the blood passing through the
centre serves as an effective stimulus.        The central centre in no very
long time recovers its normal state, the local centre does not.           Pro
bably it and the gland eventually atrophy unless the chorda tympani
regrows.
   Although     the secreting   cells of the sub-maxillary gland steadily
diminish    in  size  during  the  paralytic secretion, they undergo only
slight histological changes ; they become somewhat more mucous. The
demilune cells and the serous cells, which are present in considerable
number in the sub-maxillary gland of the cat, do not show any
obvious change, except      their diminution in size ; the increase in the
number of these cells,     which is stated by Heidenhain to occur,      I have
not observed.      That the cells, in spite of the paralytic secretion, are
      "          "                          " condition, is further shown
in a    resting    and not in an " active                                   by
 the cells being, in the fresh state, granular throughout.        On the side
 of the antilytic secretion the gland-cells are rather less mucous than
 in the normal    "resting" gland.

       between Metals at High Temperatures in Fused Salts."
       By Thomas Andrews. F.R.S.E., F.C.S. Communicated by
       Sir Henry Roscoe, F.R.S. Received March 12, 1885.
                                (Abstract.)
   Reversals of the electromotive force between platinum and other
metals in fused salts appear to have been noticed by Andrews about
the year 1837, and in 1858 Hankel made some observations in this
direction (Hankel, " Poggendorff's Annalen," 103, p. 612, 1858).
Dr. Gladstone and Mr. Tribe (" Phil. Mag.," 1881) also found that a
strip of silver plunged in molten Agl or AgCl, gives rise to a
growth of silver crystals ; the cause of this separation is the dissimilar
temperature of different portions of the strip which produces thermo-
currents.    The present communication is an attempt to obtain quan
titative estimations of the E.M.F., and of the extensive deviations
from the normal electro-chemical positions of the metals (platinum
and copper and platinum and iron) in fused salts, and the conditions
of high temperature attending these reactions, which do not appear to
have been previously determined.        The cell for fusing consisted of a
large platinum   crucible  (surrounded by known high temperatures)
forming one element, a thick bent copper or iron rod inserted in the
fused salt forming the other, or more frequently the copper plug of
the Siemens' water pyrometer (which had been used in taking the
time changes of temperature) was thus employed.            A delicate gal
vanometer of known constants was used for taking the E.M.F., which
was calculated from the observed deflections, in conjunction with the

 1885.]         Metals at High Temperatures in Fused Salts.                     217
ascertained resistances of the fused            salts.    The temperatures were
determined in a large number of observations by the aid of a Siemens'
water pyrometer.          The salts employed as electrolytes were potassium
carbonate, potassium chloride, potassium nitrate, potassium chlorate,
potassium bisulphate, and sodium chloride, using platinum and copper
or iron as elements.          The action of two dissimilar salts in contact
during fusion at 845° C. (K2COs and NaCl) on the same metal,
platinum, was also observed, and considerable reversals of the E.M.F.
to the extent of 0'37 volt occurred apparently from divergence                    of
temperature       in  the  relative  rate   of cooling    from   fusion  of the two
salts.
   Table   A* contains quantitative estimates in volts of the deviations
of  the E.M.F. from the normal.             The results on this Table A show
that by a       regulation of the heat between the metals forming the
elements,      extensive deviations        from the normal electro-chemical
positions of the metals were obtainable, in connexion with some of the
above fused salts, under the conditions          of temperature recorded on the
Tables A and B.          In K2C03, fused and resolidified (being then under
the fusing point), a reverse E.M.F. of l-037 volts was noticed (platinum
positive), the current flowing from the platinum to the copper;
on   remelting the salt and equalising the temperature throughout
to 845°    C., an instant reversal of the direction of the current took
place, the metals resuming their normal positions with an E.M.F. of
022 volt, platinum being now negative.                   In the case of platinum
and iron, under the same conditions in the above salt, a total deviation
of about 0 88 volt from the normal position was obtainable (platinum
positive).      In   the water    tube experiments      greater    divergences were
noticed     (see Table B).        With potassium chloride, interchanges of
position between the metals occurred, platinum at first being positive,
 with an     E.M.F. of 0'318 volt, representing a total deviation of 0-94
volt.    With potassium nitrate just before fusion point, an E.M.F. of
G'088    volt was observed (platinum positive)             ; on the salt, however,
reaching fusion, a reversal took place, the copper assuming its normal
positive position.
   Table B contains estimates of the temperature conditions attending
the   variations of the E.M.F. in fused K^COs.               Considerable reversals
of the E.M.F. were noticed (platinum positive).                 The experiments in
columns     1 and 3 show that a temperature divergence of about 260° C.
between the      platinum and copper, gave a reverse E.M.F. of 0'44 volt
(platinum positive), a difference of 265° C. between platinum and
iron gave a reverse E.M.F. of 0'24 volt (platinum positive), the
 E.M.F. reducing to a certain extent as the temperature difference
 decreased.      To obtain a greater difference of temperature between

the metals (see columns 2 and 4), the copper element consisted of
a bent pipe, immersed in the fused salt, through which water
was kept flowing, the temperature of the copper being about
29° C.       The platinum crucible was surrounded by temperatures
from    549° to 879° C., a    total variation of 850° C. between the two
elements was obtained.          A similar method was adopted in the
platinum    and  iron  experiments.     A temperature divergence of about
518° C. between platinum and copper gave a reverse E.M.F. of 0-92
volt (platinum positive), but with the salt in liquid fusion (platinum
at 879° C., copper at 29° C.) a reverse E.M.F. (platinum positive) of
only 0'66 volt was obtainable.          A temperature variance of about
522° C. between platinum and iron yielded an E.M.F. of 0'53 volt
(platinum positive), but when the salt was in liquid fusion (platinum
879° C., iron 29° C.) a reverse E.M.F. (platinum positive) of only
0'40 volt was noticed.        In a cell of this description, two opposing
forces were observed in operation, the thermo-electric, contending at
the higher temperatures with the normal electro-chemical action of
the fused salt.     The results of the water pipe experiments, recorded
in detail on Table B, show that generally from some cause the extent
of the reversed E.M.F. did not appear to correspond in exact pro
portion with the temperature divergences between the metals ; this
result may perhaps be accounted for by the electrolyte at the in
creased temperatures combating the thermo-electric influences, and
commencing to restore the true electro-chemical equilibrium of the
metals.     A point of temperature is reached where the thermal effects
counterbalance the normal electric action of the fused salt.        There is
apparently    a powerful    thermic  influence, where equality of  tempera
ture does not obtain, reversing the E.M.F. from the metals, notwith
standing their immersion at high temperatures in such electrolytes as
fused salts ; this reversal of direction of the current in the case of
K3COs, continuing even with the salt at a temperature of 695° C, or
above, the current passing from the hotter platinum to the colder
copper.     When, however, the point of fusion of the hot solidified
salt is  reached   (834° C.), the metals, being at an uniform temperature
therein, resume their true electro-chemical positions.
   The foregoing and other repeated experiments appear to indicate
that in the form of apparatus used by the author, these interchanges
in the direction of the current between platinum and copper, or
platinum and iron, were almost solely caused by differences of tem
 perature surrounding the two metals forming the elements.

    2.  I used 60 Faure-Sellon-Volckmar cells freshly and fully charged
 up at each series of experiments.        The current through the filament
 was measured by a specially constructed and calibrated Ayrton and
 Perry direct-reading spring ammeter.              The galvanometer in the
 shunt circuit was a sensitive tangent galvanometer of the Post-office
 pattern.    The current through the filament was regulated by varying
 the number of cells.         The current and electromotive force through
 the shunt aec were calculated by the following method : — The re
 sistance of the galvanometer          G was 1070 ohms, and a variable
 resistance R was inserted in its circuit.         When the current from a
 standard Daniell cell (1'07 volt) is sent through the galvanometer,
                                                 l-07
 we get a tangent reading d, which, since               = '001, is the        deflec

 The deflection (Ji) given by the shunt current was first read without
any resistance being inserted.
    Hence

Resistance was then added and a second reading d2 taken                ;   then   the
resistance r of the shunt is obtained from the formula

The electromotive force producing the current         is

The shunt circuit includes the rarefied      space ec, and   it is the   resistance
of this space that we desire to know.
    All the observations were simultaneously made by different observers.
While one observed the behaviour of the lamp, another read the
current flowing through the filament, a third read the currents in the
shunt, a fourth varied the electromotive force, and a fifth recorded the
results.    The electromotive force of the cells was carefully measured
before    and after the experiments.         No photometric       measurements

The lamp (No. 4)       was  a  short  (75 mm.) filament lamp, with a pla
tinum plate 30 mm. long and 5 mm. broad.
    The variation of the current and the increase in the resistance of
the filament    towards the end of the experiment, together with the
behaviour of the shunt, are very noticeable.            It is quite clear that
when the electromotive force attained 82 volts, a critical point was

reached that of the main current at the point of rupture of the fila
ment.    Again the current, which steadily increased until the critical
point was reached, then diminished, indicating a considerable increase
in the resistance of the rarefied space ec.    In one subsequent expe
riment, after the critical point was reached, no current could be ob

 222      Mr. W. H. Preece.       Behaviour of Glow-Latnpg      [Mar.    26,
    The direction of the current is shown in the figure.
    Towards the end of the experiment, when the characteristic diffused
blue effect in the globe was very marked, a bright arc was observed
to be playing about the bottom of the limb at c, and it was quite
clear that a bridge of conducting material was formed between e and
 c, which, together with the galvanometer, made a shunt to the fila
 ment.
    This experiment was repeated upon different lamps, and the results
were so similar that it is not necessary to reproduce the observa
tions.
    In all cases an intimate connexion was observed between the blue
effect and the appearance of the shunt current.
    4. One of Mr. Edison's assistants showed me in Philadelphia that
while the effect was very perceptible when the connexions were made
as shown in fig. 1, a being in connexion with the positive and e with
the negative pole, no shunt current or a very slight one could be
observed when the direction of the current was reversed.         I   did not
find this invariably the case.    One lamp (No. 8) only — a long   filament
lamp (150 mm. long) — which gave a marked shunt current and the
blue effect, when the connexions were made as in fig. 1 failed to
give any current or blue effect when the current was reversed within
the limits of the electromotive force at my command.          Doubtless I
should have got both effects if     I could have raised the electromotive
force.     In all cases, however, the effects appeared sooner and were
more marked when the connexions were as shown in fig. 1 than when
the direction of the current was reversed.          The effect of placing
the galvanometer      between   e and   c was the same as reversing      the
current.
    5. As the effect might    be due in some way to the material of the
conducting plate (de)      inserted   between the limbs of the filament,
Mr. Edison made for me lamps with copper, iron, and carbon
plates.
    The following experiments (pp.     223 and 224) were then made, the
connexions being the same as fig. 1.
    No marked difference was thus observable.
    If we examine the shunt current when the faint blue tinge appeared,
it was : with carbon, 3-42 ; with iron, 5-85 ; and with copper, 3-80
milliamperes.
    6. It might be affected by the extent of surface of the metal plate,
therefore lamps were made with a plate of fine wire, and also of a
very broad surface, but no difference was observable between these
and the normal plate used.

   8.      Although the maximum effect was produced by Mr. Edison when
the plate      was fixed between the limbs, he obtained   current when                     a                         it
was       fixed in any part of the rarefied space.  If the effect was due
primarily       to the Crookes effect, or to the projection of molecules
from the       carbon filament on to the metal plate, since this bombard
ment       takes place in right lines, we ought to have obtained effects
when these       lines were projected on the plate, but no effects when they
could       not strike the plate.    Several lamps were made, which are
shown       in the following sketches.

ment, and placed at the end of a tube which had a portion of the fila

     Reversed    the current through the filament.           Returned to 90 volts,
  and repeated the experiments.              Filament current readings the same
  as before, and also the blue effects.           At 108 volts a slight blue effect
  was noticed    in the open end of the tube.
     Doubtless,    if  I  could have increased the electromotive force, the
  results   would have been more marked ; but they were sufficient to
 show     that the effects were evident, even though the rarefied space
 were    greatly extended, as       in the  case of the tube attached     to No. 5
 lamp.
     10.  The tube was constructed           so  that no portion of the filament
 was opposed      by right lines to the metal plate (fig. 4).

    11.  A lamp      was constructed      with three branches at right angles to
each    other, as shown      in fig.  5, and  each metal plate taken in succession,
but no     results were obtained.
    12.  Professors Liveing        and Dewar (" Proc. Roy. Soc," March 9,
1882) observed        a

ing by     its spectrum the presence of carbonic oxide.            It was strongest
about the junction of the carbon thread and the positive electrode.               It
was, according to them, the glow of the positive                 pole attending a
discharge in rarefied gas.
   It  is a common       thing with glow-lamps which have the heels of the
fdament close       together to have an arc forming across when the electro
motive force at the terminals is too high.                 Hence in recent lamps
requiring 100 volts, Mr. Swan has considerably increased the distance
between the electrodes.             Moreover, whenever the incandescence of

                                                      is
isan indication of the advent of disintegration, and     very useful                                                     a
warning of danger ahead.
  13. Now      clear that we have
                   it   is            combination of the phenomena                             a
above described  in the Edison effect.   A continuous bridge of mole
cules    formed between the junction of the carbon filament and the
         is
metal plates inserted between its heels.    They are found deposited
on the metal plate.    A shunt      thus formed whose resistance                       is                                                is
measurable, and a definite current passes.   This shunt    formed just                                                   is
where the negative metallic connexion joins the heel of the carbon
filament, as we should expect from the investigations of Mr. Crookes.
The current is, however, weak and variable, and       scarcely reliable                                        it   is
enough        to be useful   for practical purposes as was hoped by its
discoverer.          When the critical point     reached the blue glow and                         is
flame seem         to pervade the whole bulb, and the arc-like effect, instead

of playing about the heel, surrounds apparently the whole filament.
The result is that the current passes through the galvanometer and
through the rarefied space.          This is clearly shown in Experiment 1.
    14. It is quite clear that the critical point is reached when the
filament commences to be disintegrated                by the projection of its
molecules from its surface.           It is here that the resistance of the fila
ment commences to increase, and the law of radiation and light
emission (" Proc. Roy. Soc," No. 229, 1884) commences to be
departed from, as was shown by me in a paper read before the British
Association at the Montreal meeting.*
    15. It is very evident that this Edison effect is due to the formation
of an arc between the carbon filament and the metal plate fixed in the
vacuous bulb ; that this arc is due to the projection of the carbon
particles in right lines across the vacuous space ; and that it makes its
appearance earlier, and is more strongly marked, when the connex
ions are as shown in Fig. 1 than when they are reversed, because, as
Mr. Crookes has pointed out, the projection proceeds from the nega
tive to the positive pole, and it would commence at the point of least
resistance.     Its presence is detrimental to the life of the lamp, and as
its appearance is contemporaneous with the blue effect, the latter is a
warning of the approach of the critical point, and a sure indication
that the electromotive force is dangerously high. It is also clear that
as the Edison effect is only evident when we are
                                                          " among the breakers,"
it is not available for practically regulating the conditions of electric
light currents as its ingenious discoverer originally proposed.
   * In this paper  I pointed out from experimental data that the light emitted by
a glow-lamp   varied  apparently as the sixth power of the current.    I verified this
law, not only by subsequent experiments of my own, but, which is much more
satisfactory, by experiments of others. Professor Kittler, of Darmstadt, and Captain
Abney made, independently of each other, most careful and exhaustive measure
ments in this direction.    I tabulated and traced them out in curves.     They fully
confirm the law that
                                        L = iC6,
but within limits, and that these limits embrace the ordinary range of a glow-lamp
when used for artificial illumination. As long as the resistance and the current vary
uniformly together the law holds good ; but as the state of incandescence is
increased, a point is reached, varying with each kind of lamp, when the resistance
ceases to diminish at the same rate, and eventually increases.     When this occurs
the law is departed from, and the light emitted increases less than the sixth
power of the current. The filament speedily breaks.     The point of departure from
the law indicates a point when a change of state occurs in the carbon filament.
Disintegration probably sets in. This point ought to be determined for each kind of
lamp, and it should never be allowed to be reached, for it is from this point that
decay commences and rupture follows.

I.   "Note on      an    Experiment by Chladni."          By CHARLES Tom-
               linsox, F.R.S. Received March 14, 1885.
                                     [Platb l.]
    Lord Rayleigh, in a memoir " On the Circulation of Air in Kundt's
Tubes," &c., remarks ("Proc. Roy. Soc.,"xxxvi, 10, and "Phil. Trans.,"
1884, Part I, p. 1) that
                                 " it was discovered
                                                         by Savart that very
fine powder does not collect itself at the nodal lines, as does sand in
the production of Chladni's figures, but gathers itself into a cloud,
which, after hovering for a time, settles itself over the places of
maximum vibration."
    In Savart's memoir, " Sur les Vibrations Normales" ("An. de Ch.
et de Ph." for 1827, xxxvi, 187), the author distinctly claims the
above-named discovery.          At p. 190 he refers to the nodal lines of
 Chladni, but adds that by mixing with the sand a finer dust, such as
                 " la
lycopodium,           poussiere fine se reunit pour tracer d'autres lignes
circulaires que ce physicien n'a pas connues," &c.
    Faraday, in his critical examination of Savart's memoir (" Phil.
 Trans.," 1831, p. 299), apparently takes it for granted that Savart
started with an original observation.
    But this interesting discovery, which has been so fruitful in beauti
ful results, is really due to Chladni.        In his " Traite d'Acoustique,"
Paris, 1809, he remarks, p. 125:
                                          "  Si un pen de poussiere fine est
melee au sable,       elle  pourra  mieux    servir pour faire voir aussi les
 centres des vibrations, c'est-a-dire, les endroits ou les parties vibrantes
 font les plus grandes excursions : les molecules les plus petites de la
 poussiere s'accumuleront      sur ces endroits."
                                               " Nene
    Chladni is even more explicit in his               Beytrage zur Akustic,"
 (4to, Leipzig, 1817).       At p. 7 he recommends " etwas Pulvis lyco-
podii" as the fine dust to be mixed with the sand ; and at p. 69, he
 remarks that when fine dust accumulates on the centres of vibration,
 it is in heaps more or less round or long, &c., according to the form
 assumed by the      vibrating part.

248                         Mr. C. Tomlinson.                     [Apr.   16,
   When Wheatstone reproduced Chladni's figures on square plates
("Phil. Trans.," 1833, p. 593), he did not notice the remarkable
figures produced by mixing a fine powder with the sand. This was
the less necessary because Faraday's memoir had been so recently pub
lished, and its conclusion was so satisfactory, namely, that when a
plate is vibrating, currents are established in the air lying upon the
surface of the plate, which pass from the nodal lines towards the
centres of maximum vibration, and then proceeding outwards from
the plate to a greater or less distance, return towards the nodal
lines.
   With the exception of a very few elementary specimens on a small
scale, as given by Chladni and Faraday,         I
                                                am not aware that this
class of figures has  ever been  adequately represented ; and yet these
figures are not only interesting in themselves, but are capable of being
exhibited  on a scale fitted for the lecture table.  For some of the
figures we may make use of a brass plate, 12 inches square, fixed on a
pillar by means of a central screw. The upper surface of the plate
should be blackened by means of nitrate of silver or chloride of
platinum solution, or some such contrivance, so as to leave a stain not
liable to crack or peel off.
   A thin layer of sand is to be dusted over the surface by means of a
pepper-box, and then a small bag of thin linen or calico, containing
the lycopodium powder, is to be shaken over the layer of sand. On
applying the bow to the edge of the plate, 3£ inches from the corner,
the note produced in my plate is          in the fourth space. This pro
                                        Et|
duces fig.   1  with well-defined nodal lines and heaps of lycopodium
powder on the twelve centres of vibration.           Under the continued
action of   the  bow  each  heap expands, swells up, and contracts with
great activity.    If while this figure at rest the bow be applied to the
                                        is
centre of the edge, so as to produce the higher note Bb above the
lines in the treble clef, fig. 2   is  produced, a figure of great beauty,
from the symmetrical        arrangement of its parts and the delicate
variations of shading, which confer upon      it  an artistic character.
   Iron filings were sifted over the plate, and on sounding the note
that leads to the formation of fig.      1,the finest particles of iron were
transferred to the centres of vibration, while the coarser remained at
the nodes.
  Lycopodium alone was dusted over the plate, when the powder
became divided into two portions, one remaining on the nodal lines,
now very much broader than those formed by sand, while a second
portion assumed active functions on the vibrating centres.      Lord
Justice Fry, F.R.S., to whom     showed this experiment, suggested
                                 I
that the winnowing process which separated the finer from the coarser
particles in the former experiments might also apply here. He col
lected specimens from the nodes and from the vibrating centres, bat

  on examination      found that " the spores from both are of the same
  size, all being, I believe, macrospores."           I  have since examined a
  number of commercial specimens of lycopodium, but have not met
  with any containing microspores.
     The powder of sublimed sulphur was also dusted over the plate,
  when on sounding         the note E, fig. 1 was beautifully produced, the
  nodal lines being well defined, and not much coarser than with sand ;
  but the flowers on the vibrating centres were much more diffused,
  shading off into cloudiness much more than with lycopodium.                  The
  sulphur   also  was   not  so  active.  Figs.  3  and 4  are attempts   to repre
 sent the   action of sulphur alone.
     After a layer of iron filings had been sifted on the plate, a layer of
 sand was added, when the finer particles of iron did not escape to the
 vibrating centres, they being apparently imprisoned by the sand.
     Flowers of sulphur being dusted on the plate, and then lycopodium,
 a certain amount of winnowing goes on under the influence of vibra
 tion, the sulphur for the most part going to the nodes, and the lyco
 podium to the centres (fig. 5). When either of these or a similar light
 powder is used alone, the slight adhesion of the powder to the plate
 on and about the nodal lines is sufficient to retain it there, while the
 looser upper particles are swept upon the centres.
    The cyclonic air currents are well shown by flowers of sulphur,
 when the plate is thrown into its greatest amplitude of vibration by
 sounding either of the         two lowest   notes,  D in the   bass clef, and   Ab
 below the lines of the treble clef, the figures            being the well known
 crosses   which terminate, one in the centre of the edges, and the other
 at the   angles of the plate.         In either case there are but four vibrat
 ing centres, and the powder occupies a considerable space on each,
aud is whirled round in numerous eddies, which can be distinctly
followed     by the    eye, showing how the separate heaps of lycopodium
are   formed when this powder is used instead of sulphur, which does
not   collect in heaps, but in curved parallel ripples, convex towards
the fixed centre of the plate.
    The brass plate thus fixed yields but a limited number of figures.
By using plates of various material and form, such as bell metal
bronze, white metal, glass, &c, in squares, parallelograms, ovals, &c,
fixed at any point by means of Chladni's clamp, an endless variety of
forms may be obtained.              In the following    figures  the small white
circle shows where the plate was clamped.
    The presence     of flowers of sulphur gives a softened effect to the
figure, and converts the sharp angles formed by sand alone into grace
ful curves.      Fig. 6 shows the effect of sulphur and lycopodium com
bined ; fig. 7 of sand and lycopodium, where the finer powder collects
in heaps.      In  the more complicated figures which follow it is remark
able   to note the precision with which the lycopodium becomes sepa

 250                  Note     on an     Experiment by Chladni.                           [^Pr- 16,
 rated from the sand, and performs its evolutions within the numerous
 centres of vibration into which the plate breaks up.
    With respect to the double circles (figs. 18 and 19), and the double
 ellipse (fig. 16), Chladni remarks that these are the most difficult of
 all the figures to produce.              With the two powders, sand and lyco-
 podium,     the  difficulty    ceases,     the lighter powder forming the outer
 and the sand the inner ring.
    The figures represented have been faithfully copied from the plates ;
 such distortions as those represented in fig. 10 are due to irregulari
 ties in the structure of the'plate.

        Received March 21, 1885.
     The purely pelagic habit of the interesting order of Pteropods
 places them so far beyond the reach of zoologists in general, that the
 opportunities of examining them in a living or recent state are few
 and far between.         I have myself been fortunate enough to obtain,
 from time       to time, nearly all the leading genera of the order in
 question, but, singularly, have never fallen in with Cymbulia.
    Judging from the figures and descriptions of this genus given by
 naturalists, it always appeared to me as if both animal and shell were
 taken end for end so as to render all the descriptive relationships
 ambiguous     ;  but it was only a short time ago that I was enabled to
 investigate the point practically through the kindness of a naval
 friend who brought me some specimens of Cymbulia Peroni from the
 Indian Ocean.
    The result of examination proved the impression above expressed to
 be a  correct one, while other particulars of interest also revealed them
 selves.    I found that the attachment of the animal to the shell was so
slight, and the visceral mass so short and rounded, that by incautious
handling the animal very readily came away, and here           I believe is the
whole secret of the matter, for, on attempting to place it in situ again,
one would be very likely to turn it upside down, and the error would,
of course,    be propagated    in otherwise, possibly, excellent figures and
descriptions.       It might be mentioned here   that the great malacologist
De    Blainville gave the generic name of Gastroplax to an Umbrella
which he found with the broad surface of the foot accidentally adherent
to the shell, so that we need not wonder at what anybody else might
do under similar circumstances.
    Mr. S. P. Woodward, in his Manual of Mollusca, thus characterises
Cymbulia : —
    Shell cartilaginous, slipper-shaped,       pointed in front, truncated
posteriorly, aperture elongated      ventral.
    Animal with large rounded fins connected ventrally by an elon
gated lobe; mouth furnished with minute tentacles, lingual teeth,
1,1,1 ; stomach muscular, armed with two sharp plates.
    In keeping with the above description, the figure given of Cymbulia
proboscidea    (after Adams) shows the toe of the slipper in front like a
rostrum, probably suggesting the specific name proboseidea, for the
animal itself presents no appearance of a proboscis.       In De Blainville's
figure, however, a protrusion from the generative orifice might be so
interpreted ; but unfortunately, though the shell is given in its
natural position, the animal is turned upside down.           The eyes men

 which would appear to be a modification of the metopodium of other
 Pteropods.
    The fins are said to be rounded   and connected ventrally (?) by an
 elongated lobe, but this statement is not quite correct.    The two fins
together form a broad continuous reniform plate, with an unbroken
curved outline in front, and a hilum-like notch behind, where the
mouth of the animal is situated.     Nevertheless, the epipodial expan
sion exhibits a tendency to fall into folds that might suggest the idea
of a ventral lobe if the animal were reversed in its shell.
   The posterior margin of the fins on each side presents a dilamina-
tion which gradually widens towards the middle line so as to include
the mouth, and form two distinct, but quite linear, labia or lips.

 from which it tapers elliptically to a pointed toe, while the heel at the
 anterior extremity is abruptly truncated and broadly notched.
    The slipper is ornamented with eight principal spiny ridges, taking
 a longitudinal direction, diverging from the toe and terminating
 separately at the heel.   But the central vertical ridge corresponding
 with the front of the slipper is cut off where a square notch or fissure
 in the instep receives the muscular attachment of the animal.        The
 whole scheme of arrangement will be better understood on inspecting
 the accompanying figure, which is about three times the natural size.

      some Observations on the Thickness of the Earth's Crust
      from a Geological Point of View; and on the Primary
      Cause of Volcanic Action."        By Joseph Prestwich, F.R.S.,
      Professor of Geology in the University of Oxford. Received
      March 26, 1885.
                                (Abstract.)
   That water plays an important part in volcanic eruptions is a well-
established fact, but there is a difference of opinion as to whether it
should be regarded as a primary or a secondary agent, and as to the
time, place, and mode of its intervention.        The author gives the
opinions of Daubeny, Poulett-Scrope, and Mallet, and dismissing the
first and last as not meeting the views of geologists, proceeds to
examine the grounds of Scrope's hypothesis — the one generally
accepted in this country — which holds that the rise of lava in a
volcanic vent is occasioned by the expansion of volumes of high
pressure steam generated in the interior of a mass of liquefied and
heated mineral matter within or beneath the eruptive orifice, or that
volcanic eruptions are to be attributed to the escape of high pressure
steam existing in the interior of the earth.       The way in which the
water is introduced and where, is not explained, but as the expulsion
of the lava is considered to be due to the force of the imprisoned
vapour, it is, of course, necessary that it should extend to the very
base of the volcanic foci, just as it is necessary that the powder must
be in the breech of the gun to effect the expulsion of the ball.
   The author then proceeds to state his objections to this hypothesis.
In the first place, he questions whether it is possible for water to
penetrate to a heated or molten magma underlying the solid crust.
The stratigraphical difficulties are not insurmountable, although it is
well known that the quantity of water within the depths actually

 254                  Prof.  J. Prestwich.    On the            [Apr. 10,
 reached in mines, decreases, as a rule, with the depth, and is less in
 the Palaeozoic than in the Mesozoic and Kainozoic strata.
    The main difficulty is thermo-dynamical.     As the elastic vapour of
 water increases with the rise of temperature, and faster at high than
 at low temperatures, the pressure, — which at a depth of about 7,500
 feet and with a temperature (taking the thermometric gradient at
 48 feet per 1° F.) of 212° F., would be equal to that of one atmo
 sphere only, — would at a depth of 15,000 feet and a temperature of
 362°, be equal to 10£ atmospheres, and at 20,000 feet and tempera
ture of 467°, would exceed 25 atmospheres. Beyond this temperature
 the pressure has only been determined by empirical formulae, which,
as the increase of pressure is nearly proportional to the fifth power
of the excess of temperature, would show that the pressure, in
 presence of the heat at greater depths, becomes excessive.       Thus, if
 the formulae hold good to the critical point of water or 773°, there
would at that temperature be a pressure of about 350 atmospheres.
    At temperatures exceeding 1000° F. and depth of about 50,000
feet, the experiments of M. H. St. Claire Deville have shown that
the vapour of water, under certain conditions, probably undergoes
dissociation,   and, consequently, a large increase in volume.          It
 would follow also on this that if the water-vapour had been subject
to the long-continued action of the high temperatures of great
depths, we might expect to meet with a less amount of steam and a
larger proportion of its constituent gases than occurs in the erup
tion*.    Capillarity will assist the descent, and pressure will cause
the water to retain its fluidity to considerable depths, but with the
increasing heat, capillarity loses its power.
    Taking these various conditions into consideration, the anthor doubts
 whether the surface waters can penetrate to depths of more than seven
 to eight miles, and feels it impossible to accept any hypothesis based
upon an assumed percolation to unlimited depths.        That there should
be open fissures through which water could penetrate to the volcanic
foci, he also considers an impossibility.
    But the objection to which the author attaches most weight against
the extravasation of the lava being due to the presence of vapour in
 the volcanic foci, is, that if such were the case, there should be a
distinct relation between the discharge of the lava and of the vapour,
 whereas the result of an examination of a number of well-recorded
 eruptions, shows that the two operations are in no relation and are
 perfectly independent.     Sometimes there has been a large discharge
 of lava and little or no escape of steam, and at other times there have
 been paroxysmal explosive eruptions with little discharge of lava.
    There are instances in which the lava of Vesuvius has welled ont
 almost with the tranquillity of a water-spring.     A  great eruption of
 Etna commenced with violent explosions and           ejection of scoriw,

 1885.]           Agency of Water in Volcanic Eruptions.                255
which after      sixteen  days ceased,  but the flow of lava continued for
four months without further explosions.        In the eruption of Santorin
of 1866,    the rock-emission proceeded for days in silence, the pro
truded mass of lava forming a hill nearly 500 feet long by 200 feet
high, which a witness compared with the steady and uninterrupted
growth of a soap bubble.         The eruptions of Mauna Loa are remark
able for their magnitude         and at the same time for their quiet.
Speaking of the eruptions of 1855, Dana says there was no earth
quake, no internal thunderings,         and no premonitions.     A vent or
fissure was formed, from which a vast body of liquid lava flowed
rapidly but quietly, and without steam explosions, for the space of
many months.
    On the other hand, paroxysmal eruptions are generally accompanied
by earthquakes, and begin with one powerful burst, followed rapidly
by a succession      of explosions, and commonly with little extrusion of
lava,   although it is to    be observed that a large quantity must be
blown into scoriae and lost in the ejections.        Such was the eruption
of Coseguina in 1835, and of Krakatoa in 1883.          Sometimes in these
paroxysmal eruptions, there is absolutely no escape of lava, scoria?
alone being projected.        A common feature in eruptions, and which
indicates the termination of the crisis, is the stopping of the lava,
 though the gaseous explosions continue for some time with scarcely
diminished energy.
    There is, thus, no definite relation between the quantity of explo
 sive gases and vapours and the quantity of lava.           If the eruption
 of lava depended on the occluded vapour, it is not easy to see
 how there     could be great flows without a large escape of vapour, or
 large volumes      of vapour without lava. The extrusion of lava has-
 been compared to the boiling over of a viscid substance in a vessel,
 but the cases are    not analogous.
    The only logical way in which it would seem possible for water to-
  be present, is on the hypothesis of Sterry Hunt, who supposes the
 molten magma to be a re-melted mass of the earlier sedimentary      strata,
  which had been originally subject to surface and meteoric action.
 But    in the end the preceding objections apply equally to this-
 view.
    There is the further general objection to the presence of water in
 the molten magma, in that were the extrusion of lava due to this-
 cause, the extrusion of granite and other molten rocks (which do not
 as a  rule lie so deep as the lava magma) should have been the first to
  feel its influence and to show its presence.      Yet although water is-
  present, it is in such small quantities, that these rocks never exhibit
  the scoriaceous character which lava so commonly possesses.
     Nor is lava always scoriaceous, as it should be if the hypothesis-
  were correct.     Many lavas are perfectly compact and free from vapour

256                   Prof. J. Prestwich.     On the             [Apr. 16,
cavities,  and so also are especially most of the great sheets of lava
(basalt), which welled out through fissures in late geological times.
These vast fissure eruptions, which in India and America cover
thousands of square miles, and are several thousand feet thick, seem
conclusive against water agency, for they have welled out evidently in
a state of great fluidity, with extremely little explosive accompani
ments, and often without a trace of scoriae mounds.           The general
presence    of non-hydrated   rocks  and  minerals   is also incompatible
with the permeation of water which the assumption involves.
   It has been suggested by some writers that large subterranean
cavities may exist at depths in which the vapour of water is stored
under high pressure, but the author shows that such natural cavities
are highly improbable in any rocks, and impossible in calcareous
strata.
   The author proceeds to account for the presence of the enormous
quantity of the vapour of water, so constantly present in eruptions,
and which, in one eruption of Etna, was estimated by Fouque to be
equal to about 5,000,000 gallons in the twenty-four hours. He refers
it to the surface-waters gaining access during the eruptions to the
volcanic ducts either in the volcanic mountain itself, or at com
paratively moderate depths beneath. He describes how the springs
and wells are influenced by volcanic outbursts.       By some observers,
these effects have been referred to the influence of dry and wet seasons,
but there are so many recorded instances by competent witnesses,
as to leave little doubt of the fact.       This was also the decision of
the inquiry by the late Professor Phillips, who asks, why is the
drying up of the wells and springs an indication of coming disaster ?
   The author then considers the hydro-geological condition of the
underground waters. He points to the well-known fact, that on the
surface of volcanoes the whole of the rainfall disappears at once, and
shows that when the mountain is at rest, the underground water
must behave as in ordinary sedimentary strata.       Therefore, the water
will remain stored in the body of the mountain, in the interstices of
the rocks and scoriae, and in the many empty lava-tunnels and cavities.
The level of this water will rise with the height of the mountain, and
he estimates that it has at times reached in Etna a height of 5,000 to
6,000 feet, while the permanent level of the springs at the base of the
mountain seems to be at about 2,000 feet.          The water does not,
however, form one common reservoir, but is divided into a number
of independent levels by the irregular distribution of the scorife,
lava, &c. These beds are traversed by vertical dykes running radially
from the crater, so that, as they generally admit of the passage of
water, the dykes serve as conduits to carry the water to the central
duct.
   Little is known of the sedimentary strata on which volcanoes stand.

 In Naples, however, an artesian well found them under the volcanic
materials in usual succession, and with several water-bearing beds,
from one of which, at a depth of 1,524 feet, a spring of water rose to
the surface with a discharge of 440 gallons per minute.      When in a
state of rest, the surplus underground waters escape in the ordinary
way by springs on the surface, or when the strata crop out        in the
sea, they then form submarine springs.
   During an eruption, these conditions are completely changed. The
ascending lava, as it crashes through the solid plug formed during a
lengthened period of repose, comes in contact with the water lodged
around or may be in the duct, which is at once flashed into steam, and
gives rise to explosions more or less violent.    These explosions rend
the mountain, and fresh fissures are formed which further serve to carry
the water to the duct from which they proceed ; or they may serve as
channels for the sea-water to flood the crater, when, as in the case of
Coseguina and Krakatoa, the volcano is near the sea-level.        As the
eruption continues, the water stores immediately around the duct
become exhausted, and then the water lodged in the more distant
parts of the mountain rushes in to supply the void, and the explo
sions are violent and prolonged according to the available volume of
water in the volcanic beds. When this store is exhausted, the same
process will go on with the underlying water-bearing sedimentary
strata traversed by the volcanic duct.
   The author gives diagrams showing the position of the water-levels
before,  during, and after eruption ; and describes the manner in
which, if the strata surrounding the duct and below the sea-
level become exhausted, the efflux of the fresh water which passed
out to sea through the permeable beds, when the inland waters
stood at their normal height above the sea-level, these same
beds will in their turn serve as channels for the sea water to
restore the lowered water-level         inland.   Thus, the excurrent
channels which carried the land waters into the sea-bed, and
there formed, as they often do off the coasts of the Mediterranean,
powerful fresh-water springs, now serve as channels for an in-
current stream of sea water, which like the fresh waters it replaces,
 passes into the volcanic duct. This agrees with the fact that diatoma-
ceous fresh-water remains are common in many eruptions, and marine
remains in others ; also, that the products of decomposition of sea water
are so abundant during and at the close of eruptions.      With the fall
of the water-levels, the available supply of water becomes exhausted,
 or the channels of communication impeded, and this continues until,
 with the ceasing of the extravasation of the lava, the eruption comes
 to an end.
    The author then explains the way in which the water may gain
 access to the lava in the duct, notwithstanding heat and pressure.

  2,58                  Prof.  J.  Prestwich.     On the            [Apr. 16,
  This he considers to be dependent upon the difference between the
  statical and the kinetical pressure of the column of lava on the sides
  of the duct. In the change from the one state to the other, when
 the lava begins to flow, and its lateral pressure is lessened, the equili
  brium with the surrounding elastic high pressure vapour becomes
  destroyed, and the vapour forces its way into the ascending lava.
  As this proceeds, the heated water further from the duct, and held
  back by the pressure of the vapour, flashes into steam to supply its
  place. If that water should be lodged in the joints of the surround
  ing rock, blocks of it will also be blown off, driven into, and ejected
  with, the ascending lava, as have been the blocks in Somma and of
  other volcanoes.
     It is the double action      thus established between the inland- and
  sea-waters that has probably prolonged the activity of the existing
  volcanoes settled in ocean centres, or along coast lines, while the
  great inland volcanic areas of Auvergne, the Eifel, Central Asia,
  &c, have become dormant or extinct.
     But if water only plays a secondary part in volcanic eruptions,       to
  what is the motive power which causes the extravasation of the lava
  to be attributed ? This involves questions connected with the solidity
  of the globe far more hypothetical           and difficult of proof. The
  author first takes into consideration          the probable thickness of
  the earth's crust from a geological point of view, and shows, that
  although the present stability of the earth's surface renders it evident
  that the hypothesis of a thin crust resting on a fluid nucleus is un-
. tenable, it is equally difficult to reconcile certain geological phenomena
  with a globe solid throughout, or even with a very thick crust. The
  geological phenomena on which he relies in proof of a crust of small
  thickness, are : — 1. Its flexibility as exhibited down to the most
  recent mountain uplifts, and in the elevation of continental areas.
  2. The increase of temperature with depth.          3. The volcanic pheno
  mena of the present day, and the out-welling of the vast sheets of
  trappean rocks during late geological periods.
     He considers that the squeezing and doubling up of the strata in
  mountain chains — as, for example, the 200 miles of originally hori
  zontal strata in the Alps, crushed into a space of 130 miles (and in
  some cases the compression is still greater) —can only be accounted for
  on the assumption of a thin crust resting on a yielding substratum,
  for the strata have bent as only a free surface plate could to the
  deformation    caused by lateral pressure.      If the globe were solid, or
  the crust of great thickness, there would have been crushing and
fracture, but not corrugations.         Looking at the dimensions of these
  folds, it is evident also that the plate could not be of any great
  thickness.     This in connexion with the increase of heat with depth,

long, would allow the lava to consolidate, leads the author to believe
that the outer solid crust may be less even than 20 miles thick.
    That the crust does possess great mobility is shown by the fact
that since the glacial period, there have been movements of conti
nental upheaval — to at least the extent of 1,500 to 1,800 feet — that
within more recent times they have extended to the height of 300 to
400 feet or more, and they have not yet entirely ceased.
    With regard to the suggestion of the late Professor Hopkins that
the lava lies in molten lakes at various depths beneath the surface,
the author finds it difficult to conceive their isolation as separate
and independent local igneous centres, in presence of the large areas
occupied by modern and by recently extinct volcanoes.            But the
chief objection is, that if such lakes existed they would tend to
depletion, and as they could not be replenished from surrounding
areas, the surface above would cave in and become depressed,
whereas areas of volcanic activity are usually areas of elevation, and
the great basaltic out-wellings of Colorado and Utah, instead of being
accompanied by depression, form tracts raised 5,000 to 12,000 feet
above the sea-level.
   These slow secular upheavals and depressions, this domed elevation
of great volcanic areas, the author thinks most compatible with the
movement of a thin crust on a slowly yielding viscid body or layer,
also of no great thickness, and wrapping round a solid nucleus.      The
viscid magma is thus compressed between the two solids, and while
yielding in places to compression, it, as a consequence of its narrow
limits, expands in like proportion in conterminous areas.         As an
example, he instances the imposing slow movements of elevation
which have so long been going on along almost all the land bordering
the shores of the Polar Seas, and to the areas of depression which so
often  further south subtend the upheaved districts.
   With respect to the primary cause of these changes and of the
extravasation of lava, the author sees no hypothesis which meets all
the conditions of the case so well as the old hypothesis of secular
refrigeration and contraction of a heated globe with a solid crust, —
not as originally held, with a fluid nucleus, but with the modifications
which he has named, and with a quasi rigidity compatible with the
conclusions of the eminent physicists who have investigated this part
of the problem.     Although the loss of terrestrial heat by radiation is
now exceedingly small, so also is the contraction        needed for the
quantity of lava ejected.     Cordier long since calculated that sup
posing five volcanic eruptions to take place annually, it would require
a century to shorten the radius of the earth to the extent of 1 mm.
or about      inch.
    The author, therefore, concludes that while the extravasation of the
 lava is due to the latter cause, the presence of vapour is due alone to

   There is no doubt that from every variety of blood plasma a proteid
body may be isolated, which can by appropriate means be converted
into fibrin.     This body, which is known as fibrinogen, has been more
especially    studied  by Hammarsten.        This observer has shown that
fibrinogen possesses characters which clearly distinguish it from the
other supposed factor in coagulation, viz., paraglobulin, and also that
solutions of fibrinogen will, when treated with fibrin ferment, give
rise to fibrin. The ouly objection possible to Hammarsten's experi
ments is that the body which he isolated has either previously to or
during the process of isolation undergone alteration.           That it is in
fact not the same body which is present in the circulating blood, but
that it   is,so to say, a sort of nascent fibrin. My observations bear on
this point.

blood does not clot, and by means of the centrifuge the plasma                         is
obtained. The injection of peptone produces this effect by preventing
the interaction of leucocytes and plasma which normally takes place
in shed blood.*         By repeated centrifugalising, the whole of the
corpuscular elements can be removed from this plasma, and the pure
plasma thus obtained can be made to clot in the most complete
manner, giving rise to a large quantity of fibrin, and this without
the addition of any further proteid body, so that the plasma must
contain dissolved in       the mother substance or substances of fibrin.

   In a note presented to the Society a few weeks ago, described       I                a
new constituent of the plasma which gives rise to fibrin and to other
bodies concerned in coagulation.          Ineed not refer at length in the
present paper     to this new   substance.   It separable from the plasma
                                                    is
by cooling the latter, and after its removal the plasma still yields                    a
large quantity of fibrin, and from this plasma, by Hammersten's
method, a body can be isolated, agreeing in all particulars with
 Hammersten's fibrinogen, and clotting readily with fibrin ferment.

   The following observations refer to such a plasma in which the
peptonisation is very complete, and from which the body separable by
cooling has been removed.
      Behaviour of the Plasma towards         Fibrin Ferment and Serum.*
   In the vast majority of       cases, the plasma gives with either of the
above only a very       minimal   clot, a few scarcely perceptible threads or
membranes being the sole result of prolonged action.               Serum is not
more effectual than ferment.
   But if, after the addition of serum or ferment, a stream of carbonic
acid be passed        through the plasma, or the plasma be diluted with
several times its volume of water, it clots through and through,
becoming quite solid.
    The readiness with which coagulation takes place with C02 varies
in different specimens, sometimes very rapidly, sometimes more slowly ;
sometimes it only occurs when the C02 treatment and dilution are
combined.
    There are two exceptions to the above statement : —
    Firstly — Sometimes neither ferment nor serum give by themselves
the slightest trace of a clot in the plasma.
    Secondly    — They sometimes give a very considerable clot.
    Both   these exceptions are rare.
    Now, I take these experiments to show that the plasma contains a
certain very small amount of true fibrinogen (coagulable with serum).
In some cases even this small trace may be absent, in others it may
be considerable. But the bulk of the coagulable matter of the plasma
is not directly coagulable with serum.            It is a body which is readily
altered so as to clot with the serum or ferment.             This alteration can
be effected by dilution, by C02, or in the process of isolation.             The
body is not fibrinogen,       but it readily passes   into the latter.
    I now turn to another kind of plasma which gives like results,
but which is free from the objection that in peptone plasma the
proteids become altered by the peptone injection — an objection which
I   do not think to be at all justified by the facts. For the sake of con
venience,     I  call it NaCl plasma.       It is obtained by receiving blood
direct from the artery into a 10 per cent. solution of common salt,
equal quantities of blood and salt solution being taken.
    It is essential that the blood should be mixed with the salt solution
with    as little delay as possible.     Very frequently the plasma obtained
from this blood is a little stained with haemoglobin.
    Now if to this plasma ferment bo added, a certain amount of
 clotting rapidly takes place ; it is usually very inconsiderable.            On

very long standing no increase takes place. If, however, after the
removal of the slight clot, the plasma be diluted with four times its
volume of water, it clots through and through.
   Now 4 or 5 per cent. solution of salt does not interfere with the
action of the fibrin ferment, and hence we must conclude that as in
peptone plasma, so in salt plasma, the bulk of the coagulable matter
is not in the form of fibrinogen, but as a substance which must first
be altered by dilution.
   These conclusions are confirmed by the behaviour of the plasma on
heating.   As is well known, solutions of Hammersten's fibrinogen
coagulate on heating to 54 — 56° C.
   If some NaCl plasma which has been treated with ferment, and
from which the slight clot thereby caused has been removed, be heated
to 56°, it remains perfectly clear ; long exposure to this temperature
does not alter         it,
                        can be heated up to a very high temperature,
                             and   it
90° and upwards, without the slightest coagulum      forming, though
at high temperatures               it
                         becomes opalescent.
   The exact upper limit of coagulation varies     usually over 90°
                                                              ;   it   is            C.
Of course    haemoglobin be present,
              if                       interferes with the experiment.
                                                  it
Now     will be remembered that this plasma, in spite of the removal
       it
of the small quantity of fibrin, contains a large quantity of fibrin-
yielding matter.
   The fact that ferment gives a slight clot in NaCl plasma may be
taken as an indication that NaCl plasma does contain a certain small
amount of true fibrinogen, and in fact     NaCl plasma which has not
                                                        if
been treated with ferment be heated to 56°,      becomes turbid, and
                                                               it                    a
slight coagulum   forms.  This, like the clot  obtained by ferment,                  is
sometimes very small indeed, sometimes more considerable.
  Before describing the behaviour of peptone plasma on heating,                     I
must make a slight digression.
  In my note previously referred to,*     showed that there exists

                                                    So long as this
body     present, coagulation
         is                    produced by passage of a stream

carbonic acid through the plasma, the whole of the coagulable sub
stance being converted into fibrin.  At the same time not only                       is
fibrin ferment produced, but also a body capable of converting the
coagulable body of the plasma into fibrinogen. To make this perfectly
clear, I shall give an example.
   Peptone plasma, rich in the substance separable by cold,      treated    is
with C02      ;coagulates, the serum
                  it                     pressed out from the clot and
                                                  is
allowed to stand, when       again becomes alkaline.

of this serum   to a new portion  of plasma, the latter clots completely
and with great rapidity.                 The clotting   is   much more rapid than   the
original clotting with C02.

    Now this serum contains fibrin ferment ; but inasmuch as ferment
does not cause anything more than a trace of clot in peptone plasma,
the serum must evidently contain some special body which renders the
plasma coagulable by ferment.              It must contain the precursor of the
fibrinogen       which,   as we have seen,       appears     to exist    dissolved    in
plasma.      I  do not know what this special substance is            ; it is derived
from the body separable by cold and also from leucocytes.                        I will
remark that it is not contained in ordinary serum, and hence is not
paraglobulin.
    Peptone plasma           behaves     in   a  totally    different    manner      on
heating, according as it contains a considerable amount of the body
separable by cold or not. If this body be present, the plasma
remains, on heating to 56 — 57°, perfectly clear for a short time — .
five to fifteen minutes ; it then becomes gradually turbid, and finally
a dense    flocculent precipitate forms ; but it is a very long time —
       —
hours before this precipitate reaches its maximum.*                   If it be absent,
the plasma         does not give on prolonged heating to 56 — 57° any
coagulum, and remains perfectly free from any precipitate till a
very high temperature, 80 — 90°, is reached.                It becomes opalescent
at high temperatures.            In either case, whether the body separable
by cold be absent or present,             the plasma, if mixed with an equal
quantity of 10 per cent. salt solution, remains free from any precipitate
till 80 — 90°, or higher, is reached. The upper limit varies somewhat,
often being as high as 95°.
    It must be understood that the precipitate mentioned above as
occurring      in plasma at 56 — 57° may or may not contain the body
separable by cold, but it appears in very much larger quantity there
than does the latter, and represents the whole of the coagulable matter
of the plasma. It would therefore appear that in the process of heat
ing, the same special body is liberated from the substance separable by
cold, as is the case when the latter is acted on by carbonic acid, i.e., a
body capable of converting the precursor of fibrinogen into fibrinogen
precipitable at 56°, and coagulable with fibrin ferment.                The presence
of 5 per cent. NaCl prevents its development by means of carbonic
acid, and also by means of heat.
   In order not to obscure the point              I have just been discussing,         I
have left out of. consideration        the very small trace of true fibrinogen
pre-existent in peptone plasma. This was mentioned at the beginning
of the paper; it always separates on heating the plasma to 56",
whether it has been cooled or not, or whether salt be present or'not,
but it is generally so very small in quantity that it is difficult to see
the minute      flocculi that separate at 56° ; hence the statements I made
above as to the plasma remaining clear are practically correct.                      It
must not however be forgotten that in some rare cases, peptone plasma
                  * This slow clotting at 56-57° was observed

 does give a considerable clot with serum or ferment alone, and such a
plasma gives a dense clot at 56°, whether the substance removable by
 cold be present or not.
    Now it is a well known fact that the injection into the veins of a
 strong solution of fibrin ferment, prepared in the ordinary way, is very
rarely followed by any serious thrombosis.        The same is true of defi-
brinated blood, and this is quite in conformity with the results I
have described above.
    This note is only a slight addition to the results        I  have already
obtained in the coagulation question, and        I  am actively engaged in
pursuing the subject.
    I wish to take this opportunity of making a few statements with
regard to the action of lecithin in producing coagulation.              I have
already shown that lecithin is an important factor in the coagulation
of the blood.     Since these publications,* my observations have only
tended to completely confirm the statements       I have already made, and
I  have in addition found that lecithin from the most varied sources,
and lecithin prepared from the platinum salt, is perfectly active. The
sources which have yielded an active lecithin are lymph glands, blood,
                                   I
testis, brain, yeast. Moreover, have found that it exerts its influence

viz., peptone plasma and cooled plasma. As to its exact mode of
action   I am not yet certain.    It no doubt gives rise to the appearance
of a large quantity of fibrin ferment, as was described in my note

                                 (Abstract.)
   The paper contains an account of the results of experiments which
have been made on a considerable number of samples of iron and steel
of known composition, including samples of cast iron, malleable cast
iron,  wrought iron, ordinary steels, manganese, chromium, tungsten,
and silicon steels.    The electrical resistance and the magnetic proper
ties are determined in absolute measure.          Amongst the electrical re
sistances the most noteworthy        fact is the very high resistance of
cast iron, as much as ten times that of wrought iron.          The fact that
manganese    steel   is almost non-magnetic is verified, and its actual
permeability measured.       The action of manganese appears to be to
reduce the maximum magnetisation           of steel, and in a still greater
ratio the residual magnetism, but not to affect the coercive force
materially.   It is shown that the observed permeability of manganese
steel containing 12 per cent. of manganese would be accounted for
by assuming that this alloy consists of a perfectly non-magnetic
material, in which are scattered about one-tenth part of isolated par
ticles  of pure iron.     Some practical    applications of the results are
discussed.

Joule's experiments have many times been repeated, and his general
results confirmed.    In particular, Prof. A. M. Mayer carried out a
series of very careful observations with apparatus of elaborate con
struction and great delicacy.*        The conclusions at which he arrived
were in accord with those of Joule, so far as regards iron : in the case
of steel there was some apparent discrepancy, which, however, might
to a great extent be accounted for by differences in the quality of the
metal used, and in the manner of conducting the experiments. In

which varies up to a certain point as the square of the magnetising
force. When the saturation point is approached the elongation is less
than this law would require.        The effect is greater in proportion to
the softness of the metal.
   2. When a rod or wire of iron is stretched by a weight, the elongat
ing effect of magnetisation is diminished ; and if the ratio of the
weight to the section of the wire exceeds a certain limit, magnetisa
tion causes retraction instead of elongation.
   3. Soft steel behaves like iron, but the elongation for a given
magnetising force is smaller (Joule). Hard steel is slightly elongated,
both when the magnetising current is made and when it is interrupted,
provided that the strength of the successive currents is gradually
increased (Joule).     The first application of the magnetising force
causes elongation of a steel bar      if it is tempered blue, and retraction
if it is tempered yellow : subsequent applications of the same externa]
magnetising force cause temporary retraction, whether the temper of
the steel is blue or yellow (Mayer).
    4. The length of a nickel bar is diminished            by magnetisation, the
 maximum retraction being twice as great as the maximum elongation
 of iron (Barrett).
    In order that the results of Joule and Mayer might be comparable
 with those obtained by the author, he made an attempt to estimate
 the magnetising forces with which they worked.                  From data con
 tained in their papers, it was calculated that the strongest magnetising
 force used by Joule was about 126 units, while the strongest used by
 Mayer did not on the highest probable estimate            exceed 118 units.   In
 the author's experiments      the   magnetising       force   was  earned  up to
 about 312 units.    The metal rods, too, were much smaller than any

which had been before used for the purpose, ranging in diameter from
1-40 to 6-25 mm.       Their length was in every case 100 mm., and the
apparatus was capable of measuring with tolerable certainty an
elongation or retraction equal to a ten-millionth part of this length.
    By using thinner iron rods and greater magnetising forces than
those previously     employed, the following curious and interesting fact
was established.       If  the magnetisation be carried beyond a certain
critical point the consequent elongation, instead of remaining station
ary at a maximum, becomes diminished, the diminution increasing
with the magnetising force.           If the force is sufficiently increased, a
point is arrived at where the original length of the rod is totally
unaffected by magnetisation ; and if the magnetisation be carried still
further, the original length of the rod will be reduced.                    It also
appeared     that  the position  of  the  critical  point in steel  depended in a
very remarkable manner upon the hardness or temper of the metal ;
considerable light is thus thrown on the apparently anomalous results
obtained by Joule and by Mayer. Further experiments disclosed
 strong reason for believing that the value of the critical magnetising
 force in a thin iron rod was greatly reduced by stretching ; this would
 explain the fact that Joule obtained opposite effects with stretched
 and unstretched wires.
     By ascertaining the relative values of the temporary moments
 induced by gradually increasing             external magnetising       forces, an
 attempt    was  made   to  connect  the  point  of maximum     elongation with a
 definite phase of the magnetisation of the several rods in which the
 elongation had been observed.
     Though more experiments must be made before it is possible to
  generalise from them with perfect safety, the results so far obtained
  by the author indicate the laws given below.              The elongations and
  magnetisations referred to are temporary only ; before the beginning
  of an experiment the rod was permanently               magnetised by passing
  through the magnetising coil a current equal to the strongest sub
  sequently   used. In iron the greatest elongation due to permanent
  magnetisation was generally found to be about one-third of the total
  elongation,   while in nickel the permanent retraction amounted only to
  about one   twenty-fifth part of the whole.
                                       I. Iron.
     1.  The length of an iron rod is increased by magnetisation up to a
  certain critical value of the magnetising force, when a maximum
  elongation   is reached.
      2. If the critical value of the magnetising force is exceeded, the
   elongation is diminished until with a sufficiently powerful magnetising
   force the original length of the rod is unaffected, and if the force is

  268       Magnetisation   and Length      of Rods of Iron, fyc.   [Apr. 23,
 still further increased the rod undergoes retraction.          Shortly after
 the critical point is passed, the elongation diminishes in proportion as
 the magnetising       force increases.      The greatest actual retraction
 hitherto observed was equal to about half the maximum elongation,
 but there was no indication of a limit, and a stronger magnetising
 force would have produced further retraction.
     3. The value of the external magnetising force corresponding to
 maximum elongation is for a given rod, approximately equal to twice
 its value at the " turning point."
    Definition.
                 — The turning point in the magnetisation of an iron bar
 is reached when the temporary moment begins to increase less rapidly
 than the external magnetising force.
    4. The external force corresponding to the point of maximum elon
gation increases (when the quality of the iron is the same) with the
diameter of the rod.       So also does its value at the turning point.
    5. The amount of the maximum elongation appears to vary in
versely as the square root of the diameter of the rod, when the quality
of the iron is the same.
    G. The turning point, and therefore presumably the point of max
imum elongation, occurs with a smaller magnetising force when the
rod is stretched than when       it is unstretched.
                                     II. Steel.
    7.  In soft steel magnetisation produces elongation, which, as in the
case   of iron, increases up to a certain value of the magnetising force,
and afterwards diminishes.         The maximum elongation is less than in
iron, and the rate of diminution after the maximum is passed is also
less.
    8. The   critical value of the magnetising force for a steel rod dimin
ishes with increasing hardness up to a certain point, corresponding to
a yellow temper; after which it increases, and with very hard steel
becomes very high.        There is therefore a critical degree of hardness
for which the critical magnetising force is a minimum; in steel of a
yellow temper the value of the critical magnetising force is lower than
in steel which is either softer or harder.
    9. In soft steel a strong magnetising force subsequently diminished
may cause a greater temporary elongation than the diminished force is
capable of producing if applied in the first place.
    10. A temporary elongation when once produced in soft steel may
be maintained by a magnetising force which is itself too small to
originate any perceptible elongation.

        1.
   Phytophagous larvae owe their colour and markings to two causes:
 (1) Pigments derived from their food-plants,* chlorophyll and xantho-
phyll, and probably others ; (2) pigments proper to the larvae, or
larval tissues made use of because of some (merely incidental) aid
which they lend to the colouring, e.g., fat.       A larva may be coloured
by either or both of these groups of factors.          It may be generally
stated that all green colouration without exception, as far as I have
investigated    the subject, is due to chlorophyll ; while nearly all
yellows are due to xanthophyll.         All other colours (including black
and white) and some yellows, especially those with an orange tinge,
are due to the second class of causes (as far as I am aware : it                                     is,
however, extremely probable that certain colours will be proved to
arise from the modification of the derived pigments        and many obser   ;
vations make         probable that other colours may be derived from
                            it
plants  in   the  case  of larvae feeding upon the petals, &c). The
derived pigments often occur dissolved in the blood, or segregated                                   in
the subcuticular tissues (probably the hypodermis cells), or even in                                  a
chitinous layer, closely associated with the cuticle itself. This last
situation has only as yet been proved in the case of the pupa                                        of
Papilio Macha-on, but          almost certainly true of many other pupae.
                                           it   is
The colours proper to the larvae occur in the hypodermis cells and                                   in
the cuticle.    The commonest structural basis of variability or poly
morphism in larvae        afforded by the varying extent to which either
                                      is
of these factors takes part in producing colouration.          Thus brown
and green are by far the commonest instances of dimorphism, and
when this      the case the former
                  is                   due to larval pigment, the latter
                                                          is                                          to
derived plant pigments.        It very remarkable that there should be

•.egs, as far as the causes of colour are concerned.      Mr. Raphael
Meldola has very conclusively argued for chlorophyll as the cause                                     of
the colour             in green larvae in a paper in the             "   Proc.   Zool.      Soc." for
    *   It willbe shown that the derived chlorophyll of larva; has undergone chemical
changes    of   which the effects appear in the altered spectrum, and in the great
stability of   the  pigment when present in the animal blood or tissues.         If, on the
other hand, the chlorophyll be separated from the proteid with which              united
                                                                                       it   is        in

are very constant, seeming to prove that the same definite changes are wrought                        by
many species of insect.        At the suggestion of Professor IC. Ray Lankester,                     I
 propose to call this derived pigment metttchloropht/ll.      The spectrum of the green
blood of the pupa of Ephi/ra Punciaria differs from that of other larvae and pupff

1873, p. 155.    He explains the relation between larval and vegetal colour
ation, by supposing that the larvae have been rendered transparent by
natural selection, and that thus the vegetal colours are themselves
seen and give      the colour to the larvae.  He points out that internal
feeders are not green      (their food being without chlorophyll), and he
quotes  Chautard (" Compt. rend.," January 13, 1873) as stating that
he had discovered chlorophyll in the tissues of insects.
   Mr. Meldola further expands this theory in his editorial notes to his
translation of - Weismann's "Studies in the Theory of Descent,"
Part II, "On the Origin of the Markings of Caterpillars," &c.       Here
he adduces the important evidence      that  "      few
                                               some      species of Nep-
ticula (N. Oxyacanthella, N. Viscerella, &c.) are green, although they
live in leaf-galleries where this colour can hardly be of use as a pro
tection, but their food (hawthorn and elm) contains chlorophyll." He
also quotes Chautard ("Ann. Chim. Phys." [5], iii, 1 — 56) in addi
tion to the previous reference to the same author, stating on this
authority that chlorophyll is a substance of great chemical stability,
and that it resists the animal digestive processes.     On referring to
Chautard, I find that Mr. Meldola is mistaken in the statement that
Chautard had discovered chlorophyll in the tissues of insects.        In
both papers referred to Chautard expressly states that the chlorophyll
came from the digestive tract of the insects (Cantharides) experimented
upon, and that he failed to obtain the bands after macerating the
elytra in alcohol.     He indeed states that chlorophyll resists the
digestive processes, meaning that it is detected unchanged in the
fteces. In a note to one of the papers (" Ann. Chim. Phys.") Chautard
does not seem to be entirely satisfied with his proof of the absence of
chlorophyll in the elytra of cantharides.      He states that if present
the chlorophyll must be much altered, and the colour of the elytra
cannot be due to        and he points out that the colouring matter
                       it,                                                   is
very insoluble in alcohol and ether.       He alludes to Pocklington's
researches (recently quoted by Dr. MacMunn), but only mentions and
disputes the possibility of ascertaining    the plant upon which the
cantharides fed by a spectroscopic examination of an extract of these
insects.
  Dr. MacMunn in a paper on Animal Chromatology in the " Pro
ceedings of the Birmingham Philosophical Society" (1882 —         vol. iii,
                                                                  3,
Pt. II, p. 351), states that all previous attempts to find chlorophyll in
the  colouring of insects have led to negative results. (There         is   one
partial exception to this in the case of Chautard's hesitation         about
chlorophyll in the elytra of cantharides, and there also Pocklington's
                                                        is
work on the same subject mentioned by Dr. MacMunn in a later
paper.)    He states that by concentrating light on the integument of
the larva of Pieris Rapce and examining with a micro-spectroscope, he
found    a   band in the red which showed a resemblance to chlorophyll.

 In    the   reports   of the British Association        at Southport (1883),
 Dr. MacMnnn further states that on withdrawing the intestinal con
 tents, the green colour and band disappear (Krukenberg also states
 that the band is due to the contents of the digestive tract, quoted in a
                        "
 letter to " Nature by Dr. MacMunn for the week ending January 10th,
 1885).      I have not yet examined the larva of P. Rapce from this point
 of view, but I think it is very probable that the green colour is due to
 the blood which may have been also lost when the contents of the
 intestine were removed.           I shall show later on that chlorophyll (or
 some modification of it) passes through the digestive tract and tinges
 the blood of Lepidoptercus larvae, and that the colour of green larvae
is often due to this cause alone.           I am sure that the contents of the
digestive     tract cannot account for the ground colour of a larva (such as
this)   , in which   the green is at all bright and distinct.        Furthermore,
the blood is extremely likely to be lost in any manipulation of a larva,
for it exists under pressure and exudes from a very small aperture.
If the intestine was dissected out, there can be doubt of the loss of the
blood.
    Dr. MacMunn also alludes to the discovery of chlorophyll in the
elytra of cautharides, and states that he has confirmed this observa
tion.      He believes that this chlorophyll is a synthetic production, and
suggests that it may be used for protective purposes, but that pro-
l,ably a pigment of less complicated chemical constitution might
answer as well.           Of course this would not apply to the derived
(and modified) chlorophyll of Phytophagous larvae.
    Dr. . MacMunn's interesting discovery of entero-chlorophyll (which
he believes to be synthetically formed) in the liver of many inverte
brates, does not apply to the present question. (See " Proc. Roy. Soc.,"
vol. 35, No. 226, p. 370.)
    2. Methods by which the two Factors         of Larval Colouration may     he
                    Recognised   : Instances of their Occurrence.
    If   the body of a small individual of the green form         of a dimorphic
(green and brown) Noctua larva be gently compressed,               the green tint
disappears from this part, and is replaced by faint                 yellow.    The
markings of the larva (apart from the ground colour)              are unchanged.
At the same time the tracheal system and other internal structures
become easily visible.         Conversely, the swollen uncompressed part of
the body becomes of a far deeper green than it was before. This is
especially well seen in the true legs, of which the colour is normally
pale.       Such effects are due to the fact that the green colour depends
upon the green blood.           (I use this word for the more correct term,
baemolympb.)         This conclusion is confirmed by examining the blood
itself, and by observing that the green ground colour of the larva             dis

appears on removing the bright green blood.               If, on the other hand,
a brown variety of the same larva be compressed, the results are
much less marked, and chiefly dependent upon the difference in
transparency of the compressed and swollen parts of the larva.                 The
blood is generally found to be colourless or very faintly yellowish :
hence the ground colour of the green form depends upon its blood,
while that of the brown form depends upon its proper pigment.
Intermediate colours are produced by intermediate conditions, and it
is quite common to find a series connecting the green and brown
larvae.     On compressing a greenish-brown larva, the green at once
becomes apparent in those parts of the organism which are deficient in
pigment,      i.e., the under surface and claspers ; and indeed it may bj
generally stated that the colour due to the blood generally pre
dominates in the lower part of the body, while that due to larval
pigment usually predominates on the back. The most extreme brown
varieties have often lost all colour in their blood (except when it is seen
in a very thick layer).        Phlogophora Meticulosa is a common species
upon which these observations can be made. Not only are these two
factors so variably developed in dimorphic or polymorphic larvae, but the
same variability is very commonly seen in a single life-history.              Thus
many green        larvae  become   brown   after  one  of  the  ecdyses,  or brown
ones become green.          Hence in the period preceding ecdysis the blood
must have lost its colour (P. Meticulosa and many Noctuae), or the
larval pigment must have become so opaque as to obscure any more
deeply placed colour (common among Geometers).                    There are often
great advantages to be gained by a brown larva retaining the green
 colour in its blood. This is well seen in the case of Ennomos Angidaria,
 of which the larva is an opaque Geometer, resembling the dark twigs of
 the elm. The pupal period is very short (in the middle of the summer),
 and the cocoon is consequently very slight.              It is formed of a few
 leaves loosely bound together, between          which the larva and afterwards
 the pupa, are easily seen. Here therefore the brown colour is inappro
 priate, and the whole of the larval pigment is discharged, allowing the
 green blood to give its colour to the larva during the quiescent period
 before pupation.        The pupa is similarly coloured and is also green.
  (It is dimorphic,      with  two shades of green.         These facts about E.
  Angular ia have been communicated to the Entomological Society in a
 hitherto    uupublished     paper, but the explanation has not appeared
  before.) Furthermore, these larvae, when very young, live upon the
 surface of the leaf they are eating, and at this time they are coloured
  green by   their blood, the pigment having not yet been deposited in a
  sufficient amount to render the surface opaque.              Hence the alterna
  tion of colours,    which  follows  the corresponding      succession  of objects
  imitated, depends upon the shifting scenes resulting from the presence
  of green blood behind       a superficial   covering, which can be rendered

274          Sir. E. B. Poulton.       Essential Nature   of the    [Apr. 23,
transparent     and opaque alternately.       Even in the most opaque
Geometer larvae, exactly resembling the dark twigs of their food-
plants, the inner surfaces of the large posterior claspers are often
green or yellowish.       This is the one spot in the body which is always
hidden, and here only is the pigment absent and the tint of the blood
visible.
    In  some   cases  the green colour of the blood disappears,         and is
replaced by a tint which helps towards producing the brown coloura
tion.    Thus the larva of Chmrocampa Elpenor is at first green, becom
ing brown at the beginning of the fifth stage (as a rule). Examin
                                            I
ing the blood of a pupa of this species, found that it was of a reddish-
brown colour, and must therefore have helped in causing the ground
colour of the last stages. Although no traces of the green colour were
to be seen, the spectra of modified chlorophyll and of xanthophyll
were distinct in a considerable thickness of the fluid. Evidently the
larva had not destroyed the pigments of the previous stages beyond
the point at which they ceased to interfere with the effect of the
later stage. The brownish tint in the blood of this brown larva
plays a far less important part in the total colouration             than the
green colour of the blood in green larvae, as is proved by the following
considerations : — It is not uncommon to find green larvae of C. Elpenor
in the last stage, and it may be assumed that the blood has then
retained the green tint. But even in these green larvae there is a
 considerable amount of dark pigment in and near the four eye-like
 terrifying marks on the first and second abdominal            segments, and
 the brown colour      (where it occurs) is not obviously different from
 that of a normal       brown variety.     Again, in blown specimens of
 Chmrocampa Porcellus the brown colour remains distinct and dark,
 although the blood has, of course, been removed.            And yet, con
 sidering the very complete resemblances between the larvae of C.
 Elpenor and C. Porcellus throughout their life-history, it is practi
 cally certain that the blood of the latter is similar in colour to that of
 the former.
    I will now give instances of the segregation of the derived pigments
 in the subcuticular tissues (probably the hypodermis cells). This
 must be true of Smerinthus Ocellatus, inasmuch as this larva remains
 green after dissection when the blood has escaped.         Again, the green
 ground   colour  of the  larvae of Sphinx Ligustri, S.  Ocellatus, &c, turns
 brown on the dorsal surface before pupation, but is comparatively
 unchanged elsewhere, while the green blood is also unchanged in the
 pupa.    This latter fact is also true of the pupa of Smerinthus Tilice,
 although the adult larva becomes purplish-brown without a trace
 of green remaining (even upon the paler under-surf ace) . Hence
 these larvae must be coloured by superficial           segregation of the
 derived    pigments     probably   strengthened   by   the   colour    of the

1885.]              Colouring   of Phytophagous    Larva.              275
blood.      On the other hand there are larvae which entirely depend
upon the green blood for their colour, and there is a transparency
about such larvae which at once distinguishes them from those above
described.      Thus green Noctua larvae are usually of this kind.
The species of Noctua which exhibits the most typically trans
parent green (that I know of) is the larva of Gonoptera Libatrix
(although I have never investigated the constitution of the colouring
in this species). Again, pressure has a comparatively slight effect
upon the distribution of colour in larvae of the former division, while
it produces the greatest effect in those of the latter.      I  think it is
very probable that in many cases the derived pigments may only exist
in the blood in the early stages, and may be deposited later in the
superficial tissues. Such an arrangement would entirely accord with
a very common change in the appearance of green larvae during
growth.      There is generally a marked difference in the colour of
a green larva after its first meal, and before this the transparency is so
complete that its tracheae and other internal organs can usually be
seen.     But it does not therefore follow that the chlorophyll is at this
time deposited in the superficial tissues (although such may be the
case), for the facts may be accounted for by an increase in the amount
of colour in the blood, and by a change in its tint (the probability of
this will be shown presently).
 3.  The Different Results of Methods of Preservation upon  the two Factors
                            in Larval Colouration.
    The derived pigment can always be distinguished from that proper
 to the organism, in larvae which have been preserved in spirit, or as
 blown and dried specimens. After both processes the proper pigment
 is unchanged, being quite insoluble in spirit and uninjured by drying.
 The derived pigments, on the other hand, dissolve in the spirit from
 the blood and from the superficial tissues, while in blown larvae the
 blood is removed (with the other contents of the body), and the
 chlorophyll in the superficial tissues rapidly fades, while the yellow
  due to the xanthophyll may persist for a long time.      Looking over a
  dried collection, it is at once obvious that green larvae, such as
  P. Rapes, 8. Populi, S. Tiliie, Notodonta Camelina, &c, have entirely
  changed in colour, while others, such as Liparis Aurijlua, Bombijx
  Neustria,   Odonestis   Potatoria, Eriogaster Lanestris, &c., remain
  perfectly life-like.    Hairy, brightly-coloured larvae are generally
  unchanged, as also are those distasteful forms which are protected
  by conspicuous     colours (such as Abraxas Grossulariata,       Euchclia
  Jacobea}, &c).     Smooth brown larvae (such as the majority of
  Geometers and many Noctuas) have evidently lost some depth of
  colour, due to the removal of the contents of the body and the con

276           Sir. E. B. Poulton.      Essential Nature   of   the    [Apr.  23,
sequent transparency; but the changes are slight compared with
those shown by green larvae, and are evidently due to the hypodermis
pigment being in amount or in character insufficient to render the
surface entirely opaque.       In the instances mentioned above as being
identical in appearance with the living larvae the pigment is entirely
opaque.      In such larvae some of the pigment is often deposited in the
cuticle, and is therefore visible in the latter after being thrown off at
ecdysis.     As a rule the cast off cuticle is transparent and colourless,
except the last one thrown off at pupation, which is generally dis
coloured and brown, because it is moistened by the fluid which covers
the pupa, and which hardens and darkens into the protective layer of
the latter.    The effect in spirit specimens is even more striking than
in the other method of preservation, for the green colour is not merely
changed, but has entirely disappeared, leaving the surfaces colourless.
   This is very obvious with larval colouration into which both factors
prominently enter. Thus in Dicranura Vinula (kept for a year and a
half in spirit) the green ground colour has entirely faded, and the
spirit is yellow with dissolved xanthophyll, while the large purple
area on the back with its white marginal line is entirely normal.
       4.   Colours due  to Larval  Tissues independently of Pigment.
   There is one sentence in Dr. Weismann's essay (on the markings
of caterpillars) which shows that he attributes importance to the
deeply placed substances in producing larval markings.             Speaking of
the second stage of the larva of Macroglossa Stellatarum (p. 246,
English translation), he says: — "A dark green dorsal line, which,
however, does not arise from the deposition of pigment, as is gene
rally   the case, but from a division in the folds of the fatty
tissue along this position." According to my experience the dorsal
line is generally formed in this way when its colour is similar
to that of the ground colour, except for a deeper tint.              This divi
sion in the folds of fat is occupied by the dorsal vessel, and the
latter can be distinctly seen contracting; its margins being thus
shown to be coextensive with the dorsal line, which is therefore
really due to the derived pigment in the blood.              (This is true of
S.  Ocellatus,   Sphinx Ligustri, &c.)      But  the superficial colours can
be caused by an accumulation of internal tissues immediately beneath
the transparent skin quite independently of pigment.                 Weismann
implies in the above-quoted sentence that the fat exercises a modifying
influence upon colour.       But it may do more than this ; it may be the
only factor in certain markings.        I  have already described (" Trans.
Ent. Soc," April, 1884) a Phytophagous Hymenopterous                       larva
Nematus (Curtispina')      in which  the  dark-green  dorsal  line  was  due   to
the blood of the dorsal vessel, while on each side of this line there was

1885.]               Colouring   of Phytophagous Larva;.                    211
a broad white band. Examination proved that the white bands moved
with the contractions of the dorsal vessel, and showed the charac
teristic structure of fatty tissue.      Dissection and the use of the micro
scope     confirmed these conclusions.     The rest of the larva was green
(due to its blood), with a slight black shading below the white bands.
The shading was the only part of the colour due to larval pigment.
The skin was so transparent that the tracheal system was quite
distinct, and the fat was removed from all the conspicuous surfaces
(except in the region of the bands) through which it would have been
visible, and would have added other white markings.            But this tissue
was collected superficially along the median ventral line, producing a
ventral white band, which was always hidden, for the larva rests with
its ventral surface applied to the edge of a leaf.
     Last autumn (1884)        I  found that fat can also serve as the
vehicle for other colours.        I  was working at another of the Phyto
phagous Hymenoptera        —  the larva of Crcesus Septentrionalis, and I
found that the yellow colour round the lips of the seven median
ventral eversible glands is due to fat collected at these points, and
the yellow colour of the posterior segments also depends upon the
same cause, the colour being contained in the fat globules themselves.
     It is extremely likely that fat will prove to be a more important
factor in larval colouring than has been hitherto supposed.
5.    Changes in the Two Factors of Larval Colouration before Pupation.
     It has already been mentioned that the superficial derived pigments
 of S. Ligustri become brown in the dorsal region, before pupation,
 while the colour of the blood is unchanged.          In D. Vinula the whole
 larva becomes reddish-brown,        and in this case the green blood changes
 to brownish-yellow.      The true larval pigment also changes before
 pupation, except when     it is cuticular.   Thus the larva of E. Angularia
 becomes transparent by the disappearance of dark pigment, and the
 green blood gives its colour to the larva.         The green colour of the
 blood is generally retained in the pupal state, and it is often of great
 importance, as will be shown presently.             The changes in colour
 before pupation alluded to      above,  are for the protection of the larvae
 in their new surroundings, against which their old colouration would be
 very conspicuous.     And this is therefore only true of a limited number
 of larvae which wander in search of a place in which to pupate, or are
 exposed against a new background (as E. Angularia).             In all larvae,
 however (except those entirely coloured by cuticular pigment), the
 colours ultimately fade in the quiescent and contracted state imme
 diately preceding pupation.        Even in green Noctua larvtB coloured by
  their blood, the fat is no longer withdrawn from the surface, and the
  dpop green tint can only be seen in the interstices of this lobulated
  tissue.

  278           Mr. E. B. Poulton.        Essential Nature   of  the    [Apr.  23,
     In some cases     there are indications of quite new markings in the
  changes preceding pupation.           Thus in the larva of G. Libalrix black
  patches appear on the sides of two (I believe) of the anterior seg
 ments, while green patches appear on corresponding                parts of the
  larva of Selenia Illunaria.
                       6. The Causes    of Colour in Pupce.
     In the pupae of nearly all Heterocera (except the few that are pro
  tectively coloured like the larvae, e.g., Ephyridce, E. Angularia, Ac.),
  the larval colours have entirely disappeared from the surface, and are
 replaced by the darkened opaque cuticle of the pupa. The derived
 pigments are, however, generally retained in the blood.               Before the
 covering has darkened, immediately after the last ecdysis, the pupa
 possesses    a colour  partly due to its blood (when coloured), and partly
 to its fat body.      The effect of the former is seen in the parts where
 the latter is absent, especially in the wings, legs, and antennae.          These
 parts   are therefore    green   or yellow in  the pupae of which   the  blood  is
 coloured by derived pigments.            The rest of the body is white, and
 through the transparent cuticle the lobulated fat body can be dis
 tinctly seen. These appearances can only be witnessed for a very short
 time, since the semi-fluid surface rapidly darkens into the normal
 reddish-brown or black ; although it is not uncommon for the colour
 of the blood to be seen through the cuticle of the wings — the most
 transparent part.       There are, however, instances in which some of the
 true larval markings can be traced upon the pupa directly after emer
 gence from the larval skin.           Thus in S. Ligustri the oblique stripes
 are distinctly seen upon their respective segments.             In a specimen
 placed in spirit before the appearances were obscured, the oblique stripes
 have darkened into brown, while the surrounding surface remains
 comparatively pale.        This subject will repay future investigation, and
 I think it is probable that larval markings will prove to be commonly
present upon the pupae, if examined sufficiently early.               When the
pupae    of  Heterocera    are  freely exposed,  the constitution  of  their pro
tective colouring is similar to that of the larvae. Thus in the dimorphic
 (green or brown) species of Ephyra larva, the colour of the pupa
follows that of the larva. The green is due to chlorophyll in the
blood, and the colour         is especially deep over the wings and adjaceut
surfaces.      The depth of colour is produced in certain positions by
reflection from a white surface of fat behind a layer of green blood,
the light having thus traversed the fluid twice ; while in other positions
the pupa is transparent.             There are also black markings in the
Ephyra pupa, which are due to cuticular pigment, and                    therefore
remain in the empty pupa case.
    The pupa of A. Grossulariata is believed to be gaudily               coloured

1885.]                 Colouring    of  Phytophagous* Larvce.                 279
(black and yellow) as a signal of distastefulness, and the appearance
is entirely due to cuticular pigment, and persists in the empty shell.
The pupae of Rhopalocera are nearly all exposed, and protectively
coloured.       Most of the colours are due to the above-described causes,
derived or proper pigment ; but in some cases they cannot be the
result of pigment at all, and have not yet been sufficiently investigated
(e.g., the metallic colours of Vanessa pupae).           I have worked at the
colour in the pupa of P. Machaon, which appears in two chief forms
connected       by intermediate varieties, the forms being coloured by
derived and proper pigments respectively.             Those coloured by derived
pigments are yellow or green and yellow, the green being pre
dominant in the anterior part of the body, especially the wings, <fec,
 but also occurring in minute lines and masses mixed with the
 yellow. The other form is grey with dark markings.                   The blood
 is always bright yellow, with contained xanthophyll, but this does
 not aid the superficial colour, as the cuticle is opaque. The derived
 pigments are contained in a remarkable and very complicated layer
  beneath the true cuticle.        This layer is very finely lamellated, but at
  the same time possesses a prismatic structure, being composed of
  columns arranged vertically to the surface, and themselves made up
  of parallel fibrilltB.    It is cuticularised, and stains deeply in picric acid,
   but it is sharply marked off by a fine homogeneous membrane from
   the true cuticle above, and the subcuticular tissues below.                The
   whole structure needs further investigation, but          I  believe that the
   layer is a cuticularised and very complex result of the differentiation
   of the hypodermis        cells. The pigments are contained in the outer
   lamella*, while the inner remain white.          Although the layer is very
   firm and completely united to the true cuticle (which it resembles in
   consistence), neither itself nor its contents are beyond the reach of
   the physiological processes of the organism, for the pigments are
    withdrawn shortly before the emergence of the imago, and the wings
   of the latter are visible through the now transparent covering.             At
   the same time the whole inner layer must itself disappear, for the
    empty pupa cases of this species are thin, and evidently composed of
    the true cuticle only, as in other pupae ; while the inner layer makes
    the whole pupal covering very thick, being itself many times thicker
    than the true cuticle.      I have no doubt that this layer will be found
    commonly in Rhopalocera, and it is probably correlated with the
    extreme development of protective colours in the pupae of this group.
    The pupal pigments upon the dark varieties, and in some parts of
    most of the green varieties, are placed in the true cuticle.
                 7.  The Ultimate Use of the Derived Pigments.
       In many species there is a great positive gain in retaining the
     derived pigments    in the blood (or other part) of the pupa, for by their
       vol. xxxvm.                                                       x

280            Mr. E. B. Poulton.          Essential Nature    of the   [Apr.  23,
means the ova are coloured             green or yellow, and the pigments are
passed     down   into  the  next  generation.    In this way the newly hatched
larva is tinged, and the break in protective colouring is thus filled up,
which would otherwise occur before the results of the first meal could
become manifest.           Hence it might be supposed that the pigments
would be retained in the case of female pupae laying green eggs, but
not necessarily always in the case of males.                Nevertheless the pig
ments appear to be retained equally in both sexes, the only partial
exceptions (if any exist) being in the case of dimorphic larvae (green
and brown) of which the females are more generally green and the
 males brown, and I do not think that there are any authentic instances
                                                      "
of such a division. In Newman's " Moths it is stated of C. Elpenor
"
   caterpillar green or brown, the males generally brown," but I have
never heard of any confirmation of this statement, and furthermore,
the existence of a brown female larva would have to be explained.
Last autumn the only larva I could obtain of this species was brown,
with brown blood in the pupa, and it proved to be a male.                 It may,
however, be considered certain that the females are sometimes brown,
for all collectors seem to admit that the brown variety is far com
moner than the green.             It would be well to investigate the subject
from     this point  of  view.     But I have already stated that the derived
pigments are present in the brown blood of this species —in fact the
characteristic spectrum of green blood was faintly but distinctly
recognisable.       Thus it is possible that there is sufficient pigment to
tinge the ova, if collected in a comparatively small compass. Another
possibility is that the pigments may undergo a slight change rendering
them colourless, and that they are reconstructed for the ova. Against
this hypothesis it must be urged that some of the pigment certainly
remains unchanged.           With the exception of this unsettled question
my     observations     point   uniformly in the same direction.          I   have
examined the blood in the pupae of              the  following species which lay
green eggs : — Smerinthus OceUatus, Populi, and Tilice, Sphinx Liguttri.
In all cases the blood is green. E. Angularia is also another in
stance, the larva before pupation, the pupa itself, and the eggs being
greenish.
    On the other hand, D. Vinula lays large eggs, but they are reddish-
brown from a deposit in the chitinous covering, and resemble spots on
the leaves — to the upper sides of which they are affixed— and the
young larvae are black and are protected in the same way.                  In this
species     the  blood    of  the  pupa   has   lost the  green  colour  which    it
 possessed    in the larva, becoming brownish-yellow.
    It  is easy to extract xanthophyll in alcoholic solution from ova in
the bodies of female moths which have been preserved as cabinet
specimens for many years.             The eggs, when tinged by derived pig
ments, seem to owe most          of  their  colour to xanthophyll, and they are

 1885.J             Colouring   of Phytophagous    Larva.                281
 generally of a very yellowish-green.      In the case of E. Angularia the
eggs present (on a microscopic examination) a yellowish ground colour,
with lines and patches of green. The pigments, at any rate partially,
are dissolved in oil globules.      The ova are opaque, and are coloured
by reflected light, although no doubt a certain depth of substance is
penetrated.      In the same manner the newly hatched larva is always
yellower than one which has taken a meal, apparently due to the pre
dominance of xanthophyll in the former.          In some cases there seems
to be a segregation of the small amount of chlorophyll to a special
part. Thus the head of the newly hatched 8. Lignstri is green, while
the rest of the body is yellow.       These facts of the predominance of
xanthophyll   in  the ovum  and  young larva are no doubt to be explained
by the great stability of this derived pigment. Duo to the same cause,
this substance can be extracted from dried and blown larvae that have
been kept for many years, while the chlorophyll has entirely dis
appeared.    It is probable that the green or yellow colour of the ovum
is protective, especially considering that large and therefore easily
seen ova are most generally tinted in this way, and because they seem
to be deposited on the side of the leaf against which they would be
least conspicuous (as I have noticed in the case of S. Ligustri).        But
the chief use of the pigments must be for the young larva, which
often rests for some time before feeding, which is active, and there
fore more easily recognised, and which does not possess a firm resistent
covering like that of the ovum.
             8. The Probable    History of Larval Colouration.
   It  seems probable  that food in the digestive tract was the first  cause
of larval colour.    In root-feeding and other colourless   larvae the  dark
contents of the digestive tract are distinctly seen through the trans
parent varieties, and in many transparent coloured Iarvae the same
cause certainly helps to confer depth of colour.        It is also probable
that a dark dorsal line, due to the fluid contents of the dorsal vessel,
was a very early marking, as also must have been the external effect of
superficially placed fat. The next step would probably be the passage
of the plant pigments through the digestive tract into the blood, and
next from the blood into the subcuticular tissues, finally into so
remarkable a tissue as that shown in P. Machaon.          The employment
of true pigment seems to be on the whole posterior in date to the use
of derived pigment, and the former at first appears on the highly
protected surfaces, the back and upper parts of the sides, conferring a
distinct advantage in its greater number of available tints. In opaque
larvae, such as many brown Geometers, the green tints are still seen
on the inner surfaces of the large posterior claspers where it was
unnecessary to replace the older method of colouration.          15ut these
                                                                 x 2

             Mr. E. B. Poulton.           Essential Nature      of the     [Apr.   23,
 stages were by no means mutually exclusive, or even necessarily
 successive, for each new method was an additional resource, not often
 to replace the rest, but in nearly all cases to be used with them.
 Hence the one of the commonest associations is a ground tint partially
 due to derived pigments in the blood, and also sometimes segregated
 beneath the cuticle, while special markings are conferred by true pig
 ments generally placed in the hypodermis cells, although sometimes
 cuticular in position.          The derived pigments more often confer
 general resemblances, the true pigments, special resemblances. Again
 the association is well seen in the use made of fat as a reflecting
 surface behind the transparent green blood.             The fact that the colour
 due to derived pigments is almost incidental at first is shown by the
possession of green blood by certain leaf-mining genera entirely con
cealed from view, as is pointed out by Mr. Meldoia.
    We can now summarise the causes of colour in larvae with                     some
attempt at the historic order of their employment : —

     9. Spectroscopic  Examination of      the Blood    o/ Lepidopterous    Larvm
                                      and Pupm.
    Tn the following investigation       Zeks's microspectroscope was          always
employed, and proved to be extremely delicate and convenient on all
occasions. The instrument was very kindly lent to me by Professor
 Hurdon Sanderson.         A paraffin lamp was at first used as the means of
illumination, and it acted very well for the less refrangible half of
 the spectrum, but in all later work bright sunlight was alone employed
 because of its immense superiority at the violet end.
    The blood was always obtained in such a way as to prevent admix
ture with the contents of the digestive tract or any secretions.
 Success in this attempt is aided by the fact that the blood exists
 under considerable pressure, so that after a minute prick, only just
penetrating the hypodermis, a considerable quantity at once issues. In
larvae the distal parts of the claspers were generally pricked, the spot
being chosen     because of its situation at some distance from .the diges

1885.]                 Colouring of Phytophagous     Larvce.               283
tive tract.      If the digestive tract had accidentally broken, fragments
of the food would have been found in the blood when examined
under the microscope, whereas it was always perfectly clear, con
taining only colourless corpuscles, fat-cells, and minute spherules of fat,
which gradually came to the surface. Pupae were generally pricked
through the cuticle of the wings, and here also a considerable quan
tity of blood emerged under pressure. The whole of the blood was
obtained by pushing the abdominal             segments inwards, and ulti
mately by gradually increasing compression of the pupa. Owing to
histolytic changes, the weak and thin-walled digestive tract is
broken, and a red fluid escapes, which is mixed with the last of the
blood.      By carefully watching for the first appearance of the red fluid,
the blood may be obtained in a perfectly pure state, exactly resembling
that of the larva in clearness and in microscopic contents. A con
siderable quantity of gas also emerges usually just before the ap
 pearance of the fluid contents of the digestive tract, from which the
gas also probably comes.         The blood is received into sections of glass
 tubes of various lengths, with the ends carefully ground.            One end
 is cemented with Dammar varnish to a glass slide, and when the tube
 is filled with blood a cover-glass is placed upon the open end, and
 becomes fixed by the drying of the blood.          In most cases the blood
 so prepared will keep for months without change.            If, however, air
 be admitted, an opaque black clot is formed on the          surface,  and the
 rest of the blood becomes cloudy.         It will also keep, I believe, in
 definitely in sealed tubes.
     The Spectrum of Unaltered Blood. — (a.) Larvm of P. Meticulosa. —
  These larvae were very suitable for investigation,      as all varieties of
  colour between green and brown are common.           The blood of a green
  larva was taken up (December 12th, 1884) by a capillary tube with an
  internal diameter of about -75 mm. The blood was allowed to stand
  four days, during which it evaporated to about half its bulk, but did not
  otherwise change ; the tube was then sealed up. The colour was bright
  green, becoming darker after concentration.        The spectrum was care-
 folly noted (December 29th, 1884), a paraffin lamp being used. There
  was a broad band in the red, of which the extreme edges extended
  from 64'5 — 68'5, and when this band was best seen the violet end was
  cut off at 51, and the green was darkened to 52.        There was no ab
  sorption  of the red end. When the blood was fresh (December 12th,
  1884)  and   less concentrated, the blue came through on the violet side
  of the darkening at 51, thus showing a broad dark band between this
 part and the green. A more concentrated sample of similar blood, pre
 pared    in the same way and at the same time, gave a darker band in
  the red with the same limits but with more defined edges.        The violet
  end was similarly absorbed.      There were indistinct traces of a broad
  dim band about 59 — 61-5.

284            Mr. E. B. Poulton.     Essential Nature of  the   [Apr. 23,
    The two tubes superposed gave a more marked spectrum, but the
need of      stronger light was much felt.    The dark band broadened,
extending towards the red end to 69'5, and past 64 towards the
violet, dimming the red, and apparently uniting with the dim band
at 60.     The edge of this latter was nevertheless slightly darker than
the dimmed red. The absorption of the violet end was unchanged.
    The fresh blood of a larva of the same species, which had been
bright green (due to its blood), but which after ecdysis became
brown, was examined         (December 31st, 1884) in a wide capillary tube
about 1 mm. in internal diameter.        The blood was almost colourless,
very faintly yellow, and produced no effect on the spectrum.
    At   the same     time the fresh blood of another individual of the
same    species, which was dark greenish-brown, due to a combination
of   subcuticular    pigment and green blood, was examined in a capil
lary tube.
    The compound character of the larval colouring was proved by
gentle pressure.        The pale green blood with a thickness of about
1 mm. gave the band in the red from 65 — 68, the violet end, being
completely absorbed at 45, darkened to 51 (when the slit was narrowed
so    as to render the band distinct).       A greater thickness of blood
darkened the band, and cut off the violet end at 50, darkening to 52
 (when the band was distinct). A still greater thickness produced
more marked results with nearly the same limits. On widening the
 slit no blue appeared at the absorbed end. The dark band now
 seemed to extend       to 68'5. The whole spectrum was much dimmed,
 but this was probably due to the accidental presence of fat in the
 blood.     In this case the thickness of the fluid was 3-3 mm., and the
 colour was bright green.
     The fresh blood of another individual of the same species, which
 was of a mahogany-brown         colour, due to subcuticular pigment, was
 examined at the same time. When the larva was gently compressed,
 it became slightly yellowish-green in the swollen uncompressed part.
 A thickness of 4'5 mm. was faintly yellowish.
     The spectrum showed a very faint band in the red, and the violet end
 was cut off as before, only less sharply and completely. Thus the latter
 character is more delicate as a test than the former.         Hence in this
 considerable thickness there was far less effect than that produced
 by tho blood of the last individual in a capillary tube. After being
  exposed to the air for 2^ hours the blood became brown, but there was
  no difference in the spectrum.
     Another brown individual of the same species was examined at
  the same time.        When gently compressed it emitted a clear green
  fluid from the mouth, exactly resembling the blood of a green indi
  vidual in its colour and transparency when examined in a thickness of
  2-25 mm. (except that this was a little darker).

1835.]                  Colouring of Phytophagous           Larvm.                28.3
    The spectrum showed the band in the red from                   65-5 — 68-5,  while
the blue was cut off at 50, darkened to 52. The band was very sharp
and distinct.
     The blood of this individual was also examined, and it was of the
same colour as the last, and possessed the same spectroscopic charac
teristics.      This observation upon the green fluid from this digestive
 tract is important, because it serves to identify the chlorophyll in the
 blood with that taken in as food.           It  is likely, however, that a greater
 thickness      of fluid and the     use of     sunlight would bring out some
 differences between the derived pigment dissolved in the digestive
 secretions, and that united with a proteid in the blood.                  It is also
 noteworthy      that  the chlorophyll    was   present   in solution.
     All the observations hitherto recorded were made with the illu
 mination of a paraffin lamp.            Early in January I found how much
  more could be seen        in   these spectra at the violet end by the use
  of bright sunlight. About the middle of January the more con
  centrated of the two specimens of green blood in sealed tubes was
  examined by sunlight, and the spectrum mapped (see Chart,
  Spectrum 1). The band in the red, reaching from 64'5 — 68, was
  very black,        except at the edges.            When this band was most
  distinct and clear the violet end was absorbed to 51, darkened
  to 52.     On opening the slit a little, the blue came through (though
  dimmed) at 48, the violet end being absorbed at 43.                     When the
  slit was very narrow, traces of another band, from 59-5 — 61-5, were
  faintly seen.       The spectrum was unchanged at the end of March,
  although the blood had been exposed to light for a considerable time.
  The two chief bands and the absorption of the violet end were also
  seen in the blood of a living larva by passing the light through one
  of the   claspers.
      (6.) The  Pupa of Pygaera Bucephalus. — The blood of this species is of
  a very bright and beautiful green colour.           I have examined it on a great
  many occasions,      with  all  conditions   of  daylight. In the Chart, Spec
  trum 3, is shown the spectrum of the thickness of 23' 5 mm. examined
   with bright sunlight. The characteristic band in the red ends sharply
  at 71, gradually at about 64'5, passing into a lesser absorption of the
   red, which is continuous with the second band, extending from about 58
   — 60-5, but with very indistinct limits.            When these appearances are
   best seen the violet end is completely absorbed to 52, darkened to 52-5.
   On opening the slit a little, the dimmed blue comes through                from 48
   —42. The band in the blue now sharply ends at 52, gradually at 48.
   Diminishing the thickness of the blood to 8 mm. produces nearly the
   same spectrum, the band in the red being a little narrower, while the
   band at D cannot be detected.            On diminishing the thickness still
   farther to 1 mm., another band appears             in the violet. The spectrum
   is as  follows  : —The   characteristic    band from 65 — 70, the chief band

286          Mr. E. B. Poulton.        Essential Nature of  the  [Apr.   23.
of the blue end 48 — 51, the second band of the blue end 45 — 4675,
the violet being absorbed at 41.        The second band of the bine end is
much fainter than the first band, and it is not seen in a thickness
of  5 mm.
   (c.) The Pupa of     S. Tiliae. — The blood was very bright green and
perfectly clear. A     thickness of 5 mm. was examined with the light
of a paraffin lamp.      The spectrum showed a very broad band in the
red from 64'5 — 70,     while the red and orange were much dimmed.
The violet end was absorbed to 50, dimmed to 51, and no blue came
through on widening. The green was the only part of the spectrum
which was not dimmed.          A thickness of about 1 mm. gave the band
                      —
in the red from 66 69 (but the limits were very difficult to ascertain
exactly), and the violet end was absorbed to 49, darkened to 51, while
the blue came through on widening.

   (d.) The Pupa of S. Populi. The blood was examined by the light
of a paraffin lamp, in a thickness of 5 mm. The colour was bright
yellowish-green.     The spectrum showed the broad band from 66 — 69,
while the violet end was cut off at 51, darkened to 52. No blue came
through on opening the slit (with this source of light).
    (e.) The Pupa of S. Ocellatus.
                                      — The blood is of a bright yellowish-
green colour (rather pale).       I have examined many specimens by sun
light. A thickness of 4 mm. shows traces of the band in the red, and
with great care and the right conditions of light, gives three bands in
the blue end as well as an absorption of the extreme end. The chief
band is from 48 — -50'3, the second from 46' 75 — 45, and the third,
which is very faint (and best seen when the slit is widened until the
violet is absorbed at 41), occupies 43 — 42. With less thickness the
characteristic band in the red disappears, while with greater thickness
it becomes very distinct. After addiug absolute alcohol to the blood,
a bright yellow solution of xanthophyll was obtained, which gave
the characteristic spectrum (shifted to the violet) 49 — 47, 45'25 — 44,
the violet being absorbed at 42.
                                         I
    (/.) The Pupa of S. Ligustri. — have also examined the blood of
 many individuals of this species by sunlight. The colour is a slightly
 greenish-yellow    in individuals that have fed upon lilac in the larval
 state, yellow in those that have fed upon privet.         The spectrum is
 marked by very slight effects at the red end, but very powerful
 absorption of the violet. In a thickness of 35 mm. the absorption in the
 red was strong, but did not approach that of a thickness of 23'5 mm.
 of the P. Buctpkalus, although the absorption of violet was much mow
 complete.     The spectrum of this thickness of the blood of S. Ligustri
 is shown   in  the Chart, Spectrum 2, whilst Spectrum 3 is the Buce
 phalus blood which contrasts with it very markedly at both ends of
 the spectrum.      The characteristic band is seen to extend from 70
 (ending sharply) to 64-5, becoming gradually continuous with a less

absorption extending to D, and of which the part from 59 — CO cor
responds to the second band of the less refrangible                 part of the
spectrum      and  the   third   band   of true   chlorophyll.    The  violet end
is completely absorbed from 51-5, dimmed to 52, but on widening the
slit a little blue comes        through on the violet side of       48 ; but very
dimly.
    A thickness of 3 mm. gives no absorption of the red end, but shows
three bands at the violet end and an absorption of the extreme end.
The bands are (1), the chief band, from 50 — 48 ; (2), the second band,
from 46-25     — 45; and (3), the third band, from            42 —43; the violet
being absorbed at 41.         The bands become less distinct in the order
above given, and between them the spectrum is dimmed.                 The second
and    third are best seen by an illumination from the bright sky near
the    sun rather than from the sun itself. This spectrum is shown in
the Chart,     Spectrum    6.
    Comparing     the spectra of the blood from pupae of which the larvae
had fed upon different foods,       it was found that the lilac-fed individuals
showed greater       effect at the red end than the privet-fed individuals,
while the converse was true of the violet end. The comparison was
made in a thickness of about 8 mm. and by sunlight.
    (g.) The Pupa of C. Elpenor. — A single specimen of the blood of
this pupa (from a brown larva) was examined (February 19th, 1885).
The colour was a clear reddish-brown in thick layers, almost colour
less in a thickness of 3- 75 mm.            It was examined in thicknesses of
23 mm.      and 8 mm. In the former the spectra of derived chlorophyll
and     xanthophyll were distinct (although the colour was not per
ceptible).      There was a faint band in the red from 69'5 (ending
sharply), gradually lessening to 65.           There was the chief band at the
violet end from 50'5 — 48, and the second band was present from
46-25 — 45, and even the third band from 43 — 42, the violet end
 being absorbed at 41. These appearances were only seen in certain
conditions of light.        The first to disappear is the third band, for it
fuses with the absorption at the end of the violet, which, there
fore, seems to be absorbed to 43.              This is common in other cases
 also.    The lesser thickness also showed these effects at the blue end,
 bat not at the red end.

 of a reddish-yellow colour (by lamplight).               It was examined in a
 thickness of 2-55 mm. by the light of a paraffin lamp (December 29th,
 1885).      There were no bands visible, but the violet end was absorbed
 up to about 50.

 48, very   distinct ; the second 46'25—45, less marked but distinct ; the
 third 43 — 42, very indistinct ; the violet end absorbed at 41. In all
 but the best light the violet end was absorbed to 43, and the third
 band ceased to exist separately.        A thickness of 8 mm. tends further
 towards this absorption      to  43, and the chief band extends to 50'5, or
 even a little further. The spectrum was the same in blood from all
 varieties.    An alcoholic extract (90 per cent, spirit) of a grey variety
 was bright orange-yellow, and gave nearly the same spectrum as the
 blood, except that the bands were shifted to the violet end, and the
 third faint band was absent. The spectrum was : chief band 49 —47,
 second 45-5 — 44, violet end absorbed           to 42.  The extract   was  ex
 amined in a thickness of 23 mm. and 9'5 mm.
    A  drop of water was placed upon a cover-glass          and the latter was
inverted upon the yellow back of         a  living pupa of P. Machaon, which
 was then examined by reflected light, being entirely opaque. The
following spectrum was indistinctly seen : — A band in the red (very
                                        —                       —
faint) 65 — 63, the chief band 49 47, the second 45-5 44, the violet
end being absorbed to 42.             The green parts of the same pupa,
similarly   treated,  gave  the  following results : — 69 — 64 in the red, 52 —
48.     Pieces taken from the yellow parts of the pupal covering gave
a similar spectrum to that above described when strong sunlight, con
centrated by an Abbe's condenser, was passed through them ; the
green parts were more opaque, but tho spectrum gave the chief bands
distinctly. However treated, the spectra of the derived pigments still
contained in the pupal covering are very indistinct.           This is probably
due to the nearly solid condition in which the pigments exist in
association with some animal basis.              The alcoholic extract of the
covering, with its internal surface carefully washed to remove
adherent blood, &c, gradually becomes yellow with dissolved xantho-
phyll. The green parts, carefully washed, dried, and placed in carbon

gave this spectrum in a thickness of 24 mm.              Band in the red 70 —
66, chief band in the blue 5T5 — 48, the violet being absorbed at 44.
These appearances were indistinctly made out in bad light.
    (j.) The Pupa of Ephyra Punctaria. — The pupa is green anteriorly,
especially on the wings, and examined as an opaque object by means
of Abbe's condenser (and a stop which blocked the central rays), with
good sunlight, the following spectrum was seen : — Band in the red
70 — 65, a   faint but distinct band 63 — 61, and the band 48 — 52, or 51
when the slit was widened ; the violet absorbed at 43. This spectrum
is remarkable as being the only instance yet observed in which the
second band from the red end, of true chlorophyll, was seen separately,
and occurred in the right order.           For in all other pups and larvw
the third band appeared after the first, and then the second as a
shading connecting the former two.            The colour is entirely due to the

 blood, which, however, does not after removal give a spectrum equal
to that of the living pupa, because the amount (from one specimen) is
so small, and is disposed in the pupa so as to produce a maximum
effect.
     (k.) The Larva of S. Populi, which had been blown and dried many
years ago, was of a bright yellow colour (with a few small streaks
and patches of green).            The larval parieties were washed in water
and placed in 90 per cent. spirit, which became bright yellow in a few
hours, and gave the two bands of xanthophyll (shifted to the violet).*
     (I.) The Ova of E. Angularia were of a yellowish-green colour.                  A
single ovum examined as an opaque object gave the following spec
trum : 51 — 48, 4675 —45, the violet being absorbed at 43. Although
I   could not detect the band in the red,         I believe that a small propor
tion of chlorophyll exists in the ovum, as there are some bright green
patches surrounded by the far more abundant yellow.                       The same
spectrum was seen in the contents of the ovum which were also
better treated by reflected light.            The bands of xanthophyll were
seen in the alcoholic         extract   of the crushed ova, the violet being
absorbed to 43.
     (w.) The Ova of S. Tiliae, Ocellatus, and Sphinx Ligustri were taken
from the bodies of moths which had been in my store-boxes for many
years (8 — 10), and were well washed to remove any of the abdomi
nal contents      which adhered to their outer surfaces. The ova were
then     crushed    in a mortar and extracted by 90 per cent. spirit, which
in all cases     yielded a yellow solution giving the spectrum of xantho-
pbyll.
     10. Comparison of the above Results with those yielded by unaltered
 Plant Pigments. — It is of importance for me to give the result of the
 spectroscopic examination of leaves by the use of the same instru
 ment as that employed for the pigments in the larvae and pupae.
     Two calceolaria leaves were superposed, gently compressed, and
 examined by sunlight, giving the spectrum shown on the Chart
 (Spectrum 4).         There is a distinct black band from 70 — 64'5, two
 faint bands from 63 (nearly) to a little past 61, and from 60 (nearly)
 — 57-5. There was also a dark band from 51 — 47'5, with the dimmed
 blue coming through between this and 43, from which the violet end
 was completely       absorbed.
     When five leaves were treated in the same way, results were ob
 tained which are shown on the Chart, Spectrum 5, the three bands at
 the red end being wider, and the second and third much                        darker,
 while    the violet end was completely absorbed up to 51, darkened to
 52.     The same results were seen in the leaves of other plants.
     * After twelve hours the spectrum was as follows, in a thickness of 35 mm. :—
 chief band, 47 — 49, very distinct i second band, 44 — 45' 5, faint but distinct ; the
  violet end absorbed at 43. — May 4th, 1885.

  Comparing these two spectra with those of green blood (not yellow)
(Chart, Spectra 1, 2, and 3), the resemblance is seen to be very
great, the chief differences being in the second and third bands of the
red end, which are continuous (Chart, Spectra 2 and 3), while the
third is developed before the second (Chart, Spectrum 1). Considering
the chemical   change which must have taken place in the chlorophyll
during digestion, rendering possible the passage of the walls of the
digestive tract, and considering its chemical union with a proteid
constituent   of the blood, the resemblances of the spectra are very
striking ; in fact, the two spectra are far nearer to each other than the
ordinary spectrum of chlorophyll in alcoholic solution is to the unal
tered chlorophyll of leaves.         I
                                    believe, however, that the perfectly
fresh           solution gives a spectrum resembling that of the leaf,
        alcoholic
but the spectrum changes in a few seconds, so rapidly is the solutiou
acted on by light.       I
                       have never seen a band in the green in cater
pillar's blood, and yet the blood is acid (Mr. Sorby states that any dis
tinct band in the green is due to acidity).*     I have not been able to
satisfy myself  of the fluorescence  of green caterpillar blood, certainly
there is not the marked red fluorescence of the alcoholic solution of
chlorophyll. But this red fluorescence is not present in leaves, nor in
the perfectly fresh solution, according to J. Reinke (" Bied. Centr.,"

may be due to one or more of the lichnoxanthines, while the third
band    isnot always present, and      probably that to which Mr. Sorby
                                          is
alludes when he states (concerning the xanthophylls) that " some
times three absorption-bands may be seen but in that case

generally easy to prove, either by chemical or photochemical methods,

probablo that  a  sufficient thickness of this blood will give a spectrum identical
with that of the leaf, but nevertheless the derived pigment must have been changed
in such a way as to render    itstable in solution. — May 4th, 1885.

 (or even whether there are more than one.        The immense complexity
of the subject and the many shades of opinion are seen in a paper by
Dr. A. Tschirch, " On the Preparation of Pare Chlorophyll,"        " Journ.
of Chem.    Soc," February,    1884, p. 57).
    Nevertheless,  the difference between the spectrum of the yellow
covering of P. Machaon and of its yellow blood, is just that figured
by Mr. Sorby in his paper already quoted
                                                  — a shifting of both the
bands towards the violet end in the former case.       At the same time it
is probable that there is a difference in the animal substance with
which the pigment is associated in these two cases, and this may
account for some difference.      The chlorophyll cannot have exercised a
modifying effect on the results given above as due to xanthophyll
(Chart, Spectrum 6), for when the spectrum of the latter was seen
in the unaltered blood, the thickness employed was so slight that the
band of chlorophyll in the red could not be seen, and further yel
lowish blood was made use of. In the blood of P. Machaon the
bands    of  chlorophyll could not be seen even in a considerable
thickness.    When green blood (e.g., P. Bucephalus) was examined
for xanthophyll,     the latter was obtained in ethereal or alcoholic
solution (the chlorophyll always disappearing with the latter solvent,
becoming fixed in the solid state with the latter).           On the other
hand it is certain that the bands of xanthophyll are present in the
spectrum of green blood (such as P. Bucephalus, Spectrum 3), the
first band being contained in that from 52 — 48, and the second
being rendered invisible because of the greater darkening of the violet
between 48 and 42.        The extreme absorption of the violet end shown
in Spectrum     2  (S.  Ligustri) is due to chlorophyll, xanthophyll, and,
possibly, lichnoxanthine ; and in this general absorption the chloro
phyll takes a small part as compared with the next spectrum (Chart 3),
as is at once seen on comparing their absorption at the red end.
     11. Conditions    under which   the  Derived Pigments exist in the
                                   Larva,  Sfc.
    There is one essential difference between the chlorophyll (especially )
 in solution in caterpillar blood or tissues, and all other solutions of the
 same   substance, in the great stability of the former under the pro
 longed action of light.     The necessity for this is obvious, inasmuch
 as the colour of the larvaa often depends upon their complete translu-
 cence (P. Meticulosa, &c), and very many of them rest in such a posi
 tion as to be freely exposed to direct   sunlight. Further more there are
 long pauses   in larval life, during which no food is taken to renew
 the  derived pigments.      Such occur at the various ecdyses, and the
  colours do not fade at these times, nor when the larva; are from any
  cause deprived of food.     Hence it is seen that the pigments, having

.
   292         Mr. E. B. Poulton.         Essential Nature of       the    [Apr. 23,
  reached the blood or tissues, are in a state of great stability, and do
  not require renewal.        The same thing is even more forcibly shown in
   the persistence of the pigments in the pupae, and on into the ova and
  young larvae of the next generation.             But comparing these young
   larvae before and after their first meal, and remembering that their
  latter appearance more resembles the one that they will permanently
  keep (if they remain green), it is obvious that something has been
  lost to the derived pigments in the interval between pupation and the
   hatching of the ova (often six months, or longer) ; and the constituent
  that has been partially lost is the more unstable of the two under all
   circumstances — the chlorophyll.         It is not likely that the chlorophyll
   is partially eliminated by the action of light, for the pupal period
   is in nearly all cases passed in the dark. But it seems probable
   that pigment is lost in the various phases of redistribution gone
   through, as solution in fluid and deposition in tissue alternate.             It is
  perfectly certain     that  the   essential difference   in colour    between the
  newly-hatched larva (of a green species) and one that has fed, is the
  predominant yellow tinge and translucence of the former, and the
  green tinge and comparative opacity of the latter (not entirely due to
   the digestive tract being full).
      The same unusual stability is also true of the xanthophyll, and
   must be due to the same cause, association with a proteid of the
   blood or tissue.      The separation of the pigments from any con
   stituent of the blood is at once effected by the addition of alcohol.
   If  absolute alcohol be employed, the proteids are precipitated with
   the colouring matter, but the xanthophyll at once enters into
    solution in the alcohol, colouring it yellow, while the chlorophyll
   disappears, and the proteids are decolourised.              This must be due
   to the extreme instability of the chlorophyll, at any rate in the
  presence of alcohol when separated from the proteid, so that it
  breaks up into colourless compounds when separated from it. The
  xanthophyll dissolved in the alcohol slowly decomposes in daylight,
  but lasts for many weeks, the colour gradually fading.              Ether, on the
  other    hand,   precipitates   the  combined    pigments   and    proteid in the
  form of a green jelly (the upper part is generally darkened), and for
  some hours dissolves       no coloured constituent.       Eventually, however,
  it becomes bright yellow with xanthophyll ; while if the green
  coagulnm be broken up in the ether more xanthophyll is dissolved,
  and a small quantity of green fluid containing chlorophyll remains at
  the bottom.      This, however, is not dissolved in ether. The frag
  ments of the coagulum undergo no apparent change.
      If on the other hand the blood be protected from the air, the pig
  ments seem to exist indefinitely, and the fluid does not decompose.*              I
     * In those instances  in which the air has been entirely excluded   (when a tub*

have not yet tried exposing them to the prolonged action of bright
sunlight, but they have frequently withstood the effect of its concen
trated rays for several minutes during spectroscopic examination, and
have been exposed for weeks to ordinary daylight.
    But while the pigments exist unchanged in the blood of many larvas
for so     long a time, in other species they are entirely destroyed during
the comparatively short period preceding ecdysis, when some green
larvae become brown ; and conversely the pigments may appear in the
blood equally suddenly.             The former change must be due to an active
destruction or excretion of the pigments, and is probably also accom
panied by changes in the digestive tract, whereby no more pigment is
passed through its walls.             And so also, as will be seen, the proportions
of    xanthophyll and chlorophyll may be changed during the life of a
caterpillar.
    The pigments present in the pupal covering of P. Machaon yield to
solvent agents far more slowly than in any other place in which                       I
have found them, but this may be due to the resistant nature of the
tissue in which they are situated.               It cannot be said that they are
more stable than the pigments in the blood of the green Ephyra pupae,
for in both alike the pupaeare freely exposed to sunlight from autumn
to early summer, without the possibility of the renewal of pigment.
    It seems quite certain that the derived pigments of the blood and
tissues are only protective, and play no further part in the physiology
of these organisms.           Thus there are no marked differences between
the physiological processes of the brown and green individuals of the
same brood in a dimorphic species, or in the processes of a green larva
 which has become brown, or vice versd.               It seems that the pigments
are entirely harmless, and are often retained when they would have no
 effect upon colour.         Thus in P. Bucephalus, the blood is bright green,
 although the larva and pupa are entirely opaque, while the eggs, I
 believe, are white.         It is possible that in this case the conspicuous
 colours — which warn enemies that the species is distasteful — have
 »ection    has been completely  filled and protected by a cover-glass) the blood has
 generally remained clear and undecomposed.     When, on the other hand, the blood has
 been sealed up, a little air is unavoidably included, and the fluid generally decom
 poses,   although the pigments are not always destroyed.   The blood of the pupa of
 S.   Liguttri  was sealed up in a tube (with a little air) on March 20, 1885.      On
 May 17 the colour and transparency were unchanged, but a whitish cloud had
 appeared on one side of the tube. On breaking off the end of the tube the contents
 were found to be putrid and strongly acid, and a large quantity of gas issued under
 considerable pressure.    The whitish cloud was seen to be caused by the presence of
 large bacteria.    The fluid did not clot or blacken on being exposed to the air, and
 the spectrum of the clear portion showed that the pigments existed unchanged.     The
 spectrum was observed on May 22, five days after the contents of the tube had been
 exposed to the air and light, and two months after the blood had been taken from
  the  living pupa. — May 22, 1885.

" In addition to the classes of chlorophyll-containing animals men

by means of parasitic algae, a third class must now be added : those
which contain enterochlorophyll in their livers, or other appendages
of the enteron."      This fourth class comprises those animals which
make use of       a  modified  chlorophyll (and other plant pigments)
derived from their food, because of the protective colour which they
acquire from its presence in their blood or tissues.
 12. Notes upon the Physiology       and Chemistry of the Blood of Larvm
                                  and Pupos.
    Some interesting points came out incidentally during the course of
this investigation, and they are therefore mentioned, but only as a
 preliminary treatment of the subject which           I  hope to examine more
 completely during the present year. Much of this section is only
 suggestion.
    Reaction. — The blood of all larvae and            pupae   examined   (of all
colours) was acid to litmus-paper, turning          it distinctly reddish, with
the exception of E. Punctaria, which seemed to be neutral (although
 only one specimen was examined).           The acid which appears to be
 volatile can be extracted with ether, but           I  have not been able to
 obtain sufficient quantities of blood (during the winter) to determine
 what acid is present. The precautions previously detailed show how
 impossible it must have been to obtain any accidental mixture with
 digestive secretions.     Besides,   I have tested for the reaction of the
 blood upon a great many occasions, and again and again upon the
 same species.      The corpuscles are well known to be amoeboid, and
 Professor Schafer tells me that as far as he is aware this is the only
 instance of their occurrence in an acid fluid.
     Coagulation. — The blood clots after a very variable period of time,
 but generally darkens in about five minutes, ultimately forming a
 solid black clot which is due to oxidation.              If blood be sealed in a
 tube, the small quantity of oxygen present will form a thin black film
 on the surface of the blood, and the action then ceases.                 I have
 already shown how blood can be kept indefinitely without clotting
 in   a section  of tube with a cover-glass over one end, and the other
  cemented     to a glass slide.    I   have kept the blood of P. Buce
 phalus    in this  way  for  a  month,    quite unchanged, and on then
  breaking off part of the cover-glass a thick black crust was formed

   1885.]               Colouring     of  Phytophagous    Larvae.                 2t)5
   on the    surface,    while the blood beneath became translucent in
   stead of   clear    and    transparent.    On removing the crust a second
  thin one was formed, but on removing this no further coagulation
  took place.     If in sealing up blood, or placing it in a tube section,
  a bubble of air is accidentally included, coagulation takes place round
  the bubble, but not elsewhere.            This black substance is the normal
  clot, for the injured places on larvae which have healed are always
  black, notably the horns of Sphinx larvae which have been nibbled off
  by others of the same species.          The coagulation takes place after the
  addition of water, or of a saturated solution of neutral salt (sodium
  sulphate).     The occurrence of a reducing agent in the blood appears
  to be very remarkable, but it is possible that the substance is capable
  of again yielding up its oxygen, and so acting as a carrier.                 I have
  observed that if fresh blood be added to that which is turning black
  on the surface, the black clouds are redissolved.            If this be not so,   it
 is difficult to see how the blood can be the           internal medium for the
 supply of oxygen in these animals, and one is tempted to the supposi
 tion that in the tracheal system we have a means for the supply of
 oxygen direct to the tissues.          I hope to investigate the question this
 summer.       Another suggestion which occurred to me was that the
  coagulation is a very similar process to the darkening of cuticular
 pigment on larvae and the darkening of the pupal covering.                    It has
 always been assumed that this darkening is due to light, bnt it takes
 place rapidly and completely in pupae buried several inches under
 ground, in compact and opaque cocoons, or sometimes in the heart of
 a tree.                       I
            Furthermore, have never observed that any attainable dark
 ness made     the least difference to the darkening        of pupae.    I therefore
 think   it very probable that this will also prove to        be due to oxidation,
 and possibly to the formation of a substance similar to the black clot
 of the blood.
     The brown and colourless blood darkens as well as the green, but
 the latter seemed to yield the most marked results, although                 I  have
 not observed a sufficient         number of instances, except in the case of
 the green blood, to be able to draw conclusions.                   There is great
 variability in the time that elapses before coagulation, and                I   have
seen samples that have not clotted at all.            From my memory of the
blood of S. Ocellatus in the larval state,            I   believe that the blood

 the liquid becomes blue, and ultimately black, from the formation of
 coagulum. The proteids are decolourised and sink, the alcohol remain
 ing yellow with xanthophyll (the chlorophyll disappearing).           Absolute
 alcohol does not lie on the top of the blood, but mixes with it at
 once.
    Chloroform behaves in the same manner as ether, but it dissolves
 nothing coloured from the green coagulum ; the latter contracts in a
few hours, and a clear blue liquid appears between it and the sides of
the tube. The exposed surface of the coagulum (the chloroform
having sunk to the bottom) rapidly becomes black.
    Distilled water, like weak spirit, lies on the top of the blood with a
cloud of precipitated proteid (probably globulin) above the junction.
On shaking, the cloud disappears, and the blood only seems diluted ;
if now more water be added (altogether many times the volume of
the blood), in a few minutes the whole fluid becomes cloudy, remain
ing dark greenish.        On filtering, a blue solution comes through,
which slightly darkens for some hours. With less water the blood
coagulates normally, although after a longer interval of time.
    Carbon disulphide had no effect for a considerable time. Eventually
the blood was coagulated (green) but nothing coloured was dis
solved out.
   Heat. — The blood of the pupa of S. Ligustri was heated in a glass
tube in a water-bath ; no change was seen till the temperature
reached 132° F., when part of the blood became slightly dim. By
141° the whole of the blood was distinctly cloudy, but it was not till
180° that the blood became quite coagulated — solid-looking and
opaque, the proteids being yellow with xanthophyll.                In the in
terstices of the clot was a clear yellow fluid. The xanthophyll in the
coagulum was easily extracted by ether or alcohol.

                               their Food-plants.
    Entomologists have been long aware of the fact that the colours of
many larv© vary (within the limits of the same species) according to
the colour of the plant upon which they are found.           This is especially
true of larvsa feeding upon brightly-coloured parts of the plant, such
as the anthers or petals. At the same time there has been hardly any
investigation of these interesting facts.       The numerous instances in
                                                      I
which such variations have been observed are, believe, exhaustively
recorded by Mr. Raphael Meldola in the editorial notes to his trans
lation of Dr. Weismann's " Studies in the Theory of Descent
                                                                         "
                                                                           (the
essay  on   the Origin  of the Markings    of Caterpillars),  and  in  a  paper
in the "Proc. Zool. Soc." for 1873.
   The first step in this investigation is to make quite certain of the
facts by feeding a sufficient number of larvae, from the egg, upon the

 1885.]               Colouring of Phytophagous    Larvce.             2117
 different foods which have been found to be associated with particular
colour variations of the larvae in field observation.          Mr. Meldola
mentions a paper by Mr. R. M'Lachlan (" Trans. Ent. Soc," 1865,
p. 453)     entitled " Observations on some remarkable Varieties of
 Sterrha    Sacraria,    Linn., with general notes on Variation in
Lepidoptera."       In this paper Mr. M'Lachlan gives some valuable
data as to Eupithecia Absynthiata.         The author collected about 100
larvae of this species.     When found upon Senecio Jacobcea they were
yellowish, upon Centaurea nigra reddish,            and upon Matricaria
whitish.     When nearly full grown they were all given Senecio
Jacobcea, but this change of food did not affect the colour of the
reddish and whitish varieties.      From this Mr. M'Lachlan argued (1)
that it was necessary for the larvae to have fed on the one kind of
flower from the egg to acquire the resemblance, and (2) that the
colour is not caused by the food showing through the somewhat
transparent integument.        He thinks that variation may be indirectly
caused by the food, and he points out the similarity of internal
feeders.     He also concludes that the indirect effect of the food in
producing protective resemblance is normal, and the facts of opposite
colouration must be due to other circumstances.
              14. Experiments    upon the Larvm  of S. Ligustri.
    Mr. Meldola quotes (in the editorial notes) Mr. Argent for the
 observation that this larva is of a darker green when found upon
 laurustinus than when feeding upon lilac. He also quotes Mr. Davis
for the opinion that the larvae upon ash are of a more greyish-green
 than those upon lilac or privet. My own experience has always been
that the larvae are much duller in both the ground colour and the
purple stripes when feeding upon lilac than when occurring upon
privet.    Those upon ash resemble the lilac forms. Mr. Davis'
expression
              " greyish-green " exactly explains the difference between
the lilac and privet forms (being applicable to the former).           The
privet   varieties   have   a much   brighter yellow ground colour, and
the stripes are of a more vivid and redder purple, while the purple in
the lilac forms is bluer and altogether duller (often tending towards
brownish).      Having often observed these differences in the field, I
experimented upon some larvae during the summer of 1884.               The
larvae from a batch of eggs were divided into three lots and fed
throughout their life upon lilac, privet, and ash respectively.        The
larvae upon ash did not flourish, but about twelve of the privet larva:
and six of the lilac arrived at maturity, and without exception showed
the differences    I have indicated above. The results of these experi
ments have been communicated             to the Entomological Society of
 London, and the two varieties figured, in a paper not yet published.
                                                                  T 2

              15. Experiments   upon the Larva; of S. Ocellatus.
    The variability of this species must have been observed by many
 entomologists.     In Mr. Meldola's editorial notes there are the follow
 ing references to this larva : — In 1879 Mr. E. Boscher found ten to
 twelve larvae upon Salix Viminalis near Twickenham.            These larvae
 were of a bright yellowish-green ground colour, and all possessed the
 1ows of red-brown spots which sometimes occur on this species.          He
 also found eighteen to twenty larvae of the same species feeding upon
 S. Triandra, in a locality not far distant, all of which were dull
whitish-green above, passing into bluish-green           below.    None of
t hese latter were spotted.     In 1880 Mr. E. Boscher found seven larvae
 on S. Viminalis in the same locality, similar to those found upon this
plant the year before. He also found six larvae upon another species
of Salix in the same osier bed, two being of the bluish-green and four
of the bright green variety .
    It must be well known to all collectors that the bluish-green form
occurs on ordinary apple trees in gardens.       In 1880 Mr. Boscher con
ducted some breeding experiments upon this larva at Mr. Meldola's
suggestion.     The larvae from three batches of eggs were fed upon
S. Triandra, S. Viminalis, and apple respectively.       Only three of the
third batch survived, and were all of the bluish-green form.
    I have added the following evidence to the case of S. Ocellatus
(" Trans. Ent. Soc. of London," Part I, April, 1884). Salix Rubra
and S. Cinerea produce the bright green variety, and crab also (as far
as I could remember).       On the other hand my experience had been
that S. Viminalis produces whitish- green varieties.        Figures of the
two varieties are given in my paper.       It must not be supposed that
the yellowish-green     varieties are always spotted, or even commonly
so, but I believe that an instance of a spotted bluish-green variety
has not been hitherto recorded.
    My own experiments upon this species were conducted during the
summer     of  1884.   The eggs were obtained from Mr. W. Davis, of
Dartford. The larva? after hatching were divided into five lots of six
each, and they were fed upon the following food-plants : — apple, crab,
 Salix Viminalis, S. Cinerea, S. Rubra.        As I was travelling at the
 time, it was sometimes difficult to obtain the right plants.       On such
 occasions  I  made use of a plant which I believed (from an examina
 tion of its leaves) would produce the same colour as the one         I  had
 started with. The only instances of this were— once or twice in the
  case of crab, when I substituted an apple with similar leaves (green
 and glabrous underneath), and in the case of S. Rubra, for which
  S. Babylonica was given once or twice and S. Triandra once.         I had
 previously ascertained (in the summer of 1883) that no effect is pro
 duced by fce.ling a larva for several days upon a food-plant which

1885.J              Colouring    of  Phytophagous   Larvce.              299
tends to produce     an opposite colouration.     Hence the results of the
experiments are as convincing as if I had been able to use the same
plant throughout (as    I  did in three cases out of the five).
    The larvae hatched July 15th — 18th, and      I thought that there was
some difference in colour due to the food, as early as July 27th (in
larvae hatched    July 18th and fed on S. Viminalis), when the larvae
were    about 15 mm. long, and advanced in the second stage. On
careful comparison, the backs of those feeding on S. Viminalis, apple,
and crab appeared very slightly whiter green than those feeding on
 S. Cinerea and Rubra.     Before this all the larvae were yellowish-green,
much resembling      the brighter variety.     These early differences were
very  slight, and remained so for a long time. The head and two or
three anterior segments were yellow-green in all the larvae up to the
end of the third stage, but this colour extended backwards for a less
distance and was less marked in the whiter varieties.           While there
seemed to be some differences,          all the larvae were of a much
whiter green than at first. In the third stage there was a blue
tinge (especially seen in those feeding on apple) about the whitish-
green on the backs of the whiter varieties, which became distinct
on placing them beside the others.          The white bluish-green appears
on the back just above the subdorsal, and this line forms the boundary
between the lighter area above and the darker surface below. Some
times a line along this margin, even lighter than the colour of the
back, indicates the position of the old subdorsal.
    There was not this sudden transition between the upper and lower
surfaces in the S. Rubra and S. Cinerea larvae, although the subdorsal
 was sometimes recognisable.          The larvae feeding on crab were of
the lighter variety, contrary to my expectations.         As the larvae ad
vanced in the third stage, the differences increased and became quite
distinct, but they did not approach those observed upon adult larvae
in the field.    In the fourth stage the differences still continued to
increase, although but slightly.        The heads of the whiter varieties
were still yellowish.     It was very noticeable now, as at all times, that
the apple, crab, and S. Viminalis larvae were much whiter and nearer
the well-known variety than the S. Rubra and Cinerea larvae were
yellow-green, like the other variety. Furthermore, the S. Rubra larvae
were rather yellower than those feeding on S. Cinerea.          Towards the
end of the fourth stage the whiter larvae (except those on S. Vimina
lis) had become as white as those adult ones commonly found upon
apple, and exactly resembled them in colour.         On the other hand, tho
 8. Rubra and especially the S. Cinerea larvae were far from resembling
the yellowish-green variety usually found on these plants, although
very different from the larvae upon apple, &c.          The same facts were
 true of the last stage (fifth).    The 8. Rubra larvae were the yellowest
 green, and as the effect of the apple,     &c, had   been so much stronger

than the S. Rubra, &c., the food of the yellowest variety was changed,
and it was fed upon apple from the beginning of the fifth stage
(August 14th. The larvae were hatched July 17 — 18).
    By August 23rd most of the larvae were full-fed, and a careful com
parison was made, with the following results : —
    Apple. — The five adult larvae are quite typical whitish-green
forms.
     Crab. — Only one of the five larvae is nearly adult, the others far
behind.      The larvae were hatched a day earlier than any of the others
 (July 15), and yet they have been backward all through. This is
probably an effect of the food.         The larvae are almost as white as
the others (becoming quite so afterwards).
    8. Viminalis. — The four adult larvae are not so white as the apple
or crab, but are almost intermediate forms.
    S. Cinerea. — The four larvae may be called intermediate, and they
much resemble the S. Viminalis forms, but are as yet younger and
rather smaller (the tendencies towards the two varieties slightly in
creasing with growth).
    S. Rubra. — The four adult larvae are far more different from the
apple varieties than any of the others, but they are not greatly beyond
intermediate forms.        The one fed upon apple for nine days was the
brightest of all; it is now rather whiter than the others, which were
still fed on S. Rubra, although it does not approach the apple or
crab larvae.      But any change at all (as proved by the experiments to
be described) in so short a time shows the very strong tendency of the
whole of these larvae towards the white variety. On August 26th
this larva was adult without further recognisable change in colour.
    This then was the result of the experiments.         No one who com
pared the S. Rubra with the apple larvae could hesitate for a mo
ment in coming to the conclusion that the ground colour is largely
affected by the food-plant.       But at the same time there was no doubt
that this is not the whole explanation of the differences observed in
larvae in the field, for my S. Rubra and S. Cinerea larvae were not
yellow-green varieties, but only intermediate. A strong tendency was
manifested in the larvae all through towards the white variety, and
the food-plant could only overcome this to the extent of producing an
intermediate form.
  10.   Observation  in the Field upon Larva; of S. Ocellatus during 1884.
    I will now describe the results of my observations in the field during
 the past summer, which throw great light upon this question.          The
 larvae of S. Ocellatus were abundant last year, and I will give a list of
 all found to indicate the proportion of forms which were of excep
 tional colour (in relation to their food-plants).

     August 4th. — Upon S. Viminalis on the River Cherwell, near Ox
 ford, an almost full-grown larva of the whitish-green variety (normal
according to observation).
      (About) August 7th. — Upon (probably) S. Ferruginea* (Anderson),
 on the Cherwell, two almost full-grown larvae of nearly opposite
 varieties and both on the same tree.                 One was a bright yellowish-green
 variety      (I believe abnormal on this tree), the other inclining towards
 the   whitish-green side of an intermediate form (probably representing
 the tendency of this food-plant,                and therefore normal).
     (About)      August      7th. —  On    S.   Rubra (Cherwell) three larvae ; two
just entered the last stage, one quite small in the third stage.                               All
 yellowish-green (normal), and one of the larger ones with brownish-
 red spots round         all the spiracles except the first.

 on which the two opposite forms were found, as described above) ;
 two larvae at the close of the fourth stage, and both inclining to the
 white side of an intermediate variety (probably normal).
     Also on S. Viminalis, a full-grown bright yellowish-green larva
  (abnormal according to my observations).                           The larva may have
 wandered from a neighbouring S. Rubra, but this is not likely, as the
 8. Viminalis was much eaten and the other apparently not eaten at
all.     On other occasions I have found the interlacing branches of
 8. Viminalis and 8. Rubra eaten in such a way as to suggest that a
larva had wandered from one to the other.
     August 14th. — Upon S. Smithiana, at Botley, near Oxford, a full-
grown larva inclining to the yellow side of an intermediate variety
 (probably slightly abnormal).                     Also upon 8. Smithiana at Boar's
 Hill, near Oxford, a full-grown larva inclining to the white side of
intermediate variety (probably normal). Also upon Pyrus Malus (var.
Acerba) at Boar's Hill, an adult, very bright yellowish-green                                larva
(probably normal).               In this last case there were the brownish-red

of the other series of spots which are sometimes present.

 varieties with (at present) more or less tendency towards the white-
green variety, bnt on the whole very uniform (probably abnormal).
 One larva was rather more advanced and well in the fifth stage.           It
 was a bright yellowish-green variety (probably normal).
   August \9ith. — Upon the same 8. Babylonica one more intermediate
 variety, similar in size and colour to the five found on the 17th
 (probably abnormal).
   September 2nd. — Upon an apple in a garden at Reading, a nearly
adult bright yellowish-green variety (rather whitish on the back, but
 not nearly so much so as an intermediate variety).        The apple leaves
were white underneath, and in all previous experience such a tree has
 produced the most extreme form of whitish-green larvae.         Hence the
 occurrence is highly abnormal.         In addition to the above, two larvae
were sent to me — one whitish-green variety, found upon the ground
of another garden in Reading, and doubtless feeding on apple, and
normal : another from the same garden as that in which I found the
larva on September 2nd. This larva had turned brown, and was
found upon a gravel path, but it was described as bright yellowish-
green, and it bore traces of having had this colour when it reached
me.     It was found in the part of the garden where the apples grow.
In quite another part at a considerable distance there is a tree of
8. Babylonica, but it is not at all probable that the larva fed upon
this plant.      On the whole there is strong evidence for believing that
this  larva    was   another bright yellowish-green variety feeding ab-
noimally upon apple.
          1 7. Experiments     upon Captured Larvm of S. Ocellatus.
   Experiments were made upon some of these larvae to ascertain if
it was possible, by changing the food, to modify their colours after
a definite tendency had appeared.         Such experiments could of course
only   be   applied,  with   any hope  of  success, to the youngest of the
above-mentioned       larvae.
   The bright yellowish-green           variety in the fifth stage (with
brownish-red patches) found August 7th, on g. Rubra, was given
apple August 8th, its length (when extended) being 40 mm. On
August 14th, this larva was 58 mm. long when measured at rest in
the sphinx attitude.        It was now full-fed and became brownish. The
colour was quite unchanged up to this point, and thus an immense
amount of food can be eaten and great additional weight gained
without any effect on the colour.
   The other very similar larva found on 8. Rubra, August 7th, was
not quite so yellow as that just mentioned, but by August 10th it had
become about the same.           It was now fed upon apple, and was adult
(and turned brownish) August 18th, without any recognisable dif

 ference in consequence of the change of food.                 The small larva (in
 the third stage) fonnd upon the same plant, on the same date, was
 also fed at once upon apple.            At this early stage the larva was as
                                                                  I
 bright a specimen of the yellowish-green variety as have ever seen.
 The apple made no difference in its colour, although it was eaten for
 many days.       Tho larva had been slightly injured, and died without
entering another stage.            Evidently it possessed an even stronger
tendency towards        the   yellowish-green variety than my bred speci
mens showed towards the other form, since the colours were very
marked, while the larva was so small.
    The two whitish larvae in the fourth stage, found on August 11th,
on Salix Ferruginea, were fed upon S. Triandra or S. Rubra during
the whole of the fifth stage. On August 24th these larvae were adult
(and one of them browned) : some slight effect had been produced,
for they were both of them less white than was to be expected from
their appearance when found.
    The seven larvae found August 17th and 18th upon S. Babylonica,
were fed upon the same food-plant, and carefully compared.                        The
bright yellowish one, which was more advanced than the others,
became     adult (and turned brownish) August 25th. It remained much
the brightest all through.          The others became adult a few days later,
and throughout remained intermediate forms with a variable tendency
towards the yellowish variety.
   The tendency of the food-plant was seen during the growth of
these six larvae in the fifth stage, for they were whitish interme
diate varieties at the beginning of this stage, and they inclined the
other way at its close.        The other larvae were too old for experiment.

                         lowish varieties on " yellow Siberian        green to white, but
                         crab." My experiments showed that           are smoother than
                         larvae     with a tendency towards          apple,    and some
                         whitish were not modified.                  times glabrous.

 S. Viminalis   . . . Apparently contradictory results. From       Undersides white, with
                         a fair number of observations in the        dense satiny down.
                         field (with only one exception)         I
                         have assumed that the effect is
                         towards the whitish variety. Mr.
                         Meldola's instances, which are about
                         18 in number) oppose this conclu
                         sion. My breeding experiments per
                         haps supported Mr. Meldola's in
                         stances rather than my own, but
                         they were not very conclusive. My
                         experiments     showed that this plant
                         does not produce so white a green
                         as apple, and this I think is the
                         case.      But it certainly does not
                         cause so vellow a green as S. rubra.
                         I   am still inclined to think that it
                         may tend towards whitish, but the
                         experiments must be repeated.
 S. Smithiana   . . . Two instances, one inclining towards         Undersides white, with
                         the yellow side of intermediate, one         dense satiny down.
                         towards the whitish side. The lat
                         ter,  I  think, represents the real ten
                         dency.

                          inclined towards the whitish side of
                          intermediate, while one was bright
                          yellowish - green.     The former is
                          doubtless the real tendency, and if
                          so, indirectly supports my impres

                        be produced when the leaves are
                        downy and white underneath. My
                        experiments     produced intermediate
                        forms, but they are not very con-
                        elusive, for the larvae could not be
                        fed upon the same variety of S. Ci-
                        nerea, as I was travelling about at
                        the time.    On some occasions I was
                        obliged to use leaves with white

 S. Triandra    .. . Mr. Meldola's   instances (about 19) point  Undersides green and

                       experiments      upon the modifying
                        effect produced upon the whitish
                        larvae    by feeding    on this plant
                        throughout the fifth stage, rather
                        tend towards the other direction.
                        From the colour and surface of the
                        leaves,    I   should certainly have
                        thought that the tendency is strong
                        ly towards yellowish.
 S. Babylonica.   ., Of   seven instances, one was yellow and     Undersides green and
                        six intermediate, inclining towards         glabrous.
                        the yellowish side. The former I
                        believe represents the tendency of
                        these leaves, which much resemble
                        those of S. Rubra.
                     A fair number of instances in favour of      Undersides green and
                        a very strong yellowish tendency.           glabrous.
                        Only one exception (intermediate).
                        Experiments confirm the observa
                        tions, as yellowish       intermediate
                        forms were produced from larvae,
                        strongly tending towards the whitish
                        variety.
   Looking at the above list, I am strongly convinced that the ten
dencies  of one of the food-plants of this larva can be ascertained by
looking at its leaves, and that leaves with white pubescent under
sides, as a rule, produce whitish varieties, while those with green
glabrous undersides generally produce yellowish forms.
   The greatest support to the theory that the colour and texture of
the undersides of leaves is the best criterion of the effects is shown
by the very strong cases of apple and S. Rubra.                  The same theory is
supported by crab, S. Cinerea, and S. Ferruginea, as far as their evi
dence goes, and S. Smithiana is certainly not in opposition to it.                    S.

306          Mr. E. B. Poulton.         Essential Nature     of   the       [Apr. 23,
Babylonica is also strong evidence, if we assume (as there is some
reason for doing) that the six intermediate larvae had tended towards
the whitish variety. S. Triandra and S. Viminalis remain a difficulty,
but there is some confliction of testimony.  The cases of S. Smithiana
and Ferruginea are favourable to my view of the effects of S. Viminalis
and of S. Triandra, although indirectly, for the leaves of the former
species are intermediate between those of S. Caprea and S. Viminalis
(8. Smithiana may be a hybrid between these two, and S. Ferruginea
a variety of S. Smithiana or a hybrid between it and S. Cinerea. The
leaves of the S. Ferruginea spoken of exactly resembled those of
S. Smithiana, except that they were smaller.)    Hence if     Viminalis
tends towards yellowish, it would be expected that S. Ferruginea
would tend at least as strongly in the same direction, for its leaves
resemble those of S. Cinerea as well as S. Viminalis, and 8. Cinerea
produces yellowish larvae.  And so with S. Smithiana, which resembles
S. Viminalis and S. Caprea (which probably produces, yellow lsrvae
from its resemblance to a large S. Cinerea).  But both these interme
diate sallows produced, as a rule, intermediate varieties — that is to
say, their effects were between S. Viminalis and S. Cinerea (or ? S.
Caprea), just as their leaves combine the characters of these forms.
And, further, in the intermediate varieties produced, the whitish form
predominated, just as the characters of S. Viminalis predominate on
the underside of the leaves. Hence the observations upon these two
food-plants support my view as to the effect of S. Viminalis. In the
case of S.   Triandra I have some little experimental evidence, but I
have never found a larva on this tree in the field.               I
                                                            feel strongly
that its true tendency    is,like that of S. Rubra, towards a protective
(i.e., a yellowish) variety.     This year hope to breed large number

of larvae from the egg upon this tree, and upon S. Viminalis. Omit
ting these two trees, the whole list       very favourable to the theory
                                             is
that the results are protective, and that the tendencies can be ascer
tained by looking at the undersides of the leaves.*
19.   The Complex Nature    the Influence
                                 of            the Food-plant
                                                       of                    upon        the

                                      of
   The simplest view of this matter would be to suppose that the
colour of the leaf was itself the cause of the colour in the larva, show
ing through the transparent skin, and that the change of diet was
therefore the direct cause of the change of colour.       But        quite  it   is
clear that the influence cannot be of this simple kind, for the amount
of substance which forms the underside of the leaf             very small
                                                                  is    a
proportion of the whole substance that      eaten.is
  *
  I  have to thank Mr.   Ot.   C. Druce for much kind help in the difficult       task    of
naming the sallows.

     It is, therefore, hardly conceivable that this small proportion can
directly modify the whole larva into its own likeness ; — that the under
surface eaten by the larva should cause the latter to resemble the
surface itself.       And yet it is only this part of the food which is
common to the various food-plants producing similar effects.            In
everything except whiteness and pubescence of the underside, the
leaves     of the apple must differ more widely from those of S. Viminalis,
Ferruginea, and Smithiana than these do from S. Rubra. And yet the
effects of the latter plant are very different from the three former
species of sallow, of which the tendencies incline towards those of
apple.       And further, the resulting larvae are far better protected by
such effects produced in common by apple and certain sallows than if
all the sallows had tended in the same direction.        Furthermore, the
appearance of the undersides is quite as much due to texture as
colour, for the pubescence produces a large part of the effect of dead
whiteness.       But the larva gains the same appearance by colour, for
its hairs are microscopic rudiments (only discovered by myself last
 summer, 1884).         Again, there is no reason for supposing that the
 chlorophyll from the leaves of the food-plants would yield solutions
 corresponding in colour with the larvae ; in fact, it is certain that this
 is not the case, for the colour of the upper sides of the leaves do not
 afford an indication of the effects on the larvae, and yet the true
 colour of the leaf is far more distinct here than it is on the under
 surface.
      These conclusions are also confirmed by considering the effects of
 the experiments.        While the existence of an influence of the food-
  plant upon larval colouration        is undeniably proved, the simple
 theory of its manner of action is entirely refuted, for such a theory
 does not allow for any powerful tendency on the part of the larva
 which may even counterbalance that of the food.       Thus in the experi
  ments the effects produced were not according to the power of the
  food-plant (as proved by observation), when the tendency was in the
  direction of yellowish, while the effects were very powerful when the
  tendency was in the other direction.       And so also with the observa
  tions in the field, as was proved by the very different colours on the
  same tree, and the strongly yellowish variety upon apple.       It cannot
  be   argued that the irregularities observed are due to the effects of
   the  food-plant varying in intensity upon larvae of different constitu
   tions.    They can only be explained by the possession of an opposing
   force in the larva itself, which may not only exactly counterbalance
   the tendencies of the food, but may produce the result of the strongest
   opposite tendencies.      The former explanation would account for all
   varieties from intermediate to whitish upon apple, and from inter
    mediate to yellowish upon S. Rubra, but it fails to account for
    anything on the whitish side of intermediate upon S. Rubra or on

the yellowish side in the case of apple.    Far less can                    it account       for
an almost typical yellow variety upon this latter plant.
   Tt is clear from the experiments upon the captured larvae that some
effect may be produced in an intermediate variety by feeding it for
some considerable time (such as during the last stage), upon a food-
plant known to have strong tendencies.    But this treatment does not
affect a larva which possesses a well-marked colouration — that                             is,
                                                                                              a
larva with strong tendencies itself, and which coincide with those of
the food-plant.    Nevertheless the experiments with larvae bred from
the egg prove that the variety towards which the larva         strongly          is
tending may be much modified by the food-plant given         during the     it
whole of its life.   When such a change has been produced and                                 is
manifest,     the food be appropriately shifted at the beginning of the
              if
fifth stage, some considerable effect may be produced in the larva, in
the direction of the original tendency.
20.    A   Suggested    Explanation      of   the   Larval Tendency towards           Certain
                       Colours Independently        of   the Food-plant.
    The most probable explanation of these larval tendencies — which
 differ so much in strength and direction, and which are independent
 of the food-plant though generally modifiable by — that phyto-       it   is
 phagic effects are hereditary, and thus stronger tendencies accumulate
 as the larvae of successive generations feed upon the same food-plant
or on those which produce the same effects.         In this way all shades
of colour may be occasionally found upon any tree, and the same irre
gularity may be produced by interbreeding between individuals with
different tendencies.      This explanation accounts for all the facts
 brought out by this year's experiment and observation, and            also       it   is
in harmony      with  previously   recorded  facts.  Thus  the unexpected
results of the breeding experiments would be explained by supposing
that during the previous generation (or perhaps generations), the
larvae had fed upon apple or some other food-plant tending to produce
whitish varieties.      The yellowish larva found upon apple must,
according    to this theory, have descended from a long line fed upon
S. Rubra, or some plant with leaves having green glabrous under
sides.    In this case      believe that there must have been several
                             I
generations accumulating yellowish tendencies by their food-plants,
for the effects of apple are so very strong in the other direction, and
yet so little change was produced.        So also with regard to the two
larvae of different varieties upon the same tree, it may be supposed
that there had been different tendencies due to the food-plants of past
gsnerations.    In one of the cases quoted, there some slight evidence
                                                                is
that     this reasoning      is    correct.   Of the seven larvae found npon
S.     Babylonica,     one   was     yellowish, and the others intermediate.

 According to this theory, the egg from which the former was hatched
had been laid by a different female from that which produced the
others.     Such a conclusion is confirmed by the fact that the yellowish
larva was decidedly older than the others and became adult some
days earlier, the six intermediate larvae keeping together throughout.
I   endeavoured to ascertain the past history of the parents of the
larvae with which       I  experimented, but Mr. Davis informed me that
his larvae had not been kept separate, and had been found on different
food-plants.
    It may be argued that there is probably great difference among
individuals of the same brood in the power of transmitting these
tendencies, and that this might explain some of the above-mentioned
irregularities.      But the breeding experiments, as far as they go,
negative such a conclusion.         There was very little difference between
the larvae of each separate lot, and considerable differences between
the lots (in some cases).        The influences of the food-plant seemed to
be most rigidly regular in their effects on each division of the larvae :
in fact one might say that there were practically no individual dif
ferences    in the tendency      towards a whitish variety, although the
tendency     was  very strong.
    There is one argument against the conclusion that these effects are
in any way due to the food-plants (but           I do not see how it can stand
against the breeding experiments)            : — the  fact  that the variably
developed system of brownish-red spots have only been found on the
yellowish-green       larvae  up to the present time.           (Mr. Meldola's
instances point in this direction without exception, and so also with
my    own.)     It  is, however, quite possible that these spots may be
ultimately found upon the other variety. If not, it would seem to
imply that the yellowish-green form, often brightly ornamented with
red spots, is more ancient than the other, and that reversion to it is
caused by certain food-plants.         Against this comes the fact that the
 red  markings have all the excessive variability of a reversion character,
 while the yellowish-green ground colour can be produced with great
 regularity.     Again, the spots occur upon larvae with all shades of
 ground colour in 8. PopuK.          Looking at all the facts   I cannot doubt
 the cogency of the explanation offered above of the colouration being
 due to the food-plant, and of the accumulation of the influence during
 successive generations.       It seems very probable that we have here an
 instance of a larva of one species dividing into two.         The tendency is
 more of this kind than towards true dimorphism, for the two forms have
 different food-plants.      If a long series of generations upon one plant
 produced a distaste for the other kinds, so that the larvae wandered or
 died, it is then certain that natural selection would lead the females
 to lay their eggs on the appropriate foods, and the separation would
  be complete.     Mere proximity of one kind of food and distance from

   310          Mr. E. B. Poulron.     Essential Nature   of  the   [Apr.  23,
   other kinds might       produce some tendency in this direction.         In
   gardens there are many chances         in  favour of eggs being    laid for
   several generations on apple, and so with regard to the predominance
   of any one species of Salix over a particular area.
      It   would thus be possible for the two varieties to be rendered
   locally distinct, for the localisation of a food-plant would overcome
   both causes of variability — the liability to lay eggs on other plants
   with different tendencies, and the chance of interbreeding between
  the two varieties.      If the two varieties could become stereotyped in
  this way (and it has been shown that occasional recurrence to other
  kinds of food on the whole produces no effect), there would result a
  species with specific differences in the larvae, although the pupae and
  imagos would remain identical.         Instances very nearly of this kind
  are, of course, well known.        The above would certainly be true of
  two isolated tracts in which food-plants of opposite tendencies existed
  to the exclusion of the other kinds.            If the tracts were adja
  cent it would still be true of nearly all the larvae in each of
 them.
     It maybe argued that the food-plants are so intermixed throughout
  this country that wo should not expect to find the uniformity which
 has hitherto seemed to prevail.        But it must be remembered that
 such uniformity is chiefly observed upon apple, and that the effects of
 this food-plant are so strong that it needs a very powerful tendency
 to overcome them.        Furthermore, there is a certain amount of local
 separation     between  apple trees in gardens and the various species of
 sallow by the banks of streams and in damp lanes and hedgerows.
 The species of Smerinthus are inactive and slow flyers in the perfect
 state   ; so there is every tendency towards interbreeding    between those
 in gardens, and towards the eggs being laid upon the food-plant whi(-h
 is on the spot.      These facts will account for the almost invariable
 occurrence of the whitish variety upon apple.            The case is very
 different with the sallows.      The various kinds occur in close prox
imity, so that it is very common to find several so-called species of
 Salix in a single osier-bed.       The tendency of sallows as a whole is
rather towards the yellowish variety than towards the whitish, trat
there is at all times the greatest facility for interbreeding, and for
laying eggs on many species of food-plant, even in the case of the
most sluggish insects.        This explains the irregularity of the larvae
when found on sallows, and the fact that the yellow variety is
perhaps more commonly found upon the trees with an opposite ten
dency than the white variety upon trees tending towards the yellowish
form. I may add that the garden at Reading in which I found the
yellowish form upon apple, is on the outskirts of the town, and so
situated that the eggs might easily be laid by a female of which the
larva had fed upon sallow, for these trees are common at no great

 distance,    and  in fact there are examples of S. Cinera and S. Baby,
 lonica   in the garden itself.
     It  seems   therefore that the explanation      offered ahove mnst be
 correct, and if so we have an instance of a character (larval coloura
 tion) that is shown in a very obvious manner to be the result of the
 interaction between the influences at work in an individual life and
 the   inherited tendencies following from the influences that moulded
the lives    of ancestors.   In this case, too, there is a fairly accurate
test for the predominance           of either element, in observing the
resultant tint, and making allowance for the tendencies (already
gauged) of the food-plant.
    The case of S. Ligustri is also to be explained in a similar way,
for here, too, we have the difficulty of conflicting experience
(Mr. Davis' and my own).           I have a considerable number of pupae
of S. Ocellatus, with careful notes of the colours and food-plants of
their respective larvae, so that      I  hope to be able to test the above
theory very conclusively in the summer.

                                     plants.
    It is first necessary to carefully describe the appearance of the
varieties of 8. Ocellatus, before explaining the underlying cause of
the colour, by reference to larval or derived pigment.
    The larva of      8. Ocellatus is covered with minute white points
(which are the tubercles at the bases of rudimentary hairs), con
ferring upon the skin a shagreened texture.              The colour is much
modified by these dots ; and their arrangement, together with the
spreading of white areas from their bases, and the coalescence of
such areas, form nearly all the markings of the larva.            The dots are
very variably developed ; at one time           I thought that the whitish
varieties must be caused by their relative predominance, obscuring
and    modifying the green ground-colour. Careful observation, how
ever, convinced      me that the difference is not due to this.       The most
extreme whitish varieties are almost white upon the back, above the
horizon of the old subdorsal line.         Below this the bluish-green tint
predominates (the line of demarcation being very sharp), while the
under surface is dark bluish-green.             Careful examination of the
white dorsal surface with a lens shows that the green is obscured
(and almost obliterated) by a comparatively         superficial accumulation
of white masses,        while the green when present seems to shine
through from a lower level.         On the under surface there is nothing
to obstruct the effect of the green (since the shagreen dots are very
minute, and the white masses are absent).           The lateral surfaces offer
intermediate      effects  produced     by   intermediate    conditions.    An
    vol. xxxvm.                                                         z

  312          Mr. E. B. Poulton.      Essential Nature     of the     [Apr.   23,
  extreme yellowish variety, on the other hand, does not present the
  same marked line of demarcation at the subdorsal level ; the whole
  larva is bright yellowish-green, the tint being more pronounced on
  the under-surface,     but very bright and distinct over the whole
  larva. It is here also obvious that the main colour is deeply placed,
 and is to some extent modified by the shagreen dots and by
 subcuticular whitish masses, but these latter have not the same effect
 as in the other variety (and are probably developed to a much less
  extent) .
     A less extreme form of the yellowish variety differs in the dorsal
  tint being more completely obscured by white (the result being a
 yellowish-white in this region). The line of demarcation is not sharp.
 In   an intermediate variety (such as that found upon S. Ferru-
 ijinea), the upper surface resembles that of the whitish form, with
 the same sharp contrast at the subdorsal, but below this the tint is
 green, without any marked tendency towards yellowish or bluish, the
 under surface being of course the most deeply coloured.                 Such a
 variety  is  not at all uncommon,     and  I  have described   it as  inclining
 towards the whitish side of intermediate.        It is truly intermediate in
 the colour of the lateral and lower surfaces, inclining towards the
 whitish variety on the upper surface, and in the sharp demarcation at
 the subdorsal level.     It is at once clear that the green tints, whether
 yellowish or bluish, are due to derived pigments, which have already
 been described as present in the blood of the pupa, and which have
been proved to exist in the subcuticular tissues, as well as in the blood
of the larva. The white masses are evidently due to a substance of
 true larval origin, and the effect of the food-plant upon the latter
shows at once that its influence extends beyond the derived colours.
The yellowish tint of the bright variety is due to predominant xantho-
phyll, as is proved by comparing the blood of pupae of which the
history is known. The greener variety must conversely be due to a
larger proportion of chlorophyll, and the blue tinge may be caused
by a slight change in its constitution ; but this needs investigation in
the larva, for although the pupal blood of yellow varieties is brighter
in colour, that of the others does not retain the blue tinge. The
difference is delicate, but distinct ; and much must be lost in the
redistribution accompanying pupation.          It is likely that the blood of
the larvae is not very different, but that the chief distinctions are due
to the subcuticular derived pigments, and these are largely destroyed
in the changes preceding pupation.        It is unfortunate that this inquiry
did not suggest itself to me when          I  possessed the living larvae in
abundance.
    The  case  of S. Ligustri is more distinct, for the differences in the
green seem     to be entirely retained in the pupal blood.         I  have now
many times compared the blood of lilac and privet pupae, and that

 1885.]             Colouring   of  Phytophagous    Larvce.              313
 of the former was always greener, and gave the principal band of
chlorophyll more distinctly when equal thicknesses were compared.
It therefore appears that the blood and subcuticular pigment are of
similar tints in this larva. In this case also the influence of the food-
plant extends to the true larval pigments, for the purple stripes are
much brighter in the privet forms.
   There is very little doubt that the green and brown varieties of
Noctua larvB? could be produced by a proper arrangement of surround
ings, but as the experiment has not yet been tried, it must not at
present be assumed that the food-plant could produce so great an
effect as the removal of the derived pigments from the blood.            Ob
viously the common experience that brown larvae rest on the brown
parts of the plant or on the earth is not a sufficient argument, as the
habit may have followed the change of colour.           But a change in the
relative proportion   of  the  derived   pigments passed through the walls
of the digestive tract into the blood seems to result from a more
complex influence than that which would lead to the entire removal
of pigment from the blood ; and yet we have proved that the food-
plant exerts the former influence.
22.  Summary ; and Conclusion as        to the Nature of the Influence of the
                                 Food-plant.
   It has been shown that the influence of the food-plant is not
uniform, that it must act during a large proportion of the whole
larval life in order to produce an effect, that effects of surface coloura
tion due to consistence may be imitated in colour, and it has been
rendered extremely probable that the effects accumulate during
successive generations.       It has been shown that the effects are
partially  due  to pigment   which   is proper to the larva, and which has
no immediate relation to the food-plant, while the changes produced
in the derived pigments are even more complicated, and due to the
predominance of one or other of the vegetal colouring matters in the
tissues and blood, and before this in the materials which traverse the
walls of the digestive tract (for the hypothesis that certain pigments
are continuously destroyed after passing the digestive tract, until a
certain colour is produced, is even more complicated).
   Such effects are entirely inexplicable by the simple theory of
phytophagic influence with which           I  was strongly prepossessed on
approaching    this inquiry.    So  impossible does it seem that the effect
could be produced by the direct influence of the material which is
                                                          "
eaten, that it would be wiser to abandon the term           phytophagic," at
any rate in the sense of producing these changes.        The term still holds
good for the broad fact that pigments derived from the food-plant
play a most important part in larval colouration, and further than
                                                                   z 2

this, that such pigments afford the material which is moulded by
some subtler influence into a likeness to a special part of the environ
ment.    Of the nature of this influence we know nothing at present,
except that the whole investigation points towards a nervous circle
whose efferent effects are seen in the regulation of the passage of pig
ments through the digestive tract into the blood, and finally the tissues,
and in the colour of a certain amount of true larval pigment, while
the afferent part of the circuit must originate in some surface capable
of responding to delicate shades of difference in the colour of the part
of the environment       imitated.    This interpretation is rendered un
usually difficult by three facts : the gradual working of the process,
often incomplete in a single life ; the excessively complex and diverse
result, and the special character of the stimulus (for it is only the
part of the environment      imitated which produces any effect, e.g., the
undersides of the leaves in the case of S. Ocellatus, and yet the
environment, of course, includes both surfaces).          In parallel cases
(Amphibia,    fish, &c.),  as  far as  any parallelism exists, the stimulus
acts upon the eye, and this may be true of larvae also, but it is useless
to speculate on the subject until further data have been acquired by
experimental    research.
   Variations in the colour of the derived pigments in the blood occur
apparently spontaneously and uselessly in the opaque P. Bucephalus,
for there is a great difference in the yellowness (xanthophyll) of the
blood of this pupa and in the amount of chlorophyll.             Thus it is
possible that the variation began in this way, and was afterwards
rendered efficacious by co-ordination with the environment.             But
there are difficulties in the way of any suggestion founded upon
observations on this species, for the existence of green blood seems
to indicate a different method of colouration in former times, and if
so, the variations in colour may be themselves remnants of a past
susceptibility to the influence of environment.

                                     (Abstract.)
   In a paper read before the Royal Society in 1883, I described the-
                                                          "
results of an examination of the so-called "bile of invertebrates, and
showed     that the alcohol extracts of their liver or other appendage of
the intestine     answering to that organ, showed a spectrum so like
that of vegetable chlorophyll, as to have led me to assume that no-
essential difference exists between the spectrum of enterochlorophyll
and plant chlorophyll.

  320                Dr. McMunn.       Further Observations on            [Apr.   30,
      At that    time   I could not decide the points which are now con
  sidered : (1) Is enterochlorophyll due to the presence .of symbiotic
  algse ?    (2) If not, is it an immediate food product, and merely an
  instance    of the intra-cellular digestion         of food chlorophyll  ?   (3) If
  it is not due to either of these sources, can it            be proved   that it  is
  built up by the animal containing it ? (4) In what points does it
 differ from plant chlorophyll and that of Spongilla ?
     I  believe   I  can prove that the first two questions can be answered
 in the negative, and that it is an animal product, and does differ to a
 slight extent from vegetable chlorophyll, and also from that of
  Spongilla.
      This evidence is based on the result of spectroscopic examination,
 especially of the bands in the blue half of the spectrum, on the
  results obtained by saponifying the colouring matters, and on the
  morphological characters of the enterochlorophyll in the organs con
  taining it.
                                               I
     With regard to chlorophyll itself, mean the mixture of colouring
 matters obtainable on extracting green leaves of land plants with
 alcohol, or with alcohol and ether,           I   believe that of the six bands
 of such a solution, five correspond to those seen in a living leaf, and
 that Kraus is correct in saying that such bands can be seen in a
 leaf.
     The first four bands appear to belong to the green constituent of
 the chlorophyll, the other two to the yellow. On comparing solutions
 of enterochlorophyll with those of plant chlorophyll, it is seen that
 the bands corresponding to V and VI* of the latter are replaced by one,
or by two, occupying a somewhat different position. The enterochloro
 phyll of the following species is described : Paludina vivipara,
 IAmncens      stagnalis,  Trochus   ziziphinus,      Trochus cinerarius,  Littorina
 littorea, Patella vulgata, Helix pomatia, Solaster papposa, and several
specimens of Uraster rubens, &c.              In all these, enterochlorophyll is
 present,    and   presents very  uniform      spectroscopic characters, and the
 same as those described in the case of the Molluscs, Echinoderms,
and Arthropods referred to in my former paper. The bands of the
 spectra of their solutions have been measured in wave-lengths, and
 show a remarkable agreement. In some cases two bands placed closely
 together in red replace the single dominant band of chlorophyll, and
 in every instance the solutions possess a red fluorescence.
     In consequence of Hansen having published the result of saponi
 fying vegetable chlorophyll, and of his having succeeded in obtaining
-certain crystals, which he maintains are those of isolated "chlorophyll
 green
         "
            and "chlorophyll yellow,"       I  was anxious to try the effect of
:saponifying enterochlorophyll.          It was necessary, however, to repeat
his experiments on plant chlorophyll before saponifying eutero-
                             * Adopting Kraus'   s  numbers.

chlorophyll. On doing this, found that his statement to the effect
that chlorophyll is not decomposed by such treatment, is not supported
 by the results obtained.            The bands of solutions after saponifying
occur in an entirely different position from those of bands of similar
solutions before saponifying, but             I    found the method useful in
enabling me to compare the results when enterochlorophyll and
 Spongilla chlorophyll are saponified with those obtained in the case of
plant chlorophyll.
    I   could separate, in the case of plant chlorophyll, the constituents
called by Hansen " chlorophyll green                and " chlorophyll yellow," by
                                                 "
adopting his methods, and found that the soap on repeated extraction
with petroleum ether, lost all the yellow colouring matter, and that
the latter could be obtained in some cases in yellow needles,* the
residue giving the colour reactions of Schwalbe and Capranica.                  The
alcohol and ether extracts on the other hand contained Hansen's
"
   chlorophyll green," and none of the yellow constituent,                      and
answered, except for the position of its bands, to Hansen's description.
    On applying the same method to the chlorophyll of Spongilla, a
complete separation of the constituents could not be brought about,
as it was only partial, and an examination of the solutions showed a
total alteration of spectra.
   In the case of enterochlorophyll, saponification also alters the pig
ment. In some cases             I succeeded in separating the yellow from the
green      constituent   ; and    from the enterochlorophyll of Uraster rubens,
I  obtained crystals of       "                      "      "
                                 chlorophyll green and chlorophyll yellow,"
the former crystallising in sphere crystals, showing a black cross with
polarised light, the latter in yellow radiating needles.              But in almost
every case it was found impossible to separate the constituents, as the
petroleum ether showed a band in red, and the alcohol and ether bands
in the blue end of the spectrum.
   The solid chlorophyll yellow, while agreeing with that of plants in
its behaviour towards nitric and sulphuric acids, did not, however,
show the same blue-green colour with iodine in iodide of potassium,
as it generally became reddish or remained unchanged.
   I   agree with Hansen that the chlorophyll yellow of plants is a
" lipochrome," and also that of enterochlorophyll ; the lipochromes
being a class of colouring matters — so-called by Krukenberg — which
were formerly known by the name of
                                                   " luteins." Under this name
are also included allied pigments,              such as carotin, zoonerythrin,
Kiihne's chromophans          —   obtained by him from the retina, egg-lutein,
and other pigments, which all possess bands in the blue and violet,
and are soluble in such solvents as alcohol, ether, chloroform, bisul
phide of carbon, benzol, petroleum ether, &c.               They all are coloured
  •   It is mot yet clearly proved whether these yellow needles may not belong to a
fatty acid whose crystals are stained by the yellow colouring matter.

322                         Prof. G. H. Darwin.                    [Apr.   30,
blue-green    to blue by nitric and sulphuric acids, and generally blue-
green   with  iodine in iodide of potassium (in the solid state).
   On isolation of the yellow constituent of enterochlorophyll by
saponification and extraction with petroleum ether,          I found that it
generally showed only one band, or sometimes two, but these bands
generally gave different measurements from those of plant chloro-
phyll.
   To see whether symbiotic algae were present in the organs yielding
enterochlorophyll,     I examined fresh frozen sections, or portions of
the organ teased out in salt solution, but the results were negative.
On steeping such preparations, first in alcohol, then in weak solution of
caustic soda, and neutralising with acetic acid, and afterwards testing
with a solution of iodine in iodide of potassium and with Schultze's
        I
fluid, never obtained evidence of the presence of starch or cellulose.
Hence, apart from the absence of symbiotic algae under the microscope,
this result negatives their presence and also that of food chlorophyll.
The morphology of enterochlorophyll was studied in similar prepara
tions,    and on the whole it appears to be present dissolved in oil
globules and in granules, both of them enclosed in the epithelium
lining the liver tubes. It also occurs dissolved in the protoplasm of
the liver cells, and these appearances vary slightly in different
cases.
   It  would therefore appear that enterochlorophyll is built up in        the
organ containing it ; that it is a chlorophyll, of which there             are
several in animals, and that it is composed of two constituents, of
which one resembles closely the corresponding constituent of plant
chlorophyll, while the other is generally slightly different, but that no
essential difference   exists between the respective pigments is proved
by the fact that the constituents of both may be obtained crystallised
in the same form.
   In enterochlorophyll there is probably a more intimate union
between the constituents than in plant chlorophyll.
   All  readings are reduced to wave-lengths, and the most important
spectra    mapped in the accompanying charts.           The appearance of
enterochlorophyll     under   the  microscope  in  different   cases is also
shown in the accompanying        drawing,  as well as the crystals   referred
to above.

  plane, and the third is perpendicular thereto.     Moreover the greatest
  and least stress-axes are those which lie in that plane."
     And in a foot-note on p. 200—
     " It is               that if
              easy to see           a viscous sphere be deformed into the
  shape of a zonal harmonic, the flow of the fluid must be meridional,
  and from this we may conclude that in the elastic sphere the plane of
 greatest and least principal stresses must be also meridional. This
 has already been assumed to be the case in the present paper."
     As one of the examiners for the Smith's Prizes at Cambridge, I
 have had placed before me an essay by Mr. Charles Chree, of King's
 College,    in which he considers, amongst other points, the difference
 of principal stresses in an elastic sphere strained under the influence
 of the forces due to a potential expressed by the second zonal har
 monic.      In this essay Mr. Chree has pointed out that the conclusion
 thus arrived at by general reasoning is erroneous.          His analytical
 treatment of the problem is entirely different from mine, and I cannot,
 therefore, avail myself of his actual work in amending the error
 which he has pointed out and corrected.
    It is clear that, in the limiting case of the zonal harmonic where
 the surface becomes a series of parallel mountains and valleys on a
 flat surface, the principal stress parallel to the mountains must be
 zero, and the above reasoning has led to a correct conclusion.
    But in the case of the second zonal harmonic, with either excess
 or deficiency of matter at the pole, there is a tendency for the equa
torial regions to be either squeezed out or crushed in. Now an out
 ward squeeze necessitates that the greatest pressure shall be perpen
dicular to the meridian, and this is contrary to the general conclusion
quoted above. My error lay in overlooking this outward or inward
tendency in the equatorial matter.
    The conclusion is therefore wholly right in the case of the moun
tains and valleys, and at least partially wrong in the case of spheroidal
deformation of the globe.
    The data for examining into this question rigorously are given in
my paper, and the best way of treating the matter is to rewrite § 5
on —
The State of Stress due to      Ellipticity of Figure or to Tide-generating
                                     Forces.
    When the effective disturbing potential W; is a solid harmonic of
the second degree, the solution found will give the stresses caused by
oblateness or prolateness of the spheroid.       It will also serve for the
case of a rotating spheroid with more or less oblateness than is
appropriate for the equilibrium figure.        When an elastic sphere is
under the action of tide-generating forces, the disturbing potential

 solution will apply to this case also.
    If we extract the case i=2 from Tahles I, II, III, and put i=2 in
 (26), and substitute colatitude 0 for latitude I, we have after some

   Hence inside of the ellipsoid N2 — N3 and outside of it N, — N3
is the stress-difference.      N2— N3 nowhere vanishes so long as N2 is
not equal to Ni, and Ni— N3 vanishes where r=§\/2 .a= '9428a and
0=0, which is inside of the region for which N1— N3 is the stress-
difference.    This is the only point in the whole sphere for which the
stress-difference vanishes.
   The ellipsoid of separation cuts the sphere in colatitude 35°      16'.

   If  we put A for stress-difference, then between the centre and              the

   This last also holds for the whole polar axis, along which —
                      19A=6(8a8-9r!)         or 6(9r2-8a2).
    [In the paper the form (g) for A was taken as applicable to the
whole sphere ; the maximum value of A arises from the form (g), and
was therefore correctly computed.]
   In order to find the actual value of A in any special case, we have
to multiply the expression for A by appropriate factors, determined in
the paper.      For the present it will be convenient to omit these
factors.
   We may now from           (/)   and (g) determine the distribution of
stress-difference   throughout the sphere.

curves give the values of 19A, when the radius of the sphere is unity.
The point marked 0 is that where A vanishes.
   The dotted curve is the ellipse of separation (e) cutting the circle
in colatitude   35° 16'.
   Over the polar cap and at the surface 19A is constant and equal to
6; at the surface from colat. 35° 16' to the equator 19A increases
from 6 to 18, varying as the square of the sine of the colatitude.
   At the centre 19A is 48, being eight times the polar superficial
value.
   Beginning with the first sentence of p. 203 the remainder of § 5
will hold good. It is well to observe, however, that where surface
stress-difference is spoken of, it must be taken as referring to the
polar caps only, the stress-difference at the equator being three times
as great.     It is worth while comparing the figure 1 of the paper
(Plate 19)   with  the figure now given.
   We now come to the case of—
               The Stresses due  to the even  Zonal Harmonics.
   The complete determination of the regions within which N2— N:i
and N1 — Ns are the proper measures of stress-difference          might be
somewhat difficult. As, however, these harmonics are only used for
the determination     of stress-difference in the equatorial regions, it is
sufficient to find the boundary of the regions for that part of the
sphere.
   We   see from   (22) that ./{(P— R)2 + 4TS} only differs from      P-R
by terms   which depend on the square of the sine of the latitude.
   Hence as far as the first power of sin I we have
                 N^P-PPi,        N2=Q-Wi,         N3=R-IFi.
   Therefore if we neglect terms depending on the square of the sine
of the latitude, we have from (22),

   The abnormal         vapour-density     of many compounds has been
ascribed to their dissociating to a greater or less degree while in the
gaseous state.        The compound molecule yields, with increase of
temperature,      a constantly increasing amount of those simpler mole
cules   into which it dissociates ; and as this dissociation is attended
with increase of volume, the vapour-density of the mixture of gaseous
molecules decreases with rise of temperature.
   But this phenomenon is not confined to dissociating compounds
alone.    It is known that many, if not all, liquids acquire an abnormal
vapour-density in proximity to their point of saturation.          In studying
                                                                 2 a 2

 the dissociation   of a compound, observations regarding its vapour-
 density,  which   would  apparently lead to a correct estimate of the
 amount of dissociation under any given constant temperature and
 pressure, are complicated by the phenomena exhibited by liquids as
 such ; and it still admits of question whether bodies with such
 abnormal vapour-densities as are displayed by acetic and homologous
 acids, should have their abnormality ascribed to dissociation ; or, less
 exclusively, it may be asked, how much of this abnormality is to be
 attributed to the one cause and how much to the other ?
    To reach a conclusion on this point, it was necessary to study and
 compare the behaviour of substances belonging to the four types :—
 (a) liquids, the vapours of which are not known to dissociate under
 the conditions of temperature of the experiment ; (6) liquids, the
 vapours of which probably dissociate into like molecules ; (c) bodies
 which dissociate gradually in the gaseous state into unlike mole
 cules ; (d) bodies which dissociate completely on passage into the
gaseous state.
    The liquid ethyl alcohol has been chosen as a typical representa
tive of the first class, and its behaviour has been fully studied.
Numerous measurements have been made which establish relations :
— (a) between volume of liquid alcohol and temperature at various
pressures ; (6) between volume of liquid alcohol and pressure (com
pressibility) at various temperatures ; (c) between volume of un
saturated and of saturated vapour, temperature, and pressure ; and
(d) the heats of volatilisation have been calculated from these data.
The limits of temperature extended from 13° to 246°; and the limits
of pressure from 10 mm. to 60,000 mm.
   The point of chemical importance deduced from this research is
that alcohol vapour in contact with liquid acquires its normal density,
23, at about 50° ; and that at lower temperatures no tendency
towards a rise in vapour-density could be detected ; as it will be
shown in a subsequent memoir that the vapour of acetic acid, in
contact with its liquid, acquires increased density on lowering tempe
rature and pressure, the probable conclusion may be drawn that
complex molecular groups are produced in larger number, or exhi
biting greater complexity with decrease of temperature.     The vapour
of alcohol, on the other hand, shows no such tendency.
   This research has also shown that the critical point of ethyl alcohol
lies at a temperature differing not more than 0-5° from 243-6°, and at
a pressure of nearly 48,900 mm., while the volume of 1 gram of the
critical fluid is approximately 3-5 c.c.

  II.  On   the Solubility of Calcium Sulphate in Water in the
       presence of Chlorides."          By William A. Tilden, D.Sc,
       F.R.S., Professor of Chemistry in the Mason Science
       College, Birmingham, and W. A. Shenstone, F.I.C., F.C.S.,
       Lecturer on Chemistry, Clifton College, Bristol. Received
       April  27, 1885.
    It has long been known* that the solubility of calcium sulphate in
water attains a maximum at about 35° C., also that the solubility of
this compound is increased by the presence of common salt. But
accurate determinations of the extent to which the solubility is thus
influenced have not hitherto been published.           Having the means of
determining solubilities at temperatures above the boiling point of
water, and considering the interest from both a theoretical and
practical point of view attaching to these determinations, we under
took the following experiments.           When our work was nearly com-         j
pleted   we  observed a paper by Professor Lunge on the same subject
in the Journal of the Society of Chemical Industry for January
last.   We venture to think, however, that our results are still of
interest as being more systematic, and since every experiment was
done with every precaution and very great care, they are probably
more accurate.      The solubilities at temperatures above 100° have
never before been determined.
    Our former experiments on solubilities at high temperaturesf were
made in a gun-metal tube coated with silver, but in the present series
of experiments the silver was not found to resist the action of the
solutions, and we have therefore employed a tube of platinum.              The
 platinum tube is shown in the accompanying figure.
    The part A is 87 mm., B 123 mm. long.             Both are closed at one
end, and the open ends are ground to fit the union piece C, which
contains a small screen d, and has two small holes at e and /. The
 internal diameter of the arrangement is 12 mm. When joined
 together, the three pieces form a compound tube C, 245 mm. long.
    The salt and solvent are placed in B, a small strainer of platinum
 gauze is introduced at g, and the tubes are fitted together.              The
 whole is then enclosed in the strong gun-metal tube and heated in the
 paraffin bath as already described (" Phil. Trans.").            After four or
 five hours at the desired temperature the solution is drained into A,
 and after turning the tube so that the screen may arrest the flow of
 any subsequent drainings into A, the whole is allowed to cool. The
 small hole at e allows any drops of liquid that may be stopped by the
screen to escape into the outer tube.

   In  the experiments  made at lower temperatures the solutions were
placed    together with  excess of pure calcium sulphate in stoppered
bottles or flasks, which were immersed in the hath maintained at a
constant temperature for at least five hours with constant agitation.
At temperatures above 20° a special contrivance was used for filtering
off the solution required for analysis without change of temperature
or evaporation.
    All the materials employed were pure, and filters purified by acid
were alone used.
   Two series of determinations have been made, the first with a solu
tion containing a fixed proportion of chloride at different temperatures,
and the second at constant temperature with a varying strength of
solution.
   These results are indicated graphically on the accompanying diagram
(fig. 2), from which it will be observed that whilst the solubility
of calcium sulphate in water is increased by the addition of chloride
of sodium or of ammonium, probably owing to double decomposition,
it is diminished by the presence of chloride of calcium. It may also
be noticed, however, that the form of the curve is nearly the same in

   An attempt was made to ascertain the influence of magnesium
chloride.     A solution was made by dissolving pure anhydrous chloride
of magnesium in water, and the calcium             sulphate was digested with
this solution at known temperatures.

   From this it will be seen that whilst the magnesium chloride is
rapidly decomposed and precipitated by the water as the temperature
is raised, yet the solvent action of the hydrochloric acid which is thus
formed in the solution               is partly counteracted, probably by the
magnesium chloride which remains dissolved, and which may act in
the same manner as calcium chloride.

   The addition of common salt, therefore, increases the solubility of
calcium sulphate until the proportion of salt to water is 20 or 25 to
100.    A larger quantity diminishes the solubility. Calcium chloride
added to solution of calcium sulphate causes steady decrease of
solubility, till when the proportion amounts to about 50 to 100 water
the sulphate is practically insoluble.         These results are very plainly
observable   in  the accompanying curve (Fig. 3).
III.  " Contributions to the Chemistry of Chlorophyll.                   Part I."
     By Edward Schunck, F.R.S. Received April 30,                       1885.
                                    (Abstract.)
   The paper treats of the products formed by the action of acids on
chlorophyll. All who have worked with chlorophyll are familiar with
the peculiar effects produced in solutions of chlorophyll by the action
of acids. The colour is changed, and an absorption spectrum makes
its appearance which differs from that of chlorophyll.              According to
some,  these  changes   are due   to a simple modification of the chlorophyll,
others consider they are caused by the formation of products of
decomposition.      The latter view seems the more probable.
   On passing a current of hydrochloric acid gas into an alcoholic
solution of chlorophyll, a dark green, almost black, precipitate is
formed at once.         The greenish-yellow       liquid contains substances
extracted along with chlorophyll by the alcohol, and not connected
with the latter. The precipitate consists essentially of two colouring
matters, phyllocyanin and phylloxanthin, bodies that had been pre
viously observed and so named by Fremy, who however did not obtain
them in a state of purity.            They are best separated by Fremy's
method, which consists in dissolving the mixture in ether and then
adding concentrated hydrochloric acid, when the liquid separates into
two layers, a lower blue one containing phyllocyanin, and an upper
yellowish-green one containing phylloxanthin.              It is immaterial what

 1885.]              The Chemistry    of Chlorophyll.                337
kind of leaves are taken for extraction, the products     are always  the
same.
   The paper deals only with the properties of phyllocyanin, which are
very peculiar.    After being purified in the manner described, it is
obtained as a dark bine mass resembling indigo, and consisting of
microscopic crystals which are generally opaque, but sometimes when
very thin are translucent, and then appear olive-coloured. It stands
heating to 160° without decomposition, but between that temperature
and 180° it is decomposed without previously fusing, leaving a charred
mass which on further heating burns away without residue. It contains
nitrogen, but is free from sulphur.
   Phyllocyanin is insoluble in water, petroleum ether, and ligroin,
but dissolves in alcohol, ether, chloroform, glacial acetic acid, benzol,
aniline, and carbon disulphide.     The best solvent is chloroform. A
minute quantity of the substance imparts an intense colour to any one
of these solvents. It is only on diluting largely that the solutions lose
their opacity.    They then appear of a dull green or olive colour, and
show the well-known and often described spectrum of so-called " acid
chlorophyll," consisting of five bands, three of which are very dark,
one of moderate intensity, and the fifth very faint.
   By oxidising agents, such as nitric or chromic acid, phyllocyanin is
easily decomposed, yielding yellow amorphous products, the solutions
of which show no absorption bands.        It shows a remarkable degree
of permanence as compared with chlorophyll, when exposed to the
combined action of air and light.     A chloroformic solution contained
in a loosely stoppered bottle may be exposed for weeks or even months
to alternate sunlight and diffused daylight before its peculiar colour
and all trace of absorption      bands have disappeared.       When the
process is complete a yellow liquid results, which contains several
products, all of them amorphous, one being easily soluble in water and
exceedingly bitter to the taste. The decoloration of a chlorophyll solu
tion under the same circumstances would take place in a day or two.
   A small quantity of bromine added to a chloroformic solution of
phyllocyanin     changes the colour to a bright grass-green, which
exactly    resembles  that of a chlorophyll solution.      By a further
addition of bromine, the solution loses its green colour and acquires a
 reddish hue ; it now shows the same spectrum as a phyllocyanin
 solution ; but the bands are all shifted towards the red end. An
 excess of bromine produces no further change.        On passing chlorine
 gas through the solution    in chloroform,  it passes through the same
 phases of colour, first becoming grass-green,       then reddish, but a
 further change takes place on continuing to pass chlorine through the
 solution, which now becomes yellow, finally pale yellow, all traces of
 absorption bands at the same time disappearing.       The products both
 with bromine and chlorine are amorphous.

    Phyllocyanin dissolves easily in concentrated sulphuric, hydrochloric,
and hydrobromic acids, yielding dark blue solutions, which show
spectra differing from that of phyllocyanin, and no doubt contain
compounds of the latter with acids.         These compounds however are
unstable, for on the addition of water to the solutions, phyllocyanin
is precipitated     unchanged.      Phyllocyanin shows no tendency to
combine with weaker acids, such as phosphoric, oxalic, tartaric, or
citric acid.
    Phyllocyanin dissolves easily in dilute caustic potash or soda lye.
The solution gives precipitates of various shades of green with earthy
and metallic salts, such as barium chloride, calcium chloride, lead
acetate, and cupric acetate, and these might be called phyllocyanates.
It seems however that by mere solution in alkali, phyllocyanin under
goes some change, for if acetic acid in excess be added to the solution
and it be then shaken up with ether, the precipitate dissolves in the
ether, giving a solution which shows the bands of phyllocyanin, but
if the whole be left to stand some time, the colour of the ethereal
solution changes from green to brown, and it now shows a distinct
and peculiar spectrum, characterised by two bands in the red and two
 fine but well-marked bands in the green, the third and fourth bands
 of phyllocyanin having disappeared, while the fifth still remains. The
 body yielding this spectrum has been prepared and found to yield
 microscopic crystals like phyllocyanin. A different product is formed
 when hot alkaline lye, or, what is better, boiling alcoholic potash or
 soda is employed.      It crystallises in small rosettes, which are green
 by  transmitted,   of a fine purple by reflected light. Its solutions have
 a dull purple colour, and exhibit a distinct spectrum characterised by
 a broad very dark band in the green.         It may be identical with one
 of the products obtained by Hoppe-Seyler from his chlorophyllan with
 alkalis.
    The action of aniline on phyllocyanin is peculiar and interesting.
 When the two are heated together in a sealed tube to 130° the phyllo
 cyanin disappears entirely, giving several products, one of which is
 colourless and crystallises in white needles.      The second, which may
 be an anilide, yields solutions which are quite red, and show a
 characteristic spectrum having three fine bu£ distinct bands in the
 red, and three other very strong bands, one in the yellow, one in the
 green, and one at the edge of the blue.           No similar compound is
 formed when ammonia is used in place of aniline.
    The concluding part of the paper treats of what may be called
 double compounds of phyllocyanin, into which metals and acids,
 especially organic acids, enter as constituents.     Phyllocyanin seems to
  act the part   of  a weak   base, uniting with  strong acids and forming
 unstable    compounds.      In   acetic acid it merely dissolves without
 yielding any compound.         In like manner, when freshly precipitated

cupric oxide or zinc oxide is added to a solution of phyllocyanin in
boiling alcohol no combination takes place. A very different effect is
observed when either of the two oxides is employed along with acetic
acid.    When cupric oxide is added to a solution of phyllocyanin in
boiling acetic acid the solution acquires at once a deep greenish-blue
colour, and it no longer contains uncombined phyllocyanin, for its
spectrum is different, and on standing it deposits lustrous crystals,
which doubtless consist of a compound containing phyllocyanin,
acetic acid, and copper. If zinc oxide be employed a similar effect is
observed, the liquid acquires an intense green colour like that of
a chlorophyll solution, and now contains the corresponding acetate of
phyllocyanin and zinc. The same phenomenon is seen when ferrous
oxide, manganese oxide, or silver oxide is taken, liquids of various
shades of green being obtained which contain phyllocyanin com
pounds, but no similar compounds are formed when potassium,
sodium, barium, calcium, magnesium, or lead acetate is employed.
Acetic acid is, however, not the only acid which yields the reaction.
If palmitic, stearic, oleic, tartaric, citric, malic, or phosphoric acid be
employed, it takes place just as with acetic acid, but in some cases
time is required for its completion.        Oxalic acid, however, seems to
be without effect, and tartaric acid fails in some cases.
   The various compounds have a number of properties in common,
though the several classes differ, inter se, in some important particu
lars.   They all dissolve more or less readily in alcohol, ether, chloro
form, benzol, and carbon disulphide, but are all insoluble in water
with the exception of the phyllocyanin manganese acetate, which
 dissolves readily therein.   The solutions have a green colour varying
from grass-green,    like that  of chlorophyll solutions, to a fine bluish-
green or blue, and they show peculiar spectra. The alcoholic solu
tions remain unchanged when sulphuretted hydrogen is passed
through them, no precipitate is formed, and the solutions on evapora
tion leave the various compounds with their original properties.       It is
only on incineration that the presence of metallic constituents is
 detected.   Lastly, they are all soluble in dilute alkaline lyes, and are
 reprecipitated unchanged on the addition of acetic acid.             These
 reactions make it somewhat doubtful whether these compounds are to
 be considered as double salts in the ordinary acceptation, and whether
 the metallic constituents may not rather be contained in them some
 what in the same way as the iron in hematin.               Of the various
 compounds those belonging to the cupric class are the most stable ;
 they are not decomposed by boiling hydrochloric acid. The zinc
 compounds, on the other hand, are very readily decomposed by
 hydrochloric acid, yielding phyllocyanin.
    The behaviour of phyllocyanin towards zinc oxide in the presence
 of acids may serve to explain a peculiar phenomenon first observed by

  Professor Church, and subsequently described by Tschirch. The
  former took chlorophyll that had become brown on standing, and
 acting on it with zinc powder obtained a body yielding green
  solutions, which he took to be regenerated chlorophyll. Tschirch
  acted on Hoppe-Seyler's chlorophyllan with zinc powder and observed
  the same phenomena, the conclusion at which he arrived being the
 same, viz., that chlorophyll is reproduced            from chlorophyllan by
 reduction.     It is probable, however, that what they obtained was in
 reality a zinc compound of phyllocyanin, and would have been formed
 just as well by using zinc oxide. Chlorophyllan is probably an
 impure substance containing some fatty acid along with phyllocyanin,
 so that by the action of zinc oxide it may yield a compound similar to
 those above mentioned.          The experiment was tried with the crude
 product obtained by passing hydrochloric acid gas into a solution of
 chlorophyll. Some of this was dissolved in alcohol, and the solution
 was boiled with zinc oxide, when it gradually became of a bright
 green like a solution of chlorophyll, but its spectrum differed, being
 identical with that of the zinc compounds obtained directly from
 phyllocyanin.
 IV. " On the         Electric    Resistance     of a New Alloy named
        Platinoid." By J. T. Bottomley, M.A., F.R.S.E. Commu
        nicated by Sir W. Thomson.                Received May 5, 1885.
        Read May 7,      1885.
    In the course of a series of experiments on the electric          resistance
of various metals and alloys, and in particular on the variation of the
electric resistance of these metals and alloys with temperature, I
have examined a new alloy (called by the inventor platinoid), which
has turned out to have important properties.
    This alloy is the invention of Mr. F. W. Martino, of Sheffield; and
I   have to acknowledge my indebtedness to Mr. Martino for having
provided me with specimens of his new alloy and given me informa
tion regarding it ; and for having supplied me with wires specially
drawn down to the finer gauges for my experiments.
    The inventor, searching experimentally for a means of rendering
tarnishable   metals and alloys less tarnishable, had satisfied himself
that the addition of pure metallic tungsten                  imparted greater
density    to alloys,  and  likewise   less tendency    to oxidation.   Having
found a mode of combining a small quantity of tungsten with copper,
nickel, and zinc, he produced a white alloy resembling the alloys of
silver,    which   proved     very  little  tarnishable    under atmospheric

1885.]                  Electric Hesistance   of Platinoid.                      341
influences.      Accordingly he patented the process, and registered the
alloy under the name platinoid.
   Platinoid is practically German silver with the addition of a small
percentage (1 or 2 per cent.) of metallic tungsten.               The tungsten is
added    in the form of phosphide of tungsten, a considerable percentage
of which is in the first place fused with a portion of the copper.               The
nickel is then added       ; and then the zinc and the remainder of the
copper. The mixture requires to be re-fused more than once, and
during the process the phosphorus and a considerable portion of the
tungsten originally added is removed as scoriae.              In the end there is
obtained a beautiful white alloy, which is platinoid. When polished
the alloy is scarcely distinguishable        in appearance from silver.            To
test the    quality claimed for it     as to being untarnishable,        I  have for
some weeks been keeping ornamental           specimens lying exposed to the
ordinary town atmosphere ; and I have satisfied myself that the alloy
has a very remarkable power of resisting the tarnishing influence of
the   air of a large town.
   It is, however, with the electric resistance of platinoid that I have
chiefly interested myself.        German silver wire has proved of great
use in the construction of galvanometer coils and of resistance coils,
on account of two important properties, viz., its very high resistance,
and the smallness of the variation of its resistance with change of
temperature.        Both these properties are possessed in a still higher
degree by platinoid alloy.
   The resistance of German silver differs considerably in different
specimens.        It is commonly stated to be 21-17xl0-6 B.A. ohms
between opposite faces of a centimetre cube at 0°C.* ; or, reducing to
legal ohms, 20935 XlO-6 legal ohms between the opposite faces of a
centimetre cube. The table on page 342 shows the resistance of a
number of specimens of platinoid wire.
   It appears from these results that              the    specific resistance of
platinoid is about one and a half times that of German silver.
    The experiments on the variation of resistance of platinoid with
temperature were carried on in the following way.                The specimen of
 platinoid to be tested was wound on a wooden bobbin, on the surface
of which a screw had been cut, and the spires of the helix were kept
 separate by    lying between the threads of the screw. This coil was im
 mersed    in a bath of oil, and was connected in series with a known wire
of German silver, the temperature of which was kept constant, and with
 a single Daniell's cell.     The differences of potential between the two
 ends of the platinoid wire and the two ends of the German silver wire
 were determined by applying the electrodes of a high-resistance

for this average percentage variation between 0° and 100°, 0'022 per
degree,    with a steadily increasing rate of variation from the
beginning.
   To compare this increase in resistance due to increase of tempera
ture with that observed in other metals and alloys,           I  find that the
percentage increase of resistance for 1° C. at 20° C. for copper is
0-388, platinum-silver alloy 0'031, gold-silver alloy 0-065, and for
German silver 0,044. These numbers were obtained by Matthiessen
in the course of his experiments for finding a suitable metal or alloy
for the purpose of constructing the British Association standards of
electric resistance.     It appears that the variation of resistance of
platinoid with temperature is very much smaller than the smallest
observed for any of the metals and alloys then examined.

   I have now (May 7th, 1885) obtained some information as to the
mechanical properties of platinoid wire.
   I have determined the modulus of rigidity of a wire of the substance,
a portion of the wire marked A in the preceding paper being used for
the purpose.      This wire is a little larger than No. 24 wire of the Board
of Trade Standard wire gauge, and has a diameter of 0'0595 cm.              To
determine the modulus of rigidity a cylindrical ring vibrator was
attached by a cross-bar to the lower end of a length of the wire,
the upper end being fixed by soldering to a brass plate, which was
screwed to a beam in the roof of the laboratory.             The moment of
inertia of the cylindrical vibrator and cross-bar was ascertained ; and
the torsional vibrations of the vibrator hung by the wire were counted,
and the period determined.*           From this, and the dimensions of the
wire, the modulus of rigidity is calculated.
   The following are the particulars of the experiment : —

   The numerous cervine remains which occur in the various collec

for the last twenty-five years, and in this communication two species,
the one hitherto    ill-defined, and the other new to science, have been
described.
   The first, or Cervus verticornis, Dawkins, remarkable for the singular
forward and downward curvature of the first tine, is represented by a
large series of skulls and antlers, which enable the author to define
the changes in antler-form from youth to old age, as well as to rele
gate it to the division of deer with palmated antlers, and to establish
its geological   age to be Pleiocene, and early Pleistocene, in    Norfolk
and Suffolk.
   The second, or Cervus      Savini, is represented by several skulls and
many antlers, which present considerable modifications in form at
varying ages.     It also belongs to the section of deer with palmated
antlers, and is probably the ancestral form of the extinct (Cervus
Broumi, Dawkins) and living (C. dama) types of fallow deer.          It has
hitherto only been met with in the early Pleistocene forest-bed series
of Norfolk and Suffolk.

                                (Abstract.)
    I have  pointed out in this paper the occurrence in the Lower and
Upper Greensand strata of the Wealden area, the Isle of Wight and
the south-western counties, of beds of rock formed to a large extent
of the detached spicular remains of siliceous sponges, and thus
distinctly of organic origin. Their true characters have not been
generally recognised, and they have usually been described as deposits
of sandstone, chert, malm, hearthstone, firestone, &c. In the Lower
Greensand these beds are mainly developed in the lower, or Hythe,
division, and they are exposed at Haslemere, Midhurst, Petworth,
Godalming, Tilburstow Hill near Godstone, Sevenoaks, Maidstone,
and at Hythe.       The sponge-beds vary from three-quarters of an inch
to three feet in thickness ; between them, as a rule, there are inter
vening beds of sand or sandstone. The greatest total thickness of the
sponge-beds exposed in any one section is 11 feet. Sponge-beds are less
common in the higher or Folkestone division of the Lower Greensand,
but they are numerous at Folkestone itself, and reach a total thickness
of more than 8 feet, and there is also a thin bed in this division at
Sevenoaks.      The Lower Greensand strata at Faringdon, in Berkshire,
are of an altogether different character to those of the same formation
in the area treated of in this paper, and the sponges which abound
therein are likewise entirely different, being calci sponges, and
retaining their entire forms.
    The sponge-beds in the Upper Greensand are of two distinct types,
one of which is shown on the northern and western margin of the
Weald, and the other in the Isle of Wight, and further westward in
the counties     of Wilts, Somerset, Dorset, and Devon.      In the first-
named district the sponge-beds are of a soft, greyish-white, siliceons,
or siliceo-calcareous rock, known under the names of malm, hearth, or
firestone.     In this the sponge spicules principally occur in the
negative form of minute empty casts, the presence of which renders
the rock extremely light and porous.      The beds can be traced nearly
continuously along     the northern and western   margin of the Wealden
area, and they are well shown at Godstone, Merstham, near Beigate,
 Betchworth,     Farnham, and Selborne.     Further northwards they are
present at Wallingford, in Berkshire. The beds vary in thickness
from 15 feet at Merstham to 60 feet at Farnham.
    In the more typical Upper Greensand of the Isle of Wight and the

 1885.]                Sponge-remains        in   the Greensand.                   347
south-western counties, the sponge-beds consist of thick layers of
chert and porous siliceous rock at the summit of the series, immedi
ately beneath the so-called chloritic marl; whilst in the lower division
the sponge-remains      principally occur in loose quartzitic sands with
siliceous accretions. The chert or sponge-beds at the top of the Upper
Greensand are best exposed at Shanklin, Ventnor, and the Undercliff,
in the Isle of Wight, at Warminster in Wiltshire, and Penzlewood in
Somersetshire.      They vary from 10 to 25 feet in thickness.           The
sponge-beds   of  the lower  division are scarcely  recognisable  in the Isle
of Wight, but they attain a thickness      of  10  to 20 feet on the summit
of the Blackdown and Haldon Hills in Devonshire, and at Axmouth
in Dorsetshire.     The chert here is only present in beds of subordinate
importance.
   Sponge-beds of similar characters to those of the Greensand have
been described from the Hilssandstein in Westphalia, which is of
Neocomian age, and, judging from specimens which        have examined,I
the
    " Gaize de l'Argonne," which is largely developed in the Ardennes,
                                   " in
and the " Meule de Bracquegnies         Belgium, are sponge-beds, filled
with spicules and spicular casts like those of the Greensand.
  The sponge-remains in the various beds are exclusively those of
siliceous   sponges.     In
                         some the silica of the spicules yet retains its
original colloidal condition, in which it is negative to polarised light
and readily soluble in caustic potash.   The matrix of the sponge-beds
of the malm and firestone is also to a large extent of colloidal or
amorphous silica, and this material has been deposited in the form of
minute globules or disks, and seems to have been derived from the
sponge spicules, with the empty casts of which the beds are through
out filled.
   More generally the original amorphous silica of the sponge-remains
has been altered to chalcedony, and the chert and porous siliceous
rock accompanying        it,
                        which     filled with traces of the spicules, are
                                       is
likewise of chalcedony    occasionally the chalcedony gives place to
                               ;
crystalline silica.
   Glauconite very commonly fills the canals of the spicules, and
remains after the spicular walls have been removed          also replaces
                                                                     ;    it
the spicular walls.
   In some sponge-beds the spicules have been nearly entirely replaced
by crystalline calcite they are embedded in matrix of granular lime
                         ;                                a
stone.
   As a general rule the sponge-spicules are inclosed in     compact           a
matrix in which their forms can only be partially studied, but under
certain conditions they are loosely distributed in sand, or in fine
powder in cavities in chert, from whence they can be obtained quite
free from matrix. The sponge- beds appear to be composed of detached,
free, spicules   of    disintegrated        sponges   ;   entire   sponges are absent.

  These    spicules belong to numerous species.             All four orders of
  siliceous sponges are represented, but whilst the Monactinellid and
  Hexactinellid sponges form but a small proportion, the Tetracti-
  nellid and Lithistid sponges, more particularly those of the Mega-
  morina family, are extremely abundant.

                  Pbeece, F.R.S. Received May 6, 1885.
     1. I have for the past twelve months been experimenting with
 secondary batteries with a view of getting an efficient, uniform, and
 constant source of currents for electric lighting my house, and have          I
 succeeded beyond my expectations.            Some new facts have developed
 themselves during my experience, which 1 have thought of sufficient
 importance to bring before the Society.
     2. The cells are of the Plants type, manufactured by the Elwell
 Parker Company of Wolverhampton. Fourteen plates of plain sheet
lead 17" x 11" are suspended in well insulated wood boxes filled with
diluted sulphuric acid in the proportion of about 1 to 10. These
plates are grouped in two groups of seven, each group being soldered
to a lead strip, forming alternately the positive and negative poles of
the cell.     The plates of the respective poles are prevented from
 touching each other by ebonite grids or separators.*                  Each plate
offers a surface of 1-3 square feet, so that the total surface of lead of
each group opposed to each other is 9-l square feet; that is, 9'1
square feet of peroxidised           lead is opposed to 9-1 square feet of
spongy    lead.    I use  twenty-four such cells.
     3. My charging current varies from 3 to 3| amperes per square
foot, while the current of discharge used in lighting my house varies
from 1 to 1£ ampere per square foot. The total weight of each cell is
    • These ebonite grids were introduced by Mr. Charles Moseley, and have effec
tually removed one incessant source of trouble in these cells, viz., short-circuiting
through the buckling of the plates.

 120 lbs.       The plates are prepared by the Parker- Plante process
before insertion        in the cell, those forming the positive pole being well
peroxidised,       while    those forming the negative pole are well coated
with spongy lead.*              They are thus, when put together, prepared at
once to be charged.             If  they are not at once charged, local action sets
in, and lead sulphate is injuriously formed.
    4.  I  have cut away a small portion of the centre of the central plate
of each cell to admit a hydrometer having a scale graduated from
V050 to ri50.            The changes of the density of the liquid and of the
colour of the plates give the fullest and clearest indications of the
behaviour of the cell.               The condition of the surface of the peroxi
dised plate as felt by the finger is also good evidence of its condition.
If a plate is yellowish-brown and rough, it probably makes bad
contact with the lead terminal ; if black and hard, it wants the
density of current regulated ; if plum-coloured and greasy to the
touch,     it is in good order, and working well.
    5.  At    the present time          I  am charging my battery twice a week,
putting in at each charge about 120 ampere-hours.                            The battery is
charged in two sections.                During each charge observations are made

 before fixing   in the  cells.   This not only chemically      cleans the lead surfaces, but it
 favours the formation of sulphate of lead in such            a way as to be readily converted
 into lead peroxide    and spongy lead on the passage of a strong current through the
 cells.   The formation of the cells is thus greatly expedited.

   6. It  is evident            that  after four hours'     continuous      charging the
battery was full, for the density, the electromotive force, and the
strength of current became constant.                  The same scale of ordinates
is used for volts and amperes.                 When each magnitude reaches its
constant bubbles of gas are freely given forth, and energy is being
wasted.    The variation of the electromotive force and current strength
is clearly due to the counter-electromotive                  force of the cells, which
becomes a maximum only when the plates are fully formed.                                The
counter-electromotive force partakes of the character of a higher
resistance opposing the              charging current, and increasing        the propor
tion of the       current through the shunt of the dynamo.                       Hence the
changes   of electromotive             force are more marked than those of the
current.     Indeed, the changes in the electromotive force, as given by
the voltmeter, are sufficient alone to indicate the progress and com
pletion of the charge.               They are more reliable than the evolution of
gas.  My dynamo is a shunt- wound Gramme, my voltmeter is Cardew's,

       was at first much troubled with electrical leakage.   The
current escaped over the edges of the box through creeping by capil
lary action, and the formation of moisture from the spray of the
solution when bubbles of gas arose in the liquid and burst on the
surface.  This was quite cured by standing each box on three white
porcelain supports of the form shown in the following figure, the
cups being half filled with resin oil on Messrs. Johnson and Phillips'
plan.   It is now quite impossible to measure the leakage except with
a delicate galvanometer, and the insulation may be said to be prac
tically perfect.

    10.  Thinking that this remarkable diminution of internal resistance
 might be due to the evolution of heat,          I measured the temperature
 with a delicate thermometer.
    Normal temperature of cell 12|° C.          Current of discharge:—
         5 amperes      ....  No alteration of temperature perceived.
        10     ,,       ....  An exceedingly slight change.
        16     „        ....  About 12f°.
        20     „              Barely 13°.
    The current in each case was kept on for 20 minutes, hence the
diminution is not due to heat. Since the internal resistance varies
in this way,      I now always take the internal resistance with the same
current, viz., 10 amperes.
    11. The capacity of these batteries certainly improves with age,
and up to the present time        I  have seen no sign of decay or deteriora
tion.     M. Plants informed me that, though in course of time the
peroxidised plate becomes very brittle, it is impossible to peroxidise
it completely through ; there always remains a metallic core to give
it strength.       My experience of these plates confirms this.       Up to the
present moment          I have made no careful measurements             of the
efficiency of my battery.          I  cannot do so without deranging the
lighting of my house, and          I  regard observations on single cells as
illusory.    I                            I
                  put in about 240, and take out about 200 ampere-hours
weekly, and       I do not observe any change or fall in the electromotive
force.    When the electromotive force of these cells falls, it falls
rapidly, indeed, almost suddenly.           Occasionally one plate of a group
becomes inactive from undue local action, or from bad connexion
(shown by the colour).        I                                         I
                                remove this plate and put it in what call a
"hospital"      cell, where   it is brought into order either by a greater
density of current or by reversal.          Now that my plates have been in
use for some time they seem far less inclined to local action.           In the
oldest cells there is no trace of local action.
    12. Reversing has a great beneficial action on a cell ; it not only
improves its capacity, but it removes any cause of irregular working.
It is advisable to do this periodically. I have two extra cells, which
enables me to have two cells always under reversal by means of the
charging current.          It takes from 1,000 to 1,200 ampere-hours to
reverse a cell in its present condition, so that at this time of year it
takes a month or more to complete the operation, and it will take a
year to reverse       the whole   battery.    I have thus, up to the present
 time, reversed 16 cells.

  V. " The     Development       of Peripatus Capensis."         By Adam
       Sedgwick, M.A., Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge.
       Communicated by Professor M. Foster, Sec. R.S. Received
       May 9, 1885.
    The    development     of Peripatus capensis was first studied by
 Moseley, who stopped for a short time at the Cape in November and
 December some years ago.           His observations related only to a
 few   stages comparatively late in development.        Balfour, in 1882,
 found some younger embryos in specimens collected by Mr. Lloyd
 Morgan in July and August.         He had only time to make a very few
observations, of which he left a short record in the form of four rough
drawings and a short note, and a letter to Prof. Kleinenberg, before
starting on his last expedition to Switzerland.           His observations
were so interesting that they were made the subject of a short com
 munication to the Royal Society in the autumn of 1882, and they
were slightly extended by the editors of his last work on the anatomy
of Peripatus capensis, and published with that monograph in the
 "                                               " in the
   Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science              spring of 1883.
   The subject seemed so important that the Government Grant Com
mittee of the Royal Society granted, in the spring of 1883, the sum
of £100 to enable me to go to the Cape for the purpose of obtaining
well-preserved embryos, and of studying the development on fresh
specimens.
   Accordingly,    I  went to the Cape in the summer of 1883, arriving
early in July, and remaining till the middle of August.         I obtained a
large   number   of  specimens, and brought back  with  me   over  300 alive.
Some of the latter lived at Cambridge till the following July.           The
results of my observations at the Cape and after my return to England
have been to show that the embryos remain thirteen months in the
 uterus ; that the fertilised ova pass into the uterus in April, and the
young are born, fully developed, in the May of the year following.
That is to say, the young ova pass into the uterus one month before last
year's young are born.      I was not prepared for this, and I did not, in
1884, examine my specimens for the early stages until May, when the
young were being born. The result was that I missed last year the
early stages of development, and had it not been for the kindness of
Mr. Walter Heape, who went to South Africa last summer, and who
collected and brought back some more live specimens,          I should have
been obliged to leave the early stages undescribed.         Thanks to him,
however, and to my experience gained last year,         I  have this April
been able to find several of the younger stages, and to complete my
observations.
   The testes are fully developed and charged with ripe spermatozoa

in our autumn, when the males deposit spermatophors quite casually
all over the body of the female, and continue to do so until about
January (perhaps a little later).
   The ovaries always contain spermatozoa, but in smaller numbers,
directly after the eggs have passed into the oviduct, than at any other
time.
   How the spermatozoa pass up the uterus and oviducts, which are
always full of embryos, generally containing as many as thirty to
forty,  I do not know.
   Fertilisation is apparently effected in the ovary.                The fertilised
 ova pass     into   the oviduct     in  April,  while  the uterus   is  still full of
embryos almost ready for birth.               Segmentation and the early stages
of development take place in the oviduct, where the eggs remain until
May, when the young are born.                  They then pass into the uterus to
remain there until the following May.
   The ripe ovum is elliptical in shape, and of a dark colour by trans
mitted light.         The opacity is due to the presence of granules (food
yolk).     It   is  enclosed,   when in the oviduct and uterus, by a trans
parent structureless membrane, which is derived apparently from the
follicular cells surrounding the ovarian ovum.
   Segmentation is complete.               The first furrow is in the transverse
plane of the ovum and divides it into two halves.              The second furrow
is at right angles         to  the  first, and  divides  each  of  the first formed
segments into two.            Then each segment divides into two, one small
and   one   large segment.         There are thus four small segments lying
close together on one side of the egg and four large segments.                   The
former give rise to the ectoderm, and the latter to the endoderm.
The subsequent division of these two kinds of cells proceeds inde
pendently.        At the end of the segmentation, the ovum consists of a
number     of    large endoderm cells scattered irregularly within the egg
membrane, while the ectoderm cells form a mosaic of cells closely
applied together and placed close to the membrane on one side at
about the middle of the long axis of the egg.
   The endoderm cells now draw together and form a solid mass of
cells on which the ectoderm rests like a cap.
   The ectoderm then grows round the endoderm cells, and completely
encloses them, excepting at one point (opposite             to that   on  which the
ectoderm cap was placed).
   The embryo thus acquires             a spherical  form, and consists of a solid
gastrula,     the    small   uncovered      spot of endoderm constituting the
blastopore.
   A cavity     then appears in the centre of the endoderm cells, and this
cavity opens to the exterior through the blastopore.
   The embryo now becomes slightly elliptical, and the blastopore
also elongates in the direction of the long axis.

350                            Mr. A. Sedgwick.                           |May    21,
   An opacity appears at the hind end of the blastopore. This opacity
is the primitive streak.    It appears to be due to the active prolifera
tion of some   cells, which  cannot be definitely assigned either to the
ectoderm or the endoderm, at the hind end of the blastopore.         This
stage, which has already been described as stage A in Balfour's
Memoir on Peripatus (" Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science,"
vol. 23, Plate 20, fig. 34), is found most commonly at about the
middle of June.
   The embryo now grows considerably             in length, the blastopore pre
senting a corresponding        elongation,    and the mesoderm, which arises
from the proliferation of the undifferentiated cells of the primitive
streak, grows forward as two ventro-lateral bands, one on each side
of the blastopore.
   The mesodermal                      by transverse division from
                         bands next divide
before backwards into somites, which contain a cavity, part of the
future body cavity. The first somite to appear is the anterior, and
then successively backwards.
  The blastopore now divides into two parts by the obliteration of its
median portion into an anterior part which becomes the mouth of the
adult, and a posterior part which is at first placed at some little
distance from the hind end of the embryo and gives rise to the anus
of the adult.*
   The primitive streak still persists and extends from the hind end of
the blastopore to the hind end of the embryo.      It is now marked by
a groove — the primitive groove.
   The anterior pair of somites have shifted forward to quite the
anterior end of the body ; they give rise to the mesoderm and body
cavity of the praeoral lobes.
   This stage has already been described and figured as stage D in
Balfour's memoir (op. cit., Plate 20, fig. 37).
   The hind end of the body now becomes curved ventrally. The
beginning of this curve is shown in the figure of stage E in Balfour's
memoir (Plate 20, fig. 38).      The curve is produced by the growth of
the hind end of the body.     As this growth proceeds the curve becomes
more marked, and assumes a spiral form, that is to say, the hind end
of the body is spirally coiled, the coil being applied to the ventral face
of the anterior part of the body. (Vide Moseley's figure in the " Phil.
Trans.," vol. 164, Plate 75, fig. 1.)
  * There is no structure in the    embryos of Peripatu* capensis corresponding to
the amnion or placenta described   by v. Kennel in the West Indian species (Semper's
"Arbeiten," Bd. 7). The early stages of that species are obviously difficult to
follow, and have not been entirely made out by that observer.   I  thinkit,therefore,
better not to offer any criticisms on his statements, particularly those with regard
to the amnion, until his observations have been either extended or confirmed. —

   The spiral soon straightens out, and the embryo becomes bent
double, the ventral surface of the hind part of the body being applied
to the ventral surface of the front portion, the tail end of the embryo
being curled round the front end of the head.              The bend occurs at
the level of the 8th somite.         This stage has been figured by Moseley
("  Phil    Trans.," vol.  164,  Plate  75, fig. 4).
   The embryo gains          this  form   at the beginning of October, and
retains    it until birth. The most important internal changes take
place   between   the stage called E and this stage.
   The spiral stage is characterised by the presence of the full number
of somites, the disappearance of the primitive streak, and the shift
ing of the anus to the hind end of the body.               The appendages also
begin to appear in this stage.        They arise as hollow processes of the
body    wall, containing prolongations of the somites. The first pair to
appear are the antennae, into which the praeoral somites are prolonged.
The remainder appear from before backwards in regular order, viz.,
jaws, oral papillae, legs, 1,2,. . . 17, and the rudimentary anal papillae
which are the appendages of the last, i.e., the 21st somite.            The end
of the spiral stage is also characterised by the appearance of the
buccal fold or fold which encloses the jaws and buccal cavity, and so
constitutes the tumid lips of the adult.            This is a fold of the side
walls of the body immediately outside the jaws, and extending from
the praeoral lobe of its side to just behind the jaw.             This is most
marked in front, which fact led Moseley to describe it as a backward
process   of the  praeoral  lobe.
   I   now pass to the internal changes, by which the various organs
are established.
                                  The Ectoderm.
   The ectoderm, excepting at the points where it gives rise to the
nervous system, is always one-layered.           During stage E the cells on
the median portions       of the dorsal and ventral surfaces are extremely
flat ; those on the sides are columnar,       and especially so over the ventral
 parts of the sides of the body.         Here indeed the ectoderm becomes
during the spiral stage more than one cell thick, and gives rise to a
 thickening extending along the whole length of the body, passing
forward on each side of the mouth on to the praeoral lobes.
   Nervous System. — The entire central nervous system develops
from    these  continuous     ventro-lateral thickenings of the ectoderm.
 The ventral nerve     cords and oesophageal commissures arise from the
 deeper rounded      elements of the thickenings as two ventro-lateral
 cords,  which in front of the mouth are still continuous with the ecto
 derm.
   The nervous ectodermal thickenings in front of the mouth are
 enormously developed, even during the spiral stage, and the nervous

  rudiments       in this region remain connected with the surface ectoderm
  much longer than do those of the hinder parts of the body.                  In fact
  it may be said that the praeoral part of the central nervous system
  never does separate       from   the ectoderm which gives  it origin,  inasmuch  as
  the latter   is invaginated in      the form of two  longitudinal furrows, which
 soon become deeper, and eventually                 closed, in exactly the same
 manner that the medullary groove of a vertebrate embryo is closed.
 Two closed vesicles thus originate, one for each of the future cerebral
 ganglia.       These vesicles are lined by ectoderm, and by that particular
 ectoderm from which the nerve elements of the ganglia originate :
 they persist throughout life as the small hollow appendages of the supra-
 oesophageal       ganglia, described and figured by Balfour in his memoir
  (op. cit.,  Plate    17, figs. C, D).
     The eyes arise as invaginations of the sides of the nervous
 thickenings of the praeoral lobes during the spiral stage. The invagi
 nations are at first shallow, but soon become deeper, and eventually
 converted into closed vessels, the front wall of which (i.e., the wall
 next the skin) forms the epithelium outside the so-called lens of the
 adult eye, while the internal wall thickens, and remains continuous
 with the cerebral ganglion, and gives rise to the retina. The enclosed
 vesicle persists and apparently becomes filled by the structureless lens
 of the adult eye, if the structure described as such be not a mere
 coagulum produced by reagents.               The eye of Peripatus is therefore a
 cerebral eye.
     Stomodseum and Proctodseum. — The ectoderm grows inwards
 for a short distance, at the front and hind ends of the alimentary
 canal.     The anterior ingrowth gives rise to the lining of the pharynx,
and possibly — but of this I am not yet certain — the oesophagus of the
adult. The buccal cavity of the adult is formed, as                 I   have already
 pointed     out,   by  a  fold  of  the integument which encloses the jaw and
 external openings of the salivary gland.                 The posterior ingrowth
forms    the    lining   of  the  rectum.
                                      The Endoderm.
     The endoderm           arises from the large segmentation cells which
arrange      themselves      round a cavity, the future mesenteron.
    The mesenteron, from its very first appearance, opens to the
exterior.        This opening or blastopore gives rise, as described above, to the
permanent front and hind openings of the alimentary canal.
    The mesenteron possesses no glandular appendages of any kind
whatsoever.
                                      The Mesoderm.
    The mesoderm arises, as described above, from the undifferentiated
cells of the primitive streak of the early stages.               It is completely

established by the spiral stage, when the primitive streak vanishes, and
the anus shifts to the hind end of the body.              In the original account
of the early stages in Balfour's memoir, it was stated by the editors
(p. 256) that      the greater     portion of the mesoderm was formed from
the primitive       streak.
    I am now       in a position    to state that the whole of the mesoderm
originates in     this manner.
    On the view that the primitive streak is the remains of a portion of
the    blastopore and the ingrowth of cells from it a modified develop
ment of that part of the ancestral archenteron which gave rise in the
ancestor to the somites, the mesoderm of Peripatus is to be regarded
as   developing from the walls of the archenteron.*
    The mesoblastic bands at once become segmented, a cavity appearing
in each somite as it becomes marked off.
    The anterior somite, which is the first to be formed, is at first
placed some little distance behind the front end of the blastopore.                It
soon shifts forward, and by stage           E  is placed in  front of the embry
onic mouth.
    The somites are from the first placed at the sides of the mesenteron.
When the appendages are formed they send prolongations into
them ; this remark applies to the antennae as well as to the other
appendages.
    The body cavity of the adult is very complicated, and divided into
several parts, viz. : (1) the main central division containing the gut;
(2) two lateral chambers separated from (1) by a longitudinal vertical
septum, and containing the nerve cords ; (3) the body cavities of the
legs, separated from (2) by a vertical septum, and containing the
segmental organs and crural glands ; (4) the pericardial cavity.                  Of
these (1) and (2) are         derived,  not from   the cavity of the somites, but
from a space which         is formed by the separation of the endoderm from
the   ectoderm,     and  from   the inner wall of the somites, these being at
first in contact.       At first these divisions of the body cavity have no
special     lining   of  cells, but subsequently migratory cells from the
somites      apply themselves to the endoderm and ectoderm, and form
the very sparse lining found in the adult.
    The cavities in the legs are derived from the cavities of the somites,
the changes of which          I                                       I
                                will now shortly relate, so far as have been

   *  It was from this point of view that the editors of Balfour's memoir (op.
rit.) made the second statement at the bottom of p. 256 with regard to the meso
derm.     This statement, which runs thus, " Tho greater part of the mesoblast is
 developed from the walls of the archenteron," is obviously at variance with the
statement already referred to at the top of the same page, unless considered in the
light of the above hypothesis. It was meant to be so considered, and    I regret that
 the omission of the explanation now given has led to some misunderstanding.

360             The Development        of Peripatus Cupensis.              [May     21.
indicated below, with regard to these changes which, are still some
what obscure.
    When the appendages appear, the somites become prolonged into
them.     The portion of the somite in the leg soon (at about the end of
the spiral stage) becomes separated from the remainder, which shifts
dorsalwards, and comes into contact with its fellow along the dorsal
middle line above the gut.         I will in future refer to the former as the
leg division of the somites, and to the latter as the dorsal division.
    The leg division becomes inconspicuous in the antennae and jaws.
In the remaining appendages (oral papillae and seventeen pairs of
legs) it acquires an opening to the exterior at the base of each
appendage and immediately outside the nerve cords.
    The portion of the leg body cavity, which thus communicates with
the exterior, gives rise to the segmental organs.                   The segmental
organs are never completely separated from the rest of the leg body
cavity, except in the case of the first, the aperture of communication
persisting as the internal opening of the nephridium.
    The anterior segmental organ, viz., that of the oral papilla, gives
rise to the salivary glands of the adult.*
    The segmental organs then develop in Peripatus, as they do in
Elasmobranchs, by the direct modification of parts of the primitive body
cavity. These constitute,       I  believe, the only two cases in which such
a method of development of these organs has been observed.
    The cells of the splanchnic lining of these dorsal divisions of the
body cavity contain during the spiral stage the primitive generative
cells. But it is difficult to say where the generative cells originate,
because during the spiral and later stages nuclei exactly similar to
those of these cells are placed in groups in the portion of the endo-
derm which is in contact with that part of the splanchnic mesoderm
which contains the generative cells.            I  cannot therefore be certain
that the generative cells do not arise in the endoderm and subse
quently migrate into the splanchnic mesoderm.                 However that may
be, they soon become       surrounded by some of the smaller flat cells             of
the mesoderm which constitute the egg follicle. So far the develop
ment of the somites is quite clear and easy to follow.                      But the
changes by    which    the  dorsal   divisions   of  the  somites    are  converted
into their permanent form take place at a late period of development
— during November — and are, in consequence of the thinness of the
walls, extremely difficult to follow. I have not succeeded entirely in
following them.
    I will content myself, therefore, with making the following state
ment, of the truth of which       I  am by no means confident.
    The dorsal divisions unite with each other transversely and longi-

opening of the salivary gland, not of the slime gland as he states (see below).

tudinally, and give rise to a continuous cavity— the pericardial cavity.
The portion of this cavity containing the generative cells become
separated from the rest as two tubes which form the generative
glands and part of their ducts, and come to lie ventral to the peri
cardium in the central compartment of the body cavity. The external
parts of the generative ducts appear to be derived from the modified
leg cavity of the anal papillae.
     I   have    no satisfactory observations on the development of the
heart ;      but  it appears to arise from the cells in the dorsal middle line
 which intervene between the two dorsal divisions of the somites
before they unite with one another across the middle line.
     The slime glands are epiblastic in origin. They first appear as an
 invagination of ectoderm, at the apex of each oral papillae.                They
 have nothing to do with nephridia.
     I  have no observations on the development of the crural glands,
 neither have I been able to see anything of the development of tracheae.
  I trust that the Society will deem the foregoing results of sufficient
  interest to justify this short preliminary, but I fear too long delayed,
  account of my observations on the development of Peripatus capensis.
  The delay has been occasioned by the fulfilment of engagements
  which were undertaken before I went to the Cape, and have proved
  more arduous than         I  had anticipated.    My observations are nearly
  completed, and the greater part of the drawings are made ; and I
   trust that the detailed account will soon— before the autumn — be
   ready for publication.

       of Salt and Fresh Water.                Experimental Research.
      Part II (Gravimetric)." By Thomas Andrews, F.R.S.E.,
      Wortley Iron Works, near Sheffield.             Communicated by
      Professor G.     G. Stokes,       Sec.   R.S.  Received    May 29,

fusion in Tidal Streams     (see Proceedings Royal Society," No. 232),
the author recorded the electrical part of this investigation.       The
present communication      contains the concluding gravimetric experi
ments of the research.    The effects attending the diffusion of the salt
and fresh water in tidal estuaries, on parts of the same metal, were
estimated in each case for a period of one year, during which the
metals   were  constantly exposed to conditions        of galvanic action
similar to those obtaining in some tidal streams.             The results
demonstrate that electric disintegration of the nature alluded to
in this and the former paper (viz., the galvanic destructive action
on parts of even the same metal, arising from difference of potential
during diffusion between the surface and lower waters in a tidal
stream) is, on comparison with other investigations by the author,
apparently of much greater extent than the loss either from simple
corrosion in sea water alone, or than that which ensues from the
action on each other of dissimilar metals of this group (such as
wrought iron, cast metals and steels) in galvanic connexion in sea
water.     The wrought iron, steels, and cast metals used were from
the author's standard samples of known composition in the form of

374       Mr.  T. Andrews.      Action of Tidal Streams on     [June   18,
    The plate A standing alone and unconnected was immersed in the
vessel   S containing a measured quantity of sea water.
    The plate D also stood unconnected in the vessel F, and the action
on this plate was similar to that on plate C, though somewhat
modified in extent.      This plate, although standing isolated, afforded
another confirmatory indication of the extensive corrosion of metals
exposed in water less saline at the surface than near the bottom, not
withstanding that the total salinity of the water in vessel F was
greatly below that of the sea water.
    The plate B was immersed in the sea water, but galvanically con
nected with the plate C in the vessel F.
    In the case of the last two plates B and C, circuit was completed,
and slow bat continuous diffusion between the two solutions accom
plished by means of a triple fold of soft moistened chamois-leather L
 (1 inch wide), one end of which was immersed deeply in the sea
water, the other to an equal depth in the distilled water, see fig. 1.
The sea water was obtained regularly from Filey Bay. The vessel
was filled at the commencement with 25 fluid ounces of sea water, the
vessel F with the same volume of distilled water.             Both were
emptied by siphon (without disturbing the plates) and each carefully
refilled with their respective waters periodically every fourteen days
for a total period of fifty-two weelcs.    Seven pairs of such diffusion
cells of equal size were employed in the investigation.     At the termi
nation the plates were taken out, washed, carefully cleaned, dried at
212° F., and again weighed on the balance, and the corrosive effects
determined by their relative loss in weight— the results are sum
marised in Table C.
    The arrangement, fig. 1, was made so that the plate C, from its
position,   was exposed near the bottom at (a) to the action of water
containing rather more salt than the water adjacent to the top at (I),
whilst constant diffusion was at the same time proceeding, the salt
water from vessel S also coming over into the distilled water at an
increasing ratio, by means of the soft moist leather connexion ; the
water, however, about the position (6) nearer the surface, maintained
a less saline composition than at (a), and the estimation of this dif
ference between top and bottom water during the periodic slow dif
fusions, is shown     in the following analysis, selected as an example
from   a number of    similar observations taken at intervals during the
progress of the investigation.
    It will be seen that the diffusion cell arrangements allowed equili
brium of composition between bottom and surface to be restored in
about fourteen days.         As there was easy communication        (about
   inch)  around  the  edges, not only of the plate C, but of the others,
the fluid during diffusion in vessel F would probably arrange itself
in layers of fairly equal density therein.    These diffusion results also

compare favourably with statistics (examined and formerly referred
to by the author, and some of which are given in the Appendix) as
to differences of composition            between surface and bottom waters
during diffusion in some portions of such a tidal stream as the
Thames, and therefore afford an approximation to effects arising from
similar conditions existing during such tidal action ; the propor
tional difference of salinity between top and bottom waters in parts
of the Thames during certain states of tide, &c., being, however,
sometimes greater than the experimental                  divergencies       given on

  The samples of water for analysis were carefully taken from vessel F by pipette
at points indicated on fig. 1 for convenience   and accuracy, so as least sensibly to
disturb the solution.
   The electric action between the plate (which was the positive
metal throughout the whole period) in the sea water and that in the
other water, was in course of the research ascertained by occasionally
introducing in the circuit a delicate galvanometer of known resist
ance and constants,          and the resistance of the cells having been
regularly determined, the highest E.M.F., in the case of two repre
sentative plates, was found to be about 0'14 volt, which gradually
reduced as diffusion proceeded.
   The loss by simple corrosion in the sea water alone, as compared
with that taking place in the diffusing salt and fresh water, is shown
by the relative behaviour of the two plates A and C, of the same

metal    in each    case,   from which it is manifest that a diffusing mixture
of salt and fresh water, although containing a comparatively small
proportion of saline matter, is capable of setting up an amount of
corrosive mischief far greater than that arising from the action of
sea water only, the increased, loss varying from about 15 up to 50 per
cent., according to the nature of the metals.                 From a reference to
column 3 it will also be seen that the combined action of the sea
and distilled water (although showing only such a slight saline com
position and difference of salinity as indicated on Table B of analysis)
whilst diffusing, produced an amount of local galvanic action in the
same plate C, sufficient to induce therein much greater corrosion than
in the case of plate B, although the latter was constantly immersed in
the sea water (containing 2276'8 grains per gallon of sodium chloride),
and was at the same time metal positive, as indicated by the galvano
meter.

than the action of sea water alone.
   Moreover, the author has found it (in other experiments extending
over long periods) to considerably exceed (in some instances varying
from about 55 to 120 per cent.) the loss caused by galvanic action
between dissimilar metals of the iron and steel group, in circuit in
sea water.
   The arrangement of the waters in tidal streams and various effects
consequent thereon form an intricate study ; the author trusts, how
ever, that the limited observations recorded in the present and the

aspect of the subject.
                                 Appendix.
   The gradual rise and consequent inward flow of salt water and
the outward flow of fresh water, has a general tendency to arrange
the waters of a tidal stream into long, overlapping, wedge-like,
layers or formations, the lower containing denser salt water and the
upper more fresh water.       This disposition of the waters is modified
very considerably    by   currents,   inter-diffusion, and numerous other
conditions.     The arrangement and diffusion of the salt and fresh
water may not necessarily, at all places in the stream, be of an even
character, almost isolated bodies of salt and fresh water not impro
bably accumulating in the numerous creeks, basins, or other indenta
tions along the shores. The general contour of a stream, the in
fluence of rainy or dry seasons (affecting the proportion of fresh
water), the fact of its estuary being either long, deep, and narrow,
affording little fall, or, on the contrary, of a wide shallow character,
the states and times of tide, &c., and many other circumstances, also
variously modify the diffusion results.
   To illustrate further the basis and nature of this investigation,
the author gives on Table D some typical analyses, selected from in
formation relating to the disposition of the waters of tidal streams,

   The overwhelming evidence which has been now accumulated of
the fact that some at least of the diseases called "zymotic" are pro
 pagated by means of living organisms, renders it interesting to dis
cover in what manner such organisms may be removed from the
media — air and water — through which they are in general distributed.
                           I
In the following pages have the honour to bring before the Royal
 Society  the results of some experiments upon which         I have been
recently engaged,  with  a  view to discover  whether and to  what extent
micro-organisms    may be removed from water by submitting this
medium to some of the various processes of treatment which are in
vogue for its purification. For although the chemical efficiency of
numerous methods of water-purification has been largely studied,
little has been done in the matter of determining their value as agents
for the removal of micro-organisms.
   The method of investigation which        I  have adopted was to take
water in which the number of organisms was approximately known,
submit this to treatment in such a manner as not to introduce extra
neous organisms     during the experiment, and then determine the
number of organisms which remained in a given volume of the water
after treatment.     Since we are doubtless at present only acquainted
with a few of the micro-organisms which are capable of producing
disease, it appeared to me to be, in the first instance, desirable to
study the question irrespectively of the nature of the organisms, and
only to take into consideration     their aggregate number before and
after treatment.     Moreover the employment of specific organisms
would in all cases have greatly enhanced the difficulty of the expe
riments, and would in some cases have actually rendered them
impossible.
   The organisms generally used in these experiments were those
which develope in diluted urine after exposure to the air.      The solu
tion was further diluted more or less with water so as to obtain a
liquid containing a convenient number of organisms in a given
volume.
   The method of determining the number of organisms present in the
waters, both before and after treatment, was, with a few modifi
cations, that devised by Koch, in which a definite volume of water is
mixed with sterilised nutritive gelatine and then poured out upon a

380                        Dr. P. F. Frankland.                 [June 18,
glass plate, when, after the lapse of a few days, the colonies derived
from the individual centres of life can be counted by means of a lens,
and from this the number present in a cubic centimetre or any other
volume of water can be calculated.      The following is a description of
the exact mode of procedure adopted : — .
        Determination of the Number of Micro-organisms   in Water.
    The nutritive gelatine was prepared thus : — 1 lb. of lean meat is
finely minced and then infused with        litre of water for 1 — 2 hours,
the solid part being then strained off through linen. 100 grams of
white French gelatine is allowed to soak in another        litre of water,
and to this the extract of meat obtained above is added. The whole
is now boiled for a few minutes to complete the solution ; 10 grams of
peptone and 1 gram of common salt are then added and dissolved.
The mixture so obtained gives an acid reaction, which is carefully
neutralised with carbonate of soda.       The liquid is now clarified by
beating in the contents of two or three eggs along with the broken
shells, the whole being briskly boiled for a few minutes.      The coagu
lated albumen rises to the surface and carries with it the other solid
particles in the liquid.     On then straining through linen, an almost
clear liquid is obtained, which is finally clarified by passing through
filter-paper kept hot by means of a water-jacket. On cooling this
liquid, it sets to a yellowish-brown transparent jelly. Whilst still
liquid it is poured into clean test-tubes, so that each of these contains
2 or 3 c.c.   The test-tubes are tightly plugged with cotton-wool, and
then sterilised by steaming them for half an hour, on three consecutive
days.    Tubes thus prepared were found to keep for an indefinite period
of thne. The glass plates destined to receive the film of gelatine were
well washed, and then placed in a copper box provided with a tightly
fitting lid, the whole being sterilised by heating for at least three
hours to 150° C.
    The glass dishes in which the gelatine plates are placed during the
development of the organisms were always well washed, and then rinsed
 with a 2 per cent. solution of mercuric chloride immediately before use.
Some of the same solution of mercuric chloride was poured into the
bottom dish, so as to preserve the internal atmosphere saturated with
moisture, and the two dishes were always placed in a porcelain tray
 containing a solution of mercuric chloride, so that the interior of the
 dishes was disconnected from the outside air by means of a mercuric
chloride seal, whereby all ingress of organisms from the atmosphere
 was prevented during incubation.      The dishes also contained a small
glass tripod, bearing a glass plate, the surface of which was carefully
 levelled by placing the dishes on a table provided with three screws.
When the apparatus is thus prepared, the sterilised plate is rapidly
 transferred to the levelled plate, the gelatine is carefully melted in

  1885.]       The Removal     of Micro- Organisms from      Water.       381
 its test-tube, and before removing the cotton-wool plug the latter is
 burnt outside,    so as to destroy any organisms that may be adhering
 to the exterior.      A given number of drops of the water or other
liquid under examination are now introduced into the open test-tube
 by means of a pipette, which has been previously sterilised by heating
 it nearly to redness in a Bunsen flame. The water and liquid gelatine
 are mixed by agitation, and then quickly poured out on to the steri
 lised plate, the glass cover being immediately replaced.           The whole
 operation is so managed that the time of exposure to the air is
reduced to a minimum.              A solution of mercuric chloride is then
poured into the porcelain tray as already described, and when the
gelatine has set, which generally takes place in about ten minutes,
the dishes are placed in a cupboard, and maintained at a temperature
of 20—25° C.
    After a period of incubation, varying from 3 — 6 days, the organisms
make their appearance in isolated colonies, which may be readily
counted with the assistance of a lens. The operation of counting is
greatly facilitated by placing the plate on a black ground, ruled in
squares.
    That when due precautions are taken in the execution of this pro
cess  little or no appreciable error is introduced by the unavoidable
but momentary contact of the gelatine with the air, was proved by
making blank experiments, in which all the abovementioned opera
tions, excepting the addition of water, were performed, and in these
cases no organisms were found.          Additional proof of this is also fur
nished by the fact that on several occasions no organisms were found
in the course of the experiments to be described below.
    The experiments were in nearly all cases made in duplicate, the
concordance in the results of parallel experiments being, on the whole,
very satisfactory ; occasionally, however, wide discrepancies did occur,
but these could in most cases be accounted for through the water
under examination not having been rendered sufficiently homogeneous
by agitation.
        Experiments    on the  Filtering tower of Different  Substances.
    The substances      selected for experiment were natural greensand,
silver sand, powdered glass, brickdust, coke, animal charcoal, and
spongy iron.
    These substances were all obtained in a fine state of division by
powdering them in a mortar, and then passing them through a sieve
(40 meshes to the inch).           The filters were constructed of pieces of
glass  tubing (1 inch diameter), drawn off at one extremity to a small
aperture    ; the latter was plugged with a small quantity of asbestos,
and upon this was placed a column 6 inches in height of the closely
packed filtering material, the surface of which was again protected by

382                        Dr. P. F. Frankland.                    [June    18,
a thin layer of asbestos.        Before use, the filter thus prepared was
sterilised by heating it to a temperature above 150° C. for at least
three hours.     After sterilisation the filter was at once put in opera
tion by supplying the infected water at the wide end of the tube, the
filtered water being collected when required in a vessel sterilised in
the same way beneath the lower extremity of the tube.                In those
experiments in which the filtration was carried on for many days, or
even weeks, the infected water was constantly supplied to the filter
by means of an inverted flask fitted with a delivery-tube, the latter
dipping into the water above the filtering material.         The following
results were obtained with the various materials : —
    Greenland. — The urinous water passed through this filter, on start
ing, at the rate of 2-07 inches per hour.       The sand was highly ferru
ginous, and the filtered water contained a noticeable proportion of
iron.
    On examining the unfiltered water, it was found to contain 64 centres
of life in one, and 97 centres per c.c. in a duplicate experiment ; these
consisted almost wholly of organisms causing liquefaction of gelatine,
a few fungi, and the remainder small spherical colonies.                In the
filtered water, on the other hand, there were no organisms of any
description discoverable.      The filtration had thus completely sterilised
the water.
    In order to ascertain whether        the greensand would continue         to
exercise this influence,   the arrangement for continuous filtration,        as
already described, was put in operation, and after being in action for
thirteen days, during which time 7'1 litres of water passed through,
the efficiency of the filter was again tested.        The unfiltered urine-
water was found to contain 8193 centres per c.c.         The filtered water
was found to contain      1071 centres per c.c.    These experiments show
that although the original power of the greensand was broken down,
the filter was still arresting a considerable proportion of the organisms
present in the water passing through it.
    The efficiency of the filter was again determined after the con
tinuous   filtration had proceeded for one month, when 20 litres of
water had passed through.        The following results were obtained :—
         The unfiltered water contained     . . 1281 centres per c.c.
         The filtered      „        „       ..   779
    On the whole, therefore, even after the lapse of an entire month, a
notable proportion of the organisms was still being removed by the
greensand filter.
    Animal Charcoal.   — Perfectly similar experiments     were made with
this well-known filtering material.        On examining the initial efficiency
of the filter, it was found that whereas the unfiltered water contained
so many organisms that the gelatine on the plates had become entirely

 1885.]      The Removal        of Micro-Organisms from             Water.       383
liquefied, the filtered water did not contain in either of two experi
ments any organism whatever.               The filter had thus completely steri
lised the water passing through it.
   The rate of filtration was considerably less rapid than in the case
of the greensand, being only 0'82 inch per hour.                   Continuous filtra
tion was then carried on for twelve days, during which time 4-2 litres
of water passed through, after which the unfiltered and filtered waters
were again examined.
      The unfiltered water contained             . .   2792 centres per c.c.
      The filtered        „           „          . .   No organisms of any kind.
   Thus    the efficacy of the filter remained unimpaired after twelve
days'  continuous    action.
   After acting for one month, 14'6 litres of water having passed
through, the waters were again examined.
        The unfiltered water contained. .               1 281 centres per c.c.
        The filtered          „          „         ..   6958
   Thus at the end of one month the filter was actually delivering
water more highly impregnated with organic life than that with which
it was supplied.
   Spongy Iron. — The filtering power of this material was also examined
by means of a similar series of experiments.                   The rate of filtration
at the commencement was l-84 inches per hour, and the following
results were obtained      : —
         Unfiltered water contained        ....       80 centres per c.c.
        Filtered       „          ,,       ....       No organisms whatever.
   After twelve days' continuous filtration, 3-6 litres of water having
passed through, the following results were obtained : —
            Unfiltered water contained.          .    2792 centres per c.c.
            Filtered         „          „     .  .    No organisms whatever.
    Again, at the close of one month's continuous filtration, 9 litres of
 water having passed through, the examination was repeated : —
            Unfiltered water contained.          .    1281 centres per c.c.
            Filtered         „       ,,       .   .        2   ,,      „
    The column      of spongy iron, 6 inches in depth, was thus able to
 remove all the organisms from the water for upwards of twelve days,
 and even at the end of the month, the water after filtration was
 almost destitute of organic life.          The rate of filtration was, however,
 greatly  diminished   in    the course    of   the month during which the filter
 was in operation.       It is worthy of notice that the organisms found
 in the filtered water were all of the same kind, and caused no lique

     This material, therefore, does not wholly remove the organisms,
 even when fresh, but it continues, even after five weeks, to remove a
 considerable proportion of them.
     Coke. — With this material, which was also used in the           same state
 of division, the following results were obtained : —
                                Initial efficiency.
             Unfiltered water contained.      .  3112 centres per c.c.

    This substance,     therefore,    possesses   filtering powers which are
 second only to those of spongy iron ; at the outset the result is equally
 perfect with both, and even at the close of five weeks' continuous
 work the coke removes a large proportion of the micro-organisms
present in the unfiltered water.             Moreover, the rate of filtration
 through coke was considerably greater.             In the case of the coke, as
in that of the spongy iron, the organisms found in the filtered water
were almost exclusively of one kind, only one colony causing lique
faction, forming an exception.
    Silver Sand. — Owing to the highly ferruginous character of the
greensand employed in the previous experiments, and bearing in mind
the well-known antiseptic properties of salts of iron, it was deemed
advisable to investigate the filtering power of sand free from iron.
The silver sand employed for this purpose was digested for some days
with hydrochloric acid, the latter then carefully washed out, and the
filter sterilised as already described.           The following results were
obtained    with  this material  : —

    The rate of filtration was exceedingly rapid, viz., 1 inch in less
than two minutes, or more than 30 inches per hour.                  The number of
organisms      found    in  the   unfiltered    and   filtered waters  respectively
were —

    Thus already at the outset the silver sand filter fails to arrest all
the organisms in the water, although it very considerably diminishes
their number, even when the rate of filtration is exceedingly rapid.
    Powdered Glass. — This material also was employed, with a view to
determining the value of non-ferruginous siliceous matter.                The rate
of filtration in this case was also very great, viz., 1 inch in less than
eight minutes.
     The following results were obtained          : —

     The results obtained with the powdered glass very closely resemble
 those obtained from the silver sand ; but as neither were efficient
 filters, even at the outset of their action, no further experiments were
made with them.
 Benwval of Micro-organisms            by   Agitation with Finely Divided     Solid
                                          Matter.
     The above experiments show that micro-organisms may be more or
 less completely     removed by mere contact with solid particles, some
  of which are incapable of exerting any chemical action upon them ;
  it therefore appeared of interest to ascertain whether these orga
  nisms   may be removed by agitating the water with the same sub
  stances, and then     allowing them to subside. The experiments under
  taken   with this object were conducted in the following manner : —
     50 c.c. of urine-water,        in which the number of organisms was
  determined, were placed        in   a small accurately stoppered bottle, pre
  viously sterilised by being heated to 150° C., for at least three hours.
  A given weight of the substance was placed in a small test-tube,
  plugged with cotton-wool, and then sterilised in the same way.                The
  sterilised substance was then transferred to the water in the stoppered
  bottle, and the latter violently shaken for a definite length of time,
  after which it was allowed to stand at rest until complete subsidence
  had taken place.      Some of the clear supernatant liquid was then taken
  out with a pipette, and examined for organisms by means of gelatine
  cultivation in the manner already described.              The substances were in
  all cases employed in the same state of division as in the filtration
   experiments.

    Spongy Iron. — 5 grams of this substance were shaken up with
50 o.c. of urine-water in one case for one minute, and in another for
fifteen minutes; in both cases the waters were subsequently allowed
to subside for half an hour before examination.      The following results
were obtained : —
          Untreated water                          609 centres per c.c.

               ,,     ,,       „     ,, 15 minutes  63     „       „
    Thus the reduction in the number of organisms by agitation is
exceedingly marked, and curiously the most favourable result was
obtained when the agitation was only continued for a single minute.
A pure cultivation was not obtained in the treated water, some colonies
 producing liquefaction of gelatine, and others not, thus presenting a
contrast to the results obtained by filtration through this material.
     Chalk. — 1 gram of water was shaken up with 50 c.c. of urine-
 water for fifteen minutes, and then allowed to subside for five hours.
 The following results were obtained : —
     Untreated water                                8325 centres per c.c.
     Water after 15 minutes' agitation with chalk     274    „       „
     A very large reduction      indeed in the number    of organisms   was
 thus obtained.
     Animal Charcoal. — 1 gram of animal charcoal was shaken up with
 50 c.c. urine-water for fifteen minutes, and then allowed to subside
 for nearly five hours.     The following results were obtained : —
     Untreated water                                8325 centres per c.c.
     Water after 15 minutes' agitation        with
        animal charcoal                                60    „       „
     The efficiency of the animal charcoal in this respect is thus very
 markedly greater than that of chalk.
     Coke. — 1 gram of coke was shaken up with 50 c.c. of urine-water,
 and then allowed to subside for forty-eight hours, as the water did not
 clear before.     The following results were obtained : —
     Untreated water                        Too numerous to be counted.
      Water after 15 minutes' agitation
       with   coke                          No organisms whatever.
     It thus appears that simple agitation with coke for fifteen minutes
  is sufficient to entirely remove all organisms.
     China Clay. — 1 gram of this was shaken for fifteen minutes with
  50 c.c. of urine-water ; subsidence was not complete for five days. On
  examining the clear water it was found to yield a very large number
 of organisms indeed, thus showing that prolonged subsidence with

 finely divided matter like clay is not conducive to the separation of
micro-organisms.
    A similar result was obtained with brickdust, which, however, did
not take quite so long to subside.
               Effect of Subsidence     on Micro-organisms     in Water.
    As in the above agitation experiments the water for examination
was always taken from the clear upper layers, it became of interest to
know whether the micro-organisms would not, by subsidence alone,
separate out from the upper layers without the influence of solid
particles. In order to ascertain this, three sterilised Winchester bottles
were filled up to the shoulder with urine-water, and plugged with
sterilised cotton-wool.        The bottles were placed in a room (temperature
about 10° C.)      and  left at perfect rest; the number of organisms in the
urine- water was ascertained at the outset of the experiment, again at
the end of six hours the number was determined in one of the bottles,
at the end of twenty -four hours in the second bottle, and lastly, at the
end of forty-eight hours in the third bottle. The numbers found were
as follows : —
                                                    No. of centres found per
          Hours of subsidence.                            c.o. of water.

                    6                                           6,028
                   24                                           7,262

    These experiments show that far from there being any tendency for
the upper layers of water to become deprived of organisms by sub
sidence, the tendency is for the number to increase very rapidly
indeed.
            Effect of Clark's Process on Micro-organisms          in Water.
    Owing to the encouraging results obtained by agitating water with
finely divided chalk, it appeared probable that still more striking
effects would be obtained if the chalk were present in a more finely
divided state, such as is the case when water is softened by means of
lime (Clark's process).           In order to ascertain the effect of Clark's
process in this respect,      three   stoppered Winchester bottles were taken,
and to each were added 2 litres of ordinary Thames water, to which
some urine-water had been added, so as to impart a convenient num
ber of organisms.        To two of these bottles 100 c.c. of clear lime-water
 (1  c.c.   = 0'0013 gram CaO) were added, calculated                     to remove
 11-6 parts of carbonate       of  lime  per 100,000 parts   of   the water.   Each
of these bottles was violently shaken, and then allowed to subside for
eighteen hours.        The third bottle, to which no lime-water was added,

was first tested for the number of organisms contained in the water
used in the experiment.           After eighteen hours the two bottles to
which lime-water        had   been    added were tested without disturbing
the precipitate, and also the third bottle containing the untreated
water which had been left at rest in the same place as the other two.
The following results were obtained : —
    Untreated water                                      85 centres per e.c.

      subsidence                                         42    ,,       „
   In order to appreciate the real effect of the treatment by Clark's
process, it is necessary that the treated waters should be compared,
not with the original water, but with the latter after eighteen hours'
rest, for this shows what the condition of the water would have been
at the time of testing if no lime-water had been added.           It is evident
that after the subsidence of the carbonate of lime precipitate has taken
place, there is every probability of the organisms becoming again
distributed throughout the upper layers of the water, and with a
view of determining whether this actually takes place or not, the
same waters which had remained well stoppered and at rest were
again tested after the lapse of ten days. It was then found that the
untreated as well as the softened waters contained immense numbers
of organisms in their upper layers.
   As the effect of Clark's process in removing organisms from            water
appeared to be of great practical importance, the above experiments
were repeated, the conditions being essentially the same as before.
The following results were obtained : —.
         Untreated water                            37 centres per c.c.

   Owing to the number of organisms in the original water having
been   very much smaller, the results are not so pronounced as in the
former case, the main facts are, however, fully substantiated.
    It appeared also to be of interest to ascertain what results             are
obtainable on the large scale.         For this purpose the process of soften
 ing as practised at the Colne Valley Waterworks at Bushcy, near
Watford, was investigated, as well as the new modification of Clark's
process devised by Messrs. Gaillet and Hnet, which is now in opera
tion at Mr. Duncan's, Clyde Wharf, Victoria Dock.              I  am indebted

to   Mr. Verini, of the Colne         Valley Waterworks, as well as to
Mr. Duncan and Mr. Newlands,          for their kindness in permitting me
to  carry out  these experiments.
   At   the Colne Valley Waterworks, the hard water obtained from a
deep well in the chalk is mixed with the requisite proportion of clear
lime-water, and then allowed to settle in open tanks.           The subsidence
is so  rapid that under favourable        circumstances the upper layers of
water are, after three hours' time, fit for distribution.         On the occa
sion of my visit, however, boring operations were being carried on,
and the water was in consequence milky, and the necessary subsi
dence after softening had to be increased to two days.                    I was
unfortunately unable to obtain a perfectly representative sample of
the water before softening, and the number of organisms found in the
untreated water is probably in excess of that which was actually
present in the unsoftened water itself.           The following results were
obtained : —
           Unsoftened  water                       322 centres per c.c.
           Water after softening and    2  days'
             subsidence (from main)                   4     „       „
    The almost complete absence of organisms in the softened water
 shows how perfect a result is obtained even on the large scale.
    In the process of softening, due to Messrs. Gaillet and Huet as
 practised at Mr. Duncan's, the water from an artesian well is mixed
 with a suitable proportion of lime-water and caustic soda, the mixture
 being then made to pass upwards through a tower provided with
 diaphragms, which accelerate the precipitation of the carbonate of
 lime.    The passage through this tower occupies a period of about two
 hours.    Samples of water before and after treatment were examined
 with the following results : —
               Well water                      182 centres per c.c.
                                    (38 caused    liquefaction of gelatine.)

                                               tion of gelatine.)
    These experiments, as well as      those made in the laboratory, show
 that the softening of water by         Clark's process is attended with a
 great reduction in the number         of organisms, the best results being
 obtained when the clear liquid         is separated from the precipitated
 carbonate of lime as speedily as possible.

 known, and due precautions in collecting samples have been taken,
there can be no doubt        that in many cases it is capable of throwing
considerable light upon the quality of water and in assisting to
interpret the results of chemical analysis.
    The method of collecting samples which has been employed by me
is the following : —
    Small (about 3 oz.) bottles, accurately stoppered, and sterilised by
being heated to 150° C. for at least three hours, are kept tightly
stoppered until they are to be used.              In taking the sample, the out
side of the bottle is well washed in a stream of the water to be
examined, the stopper is then removed, the bottle nearly filled with
water, and the stopper replaced as rapidly as possible.                The examina
tion of the water should follow as soon as possible after collection.
    The following results were obtained with samples taken as above
from the mains of the various companies supplying London : —

analysis,   so  that   their  biological and chemical characters might be
compared ; the results are given below.
    General Conclusions. — (1.) Of the substances experimented with,
only greensand, coke, animal charcoal, and spongy iron were found to
wholly remove the micro-organisms                  from water filtering through
them, and     this power was in every case lost after the filters had been
in operation for one month.          With the exception of the animal char
coal, however, all these substances, even after being in action for one
month, continued to remove a very considerable proportion of the
organisms present in the unfiltered water, and in this respect spongy
 iron and coke occupy the first place.

    (2.) The results obtained by agitating water with various solid
materials   show that a very great reduction in the number of sus
pended organisms may be accomplished by this mode of treatment,
and the complete removal of all organisms by agitation with coke is
especially worthy of notice.
    (3.) Again, the results obtained with Clark's process show that
we possess in this simple and useful mode of treating water a means
of greatly reducing the number of suspended organisms.
   (4.) Thus, although the production in large quantity of sterilised
potable water is a matter of great difficulty, involving the continual
renewal of filtering materials, there are numerous methods of treat
ment which secure a large reduction in the number of organisms
present.
   Moreover, in judging of the value of filtering materials from exami
nations of this kind, it is only reasonable that a preference should
be given to those materials with which a practically pure cultivation
is obtained in the filtrate over those materials which appear to exercise
no selective action upon micro-organisms.
    In conclusion,  I  would point out that it is very desirable that
experiments of this kind should be greatly multiplied and repeated
under varying conditions,       and  it is my intention to continue and
extend this examination.
III. "A    Memoir introductory to a General Theory of Mathe
       matical Form." By A. B. Kempe, M.A., F.R.S. Received
       May   18, 1885.
                                 (Abstract.)
   The memoir is divided into 426 short sections which are arranged
under 42 heads.      Each head is given in the abstract, with a brief
reference   to the nature   of the sections it comprises, except in the
case of the second head, viz.,
                                  " Fundamental
                                                 Principles," the sections
under which are given almost in full.
                       §§ 1 — 2. Scope  of the Memoir.
    The object of the memoir is the treatment of the " necessary
         "
matter of exact or mathematical thought as a connected whole ; the
separation of its essential elements from the accidental clothing —
algebraical, geometrical, logical, &c. — in which they are usually pre
sented for consideration ; and the indication of that to which the
infinite variety which those elements exhibit is due.
    The memoir is introductory only, comprising the statement of
 fundamental principles, and the vindication of their truth by a suffi
 cient variety of applications.                           .  .

 394                          Mr. A. B. Kempe.                       [June 18,
                     §§  3 — 13. Fundamental      Principles.
     (3.) Whatever may be the true nature of things and of the con
 ceptions which we have of them (as to which points we are not
 concerned in the memoir to inquire), in the operations of reasoning
 they are dealt with as a number of distinct entities or units.
     (4.) These units   come  under consideration in      a variety of guises —
 as points, lines, statements, relationships, arrangements, intervals or
 periods of time, algebraical expressions, &c, &c. — occupy various
 positions, and are otherwise variously circumstanced.              Thus while
 some units are undistinguished from each other, others are by these
 peculiarities rendered distinguishable.          For example, the angular
 points of a square are distinguishable from the sides, but are not dis
 tinguishable from each other.        In some instances where distinctions
 exist they are ignored as not material.         Both cases are included in
the general statement       that  some   units  are  distinguished from each
other and some are not.
    (5.) In like manner some pairs of units are distinguished from
each other while others are not.          Pairs may be distinguished even
though the units composing them are not. Thus the angular points
of a square are uudistiuguishable from each other, and a pair of such
points lying at the extremities of a side are und istinguishable from
the three other like pairs, but are distinguishable from the two pairs
formed by taking angular points at the extremities of a diagonal,
which pairs again are undistinguishable from each other. Further, a
pair, ab, may sometimes be distinguished from a pair, ba, though
the units a and b are undistinguished. Thus if a, b, c, be the angular
points of an equilateral triangle, and barbs be drawn on the sides
pointing from a to 6, from b to c, and from c to a respectively, the
lingular points a, b, c will be undistinguished from each other, each
has an arrow proceeding from it and to it ; but the pair ab is dis
tinguished from the pair ba, for an arrow proceeds from a to 6, but
none from b to a.
    (6.) It will be convenient to speak of ab and ba as different aspects of
the collection of two units, a, b. Here the terms " aspect " and
" collection " are each to be understood as
                                                   referring to two separate
units, and not to those units regarded in the aggregate as a single
unit.
    (7.) Again we have also distinguished and undistinguished triads,
tetrads,   ....   m-ads   ....  n-ads . . . .; every m-ad being, of course,
distinguished from every n-ad. Just as we may have ab distinguished
from ba, so we may have an n-ad pqrst .            ...  up distinguished from
qnsvt    ....   rp.   Here pqrst    ....   uv and qusvt . . . . rp will be
termed, as in the case of pairs, different aspects of the collection
p, q, r, s, t, ....  u, v ; the term
                                         " collection " being understood to

refer to a number of separate units without reference to the various
"         "
  aspects   of the collection.  Different aspects of the same collection
of n units will be spoken of as different n-ads.
   (9.) Every collection of units has a definite form, due — (1) to the
number of its component units, and (2) to the way in which the
distinguished and undistinguished units, pairs, triads, &c, are dis
tributed through the collection.   Two collections of the same number
of units, but having different distributions will be of different forms.
The angular points of a cube and of an octagon furnish examples of
two systems of eight units, having different distributions.       In the
former case there are three sorts of pairs, in the latter four.
   (10.) Two collections which are undistinguished will be of the
same form, but two collections which are of the same form are not
necessarily    undistinguished.
  (11.) Each of the forms which a system of n units can assume
owing to varieties of distribution is one of a definite number of
possible forms, and the peculiarities and properties of the collection
depend, as far as the processes of reasoning are concerned, upon
the particular form it assumes, and are independent of the dress —
geometrical,         algebraical, &c. — in which it is presented ; so
                   logical,
that two systems which are of the same form have precisely the same
properties, although the garbs in which they are severally clothed
may by their dissimilarity lead us to place the systems under very
different categories, and even to regard them as belonging to " diffe
rent branches of science."
   (12.) It may seem in some cases that other considerations are
involved besides " form," but it will be found on investigation that
the introduction of such considerations involves also the introduction
of fresh units, and then we have merely to consider the form of the
enlarged collection.
                                               " accidental "
   (13.) In order to put form in evidence some                clothing
is of course necessary;           if,
                           however, we employ more than one species
of clothing, each species being uniform and suited to forms of every
kind, the disturbing effect will be reduced to a minimum.
                                        §§   14-17. Units.
   The variety of the units which may be dealt with in an investiga
tion is here indicated   e.g., we may have

                        §§ 18 24. Some Definitions.
   A collection of units selected from a larger collection is       termed   a
component of the latter.
   A collection of units containing some units selected from        each of   a
number of other collections is said to connect the latter.
   There are other definitions which need not be referred to.
                                   —
                             §§ 25 36. Systems.
   A collection of units which is such that every component unit is
distinguished from every unit which is not a component is termed a
system.   A single system is one in which all units are undistinguished.
We have also double, treble, Sfc., systems.           The sections contain
general observations about systems.
                —
          §§ 37 49. Heaps — Graphical Representation of Units.
   We may graphically represent units by small circles of different
colours, spots, &c. These are termed graphical units.
   A large class of systems called heaps may be represented by         means
of these alone, without further graphical adjuncts.
   A single heap is one which is graphically represented by graphical
units all undistinguished from each other.
   A discrete heap is one which is graphically represented by graphical
units which are all distinguished from each other.
   There are intermediate forms called double, treble, 8fc, heaps.
               §§ 50 — 72.   Pairs — Graphical Representation.
   The three different     forms which pairs can assume are considered,
VMS. :—
   (1.)  The two units a, b, maybe distinguished from each other.
   (2.) The two nnits may be undistinguished but unsymmetrical,            i.e.,
ab distinguished   from ba.
   (3.) The two units may       be  undistinguished and symmetrical,      i.e.,
ab undistinguished    from ba.
   Certain modes are discussed of distinguishing pairs of graphical
units, so as to make a graphical diagram represent a system the form
of which depends upon pairs being distinguished.           These involve the
use of plain lines, or
                         " links,"                 of graphical units ; also,
                                   joining pairs
where necessary, lines of various sorts, coloured, wavy, dotted, Ac. ;
and, where unsymmetrical         pairs have to be represented,    the  use    of
barbs on the lines.
                              §§ 73—83.   Aspects.
   These sections are devoted to a consideration       of the real nature of
aspects of collections    of units, and of the units which are dealt with

 when two undistinguished aspects are regarded as corresponding unit
 to unit.   The possibility of representing any conceivable system by a
 diagram consisting of graphical units and plain lines, or links, only is
 shown.
                        —
                §§ 84 86. Letters, their Sorts and Positions.
    In arrays or other assemblages of letters each letter is of a parti
 cular sort, and occupies a position which is of a particular sort. The
 nature of the collections of units here dealt with is discussed, and
 they are shown to be the same as those considered in the case of
 aspects of systems in general.

    §§ 87 88. Representation of Aspects of Collections          by Arrays of
                                      Letters.
    Hence the propriety of doing that which is indicated by the heading
of these sections.
                        —
                §§ 89 99. Elementary Properties of Aspects.
   A variety of propositions about aspects are here given, which are
needed in subsequent parts of the memoir.                  Perhaps the most
important is the following:      —
   "  If abed  ....   is undistinguished from pars . . . . , and if I, m, n, o
....   be units other than a, b, c, d, . . . , there must be units w, x, y, z,
....    other than p, q, r, s           such that abed     ....  Vmno   ....  is
undistinguished     from  pqrs  ....   wxyz   . . .  .
                                                       "
   It is pointed out that if any aspect of a whole system S be given,
and all other aspects of S which are undistinguished from the given
aspect, the form of S is completely determined.
             §§  100 — 111.   Tabular Representation of Systems.
   Hence we get a simple and uniform method of representing any
system, viz., that of arranging the arrays of letters representing the
undistinguished aspects one above another in rows, so that letters
             "                       "
occupying the same position in the different rows all lie in the
same column.       In the resulting table the order of the rows or columns
is immaterial.     Various points about these tables are considered. A
table representing a single heap of n units will have | n rows ; and
one representing a discrete heap of n units will have one row only.
In the case of any other form of a system of n units the number of
rows   will be intermediate    between   1  and    | n.
       §§ 112— 129.     Correspondences    of Undistinguished Collections.
   These sections go somewhat fully into the correspondences of undis
tinguished collections indicated by the tabular representation of a
system.     The nature of the correspondences where two component

 systems of a double system are independent, is considered                 ;    and the
 relation of the systems, which are such that one is derived                  from the
 other by ignoring differences, is discussed.
                                   §§ 130—136. Sets.
     Sets are collections of units akin to systems (which are always sets),
 but may differ from them in each being one only of a number of
 undistinguished sets.
            §§ 137 — 142. Aspects Unique with         respect to Collections.
     If the aspects xyz      ....   abc  ....  and uvw    .... abc .... are undis
  tinguished from each other, the aspects xyz              ....  and uvw   .... may
 be said to be duplicates with respect to the collection a, b, c             . . . .    If
 there is no duplicate of xyz           ....  with respect to a, b, c               then
 xyz   ....   may    be said  to  be unique   with respect to a, b, c,  ...    .
                               §§  143 — 151.  Associates.
     (16.) If a, b, c    ....   be any collection of units, and if X be another
 unit, such that the pairs \a, \b, Xc, . . . . are distinguished from the
 pairs which X makes with units which are not components of the
 collection, then X may be said to be an associate of the collection
 a, b, o  . . . .
    Many of our conceptions and definitions of systems of units                  involve
 the idea of associates.                                     .
                             §§ 152—161. Unified Aspects.
     These are the units arrived at by regarding the aspects of collec
 tions as single units.        They are associates of the collections of which
 they are unified aspects, and are unique with respect to them.
 §§   162 — 169.     Correspondences      of Collections which    are distinguished
                                   but of like Forms.
    The nature of these correspondences, and the relations which                     they
bear, when regarded as units, to the units of the collections are                    con
sidered.
                                 §§ 170—173. Replicas.
     Two systems are replicas of each other when they are of the same
 form and bear precisely similar relations to all other collections of
units.
                  §§  174 — 188.   Independent and Related Systems.
    The conditions which must be satisfied in order that systems                     may
not be independent are here investigated, and systems which                           are
factors of others are defined and discussed.

networks they compose.
                              §§ 211—221. Chains.
   A simple chain is a succession of undistinguished pairs, ah, be, cd,
de . . . .  It may be open, i.e., having terminal units, or closed. We
may also have compound chains containing distinguished pairs.             The
formation of equations by considering coterminous chains is shown.

   In a group each unit is unique with respect to each of the others.

                              §§ 280—312. Algebras.
    The genesis of algebras is here treated of. We have three systems,
 replicas of each other, of which the units are respectively multipliers,
 multiplicands, and products.           We have also a system the units of
 which are primitive      equations,  such as
                                         ab = c,
 arrived at by regarding as units the triads of which one unit is a
 multiplier, one a multiplicand, and one a product.             We have another
 system,   of  which  the  units  are primitive algebras,  arrived   at by regard
 ing as units certain collections of primitive equations.             The deriva
 tion of compound algebras is considered, and the way in which
 algebras arise from special systems.

    Quadrates are units of a special form of system which may be
 represented by n asterisks and n* — n dots arranged in n rows and n
 columns, there being n— 1 dots and one asterisk in each row and each
 column, and the order of the rows and columns being immaterial.
 Systems of this form give rise to every species of linear associative
 algebra. Quadrates are considered by Professor Pierce in his annota
 tions of his father's memoir on
                                         " Linear Associative Algebras."

 of isolated collections, i.e., collections which are such that each com
 ponent unit is unique with respect to the rest of the collection.

may therefore graphically represent such a system by using two sorts
of graphical units, a pair of which, one of each sort, are either con
nected by a link or not, according as the point represented by one
lies on the line represented by the other or not.       The laws regulating
the distribution of the links are stated, and the various forms which
collections of three and four points and collections of three lines can

 IV. "On the Influence of Temperature on the Heat of Dissolu
       tion of Salts in Water." By William A. Tilden, D Sc.
       Lond, F.R.S , Professor of Chemistry in the Mason College,
       Birmingham.        Received May      18, 1885.
    The experiments described in this paper were undertaken in the
 hope of obtaining some light upon the vexed question of the condition
 in which a solid exists when dissolved in a liquid, and were directed
  more especially towards the investigation of the well-known remark
  able phenomena exhibited by sodium sulphate.

402          Dr. W. A. Tilden.          Influence, of   Temperature       [June   18.
    Crystallised sodium sulphate melts at about 34°, and at this tem
perature the salt begins to show signs of dissociation by depositing
the anhydrous compound.             According to Wiedemann,* indeed, indi
cations of change are observable at a few degrees lower. He finds
by observation of the volume of the crystallised salt at different tem
peratures, that whereas slight expansion occurs from 17° to about 30°,
contraction then sets in, at first slowly, then, at 33° to 34°, very rapidly,
till the salt melts. The melted salt expands regularly in proportion
as the temperature        is raised to near 100°.        Nicolf has   made experi
ments upon the expansion of solutions of the same                   salt, and with
similar results.
    The solubility of sodium sulphate increases rapidly from ordinary
temperatures up to 34°, when it attains a maximum.                From this point
upwards the solubility again diminishes very rapidly to between 40°
and 50°, and then less rapidly, till at 100° to 160° it becomes nearly
stationary.      At temperatures higher than 160° the solubility slowly
increases again.J
    In 1874 it was observed by De Coppet§ that heat is developed by
contact of water with anhydrous sodium sulphate at temperatures
considerably above 34°, at which point the ordinary hydrate is broken
up.      This circumstance was attributed by Thomsen to the formation
of a monohydrate, NajSO^.HjO, and he ascribed this composition to
the crystals which are deposited on heating a concentrated solution of
sodium sulphate, and which had always been believed to be anhy
drous. Thomsen 's assumption has, however, been shown to be ground
less, || and therefore the fact noticed by De Coppet remains without
adequate explanation.
    Below the temperature of 34° it seems probable that the sodium
sulphate dissolved in water is in the state of hydrate, NajSO^lOHjO.
In what condition is it at temperatures higher than 34° ? In other
words, does the solution contain the usual hydrate or the anhydrous
salt, or both ?
    This is the question which         I  have endeavoured to attack by com
paring the thermal changes attending the act of solution of the anhy
drous salt in water at temperatures above this critical             point with    the
corresponding        change at temperatures below.            Some   interesting re
sults have     been   obtained,   but they   do not supply final

question.      My few earlier experiments, communicated             in a short  note
to the British Association at Montreal, gave erroneous               results, partly

  because  I  was then unaware of the existence of the allotropic modifica
  tions of anhydrous sulphate of sodium since discovered by Mr. Picker
 ing (loc. cit.), and partly from errors of experiments, which have sinco
 been corrected.
     The apparatus    I have used consists of two parts, the calorimeter
 and the constant temperature bath.          The calorimeter is a brass drum
 9 cm.   high and 7 cm. diameter, having a paddle which works in a
 socket in the centre of the vessel, and the spindle of which passes
 through the lid. At the top of the spindle is a reel, round which
 passes a silk cord, the ends of which are weighted and drawn over
 pulleys placed at a little distance on opposite sides. By gently pulling
 the cord at either end the paddle is made to spin round.        Immediately
 above the blades of the paddle is a wide brass tube perforated with
 holes, and the bottom of which is immersed in the water, which is
 placed in the calorimeter.       In this tube is placed a thin glass bulb
 containing the weighed quantity of salt and sealed at the blowpipe.
 Standing in the tube is a thin brass rod having a fork at the end to
 act as pulveriser, the top which projects through the lid of the calori
 meter, being provided with a wooden handle. The thermometer stands
in a perforated tube on the opposite side of the calorimeter.            The
 cover of the calorimeter is provided with three holes, one for the stem
 of the thermometer, one in the centre for the paddle, and the third for
the handle of the pulveriser.        The vessel is supported on three sharp
boxwood points within a covered brass case silvered inside, the space
between the calorimeter and the case being about 1 cm. all round.
    The bath employed for maintaining a constant temperature is
practically identical with that described by Nicol,* but is provided
with a well in the middle, into which fits closely the outer case of the
calorimeter.      The temperature of the water or oil is remarkably con
stant, and when the temperature does not exceed 30° a thermometer
in different parts of the bath does not vary by more than '05°. To assist
in maintaining this constancy the bath is covered closely, and ia
enveloped in thick felt.      Three thermometers were used — A, from 8°
to 26°   C,  divided into twentieths ; B, from 25° to 50°, and C, from
42° to 76°, both divided into tenths Centigrade, and the temperature
could easily be read to '005° and -01° respectively, or even half this.
    The course of an experiment is as follows : — The water having been
introduced into the calorimeter, and the thermometer inserted into its
tube, the whole is placed in an oven until the thermometer indicates a
temperature about half a degree above that to which the bath has been
previously heated.      The calorimeter is then put into the bath, the
cover of the case is put on, and the thermometer read from time to
time till the temperature is either quite stationary or is falling steadily
at a rate which is recorded, and from which a correction can be intro-

daced into the observed result.       The glass bulb is then broken, and
the paddle gently worked by one person whilst another reads the
thermometer by the telescope.          In every case a definite interval
(usually one or two minutes) is allowed to elapse before the final
reading is taken, not only to allow time for solution, but for the
alteration   of temperature in the liquid to be imparted to the calori
meter.     In  those cases in which the calorimeter had been in the
bath for some time at a rather high temperature, and there was
reason to fear that slight loss had occurred by evaporation, the
whole was weighed after the experiment was concluded, and a cor
rection introduced accordingly. The amount thus lost never exceeded
a gram or thereabouts, and as the thermal equivalent of the calori
meter and its contents amounted to 100 grams and upwards, the
result is not appreciably  affected.
   In the accompanying      tables the numbers contained in the column
headed " Water equivalent of the calorimeter," include the values of
the calorimeter, the glass bulb, the thermometer, and the solution, the
specific heat of which is taken generally from Thomsen's numbers.
   Three series of experiments       were   undertaken  with sulphate of
sodium, and the results are embodied in the three tables, A, B, and C.
   For A the salt had been heated to redness, not to fusion, about a
fortnight before.
   For B the salt had been heated to redness one day before.
   For C the precipitated salt had been dried at 120°.
   These varieties were taken on account of the differences in the heat
of dissolution of sulphate of sodium which have been observed by
Mr. Pickering (Inc. cit.).

   From these figures it appears that although the manner in which
the salt has been prepared influences the result very notably, yet in
each series, comparing together the effects of dissolving the same
kind of anhydrous sodium sulphate, the heat of dissolution increases
progressively with rise of temperature.  That this would be the case
might be predicted by applying the principle originally indicated by
Person,* and since discussed by Berthelott and by Thomsen,J and
embodied    in the general equation QT=Q/-|-U— V, where QT and
Qi  are the  quantities of heat evolved in the act of solution at the
temperatures T° and       and U represents the sum of the capacities
                                    t",
for heat of the salt and the water, and V represents the capacity                              of
the solution between the temperatures T° and t°.
   The salt    must be regarded as being in the most stable condition

  The carbonate         of sodium used in these experiments had been
heated to redness, but at times which varied from a few hours to
several days before the experiment.           Some of the irregularities in the
numbers may be not improbably due to this circumstance.                    But the
mean results show on the whole an increase in the heat of dissolution
with rise of temperature.

    In the solution of anhydrous carbonate and sulphate of sodium in
 water, evolution of heat occurs, and the amount of heat evolved in
creases with the temperature, but is not so great as would be inferred
from the application of Person's             formula.      On the other hand,
sulphate    of  potassium,    the solution  of  which   is attended by absorp
tion of heat, gives a gradually diminishing absorption as the tempera
ture is raised, but the observed absorption is greater at the higher
temperature than the calculated amount.              That is to say, in all these
cases, whether the act of solution is attended by rise or fall of tem
perature, there is a consumption            of energy corresponding          to an
absorption of heat, which is not accounted for by the difference
between the specific heats of the materials, and of the solution which
results from their union.
   From the connexion already established between fusibility and
solubility,* and from a priori considerations, it seemed probable that
the thermal change attending the solution of a solid must vary
according as by raising the temperature the cohesion of the solid is
diminished, or by lowering the temperature the cohesion is increased.
For if a salt dissolves in water with absorption of heat, this absorp
tion will be less at higher temperatures when the cohesion of the
solid has been reduced, and therefore the energy required for its
liquefaction by the solvent also lessened. On the other hand, if a salt
dissolves with evolution of heat, the heat evolved must be greater at
higher temperatures for the same reason.
   Some very fusible salts were therefore taken in order to ascertain
whether the difference between the observed and calculated heats of
solution was notably greater or less than the difference observed in
the case    of the sodium carbonate and sulphate and potassium sul
phates.

412          Dr.   VV. A. Tilden.       Influence   of   Temperature       [June    18,
    Experiments published in         1873   by Winkelmann,* on the solution of
the potassium, sodium, and ammonium chlorides and nitrates in water
at different temperatures lead to similar conclusions.                   Thus taking
Winkelmann's figure representing the heat of dissolution of nitrate
of sodium, 1 gram of salt in 20 80 grams of water, which is very
nearly 1 mol. of salt to 100 mols. of water —
                     At 2 — 3° gives      as a mean —60 30 cal.
                     At 50— 51° „            „    „     -4870 „
    For a molecule of salt, or       85 grams   —
                                  60-3x85=5125-5
                                  487 x 85=4139-5.
    By the formula —
                    Qr=Q( + [(18n+C)-(18n+K)](T-i),
and using the values already given for sodium nitrate,
                                    QT= -3646-6,
and this is very nearly identical with the number calculated from                   my
own experiment at 16".
    I have made a few determinations of heat of solution of the crystal
lised sulphate and carbonate of sodium.                Whilst these salts dissolve
at common temperatures, with great absorption of heat, the absorp
tion at the melting point is very feeble, and at a few degrees higher
is changed into evolution of heat. This last-named effect is probably
due to the fact that when heated beyond their melting point, 34°
(circa), these salts are partly deposited in a solid dehydrated state.
   * " Fogg. Annalen," cxlix, 1. Winkelmann s experiments were directed towards
the object of determining the specific heat of the solutions of these six salts. One
difficulty in the way of the general application of this method is the uncertainty
attaching to the specific heats of the salts in the solid state, by reason of the varia
bility of their properties according to the manner in which they have been prepared.

   The very rapid decline in the heat absorption attending the solu

be  distinguished from the intermixture of the liquefied solid with the
water.     Both these acts must be attended by heat-absorption.               The
dilution of watery solutions has been shown, especially by the
researches of Thomsen,        to be attended very generally by absorption
of heat, notwithstanding that in most cases it is accompanied by con
traction of volume, a process which must have an opposite effect.
   In the solution of many anhydrous and even hydrated salts, we
must believe, from the very energetic thermal change observed, that
the salt enters into chemical union with a portion of the liquid.             The
extent to which this combination occurs will be greatly influenced by
the temperature at which the experiment is made, and at sufficiently
elevated temperatures it must be believed to be entirely annulled,
whilst on the other hand, as the temperature is raised, chemical
action, resulting in double decomposition between the water and con
stituents of the salt, becomes apparent.          This action, which is mani
fested  in  the case  of the   salts  of  the heavy metals by the production
of insoluble oxides, hydroxides, or basic salts, cannot be supposed to
be altogether without effect in the case of the salts of the alkali
metals such as I have been examining, and             I  incline strongly to the
belief that a part of the difference which         I have pointed out between
the observed heat of solution and the same calculated according to
Person's formula, is due to this decomposing action of the water.
   It is manifest that no theory of solution can be accepted which does
not take cognisance of all these facts.
   In conclusion,    I desire   to acknowledge the intelligent assistance I
have received in the conduct of these experiments from Mr. Harold
P. White.

   In  the concluding sentence of the Bakerian Lecture which            I had the
honour to deliver before the Royal Society, May 31st, 1883,           I said that
the new method of Radiant Matter Spectroscopy there described had
not only given me spectrum indications of the presence of yttrium as
an almost invariable, though very minute, constituent of a large
number of minerals, but had likewise revealed signs of another
spectrum-yielding element.            I  stated that   I  had repeatedly     seen
indications of another very beautiful spectrum characterised                by a
strong red and a double orange band.

             Elimination of Mercury Vapour from Vacuum Tubes.
    It is much more difficult than is generally supposed to keep mercury
vapour from diffusing into the experimental tubes.
    The following plan answers perfectly so far as my experiments have
yet gone : — Sulphur is first prepared by keeping it fused at a high
temperature till bubbles cease to come off, so as to get rid of water
and hydrogen compounds.            It is then allowed to cool, and is pounded
and sifted      so  as  to  get  it  in the form of granules averaging a
millimetre in diameter.        A glass tube, a centimetre in diameter and
about 2 feet long, is lightly packed for half its length with this
sulphur, and next about 2 inches of iodide of sulphur (I,S2) is added,
and the rest of the tube is then filled up with sulphur.               Ignited
asbestos    is  packed  in at  each   end  to keep the sulphur from blowing
out whilst the vacuum is being made, or from being sucked through
when air is suddenly let in. This contrivance entirely keeps mercury
vapour from passing through, since the iodide of sulphur holds its
iodine very loosely, and fixes the mercury in the form of non-volatile
red iodide.       A glass tube containing finely divided copper must
follow in order to keep sulphur out. With this blockade interposed
between     the pump and experimental tubes            I have been unable to
detect mercury vapour in any of the tubes, whether in the cold or on
heating them.

    Since the date of my last paper I have devoted myself to the task
of solving the problem presented by the double orange band first
observed in 1881.        With the yttrium experience as a guide it might
be thought that this would not be a difficult task, but in truth it
helped me little beyond increasing my confidence that the new, like
the old, spectrum was characteristic of an element. The extreme
sensitiveness of the test is a drawback rather than a help.             To the

absolutely unknown, the difficulties of the problem become enormously
enhanced.     Insolubility as ordinarily understood is a fiction, and
separation by precipitants is nearly impossible.          A new chemistry has
to be slowly built up, taking for data uncertain and deceptive
indications, marred by the interfering power of mass in withdrawing
soluble salts from a solution, and by the solubility of nearly all
precipitates in water or in ammoniacal salts, when present in traces
                                      "        " will be better understood if
only. What is here meant by traces
I  give an instance.       After six months' work        I  obtained the earth
didymiain    a state which most chemists would call absolutely pure, for it
contained probably not more than one part of impurity in five hundred
thousand     parts of didymia. But this one part in half a million
profoundly altered the character of didymia from a radiant-matter-
spectroscopic point of view, and the persistence of this very minute
quantity of interfering impurity entailed another six months' extra
labour to eliminate these final "traces" and to ascertain the real
reaction of didymia pure and simple.
             Chemistry of the Orange Band-forming Substance.
    At first it was necessary to take stock, as it were, of all the facts
regarding the supposed new substance, provisionally termed x, which
 had turned up during the search for the orange band.                In the first
 place x is almost as widely distributed as yttria, frequently occurring
with the latter earth. It is almost certainly one of the earthy metals,
as   it occurs in the insoluble oxalates, in            the insoluble double
sulphates, and    in  the precipitate with ammonia.       It is not precipitated
by sodic thiosulphate, and moreover it must be present in very minute
quantities, since the ammonia precipitate is always extremely small,
and as a rule x is not found in the filtrate from this precipitate.
    At this stage of the inquiry the chemical reactions of x were much
more puzzling than with yttria.          At the outset an anomaly presented
itself.   The orange band was prone to vanish in a puzzling manner.
Frequently an accumulation of precipitates tolerably rich in x was
worked up for purposes of concentration, when the spectrum reaction
suddenly disappeared, showing itself neither in precipitate or filtrate ;
whilst on other occasions, when following apparently the same
procedure, the orange band became intensified and concentrated with
no apparent loss. The behaviour of the sulphate to water was also
very contradictory ; on some occasions it appeared to be almost
insoluble, whilst occasionally      it dissolved in water readily.
                               Is " x "   a Mixture ?
   A very   large series of experiments,        which need not here       be de
scribed   in detail, resulted ultimately in establishing the         remarkable
fact that the x      I  sought was an earth which of itself could give         no

phosphorescent spectrum in the radiant matter tube, but became im
mediately endowed with this property by admixture with some other
substance, which substance likewise by itself had no power of phos
phorescing with a discontinuous spectrum.

                                                  I
   In the corresponding yttrium research was aided materially by
the fact that the sought-for earth did not give an absorption spectrum.
This enabled me to throw out a large number of obscurely known
elements, and     I therefore early endeavoured to ascertain whether the
supposed new earth, x, did or did not give an absorption spectrum.
Gradually it was noticed that whenever the didymium absorption
bands were strong the orange band spectrum was also particularly
brilliant.     Moreover, amongst the earths previously enumerated as
mixed with lime in the quest for x,         I have mentioned that some of
them gave the orange band spectrum with increased intensity ; the
earths   of the cerium     group   were the most noteworthy,      and these
considerations     made   it probable    that here would be      found the
location of x.

   The cerium      group consists of cerium, lanthanum, didymium, and
samarium.
   The first necessity was to get the earths ceria, lanthana, and the
mixture hitherto called didymia, in a pure state, for my so-called
pure earths of this group all showed the orange band in more or less
degree.
   The separation from each other of ceria, lanthana, didymia, and
samaria is a most laborious process, and the amounts of these earths,
obtainable in anything like a pure state, is small, compared with the
mass   of material worked up.      Full particulars are given in the paper
as to  the method adopted to obtain each of them in a state of purity.

   The eerie oxide obtained was almost pure white.           A considerable
thickness of a strong solution did not show a trace of absorption
 spectrum. The atomic weight of the metal was taken and yielded
the number 141-1.
   The    eerie  oxide  gave   no orange band spectrum in the radiant

 lanthana   appeared pure, it gave in the radiant matter tube a good

thana was snow-white, and had an atomic weight of 138-3.

   The earth formerly called didymia      now known to be mixture
                                             is                         a           of
didymia  and  samaria,  and systematic operations were now commenced
with the object of obtaining the didymia and the samaria in a state                 of
purity — that is to say, in such    condition that one of them should
                                     a
show no orange band spectrum at all, whilst the other should give
the spectrum in its highest degree of intensity.
I   commenced the purification of didymia in the latter part of the
year 1883, and the operations have been going on since almost daily
in my laboratory.     At intervals of some weeks the didymia in the
then stage of purification was tested in the radiant matter tube, little      a
lime having previously been added to bring out the discontinuous
phosphorescence.     During the first month or two the intensity     the       of
orange band spectrum scarcely diminished.    After this  began to fade,
                                                                  it

   The foregoing experiments left little doubt that x, the orange-band-

this earth in a pure state. The general plan of operations was the
same as  I  adopted in getting didymium free from samarium, only
attention was now directed to the portions richest in samarium which
had been formerly set aside.    The colour of samaria, as pure as                   I
have been able to prepare       white with the faintest possible tinge
                              it,   is
of yellow. The absorption spectrum of samarium salts         much more is
feeble than the spectrum of didymium.

 out, the spectrum is seen to consist of three bright bands, — red, orange,
 and green, — nearly equidistant, the orange being the brightest. With a
narrower slit the orange and green bands are seen to be double, and on
closer examination faint wings are seen, like shadows to the orange
and green bands.
    Preliminary experiments had shown me that lime was one of the
best materials to mix with samaria in order to bring out its phosphor
escent spectrum, but it was by no means the only body which would
have the desired effect.
    The samarium spectra, modified by other metals, may         be divided
into three groups.     The  first group comprises the spectra given when
glucinum, magnesium, zinc, cadmium, lanthanum, bismuth, or anti
mony is mixed with the samarium.             It consists simply of three
coloured bands, red, orange, and green ; as a typical illustration I will
select the lanthanum-samarium        spectrum (fig. 1).
                                     Fig. 1.
    The second type of spectrum gives a single red and orange and a
double green band. This is produced when barium, strontium, tho
rium, or lead, is mixed with samarium. The lead-samarium spectrum
(fig. 2) illustrates this type.

    The third kind of spectrum is given by calcium mixed with sama
rium. Here the red and green are single, and the orange double.
Aluminium would also fall into this class were it not that the broad
ill-defined green band is also doubled. The calcium-samarium spec
trum (fig. 3) is a good illustration of this type.

                Mixed Samarium and Yttrium Spectra.
   It  was interesting to ascertain what spectrum a mixture of
samarium and yttrium would give. A mixture of 90 parts of samaria
to 10 of yttria was treated with sulphuric acid and then ignited, and
afterwards examined in the radiant matter tube.     The result was as
remarkable as  it   was unexpected.  Not a trace of the yttrium spec
trum could be detected. The powder phosphoresced with moderate
intensity, but the spectrum was almost the facsimile of that given
                                                                                         in by

sufficiently in intensity to be measurable, and was found to lie at
2693, on the    scale.   A large   number of experiments were next                    tried
on mixtures of samaria and yttria in different                   proportions,    and the

only indication of the samarium spectrum that could now be fonnd

and the new orange line, which shone out as brightly and sharply as
ever.

    It will be remarked that a sudden change of spectrum occurs
between very narrow limits of mixture.
    The spectrum of a mixture of 44 parts samaria and 56 parts yttria,
except for the orange line, is the pure samarium spectrum.             The
spectrum of 42 samaria and 58 yttria is built up of some of the com
ponent bands of the spectrum of each earth ; whilst the spectrum of
39 samaria and 61 yttria is almost a pure yttria spectrum, the sharp
orange line running across them all.
              The Delicacy of the Spectrum Test for Samarium.
    Experiments were now commenced with the object of getting some
approach to a quantitative estimate of how small a quantity of
samarium could be detected.
    A mixture was first made in the proportion of one part samarium
to 100 parts of calcium.        The spectrum is very brilliant, and but
little inferior in sharpness to the spectrum given by a 50 per cent.
mixture.
    A mixture was now prepared containing 1 part of samarium to
1000 parts of calcium.      Very little difference can be detected between
the spectrum of this mixture and that of the last. The bands are,
however, a little less sharp.
    A mixture containing one part of samarium to 10,000 parts of
calcium was now tested. The bands are now getting fainter, the
second green band is fading out, and the continuous spectrum of
calcic sulphate is getting brighter.
   The next mixture tried contained one part of samarium in 100,000
parts of calcium. Here the green is almost gone, being overshadowed
by the continuous spectrum of calcium which has spread over it.
The red band has likewise almost disappeared in the greater bright
ness of the continuous red of the calcic spectrum.             The double
orange band is still very prominent, and the black space, 2942,
between    it and the green is very marked.
   The   next   mixture,   one  part of samarium to 500,000 parts of
calcium, gives a spectrum which is fainter than the last, but the
orange bands are still distinctly visible.       The blank space between
the yellow and green is strongly marked, but narrower than before.
   A mixture of one part of samarium in 1,000,000 parts of calcium
was next subjected to experiment.        In this the samarium spectrum is
very feeble, and the orange bands are only to be seen with difficulty.
Now the most striking characteristic of this spectrum is the black
space which still cuts out the greater portion of the yellow.
   A mixture of one of samarium in 2,500,000 parts of calcium was
now taken. In the spectrum shown by this mixture the bands of
samarium have entirely gone, and its presence now is apparent only

 by the darkening in the yellow portion of what otherwise         would    be a
 continuous spectrum.
     The calcium phosphorescent spectrum by itself is continuous,          with

  no break, lines, or bands in it.
                       The Anomalous Line        2693.
    On several occasions I have spoken of an ort-ngo line, 2693, which
 by its brilliancy and sharpness is a prominent object in most of the
 samarium-yttrium spectra. With pure samaric sulphate it is exceeding
 faint. With samaria containing 5 per cent. of yttria it is very little
 brighter; with 10 per cent. of yttria it gains a little ; with 15 per
cent. it is brighter still, and with a mixture of 80 parts samaria and
 20 parts yttria it is at its maximum intensity. It continues to be the
 most striking feature in the spectra of the various mixtures of samaria
and yttria until the proportion becomes samaria 3, yttria 97, when it
begins to get less bright, and only when pure yttria is reached does it
altogether vanish.
    It is noteworthy that so long as this bright line is a component of
 the spectrum, the other bands manifest decidedly less intensity, and
many of them are suppressed.          The profound modification in the
                                                                   I
spectra of samaria and yttria developed by their mixture is, believe,
without precedent in spectrum analysis.        It is difficult to realise the
character of    the modification  which converts   somewhat faint diffused
bands into one intensely sharp and brilliant lino.
    One important lesson taught by the many anomalies unearthed in
these researches is, that inferences drawn from spectrum analysis per
se   are liable to grave doubt, unless at every step the spectroscopist
goes hand in hand with the chemist.        Spectroscopy may give valuable
indications, but chemistry must after all be the court of final appeal.

by  artificial means. The first case considered is that of a piece of
thick plate glass which has been totally devitrified under conditions
described in detail in the paper.       In the roughly broken specimen
the fractured surface sufficiently reveals the fact that crysta llisation has
taken place throughout the mass, while other specimens subsequently
described by the authors demonstrate beyond question that the crystal
lisation has started at the surfaces and has travelled in war dp.          In
this particular specimen the crystallisation has advanced from the
different surfaces until the various sets of crystals have arrested one
another in very definite planes, whose traces are clearly perceptible on
a fractured surface.      A figure showing this has recently been pub
lished in Prof. Bonney's Presidential Address to the Geological Society,
the drawing having been made from a chip taken from part of the
same plate of glass now in the Museum of Practical Geology.                An
examination of a section cut in one direction from the specimen now
described, showed little more than has already been stated, except
that the crystals were seen to occur in bundles of divergent prisms,
the centres of divergence being at or near the surfaces of the plate
of glass. An inspection of a ground surface of the plate showed a
curious reticulation, in some places very well marked, and it therefore
seemed desirable to examine another section taken parallel to this
surface, and at right angles to the former section. This was done, and
it then became apparent that a third section must be cut, so as to
traverse two directions of crystallisation disposed at right angles to
each other before any sound interpretation of the phenomena could be
arrived at.    This third section traversed one of the triangular areas,
or rather wedges formed by arrest, on the shorter side of the plate, at
a little distance from the thin end of the wedge, and, beyond this area,
it passed parallel to the adjacent directions of crystallisation. In this
section the bundles of crystals lying normal to the plane of section
were seen exactly to resemble those visible in the second section taken
parallel to one of the broad surfaces of the plate, while the others
 were identical with those already seen in the first section.         It then
became clear that a system of prismatic jointing had been developed,
 presumably due to strain around separate centres of crystallisation
from which the divergent fasciculi emanated, while from the first and
third sections it was evident that this jointing extended from the
surface inwards, until the development of one set of crystalline bundles
 was arrested by another set.       In sections taken parallel to these
 fasciculi there is a curious wavy brindling, which is apparently due to
                                                      "
 structure analogous to that seen in " cone in cone ironstone and some
 other minerals,   the marked character of the phenomena when viewed
 by  transmitted  light being probably due to want of coincidence in the
 direction of the minute prisms or fibres composing the overlapping
 divergent groups.     In  order to ascertain   more   fully the conditions

 under which this mode of devitrification would hold good, glass solids
of definite geometrical forms were partially and completely devi-
 trified, and it was seen that in each case the crystalline bundies, sepa
 rated by joint planes, extended from the surface of the solids inwards
in directions normal to the surfaces. In a trigonal prism it was found
 that there was an apparent departure from this rule, certain sets of
crystals emanating from lines within the prism, and extending out
 wards towards the surfaces of the solids, although they did not reach
 those surfaces.   This anomalous procedure was referred to the pre
sence    of flaws, and  to demonstrate this two fresh specimens were
devitrified. One was another trigonal prism free from any flaw, in
which devitrification extended uniformly from the surfaces until three
straight lines of arrest resulted, meeting in the axis of the prism.
The other specimen was a thick piece of flat plate glass. On this a
short line was ruled with a diamond, and a tap being administered, a
crack was developed from this line, extending rather more than half
way through the plate. The plate was then completely devitrified. The
result was precisely similar to that seen in the specimen first described,
but it was found that the crack emanating from the diamond scratch
had acted as a fresh surface, devitrification having taken place at right
angles to this crack as far as the median line of arrest, while on the
other side of that line, and from the extremity of the crack, a radiating
crystalline structure was developed, resulting in a structure analogous
to that of a hemisphere, but of course extending the whole length of
the crack.
    The remainder of the paper touches upon the incipient development
and formation of spherules and crystallites, with other points of inte
rest in connexion with superficial devitrification.      The spherules in
their most rudimentary stage sometimes appear to consist of nebular
segregations of globulites. Instances are also cited in which partial
and complete devitrification of a glass plate is brought about by the
development of spherules in the interior of the plate in conjunction
with the formation of an enveloping crust, which extends to variable
distances from the surfaces of the plate, according to the period of
devitrification, and also, more especially, according to the chemical
composition of the glass.
    Some notes are also given on the relation of the phenomena here
described to similar ones met with in naturally devitrified rocks, the
paper being intended as the forerunner of others, in which it is hoped
that the petrological bearings of the subject may be more fully
discussed.

VII. " Regional      Metamorphism."          By JOSJSPH PRESTWICH, M.A.,
       F.R.S., Corr. Acad. Sci. Paris, Professor of Geology in the
       University of Oxford.         Received June 11, 1885.
    Metamorphic rocks have been divided into two classes — 1. Those in
which local changes have been caused by contact with heated eruptive
rocks ; 2. Those extending over wider areas, in which the rocks are
in no apparent relation to eruptive or igneous rocks.              The first has
been termed Contact Metamorphism, and the second Normal or Regional
Metamorphism, the latter two terms having been used to express the
same phenomena and treated as synonymous.
    The object of this paper is briefly to show that there may be another
cause for metamorphic action, for which, not to introduce a new term,
I would propose to transfer and restrict the term of 11Regional Meta
morphism."      Normal metamorphism I would confine to signify, as
hitherto, the changes caused by the heat due to depth, on the supposi
tion of the existence of a heated central nucleus of the earth, while 1
would use the term regional metamorphism to denote changes effected
by the agency of the physical causes to which Mr. Mallet referred the
fusion of the volcanic rocks, namely, the heat produced locally within
the crust of the earth by transformation into heat of the mechanical work
of compression, or of crushing of portions of that crust.*
    I was led to consider the importance of this action by the abnormal
result presented in the distribution of the underground isotherms in
 the St.  Gothard Tunnel, and which on looking into the question can
 only, as it seems to me, be attributed to the residual heat arising from
 the crushing of the rocks during the upheaval of that portion of the
 Alpine range, which is of very late geological date ; and also by some
 cases in which the alteration in the rocks hardly seemed explicable upon
 the hypothesis either of ordinary contact- or normal-metamorphism.
    This other source of heat had not been altogether overlooked by
 geologists, though only occasionally referred to as a secondary cause ;
 but its actual importance had hardly been realised until Mallet inves
 tigated the subject experimentally and mathematically.             He failed to
  show sufficient cause for the fusion of the volcanic rocks, but he drew
  attention  to the enormous       heat-producing      power    of certain  earth
  movements.     This power, inadequate though it may be to explain the
  phenomena    of vulcanicity, is singularly applicable in explanation of
  some of the metamorphic phenomena exhibited in mountain ranges.
  The object of his experiments, however, having been to establish the
  maximum results     to be attained by the force of compression, only
  bears indirectly on the collateral problem we are here considering.

and to determine the quantity of heat evolved by the process. For
                  I
this purpose, as have before mentioned,* the work done was measured
by the proportion of water at 32° F. that could be converted into steam
of one atmosphere (or at 212° F.) by the estimated heat evolved by
the crushing of 1 cubic foot of each class of rock.
   The crushing weight in the case of the specimens of the Sedimentary
 Strata was found to vary in round numbers from about 2 to 18 tons
per square inch, while for the Crystalline and Igneous rocks it reached
to over 30 tons (each class of rock showing considerable variations) ;
and the temperature resulting from crushing 1 cubic foot of rock
varied from 8° F. in Caen Oolite to 217° F. in Guernsey Granite.
In conclusion Mallet estimated that the heat of liquefaction of
 1 cubic mile of ice at 32° melted is equivalent to the crushing work
of 1'277 cubic mile of mean rock when transformed into heat, or that
1 cubic mile of crushed mean rock would fuse 0-108 cubic mile of
volcanic material.
   With all the harder rocks the heat produced in the metal surround
ings by the complete crushing was easily perceptible by the hand, and
was so great with some of the granites and porphyries as to necessi
tate a delay for the apparatus to cool. Both Mr. Mallet and Professor
Rankine were of opinion that in the crushing of a rigid material such
as rock, almost the entire mechanical work (with the exception of a
 small residue of external work) reappears as heat.          It was further
shown that, even in the most rigid bodies, crushing begins by com
pression and yielding, and that at this stage heat begins to be evolved.
   Mr. Mallet, applying      these results   to the deformation   caused  in
the earth's crust by the contraction of the cooling nucleus, observes
that the compression will be greatest along lines of fault and moun
tain-upheavals, so that the chief amount of the work of compression
will  be transferred to those lines of fracture or weakness ; and the in
crease   of temperature produced by the greater part of the internal
work will cause the parts of the crust about those lines to become
much hotter than the intervening parts, where the crust is undis
turbed.
   Consequently the work thus developed being transformed into heat,
that heat will be greatest along those lines or planes at places where
the movement       and pressure, together constituting the work, is
greatest ; whence Mallet concluded that along or about such axial
lines of concentrated compressive and crushing work, the temperature
may locally rise to a red heat, or even to that of fusing the rocky
materials   crushed and the pressing-together-walls       themselves adja
cent to them.     This was, in his opinion, the real nature and origin of
the volcanic heat as now produced on the globe.

    Although the hypothesis fails for various reasons* in its application
to  vulcanicity, for, as a matter of observation, the great lines of dis
turbances and compression of the Alps, Pyrenees, and other mountain-
chains are free from either active or extinct volcanoes ; there is
nevertheless reason to believe that this source of heat may have been
adequate to produce great molecular changes in the rocks along the
lines of disturbance and upheaval.             It is precisely along such lines
that not only are the older rocks metamorphosed, but rocks of creta
ceous and tertiary age — which usually have not been affected by
normal metamorphism — coming, in these mountain-chains, under the
influence of the disturbing forces, have undergone a change analogous
to that produced by normal metamorphism.
    [Unfortunately no other experiments than those of Mr. Mallet, to
determine the heat developed by the compression of rocks, have been
made ; and valuable as his experiments are, his full conclusions cannot
be accepted, because in nature the complete crushing upon which his
calculations aro based does not obtain, nor can the heat be localised
in the way assumed.
    On the other hand, his experiments do not take into separate con
sideration friction and deformation, the influence of which in raising
the temperature during earth-movements                must be very considerable.
No special experiments have, in fact, been made on the work of these
forces on rocks, but it has been proved experimentally with metals.
Iron can be raised by those means to a low red heat, and it has been
estimated that with lead the rise of temperature under deformation is
equivalent to 700°     F.
    Further, Mallet's estimates were based on an initial temperature of
32°,  whereas the initial temperature in the underground rocks affected
 by the earth-movements         would necessarily be high. Consequently,
although we cannot accept the extreme estimates of Mallet — nor can
 we hope to ascertain with the imperfect data at present in our posses
sion the exact heat developed by rock movements — still it is certain
 that his experiments, combined with what is known of the heating
 effects of friction and deformation,         indicate that a large amount of
 heat must be developed in the underground rocks by these causes. —

    If the disturbances had taken place at once, or suddenly, and the
 rocks had been wholly crushed, the results calculated on by Mr. Mallet
 were more likely to have been attained.            But the movements were in
 all probability of extreme slowness for very long periods — and this
 might be an argument that they were so — and it was only when the
 tension had reached a certain point that disruption took place, and
 the movement of the parts became more rapid, pending the restora-

                             ; nor is there any reason to suppose that
tion of a state of equilibrium
the rocks were at any time crushed in the complete manner accom
plished experimentally by Mr. Mallet.      Consequently much of the
heat developed would be dissipated during the long slow compression,
and the maximum effects estimated by him would not obtain in nature.
Still, as the experiments show that the weight at which the first
yielding of the rock takes place is not more than one- third of the
crushing weight, the thermal effects might still be considerable, pro
vided the time the heat had to spread through the adjacent rocks
were not excessive.    It is also certain that greater and more concen
trated effects would result at the time of actual disruption and
faulting. The gigantic foldings of the rocks in the Alps, and the
magnitude of the faults there and in the Pyrenees, show how vastly
great the forces then in operation were ; and indicate how important
must have been the consequent rapid conversion of even a portion of
the work of these forces into heat.
   Amongst the objections that have been raised against the explana
tion of some cases of alteration of sedimentary strata in mountain-
chains by ordinary normal metamorphism, is the one that unaltered
strata alternate with the altered strata.       Sometimes an apparent
alternation is explained by inversion of the strata, or where that
does not exist, it may be due to the circumstance that differences of
mineral composition, or in the proportion of the water of imbibition,
have caused the metamorphism to affect different beds in different
degrees.  On the theory of regional metamorphism, in the sense I
would use    it,
              another explanation suggests itself by the way in which
differences in the resistance of the rocks develop different quantities
of heat. Mr. Mallet has shown by experiments on the compressibility
of rocks at Holyhead, that, although    certain slate-rocks were com
pressed by precisely the same  force  before  their elastic limits were
passed, yet owing to differences in their compressibility, the heat
developed in the rocks when released would render the quartz-rock
nearly three times as hot as the slate-rock.    In this manner, there
fore,  may be possible to account for a special and restricted meta
        it
morphism of some strata in mountain-chains,    and for its frequently
 localised occurrence.
   Further there are,    as   well known, many strata which are not
                               is
usually metamorphic, but which are so when involved in mountain-
chains.   Among many common examples of such metamorphism may
be instanced that of the lower cretaceous strata on the flanks of the
Pyrenees.    They are there represented by dark schists and crystalline
limestones, while at a short distance from that range they consist     of
marls and ordinary limestones.     In the Alps, strata of middle Eocene
age are, at the Diablerets, converted into hard black slaty rocks, which
are purely local   ;while the soft and earthy calcareous Nummulitic

strata     of    the    south    of France are represented              by massive
limestones and crystalline marbles.              Normal metamorphism cannot
here be invoked, because it does not appear that these rocks have
been covered by any great thickness of newer rocks, or depressed to
such depths so as to bring them within the influence of the higher
underground temperatures.             Nor can the change be always attributed
to contact metamorphism with granite or other eruptive or protrusive
rocks. It is only in cases where there is a central axis of any eruptive
rocks that this form of metamorphism can have acted, but in the
many cases where no eruptive rocks appear, the effect may, I would
suggest, be due entirely to regional metamorphism.
     The remarkable changes which take place in the condition of the
coal of Pennsylvania, as it ranges into the Appalachian Mountains,
may also be owing more probably to regional than to normal meta
morphism. This mountain-range consists of a series of great parallel
folds, increasing in acuteness as the central axis is approached.
Eruptive rocks are absent ; but nevertheless the strata, as they
approach the central chain, become more crystalline, and the
coal, which at a distance is ordinary bituminous coal, passes into
anthracite, and even graphite.              The late Professor H. D. Rogers
divided this great coalfield into four basins. The coal in the less dis
turbed district near the Ohio river, where the flexures are extremely
gentle and wide apart, contains from 40 to 50 per cent. of volatile
matter ; in the wide basin further east it decreases to 30 or 35 per cent. ;
in the basins of the Alleghany range, in which, although there are no
important dislocations or great flexures, there are some extensive and
symmetrical anticlinical axes of the flatter form, the proportion of the
volatile matter in the coal varies from 16 to 22 per cent. ; while in
the most easterly chain of basins which are associated with the
boldest flexures and greatest dislocations, with close plications and
inversions of strata, the quantity of volatile matter in the coal is
 reduced to from 6 to 14 per cent.*
    A   somewhat analogous instance is presented by the Carboniferous
series of Belgium. The excessive squeezing, faulting, and inversions
 which the Coal-measures have undergone on the flanks of the axis of
 the Ardennes, is there accompanied by an alteration of the highly
 bituminous coals into dry coals and into anthracite ; while the Car
 boniferous    and Devonian limestones           amidst the sharply convoluted
and folded strata       of  the Ardennes     are  there, as they are also on the
 line of the same disturbance in the Boulonnais, transformed very
 generally into semi-crystalline        marbles.    The few exposures of eruptive
    * Some geologists have reforred the coincidence of these phenomena, partly to
 the greater facility afforded for the escape of volatile matter when the fracturing of
 the rocks has produced an infinite number of cracks and crevices, and partly to the
 gases and waters which penetrated these cracks and promoted the disengagement of
 volatile matter.

rocks are all on a small scale, and affect the adjacent rocks locally
only by contact metamorphism.                It is probable that the anthracite of
the coal-field of South Wales is the result of similar regional meta
morphism.
    In the case of certain contact metamorphisms produced by contact
with igneous rocks, we know that the changes were produced by
great heat, for many igneous rocks must have had a temperature of
3000° to 4000° F. or more ; while in the case of normal metamorphism
it is evident that the changes produced did not depend so much on
high temperature as on pressure and the presence of water ; and there
is reason to believe that a temperature of about 600° to 800° F.
would suffice to produce all or almost all the observed hydrothermal
effects. For although in many instances of normal metamorphism
new minerals are formed, the rocks are not fused, nor are the fossils
destroyed.      In Brittany, black slates, which pass into schists, with
large crystals of Chiastolite,        still show impressions of orthis,         trilobites,
and other Silurian fossils.*          Devonian strata in the Vosges pass into
a rock consisting of pyroxene, garnet, epidote, and other silicates of
this character, and yet retain impressions of corals .^
    The degree of heat required, therefore, to produce changes similar
to    those   produced        by normal metamorphism,                under somewhat
analogous conditions of time, temperature, and moisture, is com
paratively small ; and as affording some indication of this amount,
the alterations in the character of the coal which have taken place in
the above-named           instances afford a convenient approximate test.
While it requires a red heat to convert coal into coke, its conversion
into anthracite is effected in presence of moisture at much lower
temperatures, and while contact with igneous rocks has produced the
former effects, contact with granite has only resulted in the latter.
M. Daubree has even converted wood, by exposure for some
time in water under pressure to a temperature of 300° C., into
an anthracite        so hard as scarcely to be touched by steel, and so
infusible as to burn with extreme slowness even in the oxidising flame
of the blowpipe, while at the same time it has been rendered, like the
diamond, a non-conductor of electricity.                This alteration in the coal-
beds indicates, therefore, the influence of a temperature sufficient to
produce effects similar to those produced by ordinary normal meta
morphism, and consequently sufficient to raise very considerably the
temperature of a body of rocks such as form mountain-chains, though
insufficient to cause fusion.

    Of the enormous tangential pressure exercised in the elevation of
these chains, some idea may be formed when we consider the amount
of compression which those portions of the crust have undergone.
Thus, for example, as I mentioned in the paper before referred to,
Heim estimates that in the Alps the compression has been to the
extent of 72 miles ; and in a recent paper by Professor Claypole,
he arrives at the conclusion, after a careful investigation of the
magnitude and width of each fold, that in the Appalachian moun
tains " a tract of the earth's surface measuring originally 153 miles
from south-east to north-west has been so crushed and compressed
that its present breadth along the line of section is only 65 miles,"
and of this, in one part, — the Cumberland Valley, — " 95 miles of
country have been compressed into 16 miles."
   These vast compressions could not have taken place without the
transformation into heat of a large portion of the mechanical work,
though the degree and centralisation of the heat would depend on the
rapidity and completeness with which the compression and deforma
tion had been effected. Need we therefore be surprised to find
that, in some of the newer mountain-ranges, a small residual portion
of the heat thus mechanically evolved still existing and causing slight
aberrations in the position of the underground isothermal lines : the
same cause may possibly account for other exceptional cases.
   The only sufficiently complete set of observations on a mountain-
chain of this character that have yet been made are those           I have
before alluded to, by Dr. Stapff in the St. Gothard Tunnel. Parti
culars of these observations will be found in my paper on "Under
                               I
ground Temperatures," and need therefore here only mention that
they show at the north end of the tunnel in the part where an axis of
elevation of late geological age (Pliocene) traverses the range, that
the thermic gradient, which normally equals about 57 feet for 1° F., is
there not more than 38 feet ; and for this Dr. Stapff states that there
was no obvious explanation.
                                       I
    In further support of this view, would refer to the exceptional
frequency of thermal springs in mountain chains.        Some of these are
 no doubt due to the presence of eruptive rocks, but in many cases there
are none of these rocks in the neighbourhood, and yet hot springs are
 common.     Others may, of course, be due to the normal temperature
 of the depth from which the water rises, but their numbers and their
position often militate against this view.      In the Alps they are not
infrequent,   and sometimes  occur  at very high levels. In the Pyrenees
 the number of thermal springs exceeds 150, while the Professors
 Rogers ascertained that there were 56 such springs in the Appalachian
 chain of mountains.     Seven of these are on lines of fault or inversion ;
 the others issue on lines of anticlinal axes, or at points near to them.

       Cocaine to the Eye."        By Walter H. Jessop. Communi
       cated by Dr. Lauder Brunton, F.R.S. Received June 4,
       1885.
    In a paper on
                   " Cocaine," published in the " Practitioner " of January
1,  1885, and more fully in a paper on " The Cocainised Eye," before
the Ophthalmological Society on January 8th, 1885, 1 mentioned          most
of the clinical facts concerning the drug and its action that had       then
come under my own investigation and treatment.
   The object of this paper is to try and elucidate one of these       facts,
namely — The
          :       cause  of the mydriasis accompanying the application of
cocaine to the eye.      This research has been made chiefly on human
and rabbits' eyes by conjunctival instillation, and on rabbits' eyes by
experiments detailed below.        The salt of cocaine used has been the
hydrochlorate obtained from Merck, of Darmstadt ; the strength of
the solutions 2, 4, and 20 per cent., and these solutions have been used
fresh to avoid any changes by the growth of fungi, &c. By means of
a syringe the quantity of the solution used each time has been as
nearly as possible 1 minim. The pupil has been measured by a
Nettleship's pupillometer, or by means of a graduated thread, which
could be easily placed across the cornea.      During each experiment the
subject was exposed as far as possible to the same light, so that the
differences in size of the pupils should be as exact as possible.
   The experiments on animals have been made strictly under the
influence of chloroform, and in animals allowed to live after such
experiments strict antiseptic precautions have been taken, so that
apparently they scarcely suffered except from the after effects of        the
chloroform, the wounds being slight and quickly healed.
   If only one measurement of the pupils of rabbits is given it is        the
transverse one.
                                Experiment  I.
   Starting first with the action of cocaine on the eye by conjunc
tival instillation,  I found as the result of over one hundred observa
tions on the human eye the following facts : —

1885.]     produced by   the Application   of  Cocaine to the Eye.     433
   The mydriasis is quickly attained and very large, and differs also
from atropine in the pupil acting always to light and accommoda
tion.
   When the mydriasis is extreme, viz., 10 mm., the movement to light
is very slight, and the initial contraction can only be seen by magni
fying the pupil by the observer's putting on a pair of +5D spectacles.
The slight contraction is immediately followed by a recoil which
almost induces the belief that a dilatation has taken place.
   The continuance of the mydriasis is comparatively short, the pupil
attaining its normal size in from twelve to twenty-four hours. By
drying the conjunctiva and cornea and placing the cocaine carefully
on a limited part, the dilatation of the pupil will at first only take
place at that spot, thus rendering the pupil irregularly dilated, and
showing the limited action of the drug.
   The following cases show the main points in the mydriasis of
cocaine, and that the stronger the solution the quicker the initial and
ad maximum dilatation.
    I. H. C., 15. Pupils Q\ mm. ; cocaine 4 per cent. on right eye at
2.5 p.m. ; at 2.25 p.m. pupil 10 mm., not further increased.     The pupil
had resumed its normal size twelve hours afterwards.
   II. W. H., 30. Pupils 5 mm., cocaine 20 per cent. in left eye ; in
seventeen minutes pupil 8 mm., and other instillations did not increase
its size.
   Pupil regained its normal size ten hours afterwards.
   III. E. W., 31. Pupils 5 mm., at 11.20 cocaine 2 per cent., at
11.30 cocaine 2 per cent., and at 11.50 pupils 8'5 mm.
   Fourteen hours afterwards pupil normal size.
   In rabbits the mydriasis induced by cocaine is, as a rule, very large,
and in two cases I could not make out any action to light, but in both
the pupil was 11-5 mm. ; and the reason probably was the great
stretching of the sphincter muscle of the pupil incapacitating its
action ; mydriasis was induced by conjunctival instillation, and also
by injection into the anterior chamber.
                  Experiment  II. — Cocaine  and Atropine.
    In cases  of full cocaine mydriasis the application of atropine had
 no effect on the size of the pupil, but stopped its action to light and
accommodation.

months continually, the pupil was very much dilated, 10'5 mm., and
here cocaine had no effect, the pupil being at its ad maximum dilata

January, and since have been fully sustained by increased experience.

  2.42 p.m., pupil 11 mm., does not act to light and accommodation.
  In this case, then, in eighteen minutes we had an ad maximum dila
tation of the pupil. To test the difference in time between this and
the action of the same quantity of atropine alone, the next experiment
was done.   This shows that in eighteen minutes no effect was noted on
the pupil, and that in thirty-six minutes the pupil was only       mm.,       9
and the greatest dilatation attained was 9-5 mm.

                    Experiment      IV. — Cocaine   and Eserine.
  The action of eserine on cocaine mydriasis was to induce myosis
very easily.The myosis resembled that due to eserine alone.
  On investigating more carefully found that on taking

of cocaine and 1 of eserine, the normal size of the pupil was un
changed.

of cocaine and eserine (27 : 1) in right eye. Pupil afterwards regular,
6 mm.
                     Experiment    V. — Cocaine and Pilocarpine.
   The action of pilocarpine was to induce myosis easily.
   On trying mixtures of the drugs I found that 4 of cocaine and 1 of
pilocarpine, each 2 per cent, solution, had no effect on the normal
pupil.
   A. W., 23. Pupils regular, equal, 5 mm., left eye pilocarpine, 2 per
cent, on conjunctiva, bringing pupil to 2-5 mm. ; 4 instillations of
cocaine, 2 per cent., brought back pupil to 5 mm.
   J. B., 30. Pupils regular, equal, 5 mm. ; 3 instillations of cocaine
and pilocarpine (4:1) had no effect on pupils.
   The importance of these combinations I have utilised, especially
that of pilocarpine and cocaine, for keeping the pupil a normal size
during the operation of iridectomy, when anaesthesia has to be induced
by cocaine.    The objection to the dilated pupil is that it keeps dilated
both during and after the operation, and so may become prolapsed
afterwards, especially in glaucoma cases ; also if a tolerably large con
junctival flap has been made the iris may disappear under          and soit,
become difficult to catch hold of,       iridectomy

This combination does not prevent the local anaesthesia of cocaine.
The antagonism between eserine and pilocarpine on the one hand, and
cocaine on the other, gives us        means of estimating the relative
                                         a
power of pilocarpine and eserine on the pupil.

   The effect of section of the 3rd nerve on a pupil dilated by cocaine
stops its action to light and accommodation, but does not increase the
size of the pupil.

  A  weak stimulation of the 3rd nerve overcame the mydriasis, pro
ducing the same myosis as before whilst the stimulant lasted, and
giving rise again to mydriasis.
                             Experiment    IX.
  On tapping the anterior chamber of an eye under the influence             of
cocaine, the dilated pupil contracts very little or not at all. This        ig,
of course, contrary to what occurs in a normal eye. or in one under
atropine, where marked contraction    of the pupil occurs in all   cases.
                             Experiment       X.
   On tapping the anterior chamber of a rabbit, and placing one
electrode on the surface of the iris towards the centre, a weak faradaic
current gave rise to contraction of the pupil in all cases of cocaine
mydriasis, except two, in which very large mydriasis had been
produced.
   These latter, however, could be explained by the great stretching
of the sphincter muscle, and hence stimulation directly of the fibres
had no effect.

first case and two othersIfailed to get any effect on the pupil.
                             Experiment    XII.
   On the exsected eye of rabbits  I     have tried several times, with
failure, to increase the size of the pupil by cocaine. In two cases, on
injecting cocaine into the anterior chamber immediately after Bisec
tion, the contraction of the pupil due to tapping soon passed off, and
the pupil became slightly larger than before tapping.

the exposed sympathetic generally gave rise to an increase in the

                                             found that it simply
depended on the size of the mydriasis, as in cases where the ad
maximum cocaine mydriasis was produced, stimulation of the sym
pathetic no longer increased it, though the strength of the current
was increased.   In some cases I found that the increase in the size of
the pupil on stimulating the sympathetic was due to the fact that the
animal was in a bright light, and therefore the pupil contracting to
that light. On shading the eyes, and the pupil assuming its full dila
tation, no extra effect was produced by stimulating the sympathetic.

shaded and accommodation relaxed it is 6 mm. On taking these notes,
the one-sided        flushing of the face was noticed.             Six instillations of
 cocaine, 2 per cent., in the right eye, gave rise            to no     alteration in the
 size of the pupil.

440                Mr. W. H. Jessop.       On   the   Mydriasis     [June    18,
   To make certain of this result, Mr. Nettleship and myself made ten
days afterwards the following observations on the patient : —
   In a good light. 11.15. a.m. right pupil 2 mm., left 2'5 mm.; 1 disk
of cocaine -g^-g grain placed in each eye.
   11.18, three more disks of same strength put in each eye.
   11.25, right pupil 2 mm., left 4 5 mm.
   11.35, right pupil 2 mm., left 6 5 mm.
   11.55, right pupil 2 mm., left 7 mm.
   12.10, pupils the same; on shading them the right pupil 3 mm.,
left 9 mm.
   On now putting homatropine into the right eye the pupil dilated
regularly as in a normal eye as below : —
   12.15 p.m., homatropine   (4 grains to the ounce) put in right eye;
pupil  was  2 mm.
   12.30, right pupil now 6'5 mm., and does not act to light or accom
modation.
     All   the preceding experiments pointed to the action of cocaine being
an   irritant of the sympathetic or mydriatic nerve of the eye, and         this
fact is proved beyond a doubt by the last experiment (XVIII).    Both
in rabbits in which a piece of the cervical sympathetic had been
excised for some days, and also in a case presenting all the symptoms
of section of the cervical   sympathetic, cocaine had not the slightest
effect on the pupil.
   That such action is local and not central is proved by the extremely
local and limited action of cocaine on all the parts of the body, in
cluding the pupil (Experiment I), and by dilatation of the pupil fol
lowing its application to an exsected        eye   (Experiment    XII).   That
cocaine mydriasis is not in any way dependent on the 3rd nerve is
shown by Experiments VI, VII, and VIII, and also by the pupil
acting to light and accommodation (Experiment I). That cocaine
mydriasis is not due to paralysis of the sphincter muscle is shown by
the ease with which eserine, which acts directly on the muscular fibre,
reduces     producing the usual myosis (Experiment IV), and also
             it,                                                              by
the fact that stimulation of the muscular fibre directly gives rise to
contraction of the pupil (Experiment X).
  The cases in which this contraction on direct stimulation did not
take place were due probably to the overstretching of the sphincter
muscle.  Thus by excluding the other means of producing mydriasis
we have next to consider whether we can produce the same kind                 of
mydriasis as that of cocaine by excitation of the sympathetic.
  We find that the faradaic stimulation of the cervical sympathetic
which will give rise to a dilatation of the pupil, at the same time
acting to the reflex of light,   very weak, as any slight increase
                                   is                                         of
the current stops this reflex action of the pupil. But that the local
excitation of the sympathetic by cocaine and its induced mydriasis           is

1885.]     produced by the Application      of  Cocaine to the Eye.      441
also weak is shown by the ease with which myotics (Experiment IV
and V) and stimulation of the 3rd nerve (Experiment VIII) overcome
the mydriasis.
   Therefore our facts bring us to the conclusion that cocaine mydri
asis  is induced by a local irritation of the endings of the cervical
sympathetic or mydriatic nerve in the eye.         Bat this nerve consists of
two distinct sets of fibres  —  one set acting on the blood-vessels as a
vaso-constrictor, and the other only producing dilatation of the pupil.
That such is the case can be proved by bleeding an animal to death
when, even after several excitations of the cervical sympathetic, fresh
stimulation of this nerve again increases the dilatation of the pupil
induced by the bloodless state of the eye.          Francois Franck, in his
able monograph " On the Dilatator Nerves of the Pupil," * brings
forward several other conclusive arguments to prove the dual action
of the cervical sympathetic fibres.        That cocaine acts on the small
blood-vessels by constricting them can be proved easily by its action
on the vessels of the conjunctiva.
   We may therefore assume that it also acts thus on the vessels of
the iris — a fact which accounts for the diminution of tension in an eye
under cocaine.      But that this is not the only cause of cocaine mydri
asis is evident from the following facts, viz., that the full mydriasis
of cocaine    is much larger than that induced by the bloodless state of
the eye, and that cocaine increases the mydriasis induced by bleeding
the animal to death (Experiments XI and XI II) . It is the action on
 the purely mydriatic fibres that gives rise for a time to dilatation of
the pupil by cocaine after section of the cervical sympathetic (Ex
periment XV).       That this action of cocaine on the purely mydriatic
fibres passes off after a time is shown on rabbits by Experiment XVII,
and this is due to cutting off its communication with the mydriatic
centre of Budge and Waller in the spinal cord.
   The reason of this happening so soon is the weak stimulus due to
cocaine, and therefore a very slight change in the nerve endings being
able to prevent its action.    That cocaine also acts on this mydriatic
nerve is suggested by the enlargement of the palpebral aperture fol
lowing its application.     Hence from these experiments it appears that
cocaine produces mydriasis by acting locally on the endings of tho
cervical sympathetic nerve in the eye, and also that it affects both sets
of fibres, namely, the purely mydriatic and the vaso-constrictor.

       College, Cambridge. Communicated by E. Ray Lankester,
       M.A., LL.D., F.R.S. Received June 2, 1885.
   The following results were obtained in connexion with a research
" On the Connective Tissue and Vascular
                                                     System of Mollusca," en
which I acted as assistant to Professor Lankester, according to the
terms of a grant from the Government Grant Committee of the
Royal Society : other results will be published subsequently.
   The connective tissues of Molluscs, as presented by Helix,
Planorbis, Anodon, Cyclas, and Solen, may be divided into two
main groups.        In one of these the constituent cells are little
advanced from their original mesoblastic condition ; they have an
irregular stellate form, and they are joined together by the tips of
their processes. In the other variety, which will be spoken of as
lamellar connective tissue, the cells are more irregular in form and
their processes more attenuated, but, by the deposition of an inter
cellular ectoplasm in certain planes, the cells come to lie in plates or
films.    These   films    form   the walls     of  the sinuses   and  lacuna;
(occasionally vein-like in appearance) of Molluscs. All the cells,
however, of the lamellar connective tissue do not lie embedded in
the films, for some of enormous size project into the blood, being only
attached by a small portion of their superficies to the film.
   These cells are the " vesicular

                                        cells    (Lankester) of the lamellar
connective tissue    : they contain glycogen.
                           1. Tissues operated upon.
   In extracting glycogen from Anodon         I have made use of the mantle,
thus avoiding all contamination and complications of results on the
part of the liver, and, by rejecting the mantle edge, ventral to the
pallial muscles, have been able to work upon a region of the simple>t
composition, for with the exception of a very few muscular fibrrs
which pass from side to side of the mantle, the region operated upon
comprises only the two epidermes and the lamellar films with their
glycogenous cells.      The blood offers no difficulties, as it readily drains
out of the mantle.
                        2. Processes of Extractions,   fyv.
   In extraction   I  have made use of the process and tests detailed for
 investigating the liver of the rabbit for glycogen in Foster and
Langley's "Elementary           Physiology," and also of those in the
admirable essay of Dr. Errera, to which         I am  much indebted.

  To observe most of the      following results, however, the more
complicated processes alluded   to above are not really essential. I
therefore give a simpler process, whose results are sufficiently
accurate.
   The mantles of twenty Anodons (previously preserved in strong
spirit) are treated, after removing the adherent spirit with blotting
paper, with 3 oz. of boiling distilled water. While in the water, the
mantles are disintegrated as far as possible with a glass rod.       The
mixture is freely shaken, and in a few minutes filtered.    The filtrate
is rapidly cooled, and then twice its bulk of absolute alcohol is added
to   it,
       and allowed to stand.  The precipitate so obtained     taken up,         is
after washing with 90 per cent. spirit, in distilled water, and again
precipitated          by absolute alcohol as before.
  Upon dissolving this precipitate in distilled water a bluish opalescent
solution       is   obtained which   —

      Gives no reaction with Fehling's solution upon warming.

solution gives Fehling's reaction.

  The above           is   briefly the evidence of the occurrence           of glycogen in
the mantle          of Anodon.
                 3.   The Localisation      ofthe Glycogen       in certain Cells.
  By    little care the mantle may be split in half (this
           a                                                performed           is
more easily with a spirit specimen).   Placing one of the halves so
obtained upon a glass slip, epidermis downwards, and treating the
preparation with solution of iodine, a remarkable       appearance                            is
observed.
  The tissues generally are hardly stained at all, but with the naked
eye   it  seen that the connective tissue
            is                               copiously sprinkled with

dark brown dots. By the microscope these dots are found to be very
large      vesicular cells,     some of whose contents have been deeply stained
by   the iodine.
     4.     Some Reactions and Particulars            of   these Glycogenosis    Vesicles.
  For the study of these cells, thick sections of the frozen mantle of
Anodon or preparations of the "mesentery " of Helix are best.
  The vesicles are then seen to be very large round or oval cells, with
very brilliant (though not doubly refracting) contents.
  By treatment with water, the cells are emptied of contents
except the nucleus and the cell protoplasm, which         very small in   is
amount.          By crushing,     it   is   seen   that the metaplasm          ("   endoplastic

product      Lankester) is fluid, and dissolves to an opalescent fluid in the
surrounding water.
   With strong spirit, the metaplasm undergoes a very remarkable
and quite characteristic          clotting or pseudo-crystallisation (also
noticed by Errera), which takes place equally well either within or
(in crushed specimens) outside the cell.                Osmic acid yields no
reaction.
   It is the metaplasm or endoplastic product of the vesicle which is
deeply stained by iodine, and also by borax carmine, and not the
nucleus and cell protoplasm.           I do not propose here to further
describe the glycogenous vesicles, for they are described and figured,
both fresh and after the action of various reagents, at great length by
Professor Lankester and myself in the forthcoming paper to which
allusion has before been made, but           I  will take this opportunity of
pointing   out —
   1. That these "vesicles" are the same as the "plasma cells" of
                                                      "

&c.    For many years the existence of these vesicles has been denied
and affirmed by two schools of observers ; we shall bring forward
indubitable proof in favour of Fleming and his adherents.
   2. That these cells are trustworthily figured and described by
Fleming ("Archiv fur Mikros. Anat., vol. xiii), and may be readily
seen in Anodon by the method described above, or in Helix by merely
                                     "             "
spreading out a portion of the         mesentery      on a glass slip.
                         5. Distribution  of the Vesicles.
   These vesicles occur in Anodon wherever there is lamellar con
nective tissue, except in the very muscular tip and edge of the foot,
labial palpi and gills, Keber's organ, organ of Bojanus, mantle edge.
   In Helix, they are found especially on the lining of the great
lacunar spaces, and on the " mesenteries."
   They are especially associated with the arteries in all Molluscs I
have examined.      The brilliant whiteness of the slug's arterial system
is due to their presence in the connective tissue, outside the arteries.
   I have reasons for believing that these cells, or slight modifications
 of them, are very widely distributed throughout the Invertebrata.
                    6.  General Remarks and Conclusion.
   Although glycogen has frequently been stated to occur in Inverte
brates (e.g., by Professor Foster for Ascaris, and by Fredericq for
             I
Mya), yet believe that hitherto it has never been definitely localised in
certain cells, and far from being associated with connective tissue, has
been thought to be for the most part a liver product.             I  hope to be
able to publish further results in the above directions at a future time.

1885.]        Morphology of Phylloglossum Drummondii.                       445
    In  connexion     with the Mollusca certain points         seem   worthy of
special notice.
    In the first place, it is held by many comparative anatomists that the
lacunar system of Molluscs has a partly enterocoelous origin, or at
least has enterocoelous        elements in its nature.     If this be so, it is
interesting    to  note   that    some  cells of  the lacunar    walls may be
glycogenous, for glandular surfaces seem to be specially characteristic
of the ectoderm and endoderm.            Moreover, these cells are also to be
found on the mesenteries of Holothurians, which are undoubtedly
enterocoelous.
    In the second place, one of the greatest objections which can be
urged against the feasibility of water inception               by Molluscs is
removed, if (1) the specific gravity and (2) the nutritive quality of
the blood can be maintained in spite of the process.             It is supposed
that this would     be accomplished       by the discharge   of the contents of
the glycogenous     vesicles.
    Finally it is interesting to     note, that one of the functions of the
vertebrate liver seems      in  Molluscs  with ease to be performed outside
its domain, and this, moreover, in animals whose liver is essentially
a  digestive gland.
    In conclusion    I have to thank Professor Lankester and Professor
Foster, to whom, as also to Mr. Langley, Mr. Lea, and Mr. Gardiner,
I am very greatly indebted.

    The morphological history of Phylloglossum has up to the present
 time rested on a very slender basis.          The following brief summary
 given   by    Sachs    ("Textbook,"       2nd   English    Edition,   p.  463)

 practically comprises the whole of it : — A small Australian plant,
 only a few centimetres high.          It consists of a stem arising from a
 small tuber, and bearing at its lower part a rosette of a few long leaves,
 and one or more lateral roots ; it is prolonged above this as a thin
 scape, and terminates in a spike of small leaves bearing the sporangia.
 The plant is propagated by means of adventitious shoots, consisting
 of a tuber with a rudimentary leafless bud ;              in this respect it
 resembles our native Ophrydece."

for luxuriant vegetative development, seemed to promise a good deal
of interest.      Baron Ferdinand von Mueller, K.C.M.G., F.R.S., Govern
ment Botanist, Melbourne, with the unfailing energy which prompts
him to assist every kind of botanical work, after one or two attempts
succeeded in transmitting to the Royal Gardens, Kew, a parcel of
tubers in a living condition.        These were successfully grown for the
first time in Europe.        Their examination in the Jodrell Laboratory
has yielded the results now communicated to the Society.
   The mode of development depends to a certain extent upon the size
of the tuber: where the tuber is small only vegetative organs are
formed, where it is relatively large, the plant may form sporangia.
Taking first the simpler      case, it is found that outgrowths appear on
the broad apex of the tuber, which is before germination a simple,
smooth and rounded cone ; these outgrowths are leaves ; their number
may vary from one to six or seven. They are arranged in an
irregular whorl, of which the members on one side take precedence of
the rest in time of appearance ; they constitute in fact a " successive
whorl." From the first they are rounded at the apex, and have no
single apical cell.     The apex of the axis, which has a central position
at first, becomes gradually depressed, and is overarched by the
surrounding tissue ; it develops directly into the apex of the new
tuber, which is accordingly of exogenous origin, and represents in this
simpler case the actual apex of the parent plant.             By a peculiar
localisation of growth this apex becomes inverted, and by a process of
development very similar to that of the axillary shoot in certain
orchids    (e.g.,  Herminium monorchis), it projects laterally from the
parent plant.       Meanwhile an outgrowth appears on the opposite side
of the axis from that on which the tuber projects, and below the
insertion of the oldest leaf : this is the first root. It has been clearly
proved, by both external observation and by study of sections, that the
root in Phylloglossum is of exogenous origin.          Among other known
examples of this anomalous mode of root-development it is interesting
to note the root of the embryo of Isoetes.          In those cases where the
tuber is relatively large, sporangia are          formed  : these are, as is
already known, borne upon an elongated axis, which is the direct
product of the apex of the tuber.         A different origin is necessary in
this case for the tuber, and it has been found that the tuber originates
in such plants in an adventitious manner, as a depression at the base
of the sporangium-bearing           axis or peduncle : the details of its
development are otherwise similar in this case to that above
described.
   A   comparison      of both external    form, and as far as possible of
internal structure,      between Phylloglossum and the young plants of
Lycopodium cernuum described recently by Treub, shows many points
of striking similarity : this is so marked that the author draws the

following conclusion:   that, provided   the oophore    generation   of
Pltylh'glossum(which  has never yet been  observed) corresponds  in its
more important points to that of Lycopodium, we may regard
Phylloglossum as a form which retains and repeats in its sporophore
generation, the more prominent characteristics                       of the embryo as seen
in Lijcopodium cernuum : it is a permanently                         embryonic form of a

   The communication forms a continuation of some researches the
first part of which was published in Part I of the Transactions for
1884.    In that paper was considered the case of a circular hollow
with cyclic motion through it. In the present the more general case
is investigated where the core is of different density from the sur
rounding fluid, has a hollow inside            and circulations additional to
                                                it,
that due to the filaments of rotational fluid actually present. It does
not seem to have been generally noticed that even in the case of the
ring ordinarily considered, where the density of the core           the same      is
as that of the surrounding fluid, and there are no additional circula
tions, the full theory ought to take account of the existence of a
hollow, for when the energy of the motion (as was pointed out by the
author*)      increased beyond
              is                      certain point, depending on the circu

necessarily begin to form. As           itseems impossible to account for the
very  great  differences   in  the  masses   of the various elements on the
vortex theory of matter unless the cores are of different densities, the
investigation includes   the case where the density       arbitrary. As  is
soon as the existence  of  a core    postulated
                                           is   tho ring at once becomes
more complex, depending on the density (or even the distribution of
density) of its core, on its vorticity, and on the presence or absence of
additional circulations. The vorticity has been taken uniform this                     ;
not only greatly simplifies the mathematical methods, but      also the           is
case we should naturally   choose first to investigate. In the general

core.   It is evident that the presence of the former necessitates the

 perpetual existence of the hollow. It is shown that the presence                 of
 the latter is necessary to render the ring stable when its density                ia
 greater than that of the surrounding fluid.
     The investigation is divided into three sections. The first is pre
 liminary, and deals with the necessary functions and their approxi
 mate values. The second is devoted to the state of steady motion ; and
 the third to the small symmetrical vibrations and the question of
 stability.
     When the motion is steady the sectional centre* of the hollow lies
 outside that of the core. In general if Ci is its position when the
 inner additional circulation is very large, and C2 when the same quan
 tity is zero, Ci is outside of C2, and the position of C when the addi
 tional circulation is anything else is the centre of gravity of masses
 proportional to the added circulation at 0|, and the circulation due to
 the core itself at C2.         When the hollow is just zero the distance of
 Ci   from  the  sectional   centre   of the core bears to the sectional radius
 the ratio 5r/8a where r is the sectional radius and a the aperture radius.
 This therefore is the point where the hollow begins to form when the
 energy is sufficiently increased.          If with the same outer boundary the
 mass of the core be lessened (or size of hollow increased), both Ci and
 C2 move in, and ultimately coincide with the centre of the outer
section.
     So long as the core is only doubly continuous the volume is constant,
and therefore the sectional radius varies inversely as the square root
 of the aperture radius.         When there is no core it was shown in the
 former paper that the sectional radius of the hollow remained constant.
 In the general case, after a hollow is formed, the sectional radius of
the core changes more slowly, and the additional circulations add to
this tendency.         The outer section always decreases as the aperture
 increases, but when the hollow becomes large this decrease is small,
and the sectional radius of the core remains almost constant. The
sectional radins of the hollow, however, increases with the aperture
when the hollow is small, but decreases beyond a certain critical value.
The expansibility of the ring, due to the presence of a hollow, has a
marked effect on the variation of the velocity of translation with
increasing aperture, the tendency being to make the variation smaller.
With an internal additional circulation the ring will possess internal
energy comparable with that of the external fluid. It will, however,
decrease as the whole energy is increased.                The fluted vibrations in
general     consist   of two    pairs,   those  of one   pair travelling with the
cyclic motion, and the other against, the mode being determined by
the number of flutings. For a simply continuous core there are two
times of vibration for each order ; for a hollow core without internal

    When there is no rotational core the motion is always stable. When
 there is a doubly continuous core whose density is greater than that of
 the surrounding fluid there must in general be an additional outer
 circulation to render the ring stable. After a hollow is formed the
 simple ring usually treated of is still stable. But if the core is denser
 than the surrounding fluid, it is always stable only if the outer addi
 tional circulation is larger than a certain critical value, depending on
 the densities and the circulations.         If it is less than this critical value,
 the ring becomes unstable at some point as the aperture increases.

        coccus in the Dog from the Echinococci of Man.'- By John

        T. S. Cobbold, M.D., F.R.S. Received June 8, 1885.
    The cystic parasite, Echinococcus, is known to occur under four
forms, viz., as —
                        1.  The Acephalocystic form.
                        2. Echinococcus      scolicipariens.
                        3.          „         altricipariens.
                        4.          „        multilocularis.
     As regards the Acephalocystic form first described in 1804 by
 Laennec, it is now generally regarded as a sterile variety in which
 either no brood-capsules        and scolices have been formed, or in which
 such    structures   have once       been present, but have degenerated and
 disappeared.
     Echinococcus multilocularis is believed to owe its peculiar characters
 to the fact that it has developed, within tubular structures, e.g., the
  lymphatic canals (Virchow), the blood-vessels               (Leuckart), or the
  biliary canals (Schroder van der Kolk, Friedreich, and Morin).
     It is not probable that this unusual growth is connected in any way
 with the biliary canals, because it has been found not only in the
 liver but also in the lungs and peritoneum.
     Echinococcus scolicipariens       and Echinococcus veterinorum were long
  regarded as    distinct  species.     Their distinctive characters being —
     (a.) A   marked    difference     in the mode of proliferation.       In Echi

 whilst in Ech. altricipariens        a  more or less numerous         progeny      of
 daughter cysts is present. Within these, grand-daughter cysts, enclos
 ing a third generation, may be found.
     (6.) Kiichenmeister alleged that the Echinococcus heads in these
 two forms, differ in the number, shape, and size of the booklets.
 According to him Ech. scolicipariens has twenty-eight to thirty-six
 booklets of somewhat blunt shape, whilst Ech. altricipariens possesses
 between forty -six and fifty-six of more slender figure and smaller size.
     (c.) The habitat of the two forms is different, Ech. scolicipariens
 occupying the viscera of the domestic Herbivora, whence it was also
 called Ech. veterinorum, Ech. altricipariens, named also Ech. homimi,
 being the form found in man.
     It is, however, very doubtful whether any of these differences can be
 regarded as specific, for great variations occur in the number of
 daughter-cysts present in Ech. altricipariens, e.g., there may be only
 one or two small cysts, or they may be reckoned by thousands.
 Again, as regards the characters of the booklets, Rudolph Leuckart
 points out that considerable variety prevails in different individuals of
 the same species, dependent partly upon the age of the bearer, but
also in part upon the circumstance that the shape, arrangement, and
 size of the hooklets are liable to considerable diversity.
    Finally, Ech. scolicipariens and Ech. altricipariens may be found
 together in the same
                          " host."
    Obviously, the question of the identity or otherwise of these forms
could only be satisfactorily proved by experiment.              If the scolices of
each    form   produced   the same    cestoid   worm,   no  further   doubt could
remain as to the specific unity of the two varieties.
    At this stage it is necessary briefly to allude to the evidence upon
which our knowledge of the life-cycle of Ech. veterinorum depends.
    Shortly after Kiichenmeister had initiated his helminthological
 " Feeding Experiments " with
                                      Cysticercus pisiformis, Coanurus, &c.,
experiments were made to discover the cestoid form of Echinococcus
veterinorum.
    In    1852  von Siebold,* by a series of successful feedings demon
strated     that the tapeworm phase of Echinococcus was the small
cestoid worm, now known as Taenia echinococcus.
    The experiments of von Siebold were successfully repeated by
Kiichenmeister and others, and a very successful experiment was
also made by Mr. Edward Nettleship, in 1866, an account of which
was communicated to the Royal Society .f

    In all    these    cases, however, the dogs were fed with Echinococci
obtained       from     the lower animals (Bchinococcus veterinorum). As
many able zoologists believed that there were two or more species of
Echinococcus, it became a matter of considerable scientific interest,
and      indeed of great practical hygienic importance, to determine
whether this really were so or not.
    Both KUchcumeister and Zenker endeavoured to breed the adult
tapeworm from Echinococci derived from man, but without success.
    In 1863, however, Krabbe and Finsen in Iceland, as well as Naunyn
at Berlin, succeeded in breeding Taenia echinococcus from the hydatids
of man, but for reasons to be mentioned hereafter, their experiments
can scarcely be regarded as decisive.
     In order that experiments of this kind may be considered as satis
factory, certain conditions must be fulfilled.            It is necessary —
    1. To employ animals which could not be suspected of having been
infected prior to the time of experiment, or to take steps to remove
any entozoa that might be present, by the previous administration of
suitable vermifuges.
    2. To place the animals under circumstances in which it would be
 impossible for them to acquire infection from any accidental source.
     3. To feed them with the living Echinococci of man.
     4.   To ensure complete success it is necessary not only that the
 tapeworm should be found in the intestine of the dog, but also that
 it should be found in numbers proportionate to the number of Echino
 coccus heads administered,            and, moreover, the stage of development
 reached by the tapeworms should correspond with the date of the
                     " feeding."
 experimental
     5. No kinds of tapeworms should be present excepting such as can
  be satisfactorily accounted for.
     Judged by this standard, neither the experiments of Krabbe nor
  those of    Naunyn can be regarded as decisive.
     Six separate experiments were performed by Krabbe* and Finsen,
  the number of dogs employed being nine.
     Experiments Nos. 2, 3, and 5 were entirely unsuccessful, no speci
  men of Taenia echinococcus being found in the dogs.                  These experi
  ments included       four out of the total number of nine dogs observed.
     Experiment No. 1. — In the autumn of 1862 M. Finsen sent to M.
  Krabbe a glass containing Taeniae found by him in the intestines of a
  young dog, to which some months previously he had administered
  Echinococci obtained from a patient operated on by Recamier's
  method.
      These Taeniae     were chiefly specimens of Taenia cucumeriua, but there
   was  found also one mature joint of Teenia echinococcus.

    This   case is not     entirely satisfactory, since no mention is made of
any precautions having been taken to prevent infection of the dog in
question, from other sources than the experimental feeding, and as
dogs in Iceland are very frequently infested with Taenia echinococcus*
the experiment cannot be regarded as decisive.                 Besides, the feeding
took place some months previously, and as the sojourn of Taenia echi
nococcus in the intestine of the dog is believed not to exceed about
two months, this renders the experiment still less conclusive.
    Experiment No. 4 was by far the most successful one performed by
MM. Krabbe and Finsen. On this occasion two dogs, which had been
kept under close surveillance by M. Finsen since they had ceased
suckling, were fed with the Echinococci of man upon two separate
occasions at an interval of a month.               Three months after the second
feeding, they      were   examined.       One gave a negative result ; the other
contained a moderately large number of Taenia echinococcus and
four examples of Taenia canis lagopodis.f                 This experiment would
 be a very satisfactory one, if the presence of Taenia canis lagopodis
could be accounted for ; but failing this, some doubt must exist as to
whether some accidental infection had taken place or not.
     Experiment No. 6. — Two dogs were fed : one yielded a negative
result.      In the other there were found four specimens of Taenia
echinococcus, in company with four hundred of Taenia canis lago
 podis.     The remarks made upon Experiment No. 4 apply with greater
 force to this observation.          It will thus be seen that out of nine dogs
 experimented upon only three yielded any specimens of Taenia
 echinococcus.        In one of these only one mature point was found ; in
 another only four examples of Taenia echinococcus to one hundred
 times as many of Taenia canis lagopodis.
     Naunyn's experiments were performed in Berlin in 1863.              J
     He administered to two dogs the contents of a hydatid of the liver
 which contained Echinococcus heads, and which had been obtained
 from     a woman     operated upon by puncture of the cyst.               One of the
 dogs, which was examined twenty-eight days subsequently, contained
 no intestinal worms; but in the second one Naunyn found, on the
 thirty-fifth day after the feeding, examples of Taenia echinococcus
 from one to      one and a   half lines in length.       The chief drawbacks       to

     t Erabbe found this parasite in more than one-fifth of all the Icelandic dogs
  (over 100 of all ages) examined by him. It seems to be a peculiar species, whose
  genetic history is not yet known.   Krabbe and Cobbold regard it as identical with
  the Taenia litterata of Batsch.    Be that as it may, its frequent presence in Ice
 landic dogs seriously vitiates the results of the experimental feedings of M. Krabbe.

                             The Author'   s   Experiments.
  On 25th June,         1883,   I purchased     four puppies, which were said to
be a cross between               and a mastiff.
                             a bloodhound       At the time they
came into my possession they were seven weeks old, and up to that
moment they had never left a small enclosed yard, in which their
mother was chained.   Beyond the maternal milk, they had received
no food, except cooked scraps from the kitchen of their owner, and
indeed very little of anything except their mother's milk.
   On the evening of June 25th they were enclosed in a recently
disused   powder magazine, situated on the North Park Lands,.
Adelaide.    The magazine in question is now the property of the
University of Adelaide, and its use for the purpose of these expe
riments was kindly granted to me by the Council of the University.
   During the seclusion of the dogs, they received only cooked food
from my own kitchen, and rain water collected from the roof of the
magazine, and stored in a new tank within the magazine enclosure.
   The animals remained in good health and grew rapidly.
   Experiment No. 1. — On July 5th I aspirated a hydatid tumour
situated in the epigastrium of a woman, who was then a patient
under my care in the Adelaide Hospital.
   Two ounces of nearly clear hydatid fluid were removed, and as I
thought   I   could see with the naked eye a few groups of scolices
floating  in the fluid, I administered    mixed with milk, to one of the

dogs.    The feeding took place about two hours after the fluid was
removed from the human body.           The dog continued in good health,
and was killed by prussic acid on August 5th, i.e., on the 31st day
after the feeding.      No tapeworms were found, but several ascarides
were present in the small intestine.
  This experiment was therefore quite negative in its results but as       ;
the patient had been some years previously operated on for the same
hydatid, and as consequently        very doubtful whether any living

was found to have a   hydatid cyst on the upper surface of the liver,
which was aspirated by me on October 16th, 1883.      Twelve ounces
of perfectly normal hydatid fluid were removed.   Upon microscopic
examination, a considerable number of scolices, mostly collected into
groups, were found.
                                                                   2   K   2

    The fluid was allowed to stand in a decantation glass, protected
from du8t by a glass shade, for a couple of hours, and the bulk of the
supernatant fluid was then poured off.        Three and a half hours after
its removal from the man, about half the residue, containing many
groups of scolices, was poured down the throat of one of the dogs ;
most of it seemed to be swallowed, but some was coughed up.               Milk
was   then   poured    down   the  dog's throat,  and  afterwards   a  further
quantity of milk was supplied in a vessel ; this was readily lapped by
the animal.
    On the next day, October 17th (about sixteen hours after the fluid
was obtained), most of the remaining scolices were administered,
being poured down the throat of the dog in about an ounce of their
native fluid.         before, a supply of milk followed, this time with the
addition of breadsops.        Twenty-nine hours after the removal of the
hydatid   fluid,  I examined   some of the contained scolices, and found a
considerable portion of them alive and moving actively on the hot
stage (temp. 100° F.).          On November 18th (thirty -two days after
the feeding) the dog was killed with chloroform, and the small intes
tine and stomach were carefully examined by Dr. Whittell and
myself.      No appearance of Taenia echinococcus could be recognised
on the lining of the intestine, but a great number of Taenia camu-
merina were noticed, partly in the lower portions of the upper half of
the small intestine, and in greater numbers in the lower half. No
round worms could be found.             The lining membrane was washed
 with warm     water,  and  the  washings were then carefully examined.
    In the washings of the upper half we found        about 100 specimens of
 Taenia  echinococcus,   out of which about eighty complete worms were
 collected ; many terminal points also were seen.         In the washings of
 the lower half of the bowel,     I found six complete specimens.        These
 Taenia  were    evidently uuripe,   and none  of  them  showed   four points,
 or indeed proglottides containing ripe hard- shelled eggs.           Many of
 them had three segments, including the bead, but not a few consisted
 only of a head, unsegmented neck, and one terminal proglottis.
    In the terminal joint, the cirrus, cirrus-sac, and coiled     vas deferens
 were seen, and in some cases faint indications of egg-formation.          The
 head showed the usual suckers and rostellum, and in several cases a
 double circlet of hooklets.
    The worms varied from about -rV to ^ inch (one to one and a half
 lines) in length, and were so fragile that a portion of the brood,
 carried carefully in a bottle containing camphor water for a distance
 of a few miles, were found by Dr. Whittell to be, without a single
 exception, broken into separate segments.
    The circlets of hooks were usually absent or incomplete, probably
 in consequence of mechanical injury, but in one instance a complete
 crown was found.

appear to be from thirty-five to forty in number.

this period, the experiment cannot be regarded as vitiated.      Besides
the short space of time (four days) that intervened between the tem
porary escape of the dog and its examination, renders       certain that

 the specimens of Taenia echinococcus found were the result of the
experimental feeding thirty-two days before.

mother.

pital on the afternoon of the previous day. A further "feeding"
from the same source was administered on the morning of the 17th.

Living scolices were found present in a portion of this feeding ten
hours after the rest had been given to the dog. On December 10,
1883, Dr. Dunlop, of the Adelaide Hospital, supplied me with about
8 ounces of nearly clear hydatid fluid containing a great number of
scolices.  The fluid had been obtained from two hydatids occupying
the pelvis of a woman who had died on December 9th.         considerA
able dose of the scolices mixed with milk was given to the same dog
twenty-five and a half hours after the decease of the patient.    This
"feeding" contained some living scolices, but the majority of those
examined upon the hot stage exhibited no movement when warmed,
and hence were probably dead. On December 30th, forty-four days
after the first feeding, and twenty days after the second dose of scolice?,
the small intestine of this dog was examined by Dr. Whittell and
myself. Contrary to expectation, we found no ripe Taenia echinococ
cus but after a patient examination we found one complete, but
     ;
juvenile specimen of this worm, and the terminal joints of seven
others.  These were quite young, being very small (about one- twelfth
inch when complete), and extremely fragile. However, the specimens
 showed plain indications of the generative organs, bnt no distinct

of  the  second   feeding, so that they were twenty days old.            The only
complete worm found had three distinct joints (including the head),
but it had lost its hooklets, probably from the endosmosis of water.
   It is likely that in the  case   of both " feedings " most of the scolices
were either dead or dying, for the fluid in which they were contained
showed signs of commencing decomposition.                This probably accounts
for the small number of Taeniae found in the dog. Besides the speci
mens of Taenia echinococcus, there were some hundreds                   of Taenia
cucumerina, and one small ascaris in the small intestine.
   Experiment No. 4. — In this case         I thought it advisable to vary the
mode    of  experiment,  and   to  administer     a vermifuge to the dog prior
to the experimental feeding.         As  I  could not recall a single instance
in which I had found Taenia cucumerina absent from the intestines
of the stray dogs examined by me in Adelaide, it appeared to me that
the absence    of   this worm in      a dog,     after the administration of a
vermifuge, would be good presumptive            evidence that all other entozoa
had been also removed by the medicine.
   A  male black and tan terrier which had been in my possession for
three or four weeks, enclosed in the powder magazine, received on
May 27, 1884, 30 grains of kamala in milk, and two days later a
second similar dose was administered.              On June 1st the dog seemed
to be well, and a dose of echinococcus heads (procured by puncture of
a hydatid cyst of the right lung in one of my patients) was ad
ministered in a little milk.
   On July 13th, forty-two days after the feeding, the dog was poisoned
with prussic acid and examined.
   The small intestine contained semi-fluid brown matter apparently
                  " than
more " bilious             usual, and the lower end of the small intestine
was unusually red, and apparently congested.
                             I
   After a careful search found one specimen of Taenia echinococcus ;
it was quite perfect, and when first examined, it showed a contraction
at the neck, apparently having a head, a short neck, and three suc
ceeding segments.       The contraction in the neck shortly disappeared,
and when mounted in glycerine and stained with picro-carmine, the
worm contracted greatly, especially in length.              Faint indications of
ovum-formation were visible in the posterior segment.
   A drawing    of this specimen was made by Dr. Dunlop immediately
after its removal from the dog's intestine.
   A very close examination of this dog's intestine was made, and
there were found a few very small and evidently juvenile round worms,
and the heads and necks of many Taeniae cucumerina.                  These young
tapeworms rarely      exceeded    a quarter   of   an  inch  in length, and none
were found over one-third of an inch long.               There was not a single
worm with distinct proglottides.

     It  seemed clear to me that all the entozoa present were bred after
the effect of the doses of kamala had passed away, and consequently
that the specimen of Taeniae echinococcus was forty-two days old, and
the product of the experimental        " feeding."
                                  Summary.
     In   three out of the four dogs experimented upon, Taenia echinococ
cus was       found, and in the unsuccessful case it is doubtful whether
living     scolices were given to the dog.
     The dogs were examined at various periods after the feedings, viz.,
20, 32, 42 days, and the Taeniae found corresponded      in stage of develop
ment with the interval of time that had elapsed since the feeding.
     I am indebted to Dr. Dunlop. of the Adelaide Hospital, for the
 drawings of the Taeniae bred in the experiments recorded, and also for
 the illustrations of ripe Tsenias procured from stray dogs, examined by
 me    in Adelaide.
 XIII. "Note         upon the frequent Occurrence of Taenia Echino
         coccus in the Domestic Dog in certain parts of Australia."
          By John Davies Thomas, M.D. (Lond.), F.R.C.S. (Eng.),
          lately Physician to the Adelaide Hospital and Member of
          the Council of the University of Adelaide.         Communicated
          by T. S. Cobbold, M.D., F.R.S. Received June 4, 1885.
      From the well-known prevalence of hyatid disease (both in man
  and the domestic       herbivora) in certain parts of the Australian con
  tinent, it might naturally be expected that Taenia Echinococcus should
  be often found in the domestic dogs of these parts, but as far as I
  know, no investigation had been made by any observer with a view to
  the determination of the point in question.
      Accordingly, towards the close of the year 1882,      I commenced an
  inquiry into the matter, and although I have been prevented by the
  claims of my daily professional duties from an exhaustive investigation
   of the point, yet the facts already ascertained fully account for the
   very serious prevalence of hyatid disease in the localities where
   investigation has been made.
      Dogs were examined at the following places in South Australia : —
       1. In the city of Adelaide ; 2. At Mount Gambier ; 3. At Millicent    ;
   4.   At Penola.
       The three last-named places are situated in the south-eastern district
   of the province, which is the most highly infected part of Australia as
    regards   hyatid disease.

 458            Taenia Echinococcus       in  the Domestic  Dog.     [June  18,
     In all four places Tcenia    Echinococcus was found in the stray dogs
 captured by the police.
     1. Adelaide. — In the first instance, twenty dogs were examined here.
  Tcenia Echinococcus was fonnd in nine, and in numbers varying from a
 few specimens up to many thousands. (Microscopic specimens of some
 of these accompany this paper.)
     2. Mount Gambier. — Five dogs were examined         here on December 7,
 1882.    Two  contained   numerous    examples of Tcenia Echinococcus.
    3. Millicent. — Out of four dogs examined, one contained               this
 parasite.
    4. Penola. — The single dog examined at this place had thousands of
 specimens of Tcenia Echinococcus in its small intestine.
    Including all the dogs examined          in 1882 (thirty in number) no
fewer   than  40 per cent. were  infested  by  this dangerous tapeworm.
    However it should be stated that nine dogs have been examined by
 me more recently, and that in only one of these could           I find Tcenia
 Echinococcus.    This series of dogs differed from the former one in
 some respects.      The first group of dogs consisted of vagrant and
ownerless animals that must have picked up their living largely from
slaughter-bouses, butchers' shops, and offal heaps. These naturally
would have many opportunities of eating the viscera of slaughtered
animals, cast aside as unfit for sale.          When the second series was
 procured, a very energetic raid against uuregistered dogs had been
 made by the police for several months, consequently many of the dogs
of this group had owners, by whom they were fed, but who were
unwilling to pay the registration fee required by law.
    In Melbourne. — Ten stray dogs collected in the town of Hotham
 (which is really a part of Melbourne) were examined on January 15th
and 16th, 1883. Five of them contained Tcenia Echinococcus in greater
or less number.      These observations show a very alarming prevalence
of this dangerous parasite in the places where inquiry into the matter
has been made, and fully explain the frequency of the cystic form
 (hyatid) both in man and the domestic herbivora of these localities.
    In connexion with this subject, it may be mentioned that, according
to Cobbold, this tapeworm has never been seen in any English dog
which had not previously been experimentally infected.
    Even in Iceland only 28 per cent. of the dogs examined by Krabbe
 were found to contain this tapeworm.

         Earthworm."     By Frank E. Beddard, M.A., F.R.S. (Ed.,)
         Prosector to the Zoological Society. Communicated by
         Professor E. Ray Lankester, M.A., LL.D., F.R.S. Received
         May        19, 1885.
  The specimens upon which the following observations are based
I owe to the kindness of Prof. T. Jeffrey Parker, of Otago Uni
versity ; I received from him a large number of examples of an earth
worm which appears to belong to Perrier's genus, Acanthodrilus*
though differing from any of the species of that genus as yet described.
In the present paper I do not intend to describe the general anatomy
of this worm, but to refer merely to the disposition of the " segmental
        " or
organs        nephridia, which present certain interesting peculiarities
which have not, to my knowledge, been recorded in any other earth
worm.
   Each of the segments of the body in this species, instead of pos
sessing only a single pair of nephridia, is furnished with four pairs,
a single nephridium corresponding     to each of the eight setae ; the
setae are not disposed in four series of pairs as in Lumbricus, but in
eight longitudinal rows of a single seta, each separated by nearly
equal        intervals. Cn making a dissection of
                                              a large example (12 inches
in length)           it was quite
                           easy to observe the two nephridia of the dor-
sally placed pair of setae, and to trace by help of a lens the duct which
perforates the body-wall in the immediate neighbourhood of the setae ;
each of these nephridia appeared to be quite distinct from its neigh
bour     ;    the nephridia belonging to each of the ventrally placed pair of
setae,       on the other hand, form a continuous mass closely adherent to
the intersegmental   septum.
   On        making     of transverse sections the appearances observed
                       a series
 by a naked-eye inspection were confirmed ; a nephridial tube per
 forates the body-wall and opens on to the exterior in the neighbour
 hood of each of the eight setae. In every case the nephridium passes up
 close       to the seta and is imbedded in the loose connective tissue which
 tills up the gap       in the longitudinal muscular coat partly occupied by
 the setaand its special muscles.     At the junction of the longitudinal
 and the  outer, circular, muscular coat the tube bends at right angles
 and passes in a direction parallel to the fibres of the circular coat, but
 below        it,
           t.e., between the two muscular coats; this portion of the
 nephridial tube      considerably longer in the case of the extreme
                          is
 dorsal nephridium — about three times as long. The tube then passes
 in an oblique direction through the circular coat and opens on to the
                               •   " Nouv. Arch. d. Museum,"   t.   viii.

  xterior by   a very minute orifice.     Although the orifice is so small its
presence    is  readily detected   by the   alteration in the character of the
epidermic cells ; the large, oval, glandular cells entirely disappear,
and the narrow columnar cells become more closely packed together,
and bend over towards each other on either side of the orifice, pre
cisely as at the points where the setae protrude on to the exterior of
the body. The whole of the nephridium appears to be composed of a
variously coiled tubule consisting of rows of cells placed end to end
and perforated by the duct, as Claparede has described in Lumbricus ;
in the present species, however, unlike what is found in Lumbricus, the
terminal portion of the nephridium does not differ at all from the rest,
except at the extreme distal end, where it appears that the lumen
ceases to be intracellular.      This section of the tubule, which is very
slightly  wider   than   the rest, is surrounded by a flattened epithelium
consisting of very small cells, and appears to be lined by a continua
tion of the chitinous cuticle which covers the exterior of the body ;
this last fact, however, I am unable to state with certainty, though it
is probable for other reasons.            I have observed the appearances
described above in a very large number of sections taken from dif
ferent regions of the body.
   I propose at some future time to publish a fuller description, ac
companied by figures, of these facts, which have some bearing upon the
morphology of the Annelida.
   It was supposed for a long time that only a single pair of nephridia
were to be found in each segment of the segmented worms.
Dr. Eisig,* however, found that in certain Polychaetous Aunelids
belonging to the family Capitellidae, there were frequently four, five,
or even six pairs of nephridia in many of the segments of the body,
and that the number of pairs increased from before backwards.               In
tbe present paper       I  have been able to extend Dr. Eisig's discovery
to the Oligochaeta, though the relation between the disposition of
the nephridia in the two groups is not at all a close one.
   In the Capitellidffi the nephridia of each segment are deposed in
an oblique line passing from near the ventral parapodium of each
side to near the nerve cord ; their orifices, which, as in most Poly-
chaeta, are placed upon the summit of a tubercule, are grouped
together in an irregular fashion near to the parapodium ; moreover,
the young Capitellidae possess a larval series of nephridia — one to each
 segment — which are replaced by the nephridia of the adult.             It is,
therefore, a matter of great difficulty to institute a strict comparison
between the nephridia of the adult Capitellidae and those of Acantho-
drilus;   I  can only call attention to the general fact that the Oligo-
chceta,  like   the Polychceta, may possess        more  than a single pair of
nephridia in each segment.

1885.]          Nephridia of a New Species          of Earthworm.              461
    A  discussion of certain other questions in the morphology of earth
worms, naturally arises out of the foregoing facts.                Professor Lai i-
kester, iu a memoir upon the anatomy of Lumbricus* called attention
to the fact that there is a constant and definite relation between the
nephridial aperture on the one hand, and the apertures of the genital
ducts on the other hand, to the setae ; the nephridia open close to the
ventral pair of setae, the genital ducts and copulatory pouches have a
similar relation     to the dorsal        pair.     Claparede had previously
expressed the opinion that in the Limicolons Oligochaeta, the ducts of
the genital system were the modified representatives                  of the ne
phridia, basing this opinion on the general similarity of structure and
position, and more especially upon the fact that nephridia are absent
in those segments of the body which contain the genital ducts ; he
denied, however, that this comparison could be applied in the case of
earthworms, since here the genital ducts coexist in the same segments
with nephridia. Professor Lankester, in the paper just referred to,
pointed out that Claparede's views could be extended to earthworms,
if it were admitted       that each segment of the body were typically
furnished with two pairs of nephridia, one corresponding to each of
 the pairs of setae.     Professor Lankester supposed that in Lumbricus
the copulatory pouches and genital ducts were the modified repre
 sentatives  of the second series of nephridia, which had disappeared
 elsewhere than in the genital segments.          Certain facts in the anatomy
 of other genera of earthworms, made known by the researches of
 M. Perrier, appeared to lend very strong support to this hypothesis.
 M.   Perrierf has described certain earthworms (Acanthodrilus, 8fc.)
 which agree with Lumbricus in that the nephridia open on to the
 exterior of the body by the ventral seta3 ; in others again (e.g.
 Anteus, Rhinodrilus) the nephridia are related to the dorsal pair of
 setae;  finally, in Plutellus,% there is an actual alternation in the
 position of the nephridial orifices, in some segments they open near
 to one of the dorsal pair of setae, in others near to one of the ventral
 pair. All these facts seem to be best explained by supposing the typical
 presence of two series of nephridia, a dorsal and a ventral, one or
 other of which has partially or entirely disappeared ; in Lumbricus
 the dorsal series has disappeared, in Anteus the ventral series ; while
 in Plutellus, both dorsal and ventral series have partly persisted.
  Although this hypothesis serves to explain the series of facts which
  have been briefly stated above, M. Perrier has come to the conclu
  sion that it cannot be adopted in the way that Lankester has sug
  gested, inasmuch as there are reasons for disbelieving                   in any
  homology between the nephridia and genital ducts.              If the orifices of

4C2                     Mr. F. E. Beddard.        On the                [June  18,
the nephridia were always constant to a series of seta different from
that to which the orifices of the genital ducts belong — as in the case
of Lumbricus — then it would be permissible to retain the hypothesis of
two series of nephridia.      Such, however, is not the case ; in Urochaia
and in Plutellus, the orifices of the copulatory pouches coincide at
the same seta as the orifices of the nephridia ; and it also difficult to
explain the fact that the vasa deferentia traverse several segments,
all furnished with distinct nephridia, on their way to the exterior.
    It appears to me that the coincidence of nephridium and copulatory
pouch at the same series of setae is not a serious objection to Professor
Lankester's hypothesis.       It is extremely possible that the copulatory
pouch may be      the  equivalent of a diverticulum of the duct of the
nephridium ; such diverticula I have myself described in a large
earthworm (Microchceta) from the Cape Colony in a paper read before
the Zoological Society, and they exist elsewhere. In Mierochmta there
are no proper copulatory pouches ; these structures appear to be
functionally replaced in four segments of the body by several extremely
minute caecal pouches placed in the immediate neighbourhood of the
 nephridium of their segments. M. Perrier* has described in a species
 of Prrichceta similar accessory pouches having a precisely similar
relation to the copulatory pouches ; and in my paper                I  have called
 attention to the great resemblance between the copulatory pouch of
 this Perichmta with its independent accessory pouches, and the
 nephridium of Hicrochceta with its large muscular diverticulum and
 the series of similar cecal pouches. I have also illustrated the com
 parison by figures, which will be shortly published.
    Whatever may be the value of M. Perrier's criticisms of Professor
 Lankester's hypothesis, it is quite clear now that there is no intrinsic
 improbability in this hypothesis.        The new facts that have been
 brought forward in the present paper also serve to render intelligible
 certain other facts in the morphology of earthworms.
     In his earliest paper on the anatomy of earthworms, M. Perrier
 adopted the hypothesis of two series of nephridia, one corresponding
 to each pair of seta in those earthworms that are furnished with four
 pairs.   In Lumbricus the two seta of each pair are closely approxi
 mated, but in many other earthworms, as in the Acanthodrilus, which
 forms the subject of the present communication, the two seta of each
 pair become widely separated, so that there are eight longitudinal
  series of a single seta each ; in these cases it is important to know
  what becomes of the nephridial orifice ; has it, in fact, any definite
  relation to one or other of the two seta of the pair ? M. Perrier has
  addressed himself to this question, and has recorded the fact that in
  Anteut, Rhinodrilus,     and Moniligaster,    where the ventral series of
  nephridia are alone present, their orifices are situated close to the
                 •  "Nouy. Arch. d. Museum," t. viii, PI. IV, fig. 72.

outermost of the two setae which compose the pair ; in the genus
Titanus, where the nephridial orifices are dorsal in position, they open
close to the outermost of the two dorsal nephridia. There thus appears
to be a constant relation between the nephridial apertures of both the
dorsal and ventral series to the outermost seta of each pair. His
investigations into the anatomy of Plutellus led M. Perrier to abandon
this position.      In Plutellus the setae are arranged, as in the genera just
referred to, in eight longitudinal rows, and it has been already stated
that the nephridia themselves alternate from segment to segment,
sometimes opening by one of the dorsal, at other times by one of the
ventral setae ; there is, however, no constancy to any one in particular
of the two set® which compose the pair; occasionally the nephridial
orifice will be found close to the outermost, and occasionally close to
 the innermost,      of the two setae of its pair.      These facts are clearly
 not explicable by assuming the typical presence of two series of
 nephridia in earthworms,           but they become perfectly clear and
 intelligible in the light of the facts that         I have been able to bring
 forward in the present paper ; in Plutellus there are the remains not
 only of two series of nephridia, but of four, each corresponding to one
 of the four rows of setae of each half of the body.
     We are therefore now in a position to extend Professor Lankester's
 hypothesis, and to assume that        to each seta, and not to each pair of setm,
  corresponds    a separate nephridium.       No doubt Professor Lankester's
  hypothesis    is correct  so far as it  goes ; it is very probable that when
  the two setae of each pair come to be placed close together, one of the
  two    nephridia disappears.
      Another question raised by the foregoing facts concerns the
  general problems relating to the distribution of the setae in earth
  worms ; are we to regard the presence of four series of pairs of setae
  as typical for earthworms, or is it possible that this condition has
  been arrived at by a process of reduction, the primitive condition
  being a complete ring of setae round each segment, as is actually
  f jund in Perichceta ?
      There are a good many facts which appear to support the former
   alternative; (1) the undoubtedly close resemblance between the two
   pairs of setae of an earthworm, and the dorsal and ventral parapodia
   of a Polychaetous worm ; (2) the fact that in the young Perichceta the
   setae  are by no means so numerous as in the adult; we owe this
   observation to M. Perrier, but unfortunately he has not recorded the
   exact number of setae, and whether there was any real approximation
   to the  quadriserial disposition.
       Other facts point to the latter alternative.        In JJrochmta the setae
   are disposed in eight longitudinal rows, but in the posterior part of
   the body the setae do not exactly correspond in position in a series of
    segments;    there is in fact a quincuncial arrangement; in the interval

between the       setae  of  a given     segment are certain peculiar bodies
having the appearance          of  unicellular glands, and surrounded by an
inward prolongation of the cuticle.               Quite similar structures have
been met with by Vejdovsky in Anachceta* and in this worm they
replace the setae ; there is therefore evidently some reason for supposing
that    Urochceta   has descended from ancestors in which there was                 a
complete row of setae round each segment.
    M. Perrier is of opinion that the quadriserial           arrangement referable
to the parapodia of the Polychaetous worm is the primitive arrange
ment, and that the condition found in Periehmta may have been
arrived at, first, by a separation of the setae of each pair, and
secondly,     by the development of the secondary setae ("soies de
r emplacement"'), which might get to be placed alongside of the
primary setae and form new primary setae.
    It appears to me just as legitimate to suppose a process of reduction
from a more generalised condition, and there is strong evidence that
this has taken place in Urochceta, and that the resemblance between the
more common          disposition of the setae and the parapodia of the
Polychaetous      worm is due to adaptive rather than to any genetic
causes.
    Such    an hypothesis would fit in very well with the new facts
recorded in the present paper, for          I have been able to show that there
is no connexion between the pair of setaef and the nephridium, us
between the parapodium and nephridium in the Polychaeta, and that
therefore, in so far as these facts have weight, the dorsal and ventral

   t It is worth recording the fact that in a species of Acanthodriltu, also from
New Zealand, where the setee are paired the nephridial orifice is not placed indefi
nitely in front of the pair, but has a distinct relation to one of the two sets.

    Anatomists who have written concerning the arteries of the abdo
men and their relations to the peritoneum                display considerable
divergence of opinion.        This want of uniformity may perhaps be due
to the fact, that owing to the complications        of the serous membrane
it is hard to trace the course of the vessels without seriously disturbing
their relations.     Another and most important reason is, that       so  far as
I  am aware, no methodical       attempt   has been made to elucidate them
upon developmental grounds.           The importance of such an endeavour,
in this     case, is made clear      by a moment's consideration.       If the
alimentary     tract of  one  of  the  lower vertebrates  be  examined   a very
simple arrangement may be found ; most probably a straight bowel
suspended by a simple mesentery.           Along the spinal attachment of
this serous fold a large blood-vessel extends, and branches descend
from it to supply the bowel. When such a scheme as this is compared
with that which obtains in the human subject, it is evident that many
complicated changes have taken place, and it will be found that the
vascular supply of the abdominal organs participates in every
change they undergo.         In this paper it is proposed to consider the
various events which occur, and their effects upon the course of the
arteries.
    It seems unnecessary to state that so far as alterations in the shape
and position of the various portions of the alimentary canal are con
cerned, there is hardly any difference of opinion; they are well known
and have been frequently described.            The abdominal blood-vessels
and the serous membrane have attracted less attention.
    As a preliminary, it may be stated that as the development of the
intestines and their appendages, the liver, pancreas, and spleen, has
such an important influence upon the arteries, it will be necessary to
refer to them at some length.
    Owing to the difficulty of obtaining and manipulating human
embryos young enough to display the alimentary tract in its earliest
          I
stages, found it convenient to study these by examining embryo rats,
mice, chicks, &c.       Evidently the truth of observations made in this
way requires constant verification by comparison with what can be
made out in the human subject.
    When embryo chicks are used changes prior to the third day need
 not be taken into consideration ; and although the following facts are
 all well accepted, perhaps      I may be permitted to narrate them, inas

                  and their Relation     to the Peritoneum.                 475
much as they lead up to the points towards which it is desired to
draw attention.
    A section through the abdomen at about this period (the third or
fourth day) displays a body- wall enclosing a pleuro-peritoneal cavity ;
and in the interior of this an alimentary               tube suspended by a
mesentery.     A more   minute   examination     of the  mesentery shows that
it is attached to the spine above : that its surface is covered with
flattened cells, and that its interior consists of mesoblastic tissue and
blood-vessels.    The latter spring from a large artery, the aorta, which
runs along the base of the serous fold.         The vessels of the gut are not
merely   derived from  one   or two  branches    arising from particular parts
of the aorta, but are represented by vessels which descend at intervals
from the parent trunk.       Later it will be evident that only a few of
these mesenteric vessels persist, and that the various parts of the
alimentary canal retain a supply commensurate with their require
ments.     Moreover,  it will   be  seen   that the development of a great
organ, such as the liver, pancreas, or spleen, in intimate relation with
the bowel, has an important influence in determining the size of the
vessels which pass through the mesentery.
    Again, referring to the section through the third or fourth day
chick, the following points are easily ascertained. The mesentery and
intestine hanging into the pleuro-peritoneal cavity divide it, roughly
speaking, into two halves; a right and left (Diagram 1). Of course it
follows that the blood-vessels which it contains are bounded on each
 side by these halves of the peritoneal cavity.        As long as this arrange
 ment continues, nothing could be simpler than the relations of the
 vessels ; but complications soon occur, and it will now be attempted to
 state in detail what they are and how they are produced.
    For the sake of clearness, the events which take place in that part
 of the mid-gut which afterwards becomes the stomach may be con-

476         Mr. C. B. Lockwood.        Arteries of  the Abdomen
sidered first  ; although it may be remarked that a great many of the
events which are about to be mentioned are in progress at the same
time.
    The position of the stomach is indicated by an enlargement of the
anterior portion of the mid-gut. This organ, like the remainder of
the bowel, is fastened to the spine by a mesentery, and simply hangs
suspended in the pleuro-peritoneal cavity (Diagram 1). This position
is altered by the stomach turning upon its right side. The mesentery,
or mesogastrium as it will be called in future, is implicated in this
change ; instead of descending vertically from the spine to the
stomach, it becomes looped (Diagram 2).         Owing to these movements
of the stomach and mesogastrium the cavity which they partitioned
becomes different.     There is no longer a right and left division of the
peritoneal sac, but a part in front and to the left of the stomach and
mesogastrium, and a part behind and to the right.         The space which
is behind the stomach, and which has the mesogastrium for its left
boundary, represents what afterwards is the lesser cavity of the peri
toneum.      It need not be repeated that blood-vessels pass through the
mesogastrium to the stomach, and are of necessity involved in the
changes which have just been described.          Their course, instead of
being straight, forms a curve.      The relations of these altered vessels
to the subdivisions of the peritoneal cavity require to be noted; it is
evident that to reach their destination they now pass round the left
boundary of the future lesser sac.

                        S. Stomach.  MO.  Mesogastrium.
    All  the changes which have been narrated occur at very early
rstages of development ; subsequent events do not produce any great
 alterations.    Later it will be seen that the stomach becomes less
 vertical, and its mesentery further modified ; but the changes which
 the mesogastrium undergoes are very striking.         They have been full/

                      and their Relation     to the Peritoneum.               477
discussed before,* so that       it does not seem necessary to do more than
allude to them briefly.         Stated as shortly as possible, it may be said
that at the oesophageal and pyloric ends of the stomach the mesogas-
trium remains short, but near the middle elongates and becomes the
great omentum.           This anomalous structure afterwards enters into
relation with the transverse colon ; but at present the manner in
which this is brought about need not be discussed.
     This much having been premised, it may be inquired whether these
observations are applicable to the adult subject.              The mesogastrium
having been identified with the great omentum, it remains to be seen
if the blood supply of the stomach still passes through it. The
gastric     artery certainly conforms to the conditions.             This artery
begins behind the peritoneum, and runs between two layers of this
membrane to reach the oesophageal end of the stomach. These folds of
peritoneum represent the upper part of the mesogastrium, and are
continuous below with the great omentum.                 To confirm these state
 ments the lesser sac of the peritoneum should be opened ; a hand
 passed within it towards the right of the oesophagus enters the con
 cavity of a loop which the gastric artery makes ; a hand introduced
 into the greater sac, to the left of the oesophagus, touches the con
 vexity of the loop. When the anatomy of the gastric artery is com
 pared with the original vessels of the mesentery its close resemblance
 to them      is clear; the modifications which have occurred are com
 paratively insignificant. As it has been explained how the meso
 gastrium forms the left boundary of the lesser peritoneal cavity, it
 therefore      seems unnecessary to enter into details concerning             the
 relations of the vessels which it contains to the greater and lesser
  sacs.
     If  the arteries   of the stomach were taken in detail the vasa brevia
  would    come next, and afterwards those near the pylorus.              Passing
  over the vasa brevia,     for the moment, the following question seems to
  demand an answer.         If the mesogastrium originally contained nume
  rous vessels, how is it that, with the exception of the vasa brevia, none
  are found between the oesophagus and pylorus ?              Generally speaking,
  structures receive their blood supply by the nearest route, and
  exceptions to this rule can usually be accounted for.            The elongation
  of the mesogastrium, to form the great omentum, is so excessive that
  it might almost be anticipated that none of its vessels would persist.
  Whatever the probabilities may seem, it has always been recognised
  that the omentum contains enormously long vascular loops, which
  extend from the curve of the stomach             to the transverse colon ; they
  are   usually spoken of as being the longest arterial loops in the body.
  Although these vessels appear to be more for the supply of the

            the Development of the Great Omentum and Transverse Meso-colon,"    By

478         Mr. C. B. Lockwood.       Arteries  of  the Abdomen
omentum than of the stomach, yet it does not seem uureasonable to
argue that they represent the original vessels of the mesentery.
    If the course of the gastric artery, through the mesogastrium, has
been followed, that of the splenic offers fewer difficulties.       Exactly
similar principles of development apply to it.
    If the mesogastrium of a human embryo about 2 inches long be
examined the following facts may be easily observed.              Near the
oesophagus     the mesogastrium is comparatively short, but at the
junction of the anterior with the middle third of the stomach it is
longer, and the rudiment of a spleen may be distinguished between
its layers.   This organ is developed from the mesoblast which exists
between the layers of the mesogastrium.        It will be remembered that
a portion of this tissue had previously become differentiated into the
blood-vessels of the mesogastrium.       Whether the spleen and its blood
supply are formed at the same time and from the same tissue, or
whether this organ appropriates some of the vessels which the
mesogastrium previously contained, would be hard to say.           The fact
remains that the mesoblast from which this organ is developed is
in direct continuity, behind, with that which surrounds the aorta, in
front, with that which forms the wall of the stomach ; there is no
anatomical reason, therefore, why either of the above events might not
occur.     As soon as the spleen appears blood-vessels can be seen
extending to it from the aorta, and onwards to the stomach. Entirely
situated between the layers of the mesogastrium the spleen derives
 the whole of its blood supply from vessels passing through it. At
 the period at which the spleen is formed the mesogastrium has become
 involved in the change of position which the stomach undergoes.
 Owing to the turning of this organ upon its right side, the meso
 gastrium forms a fold the convexity of which is towards the left.
 The portion of the general peritoneal cavity included in the concavity
 of the fold represents the lesser sac.     Now the spleen appears at the
 convexity of the loop, so that the portion of mesogastrium which extends
 from the spine to the spleen forms the left boundary of the lesser cavity,
 and that which passes from the spleen to the stomach constitutes the
 gastrosplenic omentum (Diagram 3).         The application of these facts
 to the course of the splenic artery is not difficult.  As this vessel runs
 in the mesogastrium it ought to commence behind the lesser peritoneal
 sac, and pass in its left boundary to reach the spleen.     It is also clear
 that a portion of the greater cavity, that which lies between the
 posterior surface of the mesogastrium and back wall of the abdomen,
 should be behind the artery.     That this is so may easily be ascertained
  by examining a human footus at about the full term.        At this period
  the mesogastrium is well marked, and the splenic artery plainly
  between its layers. Even in the adult there is a well marked recess,
  so that, by placing one hand in the lesser sac and another behind the

                   and their Relation    to the Peritoneum.             479
spleen in the greater, the artery in question may be grasped.    Recent
works on anatomy (e.g., " Quain's Anatomy," Ninth Edition, 1882,
vol.ii, p. 729, fig. 621, &c.) delineate the peritoneum in accordance
with the above description.     The process of development which has
been described seems to afford an explanation of the very complicated
relations of this artery, both to the peritoneum and to its greater and
lesser cavities.

   The   arteria vasa brevia and gastro-epiploica           sinistra    are
naturally the next to demand attention.        It has been pointed out
already that the gastro-splenic omentum         simply that part of the
                                                  is
mesogastrium which lies between the spleen and the stomach.         Blood
vessels are present in the mesentery of the stomach long before the
appearance of the spleen, but     does not seem possible to say whether
                                  it
the vasa brevia are the representatives of these, or whether, as was
remarked before, they might have been developed in connexion with
the spleen itself.  Similar doubts appear to exist when the epiploic
arteries are in question     ;how far they are prolongations        of the
original arteries of the mesogastrium, or to what extent they are
developed in the mesoblast which surrounds the stomach.        A   solution
of this point would in no way affect what has been said about the
course and relations of the splenic artery itself.        This vessel    is
exceedingly   like the gastric, for    has
                                        it    similar
                                                  a   origin  and similar
 course  through the mesogastrium.
    The arteries in the vicinity of the pylorus are the next to demand
 notice.   The development of the liver and lesser omentum has pro  a
 found influence upon these, and therefore requires ample considera
 tion.                       which have been mentioned before their
          Owing to difficulties
 development will be studied in the chick.  The very earliest stages of
 the development of the liver determine its arterial supply.  A tram

verse section through            chick at about the third day of incu-
                           an embryo
bation, displays the alimentary canal suspended from the vertebral
region by a long mesentery.    The liver commences as a protrusion
from the wall of the intestine, and owing to the rapidity of its
growth the organ soon attains considerable size. Numerous blood
vessels are present in the mesentery which unites the liver and intes
tine to the spine, and the corpuscles which they contain may be seen
to enter into intimate relation with the hypoblastic cells which form
the liver substance. This observation is of the greatest importance,
for it shows that from its earliest appearance the liver obtains a part
of its blood supply from the vessels of the mesentery. Continuing to
watch the changes which occur, it will be found that the growth of the
liver is very rapid, and that, after a while, it gradually becomes con
stricted  at its junction with the alimentary canal. Whilst this con
striction is being formed, the convexity of the growing liver unites
with the front wall of the abdomen. The histological changes which
accompany these processes are of some importance.     The cells which
cover the surface of the liver and adjoining parts assume a flattened
appearance, and are undistinguishable from those which line the
 remainder of the pleuro-peritoneal cavity. In other words, the surface
of the liver becomes covered with peritoneum.                     The constriction
 between    the stomach    and  the  liver,  at the  same  time,  becomes thinner,
 and its surface converted into serous membrane.                If, at this stage, a
recapitulation    be  permitted,   it  is evident   that the  section   shows, from

 point out that this     is  the usual condition in the vertebrates.             The
 identity of the various parts which have been mentioned has also
been recognised by these authors, and seems quite obvious                     ;   the
mesentery     and  intestine   require    no  further   remark  ;   the  constriction
between the liver and the bowel corresponds to the lesser omentum,
and the part uniting the liver to the front wall of the abdomen               is  the
same as the falciform ligament.
    A little consideration will show that although the preceding events
have been observed in other vertebrates, yet they are applicable to the
human subject.        Owing to alterations which take place in the mesen
tery this  is  not so easy in the adult, but at about the fifth month of
intrauterine life the whole intestine, including the stomach and
duodenum, has a well marked mesentery, and                 it  may be seen near
the pylorus that the mesoduodenum, duodenum, lesser omentum,
liver, and falciform ligament, form an anatomical sequence.
    These preliminary facts may now be used in an endeavour to eluci
date the course of the hepatic artery.

                    and their Relation   to the Peritoneum.               481
    It has been previously stated that from its earliest appearance the
liver derives a portion of its blood supply from the vessels of that
part of the alimentary tract from which it grew ; and the mesentery
was stated to be the route by which it arrives at its destination.
Now     it is clear that, as development progressed, this supply, besides
passing through the mesentery, would have to extend through the
constriction which forms between the liver and intestine.              In the
human subject the duodeuum represents that part of the alimentary
tract which gives origin to the liver ; and, therefore, it seems reason
able to search in its neighbourhood for a vessel which fulfils the con
ditions which have been laid down.               The hepatic artery leaves
nothing to be desired ; arising behind the peritoneum it runs to the
duodenum, and distributes branches to the stomach and intestine ;
thence it passes onwards through the lesser omentum to the liver, and
it is hardly necessary to remark that the lesser omentum corresponds
to the    constriction which has just been spoken of. One point with
 regard to the anatomy of the hepatic artery seems to call for explana
 tion and comment ; its passage through the mesentery. In the adult the
 mesoduodenum is often of insignificant size, so that it is not easy to
 demonstrate the artery passing through it. At about the middle of
 intrauterine life the mesoduodenum is long, and no such difficulty
 exists.     Perhaps this observation is strengthened by an examination
 of the course of the vessel in the shrew.         In this animal the whole
 alimentary tract retains the mesentery, and I have satisfied myself
 that the hepatic artery passes through it before reaching the liver.
     If it is true that the hepatic artery is the representative of one of
 the original vessels of the mesentery, many of its peculiarities may be
 explained.      Instead of one the liver may have two or even three
 arteries      (Cruveilhier,    "Traite d'Anatomie Descriptive," vol. iii,
 p. 67).     When    this is the case the additional vessels may arise from
 the aorta and reach the liver in the usual way, or they may take
 origin from the gastric or superior mesenteric arteries ; both of which,
 it is significant to remark, formerly belonged to the mid-gut.
  Evidently the organ may appropriate more than one of the original
  vessels of the mesentery.
     That the hepatic artery should distribute branches to the stomach
  and duodenum need not excite surprise ; before the appearance of
  the liver it performed no other function than to supply that part of
  the intestine which afterwards becomes converted into those organs.
     So far, in order        not to introduce needless complications, no
  reference has been made to the aperture which is called the Foramen
  of Winslow.       The development of the hepatic artery is a factor, but
  not an essential factor, in its formation.     To explain the origin of the
  Foramen of Winslow, the changes of position which the liver,
  stomach, and lesser omentum undergo, require          to be considered.   In

482         Mr. C. B. Lockwood.          Arteries of the Abdomen
a human      embryo, an inch or an inch and a-half long, the stomach is
almost vertical.        It has been remarked before that the space behind
it corresponds to the lesser cavity of the peritoneum.        The communi
cation between this and the greater sac lies between the right border
of   the stomach and lesser omentum and the posterior wall of the
abdomen.      Now at this early stage of development the liver is of
enormous size, and nearly fills the abdominal cavity, descending as
low as the pubes. In consequence its transverse fissure occupies an
exceedingly low position.        Afterwards the relative size of the liver
diminishes, and it may be said to retreat beneath the ribs and costal
cartilages.      It  seems  reasonable to argue that when the liver makes
this ascent     it must    needs take the lesser omentum, pylorus, and
hepatic artery up with it; and it would further follow that the
stomach would become more nearly horizontal, and the hepatic artery
acquire an upward direction.           It is these events which cause the
Foramen of Winslow          to assume its permanent     appearance and posi
tion.
    Three   important arteries, the gastric, splenic, and hepatic, have
been passed     in review.    From the details of their development princi
ples of wide applicability may be deduced.
    First. That they were originally derived from the dorsal aorta for
                 the supply of the mid-gut.
    Second. That they reach their destination by passing through the
                 mesentery.
    Third. That they participate in all the changes the           mesentery
                 undergoes.
    Fourth.  That if an organ is developed in the mesentery or from
                 the gut, it obtains, part at least, of its vascular supply
                 from the vessels of the mesentery, or from those of the
                 gut from which it sprung.
    The attempt may now be made to apply these principles to the
remainder of the human alimentary canal.               Before discussing in
detail the arteries of the intestines and their appendage, the pan
creas, the development of these organs requires a passing notice.
 The formation of the large and small intestines has been fully
described elsewhere (e.g., Balfour, Gegenbaur, Quain, &c).            Reca
pitulated    as    briefly as possible, it may be stated that in human
 embryos an inch long the alimentary canal forms a loop extending
from the stomach to the pelvis.             The convexity of this loop is
 situated in the large aperture which afterwards becomes the um
bilicus; its concavity is fastened to the spine by a considerable
 mesentery.       A small protrusion appears about the middle of the
intestine, and marks the commencement of the caecum and vermiform
appendix.      As the calibre of the upper and lower parts of the bowel

                    and their Relation     to the Peritoneum.                 483
are the same, the     outgrowth determines its division into small intestine
and colon.
    The developmental changes which afterwards occur in the upper
part are so slight that they do not seem to demand further comment.
An exception may be made in the case of the duodenum, for owing to
the presence of the pancreas, the arteries in its neighbourhood are
more complicated.
    As far as the duodenum itself is concerned, it has been explained
why the hepatic artery should send branches to it ; the rationale of
its supply from the superior mesenteric is so obvious that it does not
seem to require notice.        It would be hard to explain why parts of the
duodenum cease to have a mesentery, but the fact of the disappearance
of this serous fold can have no influence upon the sources of its blood
supply ; that was determined long before the mesentery became
obliterated.
    With regard to the arteries of the pancreas, one or two points
await solution.      At first it may not be evident why it should be sup
plied by the vessels of the duodenum and spleen. It is well recognised
that the pancreas commences as a caecal prolongation from the duo
denum.      In a human embryo about 2^ inches long the elongated
mesogastrium, i.e., great omentum, has not yet involved the transverse
colon   ; and when this membrane is lifted upwards, it may be seen
continuous with the mesoduodenum.                The pancreas, already of con
siderable size, stretches from the duodenum into the mesoduodenum,
and onwards into the mesogastrium,* where it applies itself to the
spleen, previously described as being between the layers of this mem
brane.     The splenic artery may be seen as a delicate streak in the
mesogastrium close to the pancreas, and is at this time one of its most
available sources of blood supply.          It is evident that the fact of this
organ being at one time between the layers of the mesentery explains
why it should be supplied by its vessels, such as the splenic and
duodenal; it also explains why, as Haller (quoted by Cruveilhier,
vol. iii, p. 68) points out, the pancreas may have a large artery
(pancreatica suprema) arising from the caeliac axis, superior mesenteric,
or aorta.      It will be remembered that the original vessels of the
mesentery are numerous, and that even the liver sometimes appro
priated more than one ; evidently the same is the case with the
pancreas. In conclusion, as regards the position of the pancreas
between the layers of the mesentery, it is permanent in some animals,
e.g., the hedgehog (see also sp. 780a and 781a, R. C. S. Museum).
The ultimate relations of this organ to the serous membrane may be
conveniently discussed a little further on.

484        Mr. C. B. Lockwood.           Arteries  of  the Abdomen
    The colon, sigmoid flexure, and rectum are the only parts of the
nlimentary canal which await examination.                When the primitive
 intestinal loop was mentioned, a part which extended from the pelvis
to the caecal protrusion was left. Keeping in view the fact that the
 bowel has an abundant mesentery, it remains to be explained how it
 becomes    converted into the ascending, descending, and transverse
colons, and how its conversion affects its vascular supply.                    The
simplest way seems to be to trace the movements of the caecum.                   At
its first appearance this cul-de-sac is within the wide umbilical
aperture, but as the intestine elongates it performs a tour round
the abdomen ; from the umbilicus it passes upwards towards the
stomach ; from thence it journeys into the right hypochondrinm,
forming the transverse colon, and descending into the right iliac
region completes the ascending portion of the gut.             When the colon
was straight and indistinguishable from the rest of the alimentary
tract, its vascular supply consisted simply of vessels which descended
along the mesentery; as the bowel travels round the abdomen it
carries both mesentery and blood-vessels with it. The peculiarities
which are produced in this manner are so slight that they do not
seem to demand further notice.
   There is, however, an exception in the case of the middle colic
artery, for both the anato my and the development of the mesocolon,
in which it lies, are open to discussion.       These questions have already
been argued at some length by the author in the paper previously
alluded to (p. 477), so that in the present instance they may be briefly
stated.
   As a review of the formation of the omentum and transverse meso
colon naturally leads up to the points at issue, it is convenient to
begin by discussing it.
   Both the structures in question were mentioned when the develop
ment of the stomach and colon was being described (p. 477).                It may

 therefore be sufficient to recommence at the point at which their
 description was discon tinued.         Beginning with the mesogastrium,
 perhaps it is remembered that although at first very simple
 (Diagram 4), yet it afterwards grew and descended from the
 greater curvature of the stomach to form a loop, the great omentum,
 and that afterwards it ascended to be fastened to the back of the
abdomen.       If these ascending layers be traced, the innermost, after
 reaching the spine, passes upwards to form the back of the lesser sac;
 the nnderlayer accompanies it until the spine is reached, and then
 turns downwards to become continuous with the upper layer of the

transverse mesocolon (Diagram 5).             Of course it is recognised that
at this time the colon has an independent mesentery comparable
 in every way to that of the small intestine, and it is clear that at this
juncture an interval separates the under surface of the omentum from
the upper surface of the colon and mesocolon.                    Now in order to
explain how these acquire the intimate relation which they have in
the adult, Haller simply stated that they became adherent.                        This
view has been adopted by succeeding          authors,     and  if it is  true  it must
follow, as they say it does, that the transverse mesocolon should con
sist of four layers of peritoneum, three above the middle colic artery
and one below. Although I have examined a great many subjects,
the transverse mesocolon has never appeared to consist of more than
two layers, one above the artery and one below.                     If this is true,
 Haller's theory becomes involved in doubt, even if other objections
 could not be urged against it.         But it seems pertinent to ask why
 this process of adhesion only occurs in this particular place and
                                                                        2  m  2

nowhere else     ?   Or why, before Haller invented his theory, was the
mesocolon always thought to have two layers ? The examination of a
large number of embryos shows that adhesion never takes place, but
that quite a different event happens. Suppose the loop of peritoneum
between the under surface of the omentum and the upper surface of
the transverse mesocolon was drawn out (see Diagrams 6, 7, and 8,/),
it would cause the colon to lie between the innermost layer of the
omental loop and the inferior layer of the mesocolon            ; in other words,

the transverse mesocolon would consist of only two layers, which
would embrace the gut and its artery.              The paper which has been
mentioned was       written,  and  specimens were shown, to demonstrate
that this was what took place.           If this evidence is true, the usual
accounts of the relations of the transverse mesocolon and its contents
require to be modified.
   It  may   be remembered       that a little while ago it was said that it
would be convenient to defer the final stages of the development of
the pancreas.      When this organ was last spoken of it lay between the
folds of the mesogastrium just before this membrane was attached to
the spine (Diagram 5).         In consequence, the fossa between the meso-

gastrium and the mesentery of the transverse colon intervened between
it and the spine. It is clear that if the highest part of the peritoneal
loop which forms this fossa was withdrawn, the pancreas would
naturally apply itself to the spine (Diagrams 6 and 7). That this is
what occurs need not         be repeated, and as the under       surface of the
mesogastrium is continuous with the left surface of the mesoduodenum,
the drawing out of the one causes the disappearance of the other.
   All the arteries of the alimentary canal from the stomach to the
rectum have now been discussed, and          I  have maintained that —
   First.  All of   them, even the splenic and hepatic, were originally
               derived    from the dorsal aorta for the supply of the
               mid-gut.

                   gut, it obtains, part at least, of its vascular supply from
                   the vessels of the mesentery, or from those of that part
                   of the gut from which it sprung.
      These    principles have, in this paper, only been applied to the
  development of the blood-vessels of the human alimentary canal, but
  they seem so simple, and the probability of their truth appears so
  great, that it may be anticipated that they will be found of very mach
 wider application.

ratio      of the fifth power of the distance.                Now, Clerk Maxwell
in his valuable researches on the viscosity of gases arrived at the
important result that the viscosity of a gas is independent of its
density, and proportional             to the temperature measured from the
absolute zero of the air-thermometer.* Maxwell points out that- the
constancy of the viscosity of a gas for all changes of density when
the temperature is constant is a result of the " Dynamical Theory of
Gases," whatever hypothesis we adopt as to the mode of action
between the molecules when they come near one another; but that if
the viscosity be as the first power of the absolute temperature, then
in the dynamical theory, which is framed to explain the facts, we
must assume that the force between two molecules is proportional
inversely to the fifth power of the distance between them.f                  It is true
that we cannot regard the distance between two consecutive molecules
of a solid as large compared with the diameter of the molecules ;
indeed, we must, on the contrary, assume the molecules to be nearly
touching each other; consequently Poisson's formula would require
modification before it could be strictly adapted to the case in point.
It is equally true that the equation exa7=a constant cannot possibly
hold good for all temperatures, inasmuch as the value of e decreases
more with rise of temperature than a7 increases, and that conse
quently the function fr must contain the temperature.                     Nevertheless,
the coincidence of the results as regards the law of force between
two molecules obtained by Wertheim and Maxwell in quite different
 ways, seemed to warrant me in making more extended inquiries in
 this direction, and with this object            I set about making a most careful
 determination of the thermal capacity of each of the different metals
 which had been used by me in the earlier portion of this inquiry.
My object in doing so will be seen from what follows : —
     If we denote the atomic mass by A, the density by A, the thermal
 capacity per unit mass by Cm, and the thermal capacity                       per unit

            Description of Apparatus      and Mode of Experimenting.
     Thermometers.    — Three thermometers were employed;                 these were
made by Casella, and after having been filled were kept by myself for
a year ; they were then sent back to the maker to be graduated, and
 i month afterwards their graduations were tested at Kew, and were
found to accord very accurately with the Kew standards throughout
the whole of their ranges, which were in the three instruments from
-5°C. to 30° C., from 30° C. to 65° C., and from 65° C. to 105" C.
respectively.       The graduations were made to one-tenth of a degree
centigrade, and were of such a length that it was easy to estimate to
one-hundredth of a degree.
     Calorimeter. — The calorimeter was of the well-known kind intro
duced      by Regnault, and the silver coatings of both the inner and
outer copper vessels of the instrument, which was new, were through
out the experiments kept uniformly bright.                 The mass of the inner
vessel of the calorimeter was 133 grams, and the water equivalent of
it, the stirrer and thermometer, was determined from the mean of
several experiments made by introducing into the vessel known
masses of water at different temperatures to be 138 grams, whilst
the water equivalent, as calculated               from the mass and thermal
capacity of the vessel stirrer and thermometer, was, on the assump
tion of the heat being absorbed uniformly throughout the vessel,
 140 grams.        The probable error of an observation of the thermal
capacity of a wire resulting from error in the determination of the
water equivalent would in no case exceed 0-06 per cent.
                            Mode   of Adjusting   the Wires.
     The wires, which had been previously well annealed, were wonnd
 round a steel rod, and so made into coils of length about 2 inches,
 inner diameter £ inch, and outer diameter 1| inches ; the rod was
 then withdrawn, and the coil inserted into a thin brass envelope.
 The envelope (figs. 1, 2) consisted of a hollow cylinder AB, 2 inches
 in length and 2 inches in diameter, terminated at both ends by a
 truncated cone.         The closed conical end BDB could be unscrewed so
as to receive the coil of wire, and was, after the insertion of the coil,
 force does vary inversely as the fifth power of the distance.   According to M. Heen,
  the force is inversely as the seventh power of the distance, but it would seem to
  follow from Foisson's mathematics that the law should be really the one pre
viously indicated.

screwed on again ; whilst at the other extremity of the envelope was
an aperture, C, finch in diameter, through which a thermometer could
be inserted so that its bulb would lie along the axis and in the centre
of the coil of wire.
   The envelope served a double purpose, as it not only enabled com
pensation to be made in the manner presently to be described for loss
of heat during the transference of the wire from the air-chamber to
the calorimeter, but also was of use in distributing the heat uniformly
throughout the coil, which was not the case when no such precaution
                                         Fio. 2.
 was    taken.* The thermometer was placed in the air-chamber in a
 position which was nearly horizontal, but slightly slanting upwards
 so as to prevent the column of mercury in the thermometer tube from
 being broken when the temperature was falling.                 As soon as the coil
 of wire had attained the desired temperature,                the calorimeter       was
   •   In some preliminary experiments made without the envelope     I frequently found
 a difference  of quite 1° between the temperature of the centre of the coil and that of
 one end, but with the envelope there was, after a certain interval of heating, no
 sensible difference of temperature.

placed close to the end F of the air-chamber, and the double screen
MM having been first removed the cork F was pulled out, and after
it,through the intervention of the thread, the brass envelope with
the contained wire, which were speedily dropped into the calorimeter.
After the water in the calorimeter and its contents had been stirred
for three minutes, the temperature of the mixture was determined              to
within t^5° C. by means of the first of the previously-mentioned
thermometers, care having been taken by means of the erection                 of
certain marks to avoid parallax in the reading. After the first reading
had been taken two others ensued after successive intervals of three
minutes each, so that correction might be made for loss of heat
resulting from radiation this loss, however, being almost compensated
                          ;
by placing in the calorimeter water at a temperature which previous
rough calculation had shown would be as much below the temperature
of the room as the temperature of the mixture would be above it.
    Preliminary observations were made for the purpose of ascertaining
the rise of temperature which would be caused by immersing the
heated envelope only in the 450 grams of distilled water used in the
calorimeter, and the mean of eighteen observations in which the
envelope alone was raised to 60° C. and then plunged into water at
 about 20° C., showed that the average rise of temperature per degree
of fall of temperature of the brass envelope between 60° C. and 20°           C.
was 0'01150° C.      Similarly eighteen observations between 100° C.and
20° C. showed a rise of   0  01114° C. to be produced per degree of fall
of temperature of the envelope. If the thermal capacity of the brass
of which the envelope was formed be assumed to be 0-0924 between
20° C. and 60° C.,* the calculated rise of temperature, supposing that
no heat is  lost in the transference of the envelope from the air-chamber
to the calorimeter, would be 0'0137 so that, as might be expected
                                         ;
 from the large surface of the envelope as compared with its mass, the
loss of heat during the transference        very appreciable, and, as also
                                             is
might be expected, the loss between 100° C. and 20° C.        greater than
                                                               is
 that between 60° C. and 20° C.        It will be sufficient, perhaps, to
record the eighteen observations between 20° C. and 100° C.
  * My subsequent   experiments would prove that this would be very nearly   the
case.

               Stress and Strain on the Properties         of Matter.           495
   The mean value of all the observations on the mean thermal
capacity of German-silver between 20° C. and 60° C. is 0-09424, but
this number requires to be slightly corrected if we are to assume
the thermal capacity of water at 0° C. to be unity.                 According to
Regnault,*      the  thermal   capacity   of  water  at 2° C. =  1 +   0-000042 +
O-0OO0O0922, and hence the thermal capacity at 20° C.                 =    1-00116.
Again the apparent weight of water in air was taken instead of the
weight in vacuo.          Now the correction of the apparent weight W of
                     -
a mass of water when weighed with brass weights amounts to
W . 0-0012 (1           -J.^) = W . 0-00106.        On the whole, therefore, we
must take 0'09424 x 1-00222, i.e., 0-09445, as the corrected thermal
capacity.      A similar correction was applied in the case of all the
other observations.         No correction was made in consideration of the
fact that the whole of the stem of the thermometer employed in the
calorimeter was not immersed in the source of heat, as according to
 Kopp, if N be the number of degrees extant from the source of heat,
 T the observed temperature, and t the atmospheric temperature, a. the
correction    to be applied,
                              *=N(T-0x         -O001545.f
 Now   if we    assume the temperature of the air to be 20° C., and the
 temperature      of the water before and after the immersion of the
 heated    wire to be 18° C. and 22° C. respectively (this representing
 rather an extreme case), the correction would only introduce an altera
 tion in the value of the thermal capacity of 0-015 per cent. With
 the thermometer         used in the heated air-chamber a correction, not
 however exceeding in any case 0-3 per cent., was, when necessary,
 applied by the aid of Kopp's formula.

    In Table are given the results obtained with the different metals,

 other experimenters.

    t Recent   investigations have shown   that this formula can only be regarded as
  roughly  approximate, but the approximation is quite sufficient for the present
  purpose.

of all the metals examined increases with the temperature, a result
which we find confirmed by the observations of other experimenters,
recorded in the third column of Table II.*
   The last column of Table       II  shows that the results obtained by me
are on the whole slightly, but decidedly, greater than those of the
means of the other experimenters, and perhaps this may be accounted
for by the fact that with me the loss of heat in the transfer from the
hot air-chamber to the cold water is entirely compensated.
   The thermal capacities of the alloys platinum -silver and German-silver
are almost exactly the same as those calculated from the proportions
of their components ; thus the calculated thermal capacity of the
platinum-silver, which was composed of 2 parts by weight of silver
and 1 part of platinum, is 0-04877 between 0° 0. and 100° C., and the
observed value is 0'04864. Again, the calculated thermal capacity of
the German-silver, which was composed of 74 parts by weight of
copper, 20 parts by weight of zinc, and 6 parts of nickel, f is 0-09460,
and the observed       value  0'09466.     Such     results as these are highly
satisfactory, as they not only serve as indications of the trustworthi
ness of the mode of observation, but also show how very closely we
may rely on calculating the thermal capacities of such alloys as
these from the thermal capacities of their component parts.
   Finally, we learn from Table         II how well the observations of dif
ferent observers agree with each other, so that small differences in
                            J
the purity of the metal do not, as in the case of electrical conductivity,
make much difference in the thermal capacity.

   It is now time to consider whether such a relationship as has been
mentioned in the beginning of this portion of the paper to be likely
 to exist between thermal capacity and elasticity, does really do so,
and in Table    III will be found     the necessary data.
   From Table      III we learn       that, with exceptions in the cases of
platinum and platinum-silver, the order of the thermal capacities per
unit volume of the different metals is the same as the order of

       OBITUARY NOTICES OF FELLOWS DECEASED.
    George Bentham was born on the 22nd of September, 1800, at
Stoke, near Portsmouth, where his parents happened to be at that
time residing, in consequence of the professional occupations of his
father, General, afterwards Sir Samuel, Bentham, who then held the
important post of Inspector of Naval Works under the Admiralty.
His mother, a lady of great ability, was the daughter of Dr. George
Fordyce, F.R.S.        He was the second son and third child of a family
of five, all of whom he survived.
    The conditions of young Bentham's early days were hardly favour
able to the settled routine of an orthodox scheme of education ; for
he was trained by private tutors, and never went to school nor
college.      But although it was a life-long regret to him that he had
not been subjected to the associations and discipline of school and
college — to which deprivation, no doubt, a certain shyness and
reserve that characterised him may be attributed — his was not a mind
to run to waste even under the unsettlement of strong contrasts of
life and circumstances occasioned by the migration of his father and
family to Russia, and afterwards to the South of France, where the
administration and control of a large estate belonging to the father
were confided to the junior in his early manhood.
    As a youth he was an eager student in many branches of knowledge,
with a special aptitude however for the acquisition of languages : while
yet a lad of six or seven years he was able to converse fluently in
 French, German, and Russian.          Methodical habits and a capacity for
close and prolonged application         to any favourite study appear to
 have been ingrained in him from very early days, and, with his reten
 tive memory, laid the sure foundation of his future eminence in the
 field of Systematic Botany.         He was first  attracted,  as is assumed,
 to this branch     of science by the "Flore Francaise"of De Candolle,
 the analytical tables of which, as an aid in the determination             of
species, appear to have had a special fascination           for him — falling
 in with the " methodising, analysing, and tabulating ideas " which
 he had derived from previous study of the works of his eminent
 uncle   Jeremy Bentham.       The study of other works of De Candolle's
 on the    structure and classification of plants, and the personal friend
 ship and influence of that eminent botanist, strengthened Bentham's
 bias towards Classificatory      Botany.    This indeed may, from about
    TOL.  xxxvin.                                                     b

                                       11
his twenty-fourth year onward, be regarded as his serious life's wort,
interrupted more or less, however, for some years by legal research
with a view to a professional career, and by the services which he
rendered in the preparation of his uncle's works for the press.
   Mr. Bentham's first botanical work, published in 1826, was his
" Catalogue des Plantes                                         et du Baa
                                 Indigenes   des   Pyrenees
Languddoc,"     the result   of   a careful botanical   exploration of the
Pyrenees, in company with the late Dr. Arnott (afterwards Professor
of Botany in the University of Glasgow).         To appreciate rightly this
little work of 128 pages, we must compare the botanical science of
that date with our present detailed knowledge of Pyrenean Botany,
and of the relation of the vegetation of this region to that of other
European chains.       At that time there was no accurate scientific
account of the Botany of the Pyrenees, and the loose practice of the
authors of local floras freely allowed, on the most slender indirect
 evidence, admission   into their enumerations of very unlikely species.
But Mr. Bentham            " Pour donner a mon
                     says,                        catalogue une utilite plus
generate que celle des simples compilations, si faciles a faire et par
consequent si multipliers malgre leur peu d'utilité, je me suis attache
a n'y admettre aucune observation, aucun synonyme que je n'ai pas eu
occasion de verifier par moi-meme, ou, si je me suis écarte de cette
regie, cela n'a ete que tres-rarement, et toujours en citant la personne
de qui je les tiens."   This habit of carefully scrutinizing his data he
maintained to the end of his life. Besides an enumeration of Pyrenean
plants this catalogue includes critical essays on several peculiarly
difficult genera, especially Cerastium, Helianthemum, Linum, Medicngo,
Mijosotis, and Orobanche.
    Mr. Bentham's botanical life in England may be regarded as begin
ning with his association with the late Dr. Wallich in the distribution
of the enormous Indian collections of that naturalist, and with his
elaboration   of the great natural order Labiate, and of the Indian
 Scrophulariaceae : orders which some years afterwards he revised for
                                                                   "
 the " Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Begni Vegetabilis               of his
friend De Candolle.      It is in these works that we may first recognise
 the peculiar qualities which give value to all Mr. Bentham's taxo-
 nomic work. They show an insight, of so special a character as to
 deserve the name of genius, into the relative value of characters for
 practical systematic work, and, as a consequence of this, a sure sifting
 of essentials from non-essentials in each respective grade. At the
 date of these works the broad foundations in classificatory Phanero
 gamic botany had, we must remember, been already securely laid ;
 and the pressing need, supplied so precisely at the right time by
 Mr. Bentham, was for a systematist capable of reducing to order the
 number of genera which in some of the largest natural orders were
 still simply an unorganised mob.

                                   iii
  Mr. Bentham published his " Labiatarum Genera et Species " in
         his " Scrophularineae Indices
                                       " in 1835.
1832-36    :
  In   1829 Mr. Bentham accepted the onerous duties of Honorary
Secretary to the Horticultural Society of London.    The Society was,
at that time, in very low water but with his friend Dr. Lindley's
                                   ;
assistance he rescued and brought      into " a flourishing condition,
financially and scientifically, which    it it
                                        has never since approached."
This connexion with the Horticultural Society necessarily determined
somewhat                  of his botanical work, and led him to the
               the direction
publication  of the  botanical  results of the Douglas and Hartweg
explorations in North and Central America and in the United States
of Columbia.
   In 1833 Mr. Bentham married the daughter of the late Right Hon.
Sir Harford Brydges, of Boultibrooke, and settled in the following
year at his late uncle's house in Queen's Square Place, whence he
removed in 1842 to Pontrilas House, in Herefordshire.   It was while
resident   here that he revised the orders Labiates, Scrophulariaceae,
and the Eriogoneae for the " Prodromus," besides continuing his
publication of the Guiana plants of Schomburgk, and the botanical
                                 "
collections of the voyage of the   Sulphur" (1844).
   In 1836 Mr. Bentham made tour with the object of visiting the
                               a
principal herbaria of the Continent, and settled to hard work in Vienna
in the autumn of that year. It was here that he prepared his first
important work on the Leguminosss           Leguminosarum
                                                 ("           Generibus
Commentationes "), published in 1840 in the " Annalen des Wiener
Museums." He also described, in conjunction with Dr. Endlicher,
the Australian novelties brought home             by
                                              Baron Hiigel, and worked
at  the Ericesa for the " Prodromus."
   In 1854, finding the maintenance of his herbarium and library too
serious a charge, Mr. Bentham contemplated, on his final removal to
London, abandoning botanical work and presenting his collections and
books to the Royal Gardens, Kew, of which his old and most intimate
friend Sir W. J. Hooker was Director. That eminent man, however,
by his entreaties and by the offer of the free use of his library and
herbarium, prevailed to secure to Systematic Botany the rest of Mr.
Bentham's active life.    Through his influence the accommodation of
a private working room in connexion with the herbaria at Kew was
hecured for Mr. Bentham, and the course of his future life's work
was finally determined by the inauguration of a series of Colonial
Floras, of the model of which, the " Flora of the Island of Hong
Kong" — so remarkable in the number of forms peculiar, or at that
time supposed so to be, to that small island — Mr. Bentham was the
                                        " was
author. The " Flora Hongkongensis                published in 1861.   A
short time before Mr. Bentham         had published, for the use of
beginners,    an admirable flora of the British Islands, a work in

                                      iv
 which the species are described in simple but accurate English,
 and which possesses an excellent           analytical Clavis.     Here the
  writer of this short notice may remark upon the perfection of Mr.
 Bentham's descriptive work, manifest not only in its terseness, apt
 ness, and precision, but especially in the judicious selection of diagnostic
 marks, and in the instinctive estimate of probable range in variation
  which long experience and innate genius for such work could alone
 inspire. In 1863 Mr. Bentham published the first volume of the greatest
                                                             "
 work of the colonial series yet given to the world, the Flora Austra-
 liensis," based upon the collections at Kew and Melbourne, the latter
iiunotated and transmitted with noble liberality by our Fellow Sir F.
 Mueller. This work was completed in seven volumes in 1870.
     In 1863 Mr. Bentham accepted the Presidency of the Linnean
 Society, which he retained until 1874, working with head and hand
as no President ever did before for the welfare of any learned society.
 His anniversary addresses are, in their way, masterpieces, embracing
 wide fields and discussing biological questions with a liberality and
breadth of view surprising even to his nearest friends.
     While the Australian flora was yet in progress Mr. Bentham, in
conjunction with his friend Sir Joseph Hooker, entered upon the
crowning work of his life, for which his long experience in systematic
 work had pre-eminently fitted him, the " Genera Plantarum."             This
occupied him, with comparatively slight interruption by such serious
 t rifles as the elaboration of the Legaminosffi   of Brazil for the great
 Flora of von Martins and the like, until the spring of 1883. No
                                                     " Genera Plantarum,"
 sooner had he completed this great work, the
 than it seemed as though he felt that his life's work had been accom
 plished.     His strength rather suddenly gave way, his daily visits to
 Kew became intermittent, ceasing at last in April, 1884, and gradually
 becoming feebler he sank to rest, dying simply of old age, with his
 mental faculties bright nearly to the last, on the 10th September,
 1884, within a fortnight of his 84th birthday.
     With Mr. Bentham we lose a master in Systematic Botany. The
excellent and interesting biographical notice of him in "Nature"
 by his most intimate friend Sir Joseph Hooker, of which the present
 writer has made free use, says " there is not a temperate or
 tropical region of the globe whose floras have not been largoly
elucidated by him.        It may safely be affirmed that for variety and
extent of good     work   of the kind he had no superior.    The distinctive
                                      —
qualities of his descriptions are scientific accuracy, good arrange
ment, precision of language, lucidity, and the discarding of what is
superfluous.      In these respects ho has had no superior since the days
of Linnaeus and Robert Brown."           And, again, " of his amiable dis
position, and his sterling qualities of head and heart, it is impossible
to speak too highly     ; though cold in manner and excessively       shy in

                                      V
disposition,   he was the kindest   of helpmates and most disinterested
of labourers for others."       The compiler of this notice, who had
the privilege of association with him in the work of tbe Kew her
barium for twenty-five years, can most feelingly answer to the truth
of this.
    A Royal Medal was awarded to Mr. Bentham in 1859 : he was
elected a Fellow of the Ro^al Society in 1862.        The titles of ninety
papers by his own hand, and seven written jointly with other bota
nists, occupy nearly three pages in the Society's Catalogue of Scientific
Papers.     He was a Companion of the Order of St. Michael and St.
 George, and member or associate of almost every society in Europe,
America, and Australia, which recognises biological studies.
    He left no relative except a grand-niece.
                                                                    D. 0.
    Thomas Watson was born in Devonshire on the 7th March, 1792,
 as appears    from the register of his birth in the parish church of
 Kentisbeare, in that county.     His early education was begun, during
 the head mastership of Dr. Malken, at the Grammar School of Bury
 St. Edmund's, where he was a contemporary of the late Bishop Blom-
 field, with whom he was always on terms of intimate friendship.
    On leaving Bury school he entered as a pensioner at St. John's
 College, Cambridge.     He graduated B.A. in 1815, when he was tenth
 wrangler, and in the following year was elected Fellow of his College,
 and became M.A. in 1818.       According to a rule which then existed
 those Fellows of St. John's who were not in holy orders, could retain
 their Fellowships for a short time only. From this rule, however,
 certain Fellowships, one of which was set apart for the study of
 medicine, were exempted, and Mr. Watson held his Fellowship until
 his marriage in 1825, in which year he took his M.D. degree.
     While at Cambridge he taught private pupils, and in 1823-24
 he served the office of Junior Proctor.         During his seven years'
 residence as Fellow of St. John's he was occasionally absent for
 months together; in 1819, he was a student of medicine at St. Bar
 tholomew's under Mr. Abernethy, and in the session of 1820-21,
 he attended the medical classes in Edinburgh.         In 1825 he married
 the daughter      of Edward   Jones,   Esq., of  Brackley,  Northampton
 shire, and commenced practice in Heurietta Street, Cavendish Square.
  In 1826 he was elected a Fellow of the College of Physicians, and in
 the following year physician to the Middlesex Hospital.           In 1828,
 when University College was opened, Dr. Watson was appointed
  Professor of Clinical Medicine, and gave lectures on cases under
  his care in the wards of the Middlesex Hospital.       This appointment
 he held     until 1831, when,   at   the  opening  of King's   College, he
 was appointed Professor of Forensic Medicine in that institution.

                                      vi
In   1830  he had    the terrible sorrow of losing his wife, who died
suddenly    three  days after the birth of their second child.    In 1836
Dr. Watson succeeded the late Dr. Francis Hawkins as Professor
of Medicine in King's College, and he retained that chair until the
spring of 1840, when at the opening of the newly founded King's
College Hospital he was called upon to resign either his office of
physician to the Middlesex Hospital or his chair at King's College;
and he decided to retain the former office.        The resignation of his
professorship led at once to a result which proved beneficial alike to
Dr. Watson, to the profession, and indirectly to the public, namely, the
publication of his admirable lectures
                                         " On the Principles and Practice
of Physic."      The lectures appeared first in the weekly numbers of
      "
the Medical Gazette ;" the first lecture was published on 20th Sep
tember, 1840, and the last of the series on 23rd September, 1842.       In
the following year, 1843, they were collected and published in two
volumes.       Between that date and 1871, four large editions were
called for.    The publication of these lectures, admirable as they were
by   universal  consent acknowledged to be, not less for the soundness
and wisdom of their teaching than for their lucid, elegant, and
scholarly style, greatly increased the reputation of their author,
acquired for him the well merited title of the
                                                      " Cicero of English
Medicine," and led to a large and rapid increase of his practice.
    In 1862 Dr. Watson, having held most of the minor offices in the
College of Physicians, was elected President, an office to which he
was unanimously re-elected for four successive years. The College
would have gladly elected him for the sixth time, but he declined on
the plea of advancing years, and at the annual meeting for the election
of President in 1867 he bade the College farewell in the following
characteristically    graceful terms : — " It only remains that   I should
attempt to do that which I feel to be well nigh impossible — to embody
in any form of words that I can devise the deep and inextinguishable
sense cf gratitude with which my mind is full for that kindness and
trust which have placed me year by year on five successive occasions
at the head of the College of Physicians, in other words, at the head
of the medical profession in this great country.         According to my
estimation more      than  once expressed, there is no nobler position in
medicine, whether I look before me and around me to the body of
men from whom it comes, or backwards to the splendid list of names
of those who have preceded me in the presidential chair— Linacre,
Caius, Glisson, Sir William Browne, Pitcairn, Sir George Baker;
these, to go no later, are but a few of the eminent men and sound
scholars with whom it may well be deemed a proud distinction to
have had one's name in any way associated. But besides this great
and repeated honour — the greater because so repeated — I have much
-else to thank you for.   I have to acknowledge your indulgence towards

                                            vii
the many shortcomings of which              I  am but too conscious.     I have to
express my thanks for your constant support and counsel in all
difficulties, for your unvarying courtesy and deference, for the friend
ships   which my official intercourse with you has formed or strengthened,
and most        especially for that recent and touching evidence of your
approbation and esteem shown by your wish to possess within your
walls some pictorial remembrance of my unworthy person. Of this
high and generous compliment               I   can never, while life and reason
remain to me, be other than most gratefully, and I hope pardonably,
proud.        Further,    I   have to rejoice that the happy lustrum during
which      I   have presided over your affairs has been harmonious and
peaceful — disturbed by no unseemly quarrels or serious differences
among us — stained by no scandal             arising within our proper body, and
productive through your exertions and self-sacrifices of something, at
least, of benefit to the common weal.                 I
                                                   If find anything to regret it
 is that   I  have not taken larger advantage of the opportunity which
 you have        confided to me of promoting the interests of the College,
 and    of   our useful and noble profession.           Still, I must cherish the
 hope that the College has suffered no abatement of ita ancient
 dignity and renown through my occupation of the office which               I now
 respectfully render back into your hands. And so without encroaching
 further upon your time, and in redemption of the pledge which                   I
 gave you last year,        I  bid you, as your President, one and all a cordial,
 affectionate, and final farewell."
      The " pictorial remembrance
                                          " to which he alludes is an admirable
  likeness by his old friend, George Richmond, which was subscribed
  for by the Fellows, and which is now among the most cherished
  treasures of the College.          A replica is in the possession of the present
  baronet, and the picture has been most successfully             engraved by the
  great and venerable artist Samuel Cousins.
      Dr. Watson was appointed Physician Extraordinary to the Queen
  in 1859, and in 1870 one of the Physicians in Ordinary. On the
  9th December, 1861, he was summoned to attend the Prince Consort
  at Windsor      in consultation with Sir James Clark, Sir Heury Holland,
  and   Dr. (now Sir William) Jenner, and his attendance continued
   until the lamented death of the Prince on the 14th December.
      In 1866 Dr. Watson was created a baronet, the honour having been
   conferred upon him, as the then Prime Minister, Lord John Russell,
   informed him, by the express desire of Her Majesty.
      Among other distinctions which were conferred upon him may be
   mentioned the following.           He was elected an Honorary Fellow of his
   old College at the same time as the late Sir John Herschel.                  He
    was made Hon. D.C.L. Oxford, in 1862 ; Hon. LL.D. Cambridge,
    in 1864; and Hon. Fellow of the King's and Queen's College of
    Physicians, Ireland.         In 1859 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal

                                     viii
Society.      For many years he was a most active and influential
member of the Council of King's College, London.               During the
session 1857-58 he was President of the Pathological Society.            In
1868 he became the first President of the Clinical            Society, and
in his inaugural address he impressed upon the Society, with his
customary good sense and grace of style, the supreme importance
of an endeavour to obtain " more exactness of knowledge, and there
fore more direct and intelligent purpose, and more successful aim in
what is really the end and object of all our labours — the application
of remedies for the cure and relief of disease."
      During the last ten years of his life he had retired from the active
 practice of his profession, but he continued to take great interest in
 all its concerns. His three latest essays on Zymotic Diseases, on
 Hydrophobia, and on Small-pox and Vaccination, were republished
 in a small volume in 1879, when he was on the verge of his ninetieth
 year ; yet in these latest products of his pen there is no evidence that
 age had dimmed his intellect or lessened his command of graceful and
 expressive language.
      After Sir Thomas     Watson had retired from the Chair of the
  College of Physicians, he always attended the annual meeting for
  the election of President.    The last occasion on which he appeared
 was a few months before his death, at the second election of Sir
  William Jenner to the Presidency.          That meeting was rendered
  memorable from the circumstance that, in the absence               of the
  Senior Censor, Sir Thomas Watson was called upon, as the senior
  Fellow present, to deliver to the newly elected President the insignia
  of his office ; and when he got up to walk towards the President's
  chair the whole of the assembled Fellows rose as one man to show
  their respect and affection for their venerable ex- President. Notwith
  standing his great age he enjoyed his usual good health, spending the
  greater part of the summer and autumn of 1882 with his daughter
  and his son's family, partly at the sea-side, and partly at his son's
  house at Reigate.     On Sunday, the 22nd October, soon after attending
  the morning service at Reigate Church, he was seized with slight
  paralysis of the left side. He calmly remarked to a medical friend
  who visited him soon after,
                                " this is the beginning of the end," and so
  it proved. The paralytic symptoms soon increased and confiuwd him to
   his bed.   He retained his consciousuess until within the last two days
   of his life, though his power of speech had latterly become much
   impaired.    At length, on the 11th December, he sank into a slumber,
   and so, near midnight, came the final rest for which he had longed and
   prayed.
       Thus passed away one of the wisest and best of men, and one
    who, by universal consent, was regarded as the most complete illus
    tration of the very highest type of a physician.      His own lectures

                                        ix
and    public addresses afford the best and fullest illustration of his
mind and character ; and that he taught no less by example than by
precept was known and acknowledged by all who had the privilege of
his acquaintance.       He was, in fact, a living embodiment of the prin
ciples which he so eloquently expounded in his lectures.
    One of his most remarkable and admirable characteristics was his
freedom from prejudice, and the judicial impartiality with which he
weighed and considered any facts or arguments which might be
adduced in opposition to principles and doctrines which he had
adopted and publicly taught.          A writer in the " British Medical
          "                  "
Journal       says of him :     The opinions which he formed were always
provisional — formed upon the best evidence then available, but subject
to revision.      The last edition of his celebrated lectures testifies to his
rare gift of judicial impartiality, and to the admirable candour and
philosophic modesty with which he revised and altered the opinions
of earlier years, and the unfaltering courage with which he avowed
such changes of opinion.         Among the most notable instances of such
changes were the new doctrines which he accepted with regard to the
theory of the change of type of disease and the pathology of cholera.
 In both instances he had watched with careful study the progress of
medical knowledge, and in neither did he hesitate at the close of the
controversies to which they gave rise, to declare himself convinced
in a sense contrary to his former opinion, and to set forth with the
utmost clearness and graceful simplicity the new conclusions to which
he had been      led."
    We have      it on the best authority that when        one of his medical
 friends reproached him for having, in the last edition of his lectures,
 adopted and given his sanction to so many novel doctrines, his reply
 was,                 I
       " Although am advanced in years "
                                                   (he was then nearly eighty)
 "I
     hope   I  am  not too old to learn   ;
                                            "
                                               and so to the very last he con
 tinued to take a keen interest in the progress of medical science, and
 the improvement of medical practice.
                                                                        G. J.
    Rosert    Alfred Cloyne Godwix-Austen            was the eldest son of the
late   Sir Heury E. Ansten, of Shalford House, near Guildford, a
 gentleman who was for some time an officer in the Household of
William IV, and received the honour of knighthood.              The subject of
 this notice was born at his father's house on the 17th March, 1808.
    Robert A. C. Austen, as he was then called, was sent to a school
 situated at   Midhurst, in Sussex, which at that time had a very high
 reputation. This school, which was an ancient foundation, had for
 its head-master Dr. Bay ley, an Oxonian of great classical erudition,
 who had been       an assistant-master     at Winchester,  and conducted the
 establishment on the plan of the great public schools. It is a remark-

 able   circumstance   that Charles    Lyell had  some  time before been
 educated in the same school.       If  we may judge, however, by the
 amusing sketch given in Lyell's Autobiography (" Life and Letters,"
 1881) of the rough and almost brutal system adopted in the school,
 there can have been nothing in the studies, the associations, or the
 influences of the school at all calculated to foster that love of natural
 science which became so conspicuous in the after lives of both Lyell
 and Austen.     After spending some time at Midhurst, Robert Austen
 went to France, and in a semi-military school there laid the foundation
of that knowledge of the French language and its literature which
 proved so useful to him in his subsequent scientific labours.
    The career of young Austen at Oxford, where he was next sent,
 must have commenced somewhat early, for before he had reached the
 age of twenty-two he had taken his degree and been elected a Fellow
 of Oriel College. At Oxford he was, like Lyell, a pupil of Buck-
 land's, and under his persuasive influence imbibed that passion for
 geological study which henceforth became the distinguishing feature
 of his life.
    Destined  by fortune for the life of an English country-gentleman,
 Robert Austen in 1830 became a student of Lincoln's Inn, and the
 knowledge of law which he there acquired was doubtless of great
 service to him during after years in the discharge of his duties as a
justice of the peace.       But it is clear that at this time Austen's
studies were not entirely devoted to the law.       At Lincoln's Inn he
met Lyell, then just returned from his geological explorations in the
south of Europe, and engaged in the completion of the first volume
of his " Principles of Geology ;" Leonard Horner, then Warden of the
 London University, and Murchison were also resident in London ; and
on the 19th of March, 1830, Robert Austen, introduced by these
three friends, was elected a Fellow of the Geological Society.         At
that time Sedgwick was President of the Society, and De la Beche,
Whewell, Greenough, and the three friends already mentioned were
 among the most active Members of its Council. In listening to the
papers which described the numerous and important geological dis
coveries of that period, and to the debates, always animated and
instructive, often amusing, and sometimes stormy, which followed the
 reading of those papers, Robert Austen doubtless increased that
knowledge of the infant science, the foundation of which had been so
 well laid by the teachings of Buckland.
    In 1833 Robert Austen was married at Teignmouth to Maria
Elizabeth, the only daughter, and afterwards the heiress, of the late
Major-General Sir Heury Thomas Godwin, K.C.B. This officer at a
later date, namely, between the years 1851 and 1853, commanded the
Burmese Field Force during the campaigns which resulted in the
addition of the Province of Pegu to our Indian possessions. On the

death    of General Sir Heury Godwin, in October, 1884, Robert Austen
obtained     by Royal licence permission to add the name of Godwin to
that of Austen.
    In 1834 Ansten went to reside at Ogwell House, near Newton
Abbot, Devonshire.        Here he received frequent visits from Sedgwick
and his other geological friends.       No better centre for study could
have been selected by the young geologist.         The richly fossiliferous
Devonian limestones, the outliers of Cretaceous strata, and the
Tertiary deposits of Bovey Tracy, were all within easy reach, aud as
proof of the good use he made of his opportunities it may be men
tioned that De la Beche entrusted to him the construction of portions
of the Devonshire map, while Phillips found in the collection of
Ogwell House many of the choicest specimens figured in his " Palaeo
zoic Fossils of Cornwall, Devon, and West Somerset."          Between the
years 1834 and 1840 a number of valuable papers dealing with the
district in the West of England, where he had gone to reside, were
read by Robert Austen to the Geological Society, and published in
their Proceedings and Transactions.
    Returning to his native county in 1838, Robert Austen, after a
brief residence at Shalford House, went to live at Gosden House,
and subsequently at Merrow House, both situated near Guildford.
At    a later date, 1846, he removed to Chilworth Manor, in the same
county.      Here he was within an easy distance from London, and was
able to take an active part in the work and management of the
 Geological Society.      Between the years 1841 and 1876 he was fre
 quently a Member of the Council ; in 1843-44, and again in 1853-54,
 he was Secretary, and between 1865 and 1867 he acted as Foreign
 Secretary of the Society.       Although he was frequently nominated
 Vice-President, it was a subject of regret to all his geological friends
 that he could not be induced to accept the Presidency.        In 1849 he
 became a Fellow of the Royal Society.
     Upon Austen's return to his native county of Surrey, he com
 menced    that series of careful researches on the geology of the South-
 East of England, the results of which were laid before the Geological
 Society between the years 1843 and 1853, and did so much to extend
 oar knowledge      of the Wealden, the Neocomian, and the Cretaceous
 systems.     During the same decade he spent much time in yachting,
 always    making   use of  the opportunities afforded for pursuing his
 favourite studies, and in these he was encouraged and assisted by his
 friend and frequent companion Edward Forbes.         During these excur
 sions he made the observations which were embodied in a series of
  remarkable and suggestive essays on the valley of the English Channel
  and the drift of its shores, on the geology of the Channel Islands, the
  Boulonnais, and other parts of France.      Upon Forbes' death in 1854,
  Austen, acting as his literary executor, completed his two unfinished

                                      xii
works, " The Tertiary Fluvio-Marine Formation of the Isle of Wight,"
and " The Natural History of the European Seas."
   High as the reputation of Godwin-Austen (for so we must hence
forth call him) deservedly was         as a patient observer, an accurate
describer, and a close reasoner, he now began to give proof that his
abilities and sympathies were not confined to the narrower sphere in
which     he  had first won distinction.       His versatility of mind, his
capacity for doing work of a much higher order and for following
out the most difficult lines of philosophical investigation, began to be
displayed in a series of essays which have justly earned for him the
title of the " Physical Geographer of bye-gone periods."         The many-
sidedness of his mind was exhibited, not only in the circumstance that
 he was able to complete Forbes' Essay on the Distribution of Marine
Forms of Life, but by the fact that in 1840 he read before the
 Geological    Society a remarkable        and suggestive palaeontologies!
memoir ; the views which he at that time enunciated on the zoological
position of the extinct forms of Cephalopoda have perhaps not yet
received from naturalists       the attention which they deserve. At the
 British- Association meeting at Birmingham in 1849 we find him
treating with great ability two difficult questions of Botanical Morph
ology.
    Mr.   Godwin-Austen's various        studies  had   led him to consider
 carefully the conditions under which different geological deposits
 were formed.       Long ago he threw out the suggestion that the Old
 Red Sandstone and the Poikilitic strata are of lacustrine origin ;
 his interesting     essays on the occurrence         of blocks of granite
 and coal embedded in the midst of the chalk exhibit the same pre
 vailing tendency of his speculations.        Even before the year 1850 he
 had undertaken to write the " Geological History of the European
 Area," and he also contemplated the possibility of preparing an atlas
 exhibiting the distribution of land and water at different geological
 periods.    It is not difficult to gather from some of his later essays
 that in the course of time he became convinced of the impossibility of
 performing such a task in a manner which would have satisfied his
 accurate and critical mind ; but at this time a problem fortunately
 presented itself to him, which his extensive and minute knowledge of
 the geology of Southern Britain, Northern France, and Belgium, and
 his powers of insight and generalisation admirably fitted him to
 grapple with.
    That a ridge of palaeozoic, and possibly coal-bearing, rocks extends
 beneath the Secondary and Tertiary strata lying beneath the Mendip
 Hills and the Ardennes had been suggested with more or less dis
 tinctness by Buckland, Conybeare, and De la Beche in this country,
 and by De Beaumont, Dufrenoy, and Meugy on the Continent. Bat
 in his famous essay " On the Possible Extension of the Coal-measures

                                    xiii
beneath   the South-Eastern part of England," which was laid before
the Geological Society in 1854, Godwin-Austen not only made the
subject especially his own, and exhibited his exceptional ability for
dealing with geological     problems of the greatest intricacy, but he
accomplished what was perhaps the highest service to science at that
time, by convincing those who had not paid special attention to the
subject, that geology was now entitled to take its place in the family
of sciences, and was no longer, as the world generally regarded it, a
mass of crude theories and baseless speculations.        When, in the fol
lowing year, a deep boring at Kentish Town demonstrated the accu
racy of Godwin-Austen's reasonings, and established the truth of his
conclusions, it was felt that lustre had been reflected upon the science,
no less than upon its able votary.
   During his later years, Godwin- Austen was prevented by ill-health
from taking so constant and active a part in the management of
the Geological Society as formerly.       His devotion to science was,
however, unabated.      Almost every year he accompanied a party of
geological friends on some Continental tour ; and several of these
excursions gave rise to thoughtful and suggestive essays.        In 1862
he received from the Geological Society the Wollaston Medal.           Ho
also completed the revision of the south-eastern portion of the
Greenough Geological Map of England and Wales, for the second
edition, which was published in 1865.      In 1868, at Norwich, he filled
the Chair at the Geological Section of the British Association, deal
ing in a characteristic address with the geological history of the Basin
of the North Sea. At the Brighton meeting in 1872 he occupied the
same position, and discoursed upon the history and relations of the
Wealden deposits.
   In 1872, after the death of his father, Godwin-Austen went to reside
at Shalford House. In spite of physical infirmity, he took an active
part in the preparation of the Report of the Coal Commission, of
which he was a member, and in the movement which resulted in the
experimental sub- Wealden boring at Battle. He was almost to the
last an energetic and useful member of the magisterial bench and of
the county-boards of his native district. On the 25th November,
 1884, he passed away, after a protracted illness, his death occurring
in the house of his birth, the place where he had spent the earliest
and latest years of his active and useful life.
   Among his numerous family several sons have distinguished them
selves in the military profession, and his eldest son, Lieutenant-Colonel
Godwin-Austen, F.R.S., availing himself of opportunities of scientific
study during many years of work upon the Topographical Survey of
India, has made large contributions to our knowledge of the geology
and zoology of that country.                                  J. W. J.

Mr. Dillwyn, and other friends, he thenceforth made                     it   a   regular
pursuit, at first as a recreation, and in later years as his chief occupa
tion.     Articled at the age of seventeen to one of the principal
solicitors of his native town, he laboured diligently at his law studies,
but devoted his autumnal holidays to dredging along the coast.
                                                                                       In

 Society a
Britain," which was published in its Transactions ; and in the follow
ing year he was elected a Fellow. In 1836 he attended the meeting
of the British Association at Bristol;* and there first met Edward
 Forbes, with whom he afterwards formed an intimate friendship, which
 became valuable to both.             For while Gwyn Jeffreys made many im
 portant contributions to Forbes and Hanley's classical work on the
 British Mollusca, his own scientific horizon was enlarged byfcinter-
 course with the most philosophic and far-seeing British naturalist of
 his time. Gwyn Jeffreys continued for many years to be one of the
 most constant attendants at the Annual Meetings of the Association ;
 serving as Local Treasurer at its first meeting at Swansea in 1848, as
 President of the Biological Section at its Plymouth meeting iu 18774
 and as Vice-President of the Association at its second meeting at
 Swansea in 1880.          He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in
 1840, and    served    on  its Council in the years 1869 — 1871.
     Having entered into an advantageous partnership as a solicitor in
 Swansea, and married a daughter of R. J. Nevill, Esq., of Llangennech
 Park, Carmarthenshire, he applied himself assiduously to the busi
 ness of his profession ; but still carried on his conchological researches
 by systematic dredging during his vacations, at first in a row-boats
 but afterwards in a yacht, which he purchased for the purpose of
 extending his explorations to the northern part of the British seas,

»nd of working down to greater depths.              His inquiries early led him
to suspect that the marine Molluscan Fauna of the present time is the
direct continuation of that of the later Crag period ; and this idea
received strong confirmation from his finding many Crag shells, sup
posed to have become extinct, still living in the seas around Shetland
and the Hebrides.
    After having published, from time to time, numerous short papers
on the results of his explorations, Gwyn Jeffreys determined to bring
out a systematic treatise on British Conchology, not in rivalry with
the elaborate work of Forbes and Hanley, but on a less costly scale,
generic types only (instead of specific) being illustrated.              The first
volume of this treatise appeared in 1862, and the fifth and last in
1869.     He had previously removed from Swansea to London ; having
been called to the Bar in 1856, with the view of practising in the
 Court of Chancery and before Parliamentary Committees.                   In 1866,
however, he retired altogether from legal practice, with the view of
devoting his whole time to scientific work, and soon afterwards trans
ferred his residence to Ware Priory, Herts.            There, whilst taking an
active interest in the business of the county (of which he became
J. P., then D.L., and in 1877 High Sheriff), he continued his concho-
logical studies ; and, with his estimable and accomplished wife, gave
a hospitable       reception to his numerous scientific friends of all
countries.
    Gwyn Jeffreys's dredgings, having been hitherto prosecuted on
what is now regarded as the submerged portion of the Continental
platform, had not been carried deeper than 200 fathoms.                        But
the    feasibility of exploring much greater depths having been
demonstrated in the experimental cruise of the " Lightning
                                                                        " in

   Porcupine       Expedition was next year fitted out expressly for the
prosecution of still deeper explorations.          As both Dr. Carpenter and
Professor Wyville Th omson — who had been the joint promoters of
this research — were       precluded by their official duties from taking
charge of the work during the earlier part of the season, they were
very glad to avail themselves of Gwyn Jeffreys's offer to superintend
it ; and the results proved in every way satisfactory. During the first
cruise the dredge was successfully worked at the then unapproached
depth of 1476 fathoms, thus preparing the way for the great exploit
of the expedition, the 2435 fathoms' dredging in the second cruise.
Gwyn Jeffreys's Report of the First Cruise (" Proc. Roy. Soc," Nov. 18,
1869, vol. 18, pp.
                       415—423) mentions, among the most remarkable
novelties of his deepest dredgings, the singular Clypeastroid,                now
known as Pourtalesia          Jeffreysi,* and the beautiful little Orbitolite

            this was first brought up, it was supposed to be an entirely new form.
 On the return of the Expedition, however, Professor Wyville Thomson learned that

eye   for minute distinctions, a methodical habit of mind, scrupulous
exactness, and an excellent memory. He spared no pains to clear up a
doubtful point, and never satisfied himself with imperfect knowledge,
where there was more to be acquired.         Continuing to believe in the
permanence of species, and opposing the doctrine of evolution, he
nevertheless fully recognised the frequency of a wide range of varia
tion ; and his collection, instead of being restricted to type-forms, con
tained many interesting series of varietal modifications.         How im
portant is the careful and systematic study of Shells, in relation to the
existing geographical distribution of Molluscan species (both terres
trial and marine), and, through this, to the elucidation of the past
history of the globe, would not     need to be here pointed out,  if it were
not that among the present generation of naturalists such study finds
comparatively little appreciation.      It should never be forgotten that
(to go    no further   back  in  the  history of Geology) it was entirely
upon the Conchological comparisons of Deshayes, that Lyell founded
his division of Tertiary formations into Eocene, Miocene, and Pliocene
— a division which has stood the test of fifty years' thorough scrutiny.
And it will not be for the advantage of Science, if Conchology should
ever cease to attract competent workers.        No better model could be
set forth of what Conchological work should be, than that which is
presented in Gwyn Jeffreys's life-long labours, whose results are con
tained in the fifty-five years' series of papers (considerably exceeding
100 in number) which he communicated to the Societies of which he
was a Fellow, and to the pages of scientific Journals.
    It should not be left unmentioned that G wyn Jeffreys's excellent
business-habits caused his financial services to be sought by the
Linnaoan and Geological Societies, the treasurership of both of which
he held for several years ; and that as treasurer also of the Royal
 Society Club, his social qualities did much to promote its prosperity.

    John Christopher      Augustus Voslcker was born on September
 24th, 18-22, at Frankfort-on-the-Maine.       He was the fifth son, in a
 family   of  seven  sons   and   one  daughter, of Frederick Adolphus
 Voelcker, a merchant of that city, who died when his fifth son was
 only eleven years old. During his years of boyhood, Augustus suffered
 from very delicate health, which greatly retarded his early education.
 This he obtained at a private school in the town. About the age of
 twenty-two he went to the University of Gottingen, chiefly for the
 purpose of studying chemistry under, and of working in the labora
 tory of, Professor Wohler.
    At Gottingen he took the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, in 1846,
 the subject of his inaugural dissertation being the composition of tor-
 toiseshell.

                                       xix
    He also appears to have devoted his attention to the investigation
of some of the compounds of manganese, and of some other metals, on
which, in 1846, he published papers. In the same year he also pub
lished a paper on the occurrence of mannite in the roots of Triticum
repens ; and one on the analysis      of poppy-oil.
    It  was also whilst he was still at Gottingen, that Professor Mulder,
the distinguished Dutch chemist, paid a visit to Wohler at that place ;
and, on Wdhler's recommendation, Mulder engaged Voelcker as his
principal assistant, who accordingly returned with him to Utrecht,
where     he remained for some time.        Dr. Voelcker assisted Mulder in
his various investigations, and it was doubtless this work, and tho
connexions into which       it led him, that gave a direction to his future
studies and labours.
    At Utrecht, Dr. Voelcker commenced the investigation of           some of
the albuminous      compounds, and he continued the inquiry from time
to time    for some years afterwards    ; but the only record of this work
which has come under my notice is in papers read at the meetings of
the British Association for the Advancement of Science : in 1855 —
"
    On Caseine, and a Method of Determining Sulphur and Phosphorus
 in Organic Compounds in one Operation ;" and in 1857 — " On the
 Proportion of Organic Phosphorus in Legumine."
    During Dr. Voelcker's stay at Utrecht, Professor James F. W.
 Johnston, of Edinburgh, who was Chemist to the Agricultural
 Chemistry Association of Scotland, afterwards incorporated with tho
 Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland, paid a visit to Mulder,
 and he induced Dr. Voelcker to go to Edinburgh to take charge of
 the    laboratory of that Association.         He went to Edinburgh in
 February, 1847, and remained there until August, 184'J ; excepting
  that from November,     1848, to February, 1849, he spent at Durham, at
  the  University of   which   place Johnston was Professor of Chemistry,
 and for whom he lectured and worked in the laboratory there.
     At Edinburgh the whole responsibility of the position, both as
 analyst    and consulting      chemist, frequently devolved upon him,
  Professor Johnston spending much of his time at Durham, or being
 otherwise engaged. It was under these circumstances that he first
  gained experience in the requirements of practical agriculture ; for it
  was here   that for the first time he found himself constantly in com
  munication with practical farmers, learning from them their wants,
  and investigating and advising on the problems they brought before
  him for his solution.    Trained in analysis in the best schools of tho
  time, himself an acute observer, and having an eminently practical
  turn of mind, the responsibility        of his position greatly tended to
  develop his powers, and to give      him   that self-reliance which was his
  characteristic through life, and which, thoroughly sustained by know
  ledge, industry, and conscientiousuess, contributed in no small degree
                                                                    d 2

  to   his success as a teacher, a scientific adviser to the practical farmer,
  and in his profession as a Consulting Chemist generally.
      In August, 1849, after spending about two and a half years at
  Edinburgh, Dr. Voelcker was appointed Professor of Chemistry at the
 Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester ; and from this time began
 a still more active life of lecturing, writing, and experimenting.        His
 income at the College was small, but he supplemented it by writing,
 and by analytical work. The articles on chemical subjects in " Morton's
 Cyclopaedia of Agriculture," from the letter M to the end, were con
 tributed by him.
      It was about, or soon after this time, that he contributed papers on
 various subjects of investigation to some Scotch scientific and agri
 cultural journals.        For example, to the " Edinburgh New Philo
                         "
 sophical Journal,"         Analysis of the Anthracite of the Calton Hill,
                             " Annals and
 Edinburgh ;" to the                         Magazine of Natural History,"
 " On the Chemical Composition of the Fluid in the Ascidia of
Nepenthes;"
                   " On the Composition of the Ash of Arrneria maritime
growing in Different Localities, with Remarks on the Geological
 Distribution of that Plant, and on the Presence of Fluorine in
Plants;" "On the Watery Secretion of the Leaves and Stems of the
Ice Plant."       To the " Transactions of the Highland and Agricultural
                              "
Society of Scotland,"           The Chemical Composition of the Seed of
 Chenopodium quinoa ;" "Composition of House Coal Soot;" "On
Artificial Manures in General and Bone Manure in Particular ;" " The
Effects of Burnt Clay as a Manure ;" " On the Comparative Value of
White Scottish and Black English Oats ;" and " On the Composition
of Rice Meal."
     In 1852 Dr. Voelcker went to Frankfort to be married, and he
returned to Cirencester with his wife.         Mrs. Voelcker, four sons and
one daughter, survive to mourn his loss.
     In  1855 Professor    Voelcker was appointed Consulting Chemist to
the Bath      and  West  of  England Agricultural Society, and he held the
office up to the time of his death, a period of nearly thirty years.        In
this capacity he gave lectures at various places from time to time,
instituted field and other experiments,         conducted much laboratory
investigation, and contributed papers to the Journal of the Society.
     In 1852 his first paper in the " Journal of the Royal Agricultural
                         "             He also contributed one in 1855, one
Society of England          appeared.
in 1856, and one in 1857. In that year, 1857, he was appointed Con
sulting Chemist to the Society ; and from that time to the date of his
death, about twenty-seven years, he contributed one or more papers
to every half-yearly number of the Society's Journal.
    For about six years after his appointment as Consulting Chemist
to the Society, he still retained his Professorship at Cirencester; and
he     availed   himself of the opportunities      which the College     farm

                                        xxi
afforded for carrying out various experiments at the homestead and
in the field, which were supplemented by collateral laboratory investi
gations.      He had already commenced an investigation into the com
position of farmyard manure, and as to the changes it undergoes
under various circumstances, such as in contact with different
soils.
     From the results obtained in these inquiries, he was led to investi
gate the absorptive powers of different soils of known composition ;
and he showed that the most important soluble constituents of manures
are rendered      less   soluble, but not quite insoluble, when applied to
the soil.
     In the course of his inquiries, he instituted numerous field experi
ments with different manures, on different crops, on the College
 farm; and he also endeavoured to enlist the co-operation of intelligent
 practical farmers in different localities in the conduct of field experi
 ments.
     In 1878, he became responsible for the conduct of the systematic
 series   of field experiments which, in the previous year, had been
 commenced at Woburn, on behalf of the Royal Agricultural Society,
 at the instance, and at the cost, of His Grace the Duke of Bedford.
 To the last he took the deepest interest in the management and in
 the results of these experiments.
     Very soon after he had devoted himself to agricultural chemistry,
  Dr. Voelcker commenced to pay attention to the various aspects of
 the subject of the feeding of animals.       He had not the same facilities,
 either for conducting feeding experiments himself, or for arranging
  with others to conduct them, that he had in case of field experiments
 with manures.         He, however, not only wrote and lectured on the
  chemistry of the feeding process, but he analysed a very large number
 of food stuffs, both home-grown        and imported.    He determined the
 composition, in much detail, of most of the crops grown on the farm
 as food, of new plants proposed to be grown as food-crops, of hay, of
  various descriptions      of straw, of certain refuse matters, and so on;
 discussing at length their actual and comparative feeding value, as
  deduced from the results of his laboratory investigations.
     But perhaps the most essential service he rendered, in connexion
  with the composition and value of food-stuffs, was by his most elabo
  rate investigations,    microscopic and chemical, of the various matters
  entering   into  the composition of feeding-cakes, by his numerous
  analyses  of the various    cakes themselves, and by his fearless and per
  sistent exposure of what he considered injurious, or against the
  feeder's interest,   in the manufacture or composition of such articles,
  whether   resulting from carelessuess, ignorance, or fraud.
      The subject of Milk and the Dairy, which is one of rapidly growing
   importance to the British farmer, was early taken up by Dr. Voelcker,

                                     xxii
his first paper on the subject appearing in 1861.       In connexion with
this subject he has executed a great amount of analytical work, made
many experiments in dairy management, given several lectures, and
published not a few papers recording existing knowledge, and the
numerous results of his own investigations.
   In all his work and publications, the thorough manner in which he
sought to elucidate the connexion between practice and science is
conspicuous.     Many other questions of agricultural interest than
those which have been referred to, engaged his attention, such as —
the properties of soils in other aspects than those which have been
mentioned ; the composition and value of town sewage, and also of
earth-closet manure ; the chemistry of sugar-beet ; and the chemistry
of drinking-waters.
   From time to time Dr. Voelcker contributed papers to the Chemical
Society, and in some cases he gave the same results in less technical
form in the " Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society." Of those
communicated to both journals, the one involving by far the largest
amount of laboratory investigation, and leading to the most important
conclusions,   both practical and scientific, related to the composition
of   the  waters    of land-drainage,     and to the loss of plant-food
thereby.
   He was elected a member of the Chemical Society in 1849 ; was
several times a member of the Council of the Society ; and was one of
its Vice-Presidents at the time of his death. He was elected a Fellow
of the Royal Society in 1870. He was one of the founders, and one
of the first Vice-Presidents, of the Institute of Chemistry of Great
Britain and Ireland, established in 1877.
   On coming to London in 1863, in addition to his duties as Con
sulting Chemist to the Royal Agricultural Society, Dr. Voelcker
c ,mmenced private practice as a Consulting Chemist, and very soon
acquired considerable repute in this capacity, and gained a very
extensive practice, not only in connexion with agriculture, but with
many other industries, being frequently called upon to give evidence
before Parliamentary Committees or Royal Commissions.
   There can be little doubt that his life was shortened by overwork.
 On Sunday, December 23, 1883, he had an attack of paralysis, not
severe, but such as to indicate that absolute rest was essential for
some considerable time    ; the Council of the Royal Agricultural  Society
accordingly requested him to devote six months to the restoration of
his health.    As soon, however, as he felt some recovery of strength,
it was impossible to restrain him from returning more or less to his
active duties.    He had no return of paralysis, but in August, 1884,
symptoms of heart disease, with other complications, supervened.
From this time    he never  really rallied, and he died on the morning of
December 5.      For  some   weeks he had suffered intensely; and not

                                       XX111
many days before his death, his sufferings were indeed very painful
to witness. His mind was, however, perfectly clear ; he fully recog
nised his position, and was entirely resigned to it. He passed away
quietly, and without any pain towards the last. — J. H. G.
     Charles Adolphe Wurtz was born at Wolfisheim,           a  village near
Strasburg,       on the 26th November, 1817.
      His   father, Jean Jacques Wurtz, the Protestant minister at
Wolfisheim, was a man of considerable literary culture, but of a
somewhat gloomy disposition.           His mother, Sophie Kreiss, was singu
larly cheerful and sweet-tempered, had a sound clear head, and was
most conscientious in the discharge of her duties in life.           She was
 the intimate friend and confidant of her son until her death, which
 took place quite recently, namely in 1878.
      Young Adolphe spent his early childhood at Wolfisheim, and he
 probably owed to his country life as a child the robust health which
 he enjoyed in after life.
      As Wolfisheim was not many miles from Strasburg, the Wurtz
 family, although living in the country, were by no means isolated,
 and had frequent opportunities of enjoying the society of their various
  friends and relations.       Besides other friends, Madame Wurtz 's two
  brothers, Theodore and Adolphe Kreiss, would often come out to
  spend     Sunday at the parsonage, and the intelligent conversation of
  these two distinguished men probably contributed in no small measure
  to the moral and intellectual development of young Wurtz.
      In the year 1826 Jean Jacques Wurtz was appointed to the church
  of St. Pierre-le-Jeune, in Strasburg, and Adolphe now joined the
  classes of the Gymnase Protestant, a school of secondary instruction,
  founded by Jean Sturm at the period of the Reformation.
      As a schoolboy Adolphe Wurtz did not specially distinguish him
   self.   During the eight years    he attended the Gymnasium   he obtained
   several prizes   for diligence, one for geography, one for memory and
   elocution, besides mentions for history and geography, for Latin and
   Greek translation, mathematics, and French verse.         He appears to
   have worked       industriously and steadily at the various subjects
   taught him, but not to have particularly distinguished himself in any
   one.    Hence it is not surprising that his father, with his morose
   disposition, should on more than one occasion have told the boy
   that he would never do anything remarkable in life.
       A free course of botany was open to the pupils of the Gymnase
    Protestant, and in 1828 young Wurtz attended this course, which
    doubtless contributed to the development of his faculties of observa
    tion, and to give him his taste for natural history.  Years afterwards,
    when fully entered upon his career as a chemist, he still took a
    pleasure  in reading the works of the naturalist Oken.

                                    xxiv
   Although, owing to his father's poor circumstances, and more espe
cially to his gloomy disposition, Adolphe Wurtz's home was by no
means a cheerful one, the young people spent many pleasant hours at
the house of their grandfather, M. Kreiss. Besides this kind and
excellent man, there were the two uncles, Theodore and Adolphe,
the former of whom became to them as a second father, on the death
of his brother-in-law. M. Theodore Kreiss always took the wannest
interest in their studies, and was amply rewarded in after years by
their gratitude and affection, and by their success in life.
   The young people usually passed their holidays at the house of a
great aunt at Rothau, in the Ban de la Roche.        The excursions made
on these occasions amongst the mountains and woods of the neigh
bourhood,    and also to various factories, and to the mines and iron
works of Armont, were amongst Wurtz's pleasantest recollections in
after life.
   Adolphe Wurtz left the Gymnase in 1834, after taking the degree
of Bachelier    es Lettres.    It was his father's earnest wish that he
should    now   attend  a   course of instruction as a preparation      for
theology,   but the youth had already contracted a love of science.
For some time past he had been      making chemical and physical experi
ments in the laundry attached        to his father's house.  His mother
made no objection to this, but      his father looked upon such pursuits
as both a waste of time and of     money, and occasionally even went so
far as actually to demolish the little brick furnaces which the future
chemist had the ingenuity to build up.
   Wurtz's strong inclination for chemistry was no doubt fostered by
his intercourse with Emil Kopp — afterwards the distinguished
chemist, who in later years was one of his fellow workers at the
Dictionnaire de Chimie.
   The youth at last announced that he wished to make chemistry
his profession, but his father refused his permission, insisting on his
son taking up either theology or medicine.         The youth decided on
the latter, and this selection of medicine was probably influenced by
the opportunity it would afford him of pursuing his favourite study,
as he would have to attend a course of chemistry, and would have
access to a laboratory.
   Wurtz    soon  became (in 1835) second and before long full assistant
in the chemical and pharmaceutical department.          At a competitive
examination in 1839, he was appointed Chef des Travaux Chimiques
 de la Faculte, on which occasion he wrote an essay : " Histoire
Chimique de la bile a l'etat sain et a l'etat pathologique."  He fulfilled
the duties of this new post under the direction of M. Caillot until he
left Strasburg.
   It was thus that whilst regularly and quietly pursuing his medical
studies and passing the necessary examinations, Wurtz became a

                                       XXV
chemist.       All this earnest and arduous work did not, however, pre
vent him from joining in the various amusements going on in his
family.       He had a good voice and was fond of singing, and in such a
musical city as Strasburg there was plenty of scope for this accom
plishment. In the year 1843 he took the degree of Doctor of Medicine,
and 'on this occasion he read a thesis " Essai sur l'albumine et la
fibrine," which gained him a medal from the Faculte. He now ob
tained the permission of his family to go for a year to Giessen, where
Liebig had opened the first laboratory for students. At Giessen he
became acquainted with Dr. A. W. Hofmann, with whom he main
tained a friendly intercourse through life. Here also he became in
timate with Strecker, with Hermann Kopp, and others. Liebig
received him in the most friendly manner, and entrusted him with
the translation of some of his papers into French. These translations,
which were sent to Paris for insertion in the " Annales de Chemie
 et de Physique," were the means of bringing Wurtz into contact with
some of the leading French men of science, and in particular with
 Dumas.
     It was in Liebig's laboratory that Wurtz began his investigation of
 hypo-phosphorous acid.
     On leaving Giessen he made a rapid trip to Vienna before return
 ing to Strasburg.      In 1844 he left Strasburg for good, and went to
 Paris with letters of introduction from Liebig. There he worked
 for a short time in Balard's laboratory, but very soon removed to the
 laboratory of Dumas, in the Rue Cuvier, where were also working
 Messrs. Cahours, Mellens, Lewy, Leblanc and Bonis.
     In 1845 he became assistant to Dumas at the ficole de Medecine,
 and it was whilst assisting Dumas that he made his great discovery
 of the compound ammonias, which had such an important influence
 on the progress of chemistry, and which gave the clue to the consti
 tution of the vegetable alkaloids.       It was also in Dumas' laboratory
  that he completed the beautiful investigation which he had begun at
  Giessen of the constitution    of the hypo phosphites.
     About this time he gave some instruction to M. Eugene Caventou,
  who became one of his most intimate friends.           The father of this
  young man, M. Caventou, the discoverer of quinine, was not slow
  to perceive the merits of young Wurtz, used frequently to invite him
  to   his house, and did his best to support him by his influence on
  various occasions.
     From 1845 to 1850, Wurtz held the appointment of Chef de
  Travaux Chimiques of the 3rd and 4th year students at the Ecole
  Centrale des Arts et Manufactures.
     In the year 1847, Wurtz distinguished himself greatly at the com
  petition for the Agregation de Chimie.        One legon which he gave on
   this occasion, " Sur  les Corps Pyrogenes,"   earned high praise.

                                    xxvi
   In 1845 he was employed in his capacity of Agri'ge to give Dumas'
course of lectures on Organic Chemistry, Dumas being prevented by
his political and administrative      occupations from attending to his
professional duties.
   Wurtz was at this time working in           a  dark and   inconvenient
laboratory,   situated in the Practical School of the Faculte            de
Medecine in the Musee Dupuytren. On taking possession of it              he
found it in such a state that the first thing he did was to go with his
assistant, M. A. Rigout, and buy a pot of colour and some brushes,
with which he himself painted the black and dirty walls. He was
not only particular about neatness and exactness in his work, but
attached importance to having a light, cheerful, well-kept labo
ratory.
   Desirous of getting more suitable conditions for work, Wurtz joined
in 1850 with two young chemists, Messrs. Charles Dolfus and
Verdeil, just returned from a course of practical chemistry under
Liebig — to open a laboratory in the Rue Garanciere.           The three
friends were each to carry on their separate experiments and to take
a few pupils, Charles Dolfus contributing the money needed for the
undertaking.     Wurtz was the real scientific director of the enterprise,
and this was practically the beginning of the laboratory in which he
accomplished such great work, and in which so many chemists have
been trained.     Amongst those who worked under his direction in the
Rue Garanciere, we may mention Mr. Marcet, well-known for his
labours in the department of Biological Science, M. E. Risler,
who was already working at the applications              of Agricultural
Chemistry,    and who afterwards became Director of the Institut
National Agronomique, and Adolphe Perrot, afterwards Wurtz's
assistant at the Faculte de Medecine.
   But though this enterprise of the three young chemists was under
taken to supply a real want — it was not successful ; unfortunately the
young men were not long able to keep possession of their laboratory,
for the house was very soon sold to a printer ; and they were obliged
to quit, and to sell off the fittings, &c, which had been a considerable
expense to them.
   It was at about this period that Wurtz became more or less inti
mately acquainted with various men afterwards distinguished in
science or literature.    Most of these were members of the Societe
Philomathque, sometimes called the Ante-Chamber of the Institute.
 Some of these friends were in the habit of meeting after dinner at     the
Cafe Procope before going to the meetings of the Society in             the
Rue Anjou-Dauphine.         Occasionally it would happen that the con
versation was so interesting that they prolonged their sitting at the
cafe, and did not go at all to the meeting of the Society ; but this
was no loss to science when the party consisted of such men as

                                       xxvii
 Wurtz, Foucanlt, Verdefc and Bregnet, Himly, Regnault, Robin and
 Serret.
    When the Institut Agronomique was founded at Versailles in 1850,
Wurtz was appoiuted Professor of Chemistry in it. His appointment,
however, was not of long duration, for the new institution was sup
 pressed in 1852 by the Prince President.          He lost his appointment
just   as  he  was  about  to marry,   and it was 25  years before this insti
 tution, so much needed for the promotion of agricultural science, was
 re-established.
    Wurtz was ere long amply compensated for this disappointment
by his election as Professor at the Faculte de Medecine in 1853.
 Dumas had resigned his chair, and Orfila, who had been Professor of
Mineral and Toxicological Chemistry, was dead.               The two chairs
were now united and Wurtz appointed to the post.             It might seem a
difficult task to replace two men of such talent and reputation, but
Wurtz was equal to the emergency, and for 30 years his lecture room
was crowded by students who flocked to hear him, attracted by his
 lucidity and masterly exposition.       Whilst lecturing, he would go from
 the table where his experiments were made, to the black board, all
 the time speaking with eloquence and vivacity, talking of chemical
 combinations with as much enthusiasm as though his subject had
 been the welfare of a State.        He always prepared his lectures care
 fully beforehand, and more and more carefully as years went on.
     The principal laboratory where Wurtz worked surrounded by his
 students had been taken in from the little lecture room of the
 Faculte. It was lofty, with a vaulted roof, and very light, and held
 about a dozen students besides the Professor.           The balances, which
 were placed on a little stand in the amphitheatre itself, were not
 accessible while the lectures were going on.        Several adjoining rooms,
 which were at first used for special experiments on a large scale, such
 as combustions, &c., had afterwards to be given up for the ordinary
 work for the additional students who came to Wurtz's laboratory.
     Wurtz had only a very moderate sum allowed him for the expense
 of his course, yet he managed with this and the help of some subscrip
 tions from his pupils not only to buy apparatus and substances, but
 to defray the expenses of various alterations and improvements.          His
 attempts     to get a larger allowance for these purposes never succeeded
  until years afterwards, when as Dean he obtained a rather larger
  salary, and first one, then a second assistant.
     In the year 1862, being then in London, on the occasion of the
  Universal Exhibition, Wurtz gave an address to the Chemical Society,
  " Sur                          considere comme un lien entre la Chimie
         l'Oxyde d'Ethylene
  Organique et la Chimie Minerale."
     In 1864, he being then in his 47th year,      he was elected a   Foreign
  Member of the Royal Society.

                                   xxviii
  In   1866 he accepted the post   of Dean at the Faculte   de Medecine.
In thus consenting to sacrifice a part of his valuable time to adminis
trative occupations, it was in the hope of promoting the development
of scientific instruction in the Faculte.    He succeeded, in fact, in
reorganising  it, got all the practical work placed on  a new footing,
especially  that of chemistry, obtained a laboratory of Biological
Chemistry for his pupil, M. Gautier, and that laboratories should
be put at the disposal of the clinical professors in the hospitals.
He was an active advocate for the admission of women on an
equal footing with men to the classes and examinations.      He likewise
took a considerable part in the planning and execution of the new
buildings of the Faculte, and of the Ecole Pratique.   His high-minded
courage enabled him to pull happily through      period of trouble, and
                                                 a
to retain the office of Dean until a period of tranquillity ensued.
   On two different occasions, in 1868 and in 1878, Wurtz visited the
principal German and Austrian University centres, bringing back
with him numerous documents, by the help of which he drew up two
elaborate reports on Foreign Chemical, Physiological, Anatomical,
and Pathological Anatomical Laboratories.
   Wurtz had held his professorship at the Ecole de Medecine for
twenty-five years, when in 1874 he was appointed to the new Chair
of Organic Chemistry, at the Sorbonne. He then resigned the office
of Dean at the Ecole de Medecine. He was named Honorary Dean,
distinctionwell earned by his many and long services, especially       by a
the courage he had shown during the disastrous time of the Commune,
never quitting his post until summoned to Versailles.
  Wurtz had long wished for the opportunity of teaching the higher
theories of chemistry, which he of course could not do to a class con
sisting chiefly of medical students, who for the most part took no
interest in the subject, except in as far asitwas necessary for passing
their examination.
   At the Sorbonne, Wurtz had no laboratory, and his experiments
had to be prepared in his old laboratory at the Ecole de Medecine, and
all the substances and apparatus to be carried to and fro for each
lecture.  Thanks to the energy of the Professor, and to the efficiency
of his able assistants, Messrs. Salet and CEchsuer de Coninck, the
course did not suffer from this unusual arrangement.   It was only    in
the last months of 1881, after the death of Heuri Sainte-Claire
Deville, that a small laboratory was given to Wurtz for preparing his
lecture experiments.    A new and more suitable laboratory was being
built for him in the Avenue de l'Observatoire, according to plans
drawn up by himself, pending the completion of which Wurtz and his
students remained at the Ecole de Medecine, and he was looking for
ward during the last few months of his life to occupying the new
buildings at the commencement of the following session.

                                   xxix
    During the siege of Paris Wurtz took an active interest in the
fate of the inhabitants of Alsace-Lorraine, who had crowded to
Paris. He was one of those who took part in the establishment of
the Societe de Protection des Alsaciens-Lorrains, which has been the
means of relieving so much suffering, and of founding in Algiers
three prosperous villages, peopled by refugees from those two pro
vinces. He was also one of the first shareholders in the flcole
Alsacienne, in which school the principles of instruction of the
Gymnase Protestant of Strasburg have been adopted with much
success.    He was an active member of the committees of several
charitable and other societies. He frequently spoke at the public
meetings of the Societé Protestant de Prévoyance et de Secours
Mutuels, of which he was Vice-President, M. Leon Say being Presi
dent.
    In the year 1880 he went to Bordeaux to take part as a member
of the Committee at the annual meeting of the Colonial Agricole de
Sainte-Foy. At this meeting he delivered a most eloquent address,
giving an account of the life of Felix Vernes, and of his services to
his country during the siege and to French Protestantism.
    Wurtz himself had worked most actively during the siege, both in
the ambulances and on the field of battle.         After the battle of
Buzenval, the Societe Francaise de Secours aux Blesses, of which he
was on the Council, entrusted him with the painful task of finding
the body of Heury Regnault. On the 23rd of January he reported
to the Academie des Sciences his failure to find the remains of the
son of his illustrious colleague.    As we now know, it was in the
cemetery of Pere la Chaise that the body was at last recognised,
amongst a crowd of others, on the 24th January.
    Wurtz remained to the end of his life firmly attached to the reli
gious belief in which he had been brought up. He was assiduous in
his attendance at the meetings of the Consistory and the Synods. He
contributed greatly to the reorganisation in Paris of the Strasburg
Faculte de Theologie Protestante, in which he continued to take an
active interest, and he also accepted the presidency of a society which
 was founded for the encouragement of theological study.
    He was of course a member of all the principal learned and
 scientific societies, both in France and abroad.     He became Vice-
 President of the Academie des Sciences in 1880, and presided at the
 sittings during the following year.   His numerous brilliant and scien
tific labours were appreciated abroad at least as fully as in France,
and certainly sooner. He became a Foreign Member of the Royal
 Society before he was admitted to the Institute. True it is that
 between the election of Balard to the Academie des Sciences, in
 1844, and that of Wurtz in place of Pelouze, in 1867, there was
 only one other election, that of 1857, when Frémy was chosen in pre

                                   XXX
ference to Heuri Sainte-CIaire Deville, Wurtz, Berthelot, and Cahours
 The Academic had already, however, given Wurtz every other distinc
tion it had to bestow. In 1859 it had awarded to him and his friend
Cahours jointly the Jecker Prize; in 1864 it had again conferred on
him the Jecker Prize     ; and in 1865     the great Biennial Prize of
20,000 francs was voted to him by the Institute.
    In 1881, the Copley Medal was awarded to him by the Royal
Society.
    During the siege of Paris he punctually attended the daily meetings
of the Comite' Superieure de Hygiene.       At these meetings had to be
considered the question of supplying food to the city, of the best
means of resisting epidemics, and of diminishing as far as possible
the immense mortality caused by the investment.       Among the mem
bers of this committee were H. Sainte-CIaire Deville, Gubler, Behier,
&c. Wurtz became President in 1879.
    He was also an active member of the Commission des Hopitaux
Civils et Militaires.
    He had been a member of the Academie de Medecine since 1856.
In 1871 he was chosen President, and during the whole of that
gloomy year he regularly took the chair at the meetings, with one
exception, that of the 23rd of May, during the disastrous period of
the Commune.       He took an important part in the discussions which
 were held in 1871, on vinage ; in 1874, on the water of Paris ; on the
phenomenon of fermentation in cells; on the products of cincho-
nine, &c.
    In 1877, during the rebuilding of the Faculte   de Medecine, Wurtz
moved into a provisional laboratory, which was arranged for him in
the old houses facing the Rue des ficoles and the Rue Hautefeuille.
This new laboratory was more commodious and better arranged than
the old one, and as there were more rooms, a better distribution of
the work could be made.      Wurtz now had his own private laboratory,
and he had also the gratification of being able to give a place in the
laboratory to his former teacher, Professor Caillot, who had left
Strasburg when the Germans took possession of Alsace.
    It was here that Wurtz worked during the remaining years of his
life, amidst a larger number of students than ever, and a little group
of disciples who had gathered around him.
    About the year 1856 there existed in Paris a society of young
chemists, who used to meet for mutual instruction.      In 1858 Wurtz
conceived the happy idea of transforming this association into a
learned society. He succeeded in obtaining the concurrence of Damas,
Balard, Sainte-CIaire Deville, Berthelot, Thenard, Pasteur, Cahours,
and others in this object.   He organised the " Bulletin," a periodical
in which are published the papers read before the Society, and also
the " Repertoire de Chimie Pure," which gives resumes of chemical

                                  xxxi
work published both in France and abroad. To this was added a
" Repertoire  de Chimie Appliquee," under the direction of M. Barreswil.
From the time of its foundation the Societe Chimique de Paris
took a high rank amongst scientific societies.          Wurtz himself
gave several lectures at the Society: one in 1860, "L'Histoire
G£nérale des Glycols ;" three in 1863, " Sur quelques points de Philo-
sophie Chimiques ;" and one in 1883, on
                                              " Aldol," with his usual
vivacity and enthusiasm.      He had been chosen Secretary of the
Society at the time of its foundation, and he several times filled the
office of President.   He was a frequent attendant at the meetings of
the Society, and often gave there his most interesting papers.
   Wurtz also organised in his laboratory a set of conferences, which
usually took place on Saturday afternoons, where sometimes he or
his students, or occasionally distinguished chemists of France and
other countries, gave an account of recent researches, and showed the
more important experiments.
   In 1872 he took an active part in the formation of an Association
for the Advancement of Science, similar to our British Association,
which has done so much for Great Britain. This new French Asso
ciation held its first Congress at Bordeaux, in 1872. Wurtz con
tinued to watch assiduously over its welfare.   In 1874 he presided at
the meeting at Lille, and on this occasion he gave the Association an
important and interesting discourse on " La Theorie des Atomes dans
la Conception Generale du Monde."
   In 1875 Wurtz had been persuaded to accept the office of Maire
of the VII" Arrondissement of Paris. He fulfilled the duties of this
post with his usual zeal and devotion, until 1881, when he was pro
posed for election to the Senate by the Centre Gauche, and elected
without opposition.    On the occasion of his nomination to the Senate
his numerous pupils, both French and foreign, took occasion to offer
him a testimonial of gratitude and affection.      They presented him
with a copy in bronze of Barrias' statue of Bernard Pallissy, on the
pedestal of which was engraved a dedication, with the names of 111
present and former pupils, amongst which we note Ch. Friedel,
 Lecoq de Boisbaudran, J. M. Crafts, Ladenburg, &c, &c.
    During the short time that he was a member of the Senate, Wurtz
appears to have spoken only once, namely, at the discussion of the
 law for permitting the importation into France of the American salted
 meats. He drew up for the Senate on this occasion an exhaustive
report on the Trichini, collecting together for the first time all the
 experience of France on the subject.
    In 1878 Wurtz gave the Faraday Lecture to the London       Chemical
 Society.   He selected for his subject " La Constitution de la Matiere
 a 1'etat Gazeux,"   dwelling especially on the beautiful researches of
 Faraday on the liquefaction of gases.     He was warmly welcomed by

                                      XXXI V
basic    acids,  and   on  the  production     of  aldol and   its  beautiful
derivatives.
   The classical investigations with which Wurtz euriched science
form but a small part of his work. He was one of the few French
chemists who founded a school, and the greater number of the
present generation of French chemists were his students.
   It might well be supposed that the labours of this great investigator
and teacher who had, in addition to his professional work, much
official  business and a considerable      social position, would   have left
him neither energy nor leisure for other work. Bnt he found time
for much else.        Besides being a brilliant lecturer and laboratory
teacher, he excelled as a writer. The case and rapidity with which
he wrote induced him to undertake            various literary works.       He
                     " Dictionnaire de Chimie      " in a marvellously short
brought out his
time, with tho aid of friends and pupils.         The elegantly written little
book " La Theorie Atomique
                                 "
                                    has long since been translated into all
the chief modern languages.        The " Lecons filementaires de Chimie
            " is a model of lucid
Moderne                            exposition.
   The fundamental featuro of Wurtz's character was a love of truth.
With this love of truth was combined a modest estimate of his own
merits, accompanied by tho most heartfelt         and generous appreciation
of the labours of others.
                                                                 A. W. W.

                                    xxxiii
 few days to stay with one of his daughters at Cannes. There he had
 the pleasure of seeing once more his friend Dumas, who was apparently
 in good health. Very shortly after his return, he heard of Dumas'
 death.   He had just then business at Liege. He hurried through
 this as early as possible, for the sake of attending the funeral of his
 old master, and was imprudent enough to pass two consecutive nights
in railway trains. On reaching home, he got a notice that he was
expected to give an address over the grave of Dumas, on behalf of
 the Faculte des Sciences et Medecine.         He set to work at once to
compose the eloquent discourse which he delivered on this occasion.
But the strain on his powers was too great, and his friends noticed
with pain his altered appearance. Still he went on with his work,
and resumed his lectures, though with visible effort. He gave his
last lecture on the 27th April with his usual animation, but at the end
was in a fainting state. He was now obliged to give up, and, as he
himself remarked with some pride, it was the first time during a
professorship of thirty years that he had put up a notice announcing
that his state of health prevented his lecturing.       Still his condition
was not considered serious, and he himself did not appear to have any
misgivings about his health. He was full of the idea of replacing his
illustrious master, Dumas, as Secretaire Perpetuel of the Academie
des Sciences. He consulted some of his friends on this subject. They
seeing that he was overdone by his work, yet feeling how desirable it
was that he should hold this appointment, urged him to apply; but at
the same time to give up more than an equivalent part of his other
work. This he promised to do, and they still hoped to see him at the
head of the Academie.       But disease was making rapid progress, and
he expired on the 12th of May, after a few days' illness, and only one
month after paying his last tribute to the memory of Dumas.
    He was followed from his home in the Boulevard St. Germain to
his grave in Pere-la- Chaise by an immense procession, consisting of
official deputations from the Senat, the Institut, and various learned
institutions with which he was connected, and of hundreds of
students principally from the ficole de Medecine and the Faculte des
Sciences.
   The labours of Wurtz have exerted a powerful influence on the
development of chemistry.        Among his most important discoveries
may be mentioned those of the compound ammonias and the glycols,
by which two extensive and fertile provinces were opened up in
organic chemistry.       His researches on the mixed alcohol radicals
threw great light on the constitution of hydrocarbons, which had been
the subject of a long controversy.        He also made important experi
ments on dissociation.     He discovered bntylic alcohol.     Other impor
tant investigations were his synthesis of glycerine, and of neurine,
his elaborate investigation    of lactic acid, his researches on the poly-
    vol. xxxvm.                                                    e

                                       xxxiv
  basic   acids,   and  on   the  production   of aldol and   its beautiful
  derivatives.
     The classical    investigations with which Wurtz euriched science
  form but   a small   part of his work. He was one of the few French
 chemists     who founded a school, and the greater number of the
 present generation of French chemists were his students.
    It might well be supposed that the labours of this great investigator
 and teacher who had, in addition to his professional work, much
 official business and a considerable social position, would have left
 him neither energy nor leisure for other work. But he found time
 for much else.        Besides being a brilliant lecturer and laboratory
 teacher, he excelled as a writer. The ease and rapidity with which
 he wrote induced him to undertake various literary works.               He
 brought out his " Dictionnaire de Chimie
                                                 " in a
                                                        marvellously short
 time, with the aid of friends and pupils.      The elegantly written little
 book   "                          "
          La Theorie Atomique has long since been translated into all
 the chief modern languages.         The " Lecons Elementaires de Chimie
 Moderne
            "  is a model of lucid exposition.
    The fundamental feature of Wurtz's character was a love of truth.
 With this love of truth was combined a modest estimate of his own
 merits, accompanied by the most heartfelt and generous appreciation
 of the labours of others.
                                                               A. W. W.
    William Spottiswoode was born in London on January 11th, 1825.
 He was descended from an old and distinguished Scottish family, of
whom, perhaps, the most notable character was John Spotiswood,
the Archbishop of St. Andrew's, who crowned Charles             I at Holy-
rood, and was the author of " A History of the Church of Scotland."
Andrew Spottiswoode, the father of William, was himself a man of
no ordinary attainments ; he represented Colchester for some time in
Parliament, and in 1831 was admitted into partnership with George
Eyre as one of Her Majesty's printers. His wife, William's mother,
was of the Longman family, well known from its connexion with the
celebrated publishing firm.
    Of the early days of William Spottiswoode there is but little to tell.
His school life began at Laleham under a brother of Dean Buckland.
From Laleham he went to Eton, but his stay there was short, as the
first recorded development of his scientific tastes resulted in an
explosion which, though effecting no damage to his moral reputation,
was deemed inconsistent with sound discipline. He was accordingly
moved to Harrow, then under Dr. Wordsworth, and was there placed
in the upper " shell." After continuing three years at Harrow, where
he had the reputation for being studious and thoughtful, he in 1842
obtained a Lyon Scholarship and went to Balliol College, Oxford.

                                     XXXV
His mathematical tutors there were Dr. Temple, the present Bishop
of London, and afterwards the Rev. Bartholomew Price, who had the
highest opinion of his industry and power of work. His range of
reading is said to have      been   very extensive.    In  1845  he took his
B.A. degree     as a first-class  in mathematics, and in 1846-7 gained
successively the Senior University and the Johnson's Mathematical
Scholarships.
    In 1846 Mr. Spottiswoode left Oxford to take his father's place as
Queen's printer, but he kept up his connexion with the University,
delivering a course of lectures at his college on solid geometry, and
acting in 1857-8 as Examiner in the Mathematical Schools.
    The business of the Queen's Printing Office continued to occupy his
close attention until his death. The great powers which he possessed
as an organiser     and master of detail ensured the advancement and
complete commercial success of this great establishment, and rendered
of real efficiency his unceasing efforts to promote the physical and
moral welfare of his workpeople.
    Mr. Spottiswoode began to communicate to the world the results of
his mathematical     researches in 1847, when he issued a series of five
                                  " Meditationes
pamphlets, which he entitled                       Analyticae."   These con
tained thirteen essays on a variety of mathematical topics, including
the curvature of surfaces, virtual velocities, infinitesimal analysis,
physical astronomy, and the calculus of variations.         After a pause of
three years, he in 1850 sent three brief papers to the " Philosophical
            " on
 Magazine         quaternions, and from that time forward his commu
 nications to the leading English and foreign mathematical societies
 and journals were poured out in an almost continuous stream. In a
list of his publications which is before the writer, four years only of
 his subsequent life, viz., 1858, 1867, 1869, and 1878, appear with
 out some record of mathematical work committed to the press. Much
 of this no doubt was of a slight and fugitive character, consisting
 merely of new proofs by elegant methods of known theorems, or notes
 of ideas suggested by the papers of others which the wide range of
 his college reading enabled him to follow without difficulty, so that
 but few were allowed to escape his attention.        But of important and
 original work there was an abundance. The interesting series of
 communications on the contact of curves and surfaces which are con
 tained in the " Philosophical Transactions
                                                 " of 1862 and
                                                                  subsequent
 years, would alone account for the high rank he obtained as a
 mathematician.     It would not be possible to discuss in any detail the
 various mathematical writings which have established the reputation
 of Mr. Spottiswoode without the use of complex symbolical expres
 sions quite inconsistent with the objects of a brief obituary notice.
 In truth, the mastery which he had obtained over the mathematical
 symbols was so complete that he never shrank from the use of

                                 xxxvi
expressions, however   complicated,     nay, the more complicated they
.were the more he seemed to revel     in them, provided they did not sin
against the ruling spirit of all his work — symmetry.
   To a mind imbued with the love of mathematical symmetry the
study of determinants had naturally every attraction.         In 1851 Mr.
Spottiswoode published, in the form of a pamphlet, an account of
some elementary theorems on the subject.        This having fallen out of
                                                 "         "
print, permission was sought by the editor of Crelle to reproduce it
in the pages of that journal.    Mr. Spottiswoode granted the request,
and undertook to revise his work. "The subject had, however, been
so extensively developed in the interim, that it proved necessary not
merely to revise it, but entirely to rewrite the work," which became a
memoir of 116 pages. To this, the first elementary treatise on deter
minants, much of the rapid development of the subject       is  due.   The
effect of the study on Mr. Spottiswoode's own methods was most
pronounced  ;  there is scarcelya    page of his mathematical writings
that does not bristle with determinants.
   Two communications made by Mr. Spottiswoode in 1860 and 1863
to the Royal Asiatic Society upon mathematical subjects, should be
specially referred to.    In brief note in the Journal of that Society
                            a
(vol. xvii, pp. 221
                    —  222) he discusses the claims of Bhdskarachary,
an Indian astronomer, to the discovery of the principle of the dif
ferential calculus
                 ;  and in a  more lengthy article in vol. xx, pp. 345 —
370, of the same publication, he translates into modern symbols the
formulae made use of by the Hindoos in calculating eclipses, contained
in the " Surya Siddhanta." The acquaintance which he had with
this work was formed by reading     it  in the original tongue, for among
his varied acquirements he possessed a remarkable knowledge of
several European and Oriental languages.
   Mr. Spottiswoode was not a traveller in the usual extensive mean
ing of the term, but he has left us an interesting record of a journey
which he made in 1856 through Eastern Russia, entitled " A Taran-
                                                                     "
tasse Journey through Eastern Russia in the Autumn of 1856        ;    and
in 1860, in company with his brother and sister, he accomplished an
                                            a
expedition through Croatia and Hungary.
   In 1861 Mr. Spottiswoode was married to the eldest daughter
of the late William Urquhart Arbuthnot, a distinguished member of
the Indian Council.
   In 1871 Mr. Spottiswoode turned his attention to experimental
 physical science.    The resources at his command enabled him to
furnish his laboratory on scale which rendered
                          a                         it    in some respects
 unique.   The gain to the scientific world was not due merely to his
 own experiments, as, with characteristic generosity, he was always
 ready to advance the discoveries of others by the loan of the costly
 and beautiful apparatus with which he had surrounded himself, and

                                   xxxvii
  in the perfecting of which he had spent much care and ingenuity.
  His earliest researches bore on the phenomena of the polarisation of
  light, upon which he wrote an admirable little handbook, published in
  the "Nature Series."     At a later period he made a number of com
  munications to the    " Proceedings   of the Royal Society " on the
  electric discharge in rarefied gases.    In 1879 he was joined in his
 researches on this subject by Mr. J. F. Moulton, and in conjunction
 with him entered upon an investigation of the sensitive state of the
 discharge.    An important paper in the " Philosophical Transactions "
 of 1879 (pp. 165 — 229), and some shorter notes subsequently pub
 lished in the Society's " Proceedings," give in detail the singular and
 elegant results which were arrived at.
     The great beauty of the experiments involved in Mr. Spottiswoode's
 physical researches led to demands from his friends that they should
 be laid before the public in a popular form.     The lectures which he
 delivered to crowded audiences at the Royal Institution and elsewhere
 were characterised   by a remarkable clearness of exposition, and by a
 depth of poetic feeling which excited much surprise among those who
 knew of him only as an abstruse mathematician.        Perhaps the most
 interesting example of his powers as a lecturer is to be found in a
 discourse on " Sunlight, Sea, and Sky," delivered to working men at
the British Association Meeting in Brighton in 1872 ("Nature,"
vol. vi, pp. 333 — 336).    The reputation he acquired in these essays
 excited   high expectations with regard to the address which, as
 President of the British Association, he had to deliver in Dublin in
 1878.    These expectations were fully justified by the result.     The
stores of a mind imbued with the spirit of a philosopher, a mathe
matician, a physicist, and a poet, were drawn upon with no niggard
hand, and matters usually regarded as beyond the ken of others than
experts were explained to the unversed in language as interesting as
it was simple, clear, and precise. The judgment of his fellow-workers
could now be unhesitatingly approved by others.
     The honours which were bestowed on Mr.          Spottiswoode  were
many.      He was LL.D. of Cambridge, Dublin, and Edinburgh, and
D.C.L. of Oxford.      He was elected correspondent of the Institute
 (Academie des Sciences) for the Geometrical Section, after a sharp
contest with M. Borchardt. He was Fellow of the Royal Society of
Edinburgh, the Royal Astronomical Society, the Royal Asiatic
Society, the Royal Geographical Society, the Society of Antiquaries,
and the Ethnological Society.      He occupied the Presidential Chair of
Section A of the British Association in 1865, of the London Mathe
matical Society in 1870-2, of the British Association in 1878, of which
latter body he acted as Treasurer from 1861 to 1874.       Of the Royal
Institution he was Treasurer from 1865 to 1873, and Secretary from
1871 up to his death.     He was also a Trustee of the British Museum.

                                    xxxviii
    The Fellowship of the Royal Society was conferred upon him in
1853.     After having served several times upon the Council, he in 1871
became Treasurer, a position which he held up to 1878, in November
of which year he succeeded to Sir J. Hooker as President.                One more
fully qualified to occupy this important post it would be difficult to
find. To a manner in which sweetness and dignity were singularly
blended, he added an unfeigned interest in the work of others, in
whatever field it lay, and a rare quickness of appreciation of its
merits ; while his love of society and liberal hospitality had surrounded
him with a wide circle of distinguished friends both English and
foreign.
    Death overtook Mr. Spottiswoode while he was yet in the prime of
life and in the full vigour of his intellect.      A serious tricycle accident
some months before had lowered his strength so that he was unable
 to resist an attack of Roman fever, complicated by congestion of the
lungs ; and thus he passed away on the morning of June 27, 1883.
    His remains rest in Westminster Abbey.              If further words are
 needed to justify the claims of William Spottiswoode, President of the
 Royal Society, to such an honour, none better or more eloquent could
 be selected than those uttered over his scarcely closed grave by the
 Dean of Westminster,        words which supply that reference to the
 beauty of his character, without which this brief sketch of him would
 be indeed imperfect.
                           " Those to whom his memory is dear need not
 blush to think that he lies near those whose thoughts have euriched,
 whose examples have guided, or whose lives have served mankind ;
 that he rests there not as a thinker only, not as a student only, but as
 a citizen of England, as a gifted worker in the fair domain of know
 ledge, as a busy worker in the manifold range of active life, and that
 he carried into each sphere the same minute and careful and constant
 and untiring industry, the same rare powers, the same high aim of
 serving truth, of serving man, and of serving God.            .   .   .   He was
 emphatically by      nature  and   by choice   a  man   of  science.     His own
 special and more cherished studies lay in those high and abstract
 regions which are traversed only by the few.             He moved with ease,
 we   are told, on  heights  where   others   can  scarcely draw their breath.
  He did not devote himself to those great fields of knowledge, success
  in which at once appeals to the imagination of us who stand outside
  the circle of the true students of science.     We can point to no marked
  and tangible result of his labours such as comes at once to the mind
  of the passing visitor, or may be brought home to the comprehension
  of even the least instructed stranger, as he stands on the grave of a
  Newton, or a Herschel, or a Lyell, or a Darwin.           Yet he was, in the
  truest sense   of  the  words,  a  man   of  science.    Devout    in soul and
  uuperplexed in faith, he never, we are told, cared for one single
   moment to speak of science in the sense implied in the often misused

                                   xxxix
phrase as
            '
              the handmaid    of religion.' He looked on the study of
science as,   I might even    say, part of his religion, as the pursuit
of truth, truth only, truth for her own sake ; a pursuit to be followed
up independently, fearlessly, faithfully, to whatever results patient
and enlightened, but impartial and honest, investigation should lead
the inquirer. He shrank from all attempts to divert, or to confuse,
or to limit the aim of the student by putting before him any other
one consideration than that of the pressing forwards to what was
clear, true, and demonstrable within his own department.         .    .  .
And to all who followed truth in the same spirit he turned with an
instinctive and cordial sympathy.      He won men's hearts, we hear, by
an unassuming and unselfish gentleness.        But he did more. The
variety of mental powers which enabled him to hold the threads of
the many branching lines of the ever expanding studies of his age,
which touched with poetry his treatment of the most abstruse themes,
and gave a rigorous accuracy to his management of the smallest detail
of his business, was united to an attractiveness and transparency of
character, and a spotless integrity and uprightness which secured
men's confidence.     .  .  .  And if he lies not far from those whose
genius  — very different to his own — has enlarged the bounds of human
thought, and embodied sometimes in immortal clothing the various
chords of human feeling and emotion, it is something to feel that
rarely beneath this roof has been laid one of a purer or more spotless
life."

    Peter William Barlow, whose death occurred on May 19th,         1885,
 was the eldest son of the late Professor Barlow.
    He was educated at private schools, and having at an early age
selected civil engineering as his profession, became a pupil of the late
 Mr. Heury Palmer, Member of the Institute of Civil Engineers, under
 whom he was engaged on the Liverpool and Birmingham Canal and
 the then New London Docks.
    The active demand for railways which followed the opening of the
 Liverpool and Manchester Railway, caused him to be employed in the
 preliminary surveys and studies of the county of Kent, with reference
 to a railway to Dover, and in 1836 he acted as resident engineer under
 the late Sir William Cubitt, on the central division of the London and
 Dover Railway, which formed the nucleus of the present South
 Eastern system. He subsequently became resident engineer of the
 whole line, and afterwards the engineer-in-chief, during which period
 he constructed the North Kent, the Tunbridge and Hastings, and
 many other lines in connexion with the South Eastern system. He
 also constructed the Londonderry and Enniskillen, and the London
 derry and Coleraine, and other railways.

    As illustrating the activity and energy with which railway enter
 prise was carried on at the time, it may be mentioned that the
 Tunbridge Wells Branch, which forms the first portion of the
 Tnnbridge and Hastings line, was carried into execution by consent
of the landowners and occupiers before the Act of Parliament which
authorised its construction was obtained.
    In 1858 Mr. Barlow investigated in great detail the construction of
 bridges of large span, especially with the view of stiffening the road
ways of suspension bridges, and in pursuance of those studies he went
to Niagara, in order to examine personally the great railway and road
bridge erected there by Roebling.
    Mr. Barlow's latest public engineering works were the Lambeth
 Bridge, which has since been purchased by the Metropolitan Board of
 Works, and the Tower Subway, the latter work having attracted much
 attention from the originality of its conception and the cheapness and
rapidity of its construction.     This subway is formed of cylindrical
rings of cast iron, and by forcing forward a cylindrical shield, it was
constructed from the north to the south side of the river (900 feet) in
fourteen weeks.      Although of small dimensions, and only adapted for
foot passengers, it is extensively used by the working classes, who were
formerly entirely dependent on the ferry.
    After the completion of these public works, he erected an iron
bridge on the River Lea, and had surveys made for a tunnel under
the harbour of Rio de Janeiro for the Brazilian Government.
    In 1881 he suffered under an attack of cataract, which entirely
deprived him of sight for several months.         A successful operation
restored the use of one of his eyes sufficiently to enable him to read.
He was, however, no longer able to pursue his professional career with
the zeal and energy which characterised the earlier part of his life.
    Mr. Barlow was the author of several scientific papers, among which
the following may be mentioned : —
    " An Investigation of the Laws which govern the Motion of
Steam Vessels," " Phil. Trans.," 1834.
                                                  subjected," " Civ. Eng.

   He became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1845.       He joined the
Institution of Civil Engineers in 1827, and at the time of his death
was the oldest Member of that Institution.                   W. H. B.
