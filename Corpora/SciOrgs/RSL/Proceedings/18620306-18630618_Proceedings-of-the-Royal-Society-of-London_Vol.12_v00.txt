      February 20, 1862.
   In   a note on the   Action of Tetrachloride of Carbon on Aniline
submitted to the Royal Society on the 17th of June,                 1858,  I have
described a crystalline     basic    derivative    of aniline formed by the
coalescence    of three molecules of ammonia, viz. carbotriphenyltri-

of a magnificent crimson colour.
   It may be useful to quote here the passage

to, in which the formation         of the colouring      matter is mentioned.
"On     submitting   a mixture      of 3^-  parts by weight       of aniline and
1  part   of bichloride  of carbon, both in the anhydrous state, for
about thirty hours to a temperature of            1 70°  C,   the liquid will be
found to be converted into a black mass, either soft and viscid, or
hard and brittle, according to time and temperature.
   " This   black mass, which adheres firmly to the tubes in which the
reaction has been accomplished, is a mixture of several bodies.                On

exhausting with water, a portion dissolves, while a more or less solid
resin remains behind.
    " The    aqueous solution yields, on addition of potassa,      an oily preci
pitate    containing    a considerable portion     of unchanged aniline      ;  on
boiling this precipitate with dilute potassa in a retort, the aniline
distils over, whilst a viscid oil remains behind, which gradually
solidifies with a crystalline      structure.     Washing with cold alcohol
and two or three crystallizations          from boiling alcohol render this
body perfectly white and pure,         a very soluble substance     of  a magni
ficent crimson colour remaining in solution.
     " The   portion of the black mass which is insoluble in water dis
solves almost entirely in dilute hydrochloric acid, from which it is
 reprecipitated by the alkalies in the form of an amorphous pink or
 dingy precipitate soluble in alcohol with a rich crimson colour.              The
 greater portion of this body consists of the same colouring principle
 which accompanies the white crystalline substance."
     The action of tetrachloride of carbon on aniline yields only          a com
 paratively small quantity of the crimson pigment            ; the temperature
  of the exposure, and the relative proportions in which the two sub
 stances act upon one another, have the greatest influence upon the
  results   of the reaction.      The white crystalline     base, and the base
  dissolving with a crimson colour, are by no means the only products              ;
  other   bases, most   of them amorphous and accessible only in the form
  of platinum-salt?, are produced, and complicate, owing to the simi
 larity of their chemical characters, the purification of the new com
  pound.       Notwithstanding many efforts, I failed in obtaining the
  new colouring      matter in a state     fit for analysis, and for the time
  abandoned the inquiry.
      Industry, however,       was  not long in discovering      new and much
  more appropriate methods for the production of the crimson aniline
   dye.    Certain    metallic chlorides   (tetrachloride of tin) and nitrates
   (mercurous nitrate),      and numerous oxidizing agents are capable of
   converting    aniline into the crimson colouring        matter.    It   was   M.
   Verguin who first prepared this colour upon a large scale by the
   action of tetrachloride of tin on aniline.          Since that time the pro
   duction of the aniline-crimson        has become     an important     industry,
   which,   in the hands of Messrs. Simpson, Maule, and Nicholson in
   this country, of Messrs. Renard freres in France, has rapidly attained
                                                                    2b

to colossal proportions.             The interest attached to the subject is suffi
ciently evident by a             glance at the periodical literature of the day.
The journals of applied chemistry teem with the descriptions of pro
cesses for the production of the aniline-crimson, for which the names
fuchsine,         magenta, and others more fanciful                       have been proposed.
Even the action of tetrachloride of carbon on aniline, little promising
as it appeared at first, has been used upon the large scale ; and in
teresting papers upon the industrial production of the colour by this
process have been published                   by M. Charles                Dolfus Galline*,          by
Messrs.          Monnet    et   Duryf, and lastly by M. LauthJ, who have
proved that aniline-crimson,                prepared upon the large scale by means
of tetrachloride of carbon, may                   be applied          in dyeing with exactly the
same result as the colouring                matter produced by other processes.                      It
is not the object of this Note to enter into a detailed account                               of the
development of this new industry, which has been admirably traced
by M. E. Kopp in                a series    of interesting articles published in the

the above authorities                in order to show that the basic colouring
matter obtained by me in 1858, while studying the action                                    of tetra
chloride of carbon upon aniline, is identical with the aniline-crimson
which is now by various               processes         manufactured         upon an enormous
scale.

that the slightest contamination       with other bodies is capable of alto
gether masking the properties of this remarkable compound.
    The red colouring matter of aniline and its saline compounds have
been obtained for the first time in the state of purity by my friend
and former       pupil Mr. Edward Chambers           Nicholson,     a chemical
manufacturer      equally distinguished    for his scientific attainments      as
for the skill and indomitable       energy with which in many instances
he has succeeded        in rendering the results of purely scientific in
quiries available for the purposes of life.
    Mr. Nicholson has, with the utmost liberality, placed            at my dis
posal not only a very considerable supply of the beautiful compounds
which he produces, but also the vast and precise information which
in his protracted experiments upon this subject he has accumulated.
It   is entirely   through the kindness of Mr. Nicholson that              I was
enabled to resume the study           of these remarkable bodies,        a short
account    of the composition and of the chemical nature of which               I
beg leave to submit to the Royal Society.
    Mr. Nicholson designates the pure       base of the red colouring matter
 by the name of Roseine, which appears very appropriate, since this
 substance, which furnishes such splendidly coloured solutions, is
 absolutely white in the solid condition.       Nevertheless, since the com
 pound in question appears to     be the prototype    of  a number     of similar
 substances obtainable by similar processes       from the homologues, and
 probably    also from the analogues, of aniline,        it may    be useful to
 commemorate the origin of the compound in its name, and               I accord
 ingly propose the term Rosaniline for the designation of the new
 substance.
     Rosaniline. — The material from which the        base may be most con
 veniently obtained is the acetate which in practice is generally used
 for   dyeing.    This   acetate  Mr. Nicholson produces on the large
 scale  in a state   of perfect purity. The boiling solution of this salt,
 when supersaturated with a large excess of ammonia, furnishes a
 rose-red somewhat crystalline      precipitate, which constitutes the base
 in   a tolerably   pure state.   The colourless liquid filtered off while
 boiling from this precipitate       deposits, on cooling,     perfectly    white
  needles and plates, which are the rosaniline         in  a state   of absolute
  purity.    Unfortunately the solubility of rosaniline in boiling ammo
  nia, and even in boiling water, is extremely limited,          so that only a

                                          6                            [March    6,
very small proportion of the compound is obtained in the perfectly
white condition.        The  base is somewhat more soluble        in alcohol, the
solution having a deep-red colour         ; it is insoluble in ether.    Exposed
to the action of the atmosphere, rosaniline turns rapidly pink, and
ultimately     dark red.      No perceptible       alteration  of weight is ob
 served   during this change.        At the temperature of 100° the base
 rapidly loses a minute quantity of water of interposition ; it may
 then be heated to 130° without further losing weight.               At a higher
 temperature     rosaniline    is decomposed        with evolution    of  an   oily
liquid containing        much aniline,     a quantity     of charcoal remaining
 behind.
    The combustion of rosaniline        has led to the formula
                         CMHaiN0O=CMH10N„H3O,
which has    been corroborated       by the examination       of numerous well-
characterized salts and derivatives.
    Rosaniline     is a well-defined    powerful    base,   which forms several
series  of salts, nearly all remarkable for the facility and beauty with
which they crystallize.          The proportions in which this substance
unites with acids characterize       it  as a triacid triaminc.      Like  several
other triamines which        I have examined,      it will probably  be found to
produce three classes of salts, viz.,
                                 CMH10N3,        nci,
                                 CMH10N3,2HC1,          and
                                 CMII10N3,3HC1.
Up to the present moment, however, I have been able to obtain only
representatives of the first and the third of these classes. The predilec
tions of rosaniline are essentially monacid. The salts with one equiva
lent of acid are wonderfully       stable compounds.        I have recrystallized
them four and five times without producing the slightest alteration in
their composition.        The salts with three equivalents of acid present
comparatively little stability, being, in fact, decomposed by the action
of water or by exposure to 100°.
    By  a glance at the formula given,        it is obvious that the white cry
stals of the base itself, which were submitted to examination, are a
hydrate, — the saline compounds of rosaniline, as might have been
expected from many of the processes              of their formation, containing
no oxygen.       The salts of rosaniline may          be obtained by two differ
ent processes    :   either by the direct action of the respective acids, or

by submitting the        ammonium-compounds           of the several acids to
ebullition    with an  excess  of the free   base.    Both   processes   yield the
salts equally pure and of exactly the same composition.                 The salts
with one equivalent of acid exhibit for the most part, in reflected
light, the splendid metal-lustrous         green of the wings of the rose-
beetle ;   in transmitted light the crystals are red, becoming opaque
when they acquire certain dimensions. The solutions of these salts in
water or alcohol      possess   the magnificent     crimson colour for which
rosaniline    has become so justly celebrated.           The salts with three
equivalents of acid, on the other hand, are yellowish            brown, both in
the   solid state and in solution.        They   are   much more soluble        in
water and alcohol than the monacid salts, which for the most part
are comparatively     sparingly soluble.      Both   classes  of rosaniline-salts
crystallize readily, more especially the monacid compounds             ;  some  of
them    Mr. Nicholson has obtained in perfectly well-formed crystals,
which are at present in the hands of Quintino Sella for crystallometri-
cal examination.
   Chlorides.   — These    substances, and more especially the monacid
salt, were   of particular  use  in fixing the formula of rosaniline.         Pre
pared either by     the action  of hydrochloric    acid,  or by means of chlo
ride   of ammonium, the salt is deposited from the boiling solution in
well-defined rhombic plates, frequently united in stellar forms.              The
chloride    is difficultly soluble    in water, more soluble         in alcohol,
insoluble in ether.
   The salt retains    a minute quantity     of water at     100°, but becomes
anhydrous at     1 30°.   At  this temperature it contains
                               0MH„N„BC1.
   The salt, like most of the rosaniline-salts, is very hygroscopic, a
character which must not be lost sight of in the analysis of these
compounds.
   The monacid chloride dissolves more readily in moderately strong
hydrochloric acid than in water. If this solution, gently warmed,
be mixed      with very concentrated hydrochloric acid, it solidifies, on
cooling, into a network of beautiful brown-red needles, which have
to be washed with concentrated hydrochloric acid and dried in vacuo
over   sulphuric acid and lime, since water decomposes them with
reproduction of the monacid compound.                The salt obtained by the

    Exposed to 100° this salt gradually loses acid, the brown crystals
 becoming indigo-blue    ;  and  if  the exposure be continued           until the
 weight becomes constant, the original        green salt with one equivalent
 of acid is reproduced, which was identified by analysis.
    The two chlorides combine with dichloride of platinum.                    The
 compounds thus produced, being uncrystallizable,              are not easily ob
 tained in a state of purity.       From platinum-determinations,           which
have given     only   approximative     results,   I  infer   that they contain

in green metal-lustrous      crystals, which by one recrystallization          be

on analysis, were found to be the pure monacid acetate, viz.,
                          CMH13N„HCaH,O2.
    The acetate is one of the more soluble salts, both in water and in
alcohol ; it cannot be conveniently recrystallized.
    The Formiate of Rosaniline is similar to the acetate.
    Of the  remainder of the salts of this base      I may mention the Chro-
mate, which is obtained by adding chromate of potassium to the solu
tion of the   acetate in the form of   a brick-red     precipitate, becoming a
green, crystalline,   almost insoluble powder on ebullition with water.
    The Trinitrophenate also    deserves    to be noticed    ;  it crystallizes in
beautiful reddish needles, likewise very difficultly soluble in water,

    Multiplied and varied though the analytical results may be which
support the formulae of rosaniline and its compounds, it appeared
 desirable to seek additional experimental evidence for the expres
 sions derived from simple analysis.        With this view       I  have studied
 the   products    of  decomposition     of rosaniline.        They    are    both
 numerous and interesting.      I must    limit myself to-day to quote one
 or two compounds which claim        some attention, not only because they
 unmistakeably    confirm the formula which        I have proposed, but also
 on account of the light which they throw upon the nature                   of the
 class of substances to which rosaniline belongs.
    Action of reducing agents upon Rosaniline. — This action appeared
 to promise the simplest mode of controlling the formula of the new
 base.    My anticipations have not been disappointed.             Rosaniline     is
 readily attacked by nascent hydrogen or sulphuretted             hydrogen.      A
 solution   of the  base in hydrochloric acid, when left in contact with
 metallic zinc, is rapidly decolorized.      The liquid thus produced con
 tains, together with chloride of zinc, the hydrochlorate           of a new   tri-
 amine, which, perfectly colourless     as   it is in the free   state and   in its
 saline compounds,     I propose to designate by the term Leucaniline.
 The separation of the new compound from the zinc being tedious
 and troublesome, I prefer to prepare it by the action of sulphide of

ammonium.             A   salt   of rosaniline, when digested for                     some time      with
sulphide of ammonium,                   furnishes a yellow, half-fused,                    scarcely cry
stalline, brittle compound, which constitutes the leucaniline in a state
approaching           purity.          It    is,    however,         by no means         necessary to
employ      for the preparation                    of this compound              a   rosaniline-salt        in
the pure state.            In most          cases  I     have produced the leucaniline from
the commercial article sold under the name of fuchsine or magenta.
  To purify the product thus obtained, the yellow resinous mass                                             is
powdered, washed with water to remove the sulphide of ammonium,
and dissolved          in   dilute          hydrochloric acid, when sulphur, together
with impurities,            are left         behind.          The dark-brown            solution     thus
obtained yields, with concentrated hydrochloric acid,                                  a   copious cry
stalline precipitate, which, according                         to the degree of purity of the
commercial colouring matter,                       is   either brown or yellow.               Washing

tating      by   concentrated            hydrochloric acid once or twice.                          If   the
solution, before the last addition of concentrated acid,                                 be heated to
ebullition, the liquid remains clear, and the new chloride crystallizes
out only on cooling.                  The crystals            are beautiful,       white, rectangular
plates, which are, however, always very small.                               Itccrystallization      from
water,    in which they are extremely soluble, renders them perfectly
pure.     Or they may be dissolved in alcohol and precipitated ether,                          by
in   which they are quite insoluble.
     The chloride         thus purified               yields, on addition            of ammonia, the
leucaniline      as   a   dazzling white powder, which assumes                             the faintest
rosy tint when left for some time in contact with the atmosphere of
the laboratory.            It    is   scarcely soluble in cold, very little soluble in
boiling water, from which                   it   is   deposited, on cooling, in the form of
small crystals.            It   is    very soluble in alcohol, and, although less so,
in ether.    I    have not been able to get    in good crystals from these

with     less acid by   boiling the solution with an         excess   of leucaniline,

 of which is not yet completed. Nor am I at present in a position to
 offer any definite opinion regarding the constitution          of the new com

 is in the hope of rendering the formulae of the new bases more trans

 decomposition.         Their study is likewise far from being completed           ;
 but    I  may mention, even now, that both rosaniline and leucaniline,
 when in nitric solution, are powerfully          acted upon by nitrous acid,
 new bases being thus generated, the platinum-salts               of which are
 remarkable for their fulminating properties.            A  splendid crystalline

 appears among the products of distillation of rosaniline.

 II. "On          the Integration     of Simultaneous Differential Equa
         tions."       By   George     Boole, Esq. Received March 4,
          1862.
    It   is well known that a system of n—         1  simultaneous    differential
 equations of the first order connecting n variables always admits               of
n—    1   integrals, each of which is the form     P=c, i.   e. each  of them is
 expressible by a function of the variables           equated to an arbitrary
 constant.
    But when the number of the variables            exceeds  by more than by
unity the number of the differential equations, no existing theory
assigns the number of theoretically possible integrals, or guides us
 to their discovery.
    Yet     cases such as    this occur in problems of the greatest import
ance.        The solution of partial differential equations of the second
order by Monge's method depends ultimately                on the solution of a
system of three         ordinary differential    equations of the first order
between five variables.
    I wish here briefly to indicate the results of a theory which enables
us in all such cases,        1st, to assign  & priori the number of possible
integrals ; 2ndly, to reduce the determination of the integrals to the
solution      of a system of differential equations equal in number         to the

exact differentials.
     I
     will confine my observations to the case of n — 2 differential equa
tions connecting n variables.   The general theory will be seen in the
particular one.
     1.   The solution of n— 2 differential                     equations of the first order
connecting n variables may be reduced to the solution of a system
of   2 linear partial differential             equations.         To deduce         these,   let   P=c
be any integral              of the given system, and suppose xlt                       x3 . . xn   the

equate to 0 the coefficients of the two remaining and independent
ones.

may be so prepared as to lead to this equation directly.                         To  effect
this,   it  suffices to eliminate from one of these equations             —dV
                                                                               , from   the
                                                                          dxn
other            -, and to reduce in each the coefficient of the one which
remains to unity, and then apply the theorem (2).
    3. Between (I.) and (III.) and between (II.) and                    (III.)   the same
process      may be applied         as    between     (I.) and    (II.).      The    effect
of this is to give new partial differential                 equations     ;  in fact, to
generate       a system which       will   be complete when the        further applica
tion     of   the method        gives rise to no new equations,             but only to
identities, or to repetitions, or combinations of the equations already
obtained. And though any equation of the system may be combined
 with any other, according to the theorem, in order to form a new
 one, yet it may be shown that the system will be complete when no
 new equation        arises  from the combination          of any with the original
 ones    (I.), (II.).
     4.    Suppose      that   in this      way m partial      differential     equations
 have been obtained,            including those        two   into    which the given
 system of ordinary differential equtions was transformed.                           Then
 that system of ordinary differential equations will admit of exactly
 n—m integrals, i. e. the number of integrals will be equal to the
 number of the variables diminished by the number of partial
  differential    equations.
     5.   To determine these integrals, let the complete system of partial
  differential equations be represented by
                           A1P=0,AaP=0, ..AmP=0;
  then multiplying the second by              \,  the third by   X3,  &c., and adding,
  we have
                           A1P+X2A:lP..+AmAmP=0,
  a single partial differential equation, which,           X, X, . . Xm  being regarded
  as indeterminate,       will  be equivalent to the system          of equations from
   which it is formed.         Represent this equation by
                           Y rfP     ,
                                       Y tfP        , Y l/P _
                             ld7+         'd7"+       Xnd7=0'
   then its auxiliary system of ordinary differential equations will be

 If  from these n—        1    equations we eliminate the m—          1  quantities
AaX,    . . Xm, we shall obtain n — m differential equations.           These  wil.
 be  capable of expression as exact differential equations, and wiL
give by integration       the n— m integrals before mentioned.
    The method above described admits of important applications.                  It
enables us to assign beforehand               the conditions    of success  in the
application     of Monge's and of similar methods to the integration of
partial differential equations of the second order, and even to deter
 mine the nature of the theoretically possible integral where its
actual exhibition      in   a finite form is impossible.        It also enables us
to investigate by a new and perfectly rigorous method the conditions
of integrability of ordinary differential expressions.
    I subjoin a single result of the former of these applications.            It  is
known that the equations of the possible envelopes of any surface
                                 s=lj>(x,y,a,b,c),
in which three parameters, a,           b, e, vary  in subjection to two condi
 tions,
                      /(a.i.c>^O,               /,(«,*,  e)=0,
will satisfy    a partial differential    equation   of the form
                             Ur+Ss+Tt+s'-rt=Y.
The application of the above method shows that, in order that this
equation may admit of an integral of the above species, i. e. an in
tegral interpretable by the envelope of a surface in which three para
meters vary in subjection          to two connecting relations, the following
conditions are necessary         and sufficient, viz.

    I      am informed by Professor              Stokes, who kindly made the calcula
tion, that such a disk (zone of 60°) is in volume or weight 1 *45 times
that of a sphere the sectional area of which is equal to the trans
verse sectional area             of the disk.       Could such   a disk, fired from a        gun
of similar transverse section,                   be projected    with sufficient cycloidal
rotation to maintain it in one plane, assuming it fired in a vertical
plane, the conditions                 appear favourable to dynamical              effect at any
elevation.
       I   find, however, that when concentric and homogeneous, a disk so
fired from such a gun strikes a target, not in the vertical position as
fired,        but in any position,              such as broadside       on; and that it is

as such, but chiefly to employ merely enough                      of   it   to secure due rota
tion, so as to make               a   disk, otherwise useless but at close quarters,

on the more legitimate                             of easily sup

is a    an interesting one.  In the fourth edition especially (or that pre
 ceding           the   last)    of 'Naval         Gunnery,'Sir Howard Douglas has
given a more minute                    account      than has Dahlgren of the experi
ments in England on this subject in 1850, 1851, and 1852, which
 were instituted at the suggestion of Sir Howard Douglas.                                     /

 the deviations   of eccentric spherical projectiles could be made to

geometrical centre, to which side the deviation then occurred, and
longitudinally, by placing the centre of gravity above or below ; in
the former position the range was increased, and when " below," the
range was diminished                 relatively to the range of a concentric sphere
of like dimensions, and of                       a weight       approximately            equal, but not
necessarily exactly so.                   In    these     latter positions         (t.   e.     in   a   vertical
plane) there was found                    by   General Paixhans              to be also         a      relatively
reduced amount of lateral deviation in comparison with that of com
mon spherical projectiles                 ;    in shot the difference was as              8     compared to
13, and     in shells       as   2   to 16*.         In    the English experiments, however,
of 1850, 1851, and 1852                        it   does     not appear, from the published
results, that lateral deviation was thus reduced, excepting at some oi
the longest ranges          f.       Of   these the greatest was                 with   a   68-pounder of

 variations are much less than those of an ordinary shell not made
 purposely eccentric.
     He    states that, concentricity*          being unattainable       in shells, it is
 needless     to inquire whether that or eccentricity is to be preferred,
 the real question being how best to deal with the eccentricity of all
 shells.
    Of solid shot, Sir Howard Douglas remarks that not more than
 one out     of   a hundred,      when floated in mercury, remained indifferent
 to the position in which           they were placed in the mercury            ; while   it
 was made manifest, by the experiment                   with eccentricity, that that
 quality was of all others by far the most fertile cause of deviation.
    I   now proceed to my own experiments               f.    My first idea (in 1854)
 was to employ,           with the least amount of eccentricity sufficient to

   t  While endeavouring to rifle a small model mortar, and holding it obliquely,
I was struck by the elliptical form of the muzzle        presented by thus inclining the
circular bore to one side ; and happening at the time to be thinking of some of the
details   of the experiments with eccentrical spherical projectiles in the ' Naval
Gunnery,' it occurred to me that if a gun was elliptically bored, but the bore
straight and not helical, the long axis being in a plane perpendicular to the
common axis of the trunnions, and the shot an oblate spherical eccentric               (as
already described),      and   properly placed in the bore, such would be an advanta
geous application       of the eccentric principle,  as the shot would rotate ab initio
about its natural or shortest diameter,          and the direction of such axis and of
the plane of rotation could not alter within the gun, or be likely to alter through
the air.

 not, however, a true ellipse, but two semicircular                arcs, on centres a
 little separated, connected by straight lines               at the periphery        ; and
 corresponding      projectiles were made similarly differing from the true
 form generated by an ellipse about its minor axis.                   The difference,
 however,     between the long and short axis of the figure of the shot
was insufficient     to obviate its getting crosswise in the bore, by means
 of the necessary windage          to allow    of free rolling in the bore.
     The mortar     was then re-bored to its present dimensions,                   by the
 kind aid, in lending instruments, of Mr. George Hoffman of Margate.
Fig. 3 represents a section of the bore in its present state.
    On this very small     scale nothing, however,         of any consequence could
be ascertained in either        force or accuracy, though           a singular      result
appeared as to effect of relative position of centre of gravity                  ;  for in
both models the longest ranges were afforded by a position of the
centre of gravity which was the reverse                  of that giving the longest
ranges in large guns.

    The reason     seems to me, as regards             the models, to be, that the

tubes when the shot is in stable                  equilibrium    than when in the

     I   also mode the mortars              of the    same length, namely small.              They
were fired from a moveable wooden platform,                                but each       from the
same bed or block            of wood, which slid in                 a groove   in the platform ;

elevations.
     Recoil could       be marked ; the usual                   charge was 3 drachms of fine
canister powder         ;   the disk caused more recoil than the spherical shot,
as       in the former windage could                      be more      effectually     suppressed.
Centre        of gravity below in both                    gave    more recoil than centre        of
gravity above.  The eccentric disks and spheres were usually fired
with centre of gravity below. The disk ranged to first graze about
\, and atthe extreme range about £ further than the range of the ec
centric spheres ; that   as  to   is,

                                       my later experiments, that no
sufficient rotation of           a   cycloidal       kind could have           been    imparted to
the disks from the mortar, the centre of gravity being below, but only
from their striking the sand, as                     if    the disk were bowled from the
hand      ;   the disks ricochetted to between 600 and 700 yards up to 3°
elevation, above which angle there was no good ricochet.                                 The mor
tars were about 10 or 12 inches above the level of the sand.
     When      a   disk touched       a   rough place, though much oscillation was
set up (as known by the noise                    it   produced),        this lasted only to the
next one or two grazes            ;   for at the end of the range, where the disk
rolled before stopping, and the sand happened to be soft and dry,
the track was continuous like that of                      a     wheel, and in   a    line that was
very straight.
     Some experiments with these mortars and disks were shown by
me at Shoeburyness               in 1855     ;   but the ground there consists of mud
with pools, and         is   not level enough for so small an apparatus.                      After
a   few comparative trials            of the two mortars, the cheeks blew out from
the disk mortar.

 secure the cheeks, and therefore               had the gun made of a thickness
 otherwise unnecessary.
     The first disks made were            cast with the mould in           a horizontal posi
 tion   ;  and several such disks were fired           ;  but scarcely      one of them had
 the centre of gravity in the equatorial plane                  ;  and   I found  that a disk
 that would not roll tolerably straight (as on a level table), had cor
 responding lateral deviation in the air when fired. Other disks were
 then cast with the mould in a              vertical position, and these were much
 more symmetrical in respect of the sides.
     The eccentricity was given at first by a hole through the disk,
 plugged with gutta percha, or with an alloy of lead and tin                             ; expe
 rience,        however,   showed that plugs of any kind, though                        riveted,
 were often blown            out, and could only be secured by being screwed
 in  ;  and eventually         I  found no way better than to employ symme
  trical shallow cavities * unfilled, on each side of the disk, at about
  half the         radius   from    the    centre.       The least amount            of metal

  port, for his kindness in making these cavities in the disks by a lathe.

abstracted, which      I found would effect rotation, was        y^   only of the
disk's weight, and       was removed from the sharp edge at the sides             of
the zone by filing at four points.             Rotation   was effected also     in a
homogeneous disk,         and without any cavity, by making            it slightly
oval in periphery      — in  fact, as   if it were a middle slice from a very
slightly ovoid or egg-shaped body, instead of from              a spherical one,
the larger end or heaviest part being put uppermost                 in the bore.
Excepting    one other form, better described           presently, these were all
the forms    I experimented with.
   The gun being too small            to effectually destroy    a sabot,   I   com
monly used a horse-shoe electro-magnet             sliding in one   end  of   a flat
wooden rod of similar section to the bore of gun, with which to place
the shot in any desired position.             Having previously marked, by a
spot of chalk,      the face of the shot to be seen in front when in its
place,  I placed the shot as desired in the bore, and then by throw
ing in light with      a mirror,   I saw that the position was that wanted.
Sometimes,     if  the shot turned in entering, it could not be again with
drawn but by firing        ;  and thus such cases conveyed no meaning,
unless the spot of chalk was not altogether out of sight, in which
case the position and result were recorded.
    In September 1859, by the kind permission of Captain Jerning-
ham, R.N., in command, the gun was placed on board the ' Cam
bridge,' the gunnery ship at Devonport.
    The first experiment      was to ascertain the ranges due to centre           of
gravity above and below        ; and this would also show whether rotation
occurred in one or the other position, or in both.              Four disks were
selected of within a few grains' weight of one another, average weight
7£ ounces ; three of the disks were to illustrate respectively concen
tricity, and the two opposite positions of centre of gravity "above"
and "below."          The charge was        \\  ounce, and the elevation 5° in
each case  ;  the powder was that known as            " Lawrence's No.   4, large-
grain," and     is a powder    of great strength.
   The concentric disk dropped at 550 yards; the eccentric with
centre of gravity "below," at 500 yards; the eccentric with centre
of gravity   " above,"    at 1000 yards.       The two first-named disks made
much noise in passing through the air            ; the long-ranging    disk, fired
with centre of gravity above, made but little such noise.
   The other eccentric disk       was then fired with 2 ounces instead       of the

1862.]                                   25
14  -ounce charge, and at 10° instead of 5°, the centre of gravity being
above as before.      This shot    was neither seen to drop in the water nor
heard to make much noise.             There was about 2000 yards of water
then in the creek      ; and as   the water was smooth, and many practised
eyes were looking out, it was thought likely to have passed all the water
and fallen      on  the mud.       This view was much confirmed by three
similar eccentric disks being similarly fired a few days after, i. e.
with 2 ounces of powder and 10° elevation, and centre of gravity
above.      On this occasion Capt. Jerningham kindly sent out                a boat
near the 1500-yard range, and men were stationed about the ship to
observe.       The water was smooth, and,           as  before, there was about
 2000    yards of it in the creek.          Not   one, however,    of  these   three
 disks was seen to drop by any one, nor were they heard from the
 boat,   so  that   there could be little doubt that rotation            was    esta
 blished.    A fourth    eccentric disk was entered, but stuck in the bore,
 and was pushed down in a position unknown.                 This  was also fired at
 1 0°, and with the same charge as the preceding, and it was seen to drop
 at about   1 000  yards, and was believed to have had no regular rotation.
 On Oct. 5th, 1859, the gun being            on  the lower deck, about       11  feet
 above the water, two eccentric disks were fired with centre of gravity
 above, the gun being laid horizontally,         or what is called point-blank       ;
 charge as before, 2 ounces.          The first graze of both        o^ these    shot
 was between 600 and 700 yards           ;  and there could be no doubt of the
 range being due chiefly         to velocity,   and not to vertical deviation,
 the graze      of the shot succeeding so immediately the discharge
 from the height of the gun from the water having been about
  11  feet, and the gun horizontal.         The range, if not due to vertical
 deviation, must have been due to a         velocity of more than 2000 feet per
 second.      In these early experiments with the model disk-gun,             I   had
 not the advantage       (as at present)     of having previously fired      at tim
 ber, so as to have learned unmistakeably           the effect on the position (as
 in striking in a vertical      or oblique     plane) of different     amounts of
 lateral (or undesired) eccentricity ; also I knew nothing of the inju
 rious effect of sabots on the shot's rotation when the sabots were too
  substantial   ;  consequently     the majority of these earlier experiments
 were most uncertain, and could not be repeated at will.
     I  have, however, since, by firing at timber, learned the conditions
  which secure certain results      ; and these   I will briefly state. Excepting
  when the centre of gravity is         "  above," or within a few degrees of

                                          26                            [March    13,
 such position, a disk strikes a target not in a vertical plane as fired              ;
 but when the centre of gravity is "above," when the disk is free to
 roll and not merely slide in the bore, when the sabot, if any, is
 very light and destructible, as of card, when there is a sufficient
 charge of powder, and the disk is tolerably               symmetrical     laterally,
 and sufficiently eccentric longitudinally (but which eccentricity need
 not be an amount that causes a dip of more than 1° when the disk is
 floated in mercury), then the disk,         if fired in a vertical plane, is cer
 tain to strike a target in that position up to the distances at which               I
have yet had the opportunity          of trying it   ; and though such distance
 (from the land experiments here having been of necessity in a quarry *)
 has been only from twenty to thirty yards, yet, as in the other posi
 tions of the centre of gravity the disk turns over irregularly within
 such distance, it may be assumed that a rotation in a vertical plane
 is set up in the one position          referred to, viz.    " above,"   and in no
 other position of the centre of gravity.           To this conclusion all these
experiments appear to tend.            It may by    some be questioned whether
 this rotation is as     a wheel,   or the   reverse way, by the advancement
 of the lower part of the shot. These experiments do not appear to
 support the conclusions of M. Magnusf (which have been so very
widely adopted, as by Sir Howard Douglas in his fourth and subse
quent edition), viz. that rotation occurs in both positions of "above"
and "below,"         but in the latter only is as a wheel      ;  while previously,
and as    expressed in his third edition, Sir H. Douglas entertained the
opinion that the rotation was in that direction, or by the advance
ment of the upper hemisphere, when the centre of gravity was above.
It   is probable that rotation in a disk, in either direction, would keep
its plane vertical when the projection had been in a vertical plane ;
so that    if it  strikes upright only when fired with the centre of gra
vity in   one    position (as when     "above"), it     seems    a fair  conclusion
that with the other positions          of the centre of gravity there can be
no rotation imparted.
     This I had reason    to suspect, as regards the position of the centre        of
gravity "below," long before          I had an opportunity of proving it with
the disk-gun ; for in 1854, the model-mortar experiments referred to
    * Capt. Bent, R.A., of the Royal Laboratory, St. Budeaux, near Devonport,
was so kind as to afford the ground for these land experiments, which       otherwise
I  should have been unable to carry out.

appeared to indicate that such was probably the case, by demonstra
ting that not only were the vertical deviations from such models the
reverse  of those in large guns, while the lateral deviations     were  the
same, but that it followed from this there must be a length and calibre
from which, while the lateral deviations still remained constant, the
range would be the same whether the centre of gravity of an eccen
tric sphere were put " above " or " below."        What, then,  becomes   of
the theory that the lateral and vertical deviations are due to the same
proximate cause, i. e. eccentric rotation through the air, and that it
is by the air, as assumed by M. Magnus, that both these deviations
occur ? The later disk experiments, t. e. from the gun, show that in
three out of the four positions of the centre of gravity in one plane (a
vertical plane) there is no decided rotation in such plane, or indeed
regular rotation in any plane  ; yet these three positions in spheres all
give different ranges.
    Do these spheres rotate ? or can they in such case rotate in a ver
tical plane with velocity enough to cause a vertical deviation, assum
ing that the   mean length  of a range admits   of being increased in this
manner, in opposition to gravitation?
    Perhaps the approximate     causes  may be looked for      (of the two
kinds of deviation), the   one more    within, and the other chiefly out-
side the gun.
   As regards the longer ranges due to centre of gravity "above," may
not such increase be due to the fact of the nearer coincidence of that
important point with the axis of the bore    ?   In fact, may not the ver
tical variations  in range be chiefly due to causes    of  a more directly
dynamical nature than has been generally thought ? while, respect
ing the lateral, M. Magnus's views, founded      on his experiments    with
rotating   bodies, appear not only incontrovertible    of themselves, but
the identity of such deviations    in models with those of large guns
offers no new fact on which exception could be taken or any new
question raised, which cannot be said of longitudinal deviations.
   To find whether     a disk prevented from rotating     in the bore, but
still  delivered   at the  muzzle   with centre     of gravity   "above,"
would rotate in, and in such case by, the air,    I made two disks    (with
a straight edge above and below), the disks being very eccentric by a
transverse hole through the lower part.
   They both struck irregularly in any position, as seen by the
wood of the target, which shows also the form of the disks.

    I found that a homogeneous solid disk, formed slightly oval below,
would strike as fired (in a vertical plane) when the centre of gravity
was    "above."
    There are three ways in which,           as I have found, disks may pass
through the air (as      seen by the target, and shown in figs. 9, 10, 11).

 centricity, but with centre of
gravity not "above," causes a
disk to strike in any irregular
position    (fig. 9).
    2ndly. When the centre of
gravity is "above," but there
is something within the bore
to hamper but not arrest the
rotation of the disk in the bore, such as too thick a sabot, or great
fouling and insufficient wind-                          Fig. 10.
age, the disk strikes      with the
edge, but not     upright     as fired
(fig. 10).
    3rdly. Centre of gravity
"above," with the attending
conditions     which have         been
before mentioned, gives a re
sult    as   previously    described
and shown in fig.      1 1.                               Fig. 11.
    The difficulty     of destroying
" sabots "     is much greater in
models than large guns.
    The penetration of disks when
striking with the     edge     is great  ;
with a 2-oz. charge, at twenty-
five yards, the penetration           has
commonly       been   through       three
4 -inch   planks of elm     ;   and with
half  an ounce more powder           and a wrought-iron     disk, through three
6-inch beams of elm, the latter with the grain of the plank parallel
to the plane of the disk, the former with it usually transverse. The
difference of direction in grain of wood causes in such experiments
about 2 inches difference in penetration.

 1862.]                                    29
    I beg,    finally, to sum up briefly the conclusions which appear to
me to be deducible from these experiments.
    1st.   That the experiments with the model mortar, by giving the
longest range and the shortest that           are due to certain positions    of the
centre     of gravity in    a vertical plane in positions the reverse      of those
obtaining in large guns, while the other positions remain the same,
as to their effect on the range, as in large guns, appear to render
admissible the view that the          causes  of lateral and vertical deviations,
which have hitherto mostly been assumed to be similar, may not be so.
    2ndly. That from the above experiment it also results that there
must be a length and calibre in which the range will                   be the same,
whether the centre of gravity of an eccentric spherical projectile be
placed above or below, while in the same gun all the other deviations
due to the other positions will          be similar to those obtaining in both
large guns and small models.
    3rdly.     It appears (at least with the dimensions of gun and pro
jectile here experimented with) that there is no decided rotation in
any of the four positions in         a vertical plane, excepting that     of centre
 of gravity     " above "   the geometrical centre     ;   and  it may perhaps    be
fairly assumed that in the positions in which disks                 do not rotate,
 spheres (at all events, of like dimensions) cannot.
    4thly. That       if  the results of these experiments with the model
 disk-gun may        be viewed as indicative      of similar results from large
 guns, then the above-mentioned phenomenon of rotation in one posi
 tion only renders doubtful the previous conclusions on the direction
 of rotation, which have         been   based on a view of the rotation          not
 being thus limited to one position.
    5thly.     It appears that to rotate outside the gun,            it is requisite
 that the disk (and           probably    sphere also) must be free to rotate
 within it.
    6thly. That rotation may           be imparted sufficient to be permanent
 on one axis, but not in one plane — a matter of no consequence at
 close quarters     ; while, by certain means, rotation may approximately
 be secured in one plane when the projection                 has been in a vertical
 plane   ;  this has   been seen at least up to     thirty yards   at a target, and
 longer distances not yet tried at a target              ;  but much within the
 above distance the other phenomena are seen to occur                 ; and it may
 be assumed that         if a disk  will keep upright through several inches

                                               30                               [March 13,
      of solid timber, it will also keep upright through the air, except in
      much wind, against the effect of which, however, the disk may pro
      bably be preserved by inclining the axis of the gun.
         7thly and lastly. The before-mentioned results show that a disk-
      gun may in certain respects be viewed as a common gun, and in other
     respects as a gun for throwing an elongated projectile.                   The former
     characteristics, as of circular periphery in line of motion, ensure high
     initial velocity and small strain on the gun ; and the latter, or virtual
      elongation, ensures the preservation of such velocity ; for it is seen
     that the requirement of the tangent to the trajectory, so desirable re
     specting the proper axis of rotation of a rifle projectile, does not ob
     tain in the disk    ;  and it is also seen that while the rifle projectile can
     strike effectively but in the prolongation          of  one  of its   axes,   and that
     becomes     impracticable     as elevation increases, the disk has no such
     limitation,   and is not dependent on any one angle of elevation for
     preserving inviolate the conditions          for which elongation is given to
     any projectile*.
        * On March    20, in the week following that in which the above was read
     at the Royal Society, four disks were fired at Shoeburyness, in the presence of
     Col. Taylor, R.A., Commandant and Superintendent, and other officers.                  The
     weather was so wet, the tide also not admitting of the gun being loaded early in
     the day, that four disks only were fired at a target,   first of oak, 9 inches      thick,

"   Suggestions for the Attainment    of a Systematic Representa
         tion of the Physical Aspect of the Moon."       By John
         Phillips, M. A., LL.D., F.R.S., Reader in Geology in the
         University of Oxford.               Received January 15, 1862.
           I. Sketch of the Progress of Selenography.
                   (a) By Eye-draughts and Micrometry.
    1.   Beginning with the labours of Hevelius                 (1647), maps of the
moon, embracing the whole, and signalizing special parts, have been
repeated      by   Riccioli      (1651),      Cassini   (1680),       Lalande       (1787),
T. Meyer (1748), Lambert-Schroter (1791), Lohrmann (1824),
Beer and Madler (1836).
  2. The degree in which these laborious efforts may be regarded as
                    "
meeting the wants of Selenography," is about equal to that in which
the maps of England of the last century satisfy the requirements                               of
physical geography       ;    and in the same proportion              as the great one-
inch Ordnance Map of 1862 is superior to the old Chart of 1800, so
should be the new drawings of the features of the moon to the older
delineations.
    3. That such drawings are attainable by the patient employment
of modern instruments, in hands capable of good sketching,                               is,
                                                                                          I
believe, not doubted by any competent observer with either achro
matic or reflecting telescopes having equatorial mounting.                          If   any
one      doubts, let him compare the Copernicus                 of Madler with the
Copernicus      of Secchi    ;   nay,  I      may venture to ask that my own
Gassendi be placed side          by   side   with that of any of the charts already
named.
    4. The results likely to be attained by such                  a   series    of careful
drawings     of special parts of the moon's surface, in one branch of
scientific research, are recognized            by   Mr. Conybeare in his Report on
Geology      to the British Association              in 1832.     Indeed,      it   may be
boldly affirmed that     a    competent theory of volcanic action can hardly

                                           32                         [March 20,
be regarded as having been adequately tested,              much less completed,
without    a careful study    of the magnificent volcanic surface of the
moon, where for the most part the consolidated products                  of  a long
train of igneous eruptions are exhibited as clearly as in the celebrated
region of Auvergne.
   5. Considerations       of this      kind    pressing    upon    Lord     Rosse,
Dr. Robinson, General Sabine, and other persons acquainted with the
growing power of telescopes, and the necessity of organizing a system
for the use of them on the moon, induced the British Association,
assembled at Belfast       in 1852, to constitute a Committee, consisting
of the Earl of Rosso, the Rev. Dr. Robinson, and Professor Phillips,
for the purpose of drawing up a Report on the physical character                  of
the moon's surface as compared with that of the earth.
   6.  Acting     as Secretary to    this Committee, Professor Phillips for
warded invitations       to fourteen      selected observers, in Great Britain
and Ireland, the United States, and several localities                 in Europe,
known to be in possession of adequate instrumental power, or willing
to provide it.       To each observer       a certain limited  tract was offered,
his peculiar work, but everyone was requested to add whatever in
formation he might judge useful relating to other parts of the moon's
surface.
    7.  The answers to these invitations         were for the most part favour
able   as to good intentions      ;   but in several cases want of adequate
leisure,   sometimes want       of health,       sometimes    other   causes   were
mentioned      ;   and practically     it  was  found    that very few      of   the
selected   observers sent contributions        which fulfilled the wishes of the
 Committee, even as preliminary surveys.              The Secretary of the Com
mittee, indeed, constructed         an    equatorial of large size for his own
share of work, mounted it in the open air, made photographic                    and
 eye-drawings, and completed a sketch               of his appointed region on
the 19th of May, 1853, which sketch has been in the hands of the
 Royal Society.        He thus established,       to the satisfaction    of several
friends, the facility of carrying out the desires of the Committee, and
would     have     taken up fresh districts,        on every suitable occasion,
but for the change of his            residence from     York to Oxford. The
instrumental       mounting being specially fitted for York and the cir
cumstances of his residence there, he was unable to continue his work
at Oxford    ;   and several years, as far as this problem is concerned, have

1862.]                               33
been  lost to him for want of an instrument of adequate power and suit
able construction,   conveniently placed and always at command.
   8.  Mr. Nasmyth, several years since, employed his fine reflector, with
a peculiar apparatus for drawing, in these representations of the moon,
which have justly earned for him        a reputation      in philosophic art of
which    even the inventor  of the steam-hammer may           be  justly proud.
He has lately preferred to use for his eye-draughts a fine achromatic
by Cooke, of York, — the same instrument which has been turned with
such unexpected results to a scrutiny of the solar spots.
   Professor Smyth of Edinburgh, and Professor Challis of Cambridge,
made examinations      and preliminary     sketches     of the Mare Crisium,
Plato, and other interesting objects    ;  the former artist employing oil-
colours in his scene-painting.
                           (b) By Photography.
    9. Meantime a new and beautiful art was making itself auxiliary to
the delineation of the moon,— first by the silver plate of Daguerre,
afterwards by the increasingly sensitive collodion surface. The great
achromatic     of Cambridge,     U.S., under the hands of Bond and
Whiffle,   gave  results of much promise        ;   at first the light-pictures
were of the full moon, 2 inches diameter on daguerreotype plates *               ;
afterwards we saw larger representations          of the crescent moon, with
stronger lights and shadows on the ridges and in the hollows, several
inches across (1851-53).
    10. While observing with the great reflector at Birr, every one was
struck with the probability that almost instantaneous pictures could          be
obtained of the moon, stars, and planets, by the amazing quantity of
light brought to the focus of that magnificent instrument.                 Some
trials had indeed been made in 1852 by the distinguished constructor
and Mr. Woods; but I am not aware of the results of later experiments
with the great reflector.    In  1853  I gave     much attention to the use of
collodion,   and employed     an  apparatus       attached to my achromatic
(of 1 1 feet focus and 6 inches diameter), by which at first pictures
of 1*2 inch diameter, and finally others from 2 to 3 inches were ob
tained, in times gradually    reduced from 5' to 30" and less.             I still
possess many    of these pictures  ; the best, however, was destroyed in
attempting to print from it.

     11.  Somewhat    earlier than these trials     of mine    were  the first
efforts of    Mr. De la Rue, of which       I was not aware.     These efforts
have from year to year been rewarded with still increasing             success,
till  we have had from his    skilful hands maps of the full moon of posi
tive value, and stereographic        pictures of admirable beauty.       These
researches are still in progress, with every prospect of reaching a point
from which eye-draughts may be started on a fresh basis for a systema
tic scrutiny of all parts of the moon, and the construction of maps on
the scale of •jL-th 0f an inch to a mile on the middle part of the moon's
face    (or as the moon would appear under a power        of 1000).
     1 2.  Experiments   rewarded by considerable success were completed
by the Liverpool Photographic         Society in 1854   ;  and several of their
valuable drawings of the moon, magnified to a large scale, were exhi
bited at the Meeting       of the British Association in Liverpool, along
 with    one of mine similarly handled.
        II.  Proposal of      a Method for further progress.
     13.   By the labours, for the most part uncombined, of the last ten
years, we have not achieved much beyond laying the foundation for
 further progress. We have acquired, by means of photography, a
 general view of the whole moon as to its proportions of light and shade,
 the degrees of light of different parts of its surface, the direction of the
 light-streaks,    and other phenomena, better than eye-draughts            and
 micrometry could furnish.
     By eye-draughts and micrometry alone many of the " mountains
                                                                               "
 and " seas" of the moon have been sketched in beautiful landscapes by
  Nasmyth and Smyth;          and two    "ring mountains" have       been   sur
 veyed and drawn        in detail    by Secchi    (Copernicus)   and    Phillips
  (Gassendi).
      The next ten years may, doubtless, be justly expected to give an
  equal rate of progress    ;  photographic    foundation will be made more
  effective for the whole moon and for different phases of the moon              ;
  and we may add, by individual and sporadic efforts, a few more ring
  mountains to our meagre catalogue of objects examined.            It  appears
  to me, however, that more than this can be attained, and ought to be
  attempted, on a plan of continuous work, by means of one instrument
  devoted to a survey of selected       parts of the moon, and    I proceed to
  explain my views*

  1S62.]                                    35
     14.  By Mr. De la Rue's exertions principally, photographs of
 the moon have become an essential element in the desired delinea
 tions, and an impression          is   sometimes felt that by some        possible
 farther improvement in that wonderful art, eye-drawing may be
 dispensed with. This, I am persuaded, can never happen; but
 there is in my mind the firmest conviction that eye-drawing, founded
 on a basis of form obtained by photography, will produce results as
 to details of the moon's peculiarities         which light-pictures     alone can
 never reach.       For whether the large photographs, on the scale of
 100   inches to the moon's diameter, which we desire to obtain, are
 to be had by enlarging the primary pictures of               1 or 2 inches, or by
 direct photographs on a larger scale, it seems impossible to escape
 from some want of definition,            by reason of the imperfect surfaces
 used, or by reason of the inexact following of the moon as she
 changes her rate or alters her declination.              I know this latter error
 to be very likely of occurrence, even with disks taken beyond the
 negative eye-piece, with excellent clockwork movement, and am, on
 this account, the more ready to applaud             Mr. De la Rue, whose skil
 ful hands have     so well mastered that and other difficulties.         I cannot
 too strongly express my sense of the great value of the light-pictures
 obtained by that gentleman — as a basis              of form   on which to con
 struct   eye-draughts,      showing      the mind's interpretation       of what
 the eye sees on the moon, but fails to discover in the finest pho
 tograph.
    15. Reflecting on the comparatively very small degree of success
 which has rewarded the combination instituted nearly ten years since
 by the British Association,— remembering that instrumental means
have been improved,          while     the scientific  interest in a knowledge
of the moon's peculiarities           has not diminished,     — it appears to me
possible to obtain a larger measure of success by a vigorous effort in
a different  direction.      It  appears to me that, instead of requesting
gentlemen     who possess       instruments    already engaged       in other  re
searches to turn them to selenography and make drawings in which
they may have no special interest, it will be better to carry a good
instrument to an observer interested in the survey of the moon, and
willing for   a limited    time to use his exertions for the accomplish
ment    of a definite object.         In my own      case   I feel sure that this
would succeed     ; and I believe     that my case is essentially that of many
                                                                    d 2

                                         36                         [March 20,
intelligent observers of the moon accustomed to extra-meridional             ob
servations.
    16.  The first desideratum then is        an Equatorial Instrument, con
structed with the conditions of ample optical power, — great steadiness,
— delicate     adjustment, including a sufficient range for latitude,     — the
usual circular and micrometrical readings,         — clock-movement, &c., —
so that    it may be in every point of view adapted for special obser
vations of the moon (sun, planets, comets, &c. may also be observed),
and be available for many years, in the same optical and space-mea
suring    condition.     According to my view, founded           on  experience
with various instruments,        it must    be an achromatic,    mounted on a
transportable solid stand, placed under the roof of a removeable ob
servatory, capable of holding a clock and,          if need be, a small transit.
The object-glass should       be  of  6 inches diameter, the focal length     16
or 1 7 diameters.
    Such an instrument has actually been made by my direction             ; it is
finished,    and stands complete in the workshop of the skilful artist,
whose name is a guarantee of excellence,               Mr. T. Cooke of York.
Thus the first requisite to give effect to my proposal is practically
reached.
    1 7. The    second   desideratum is that the instrument        shall become
the property of some scientific body constituted for long endurance,
 and endowed with so much influence as to be able to give effect and
gain adherence to a plan of continuous work, by definite persons,
for such periods of time       as each    in succession may command.        The
instrument      to be  confided to each in succession, and mounted in a
convenient      manner     for his   use,   at his    home,   during the time
appointed.       Each observer to furnish,          at least once a year,     an
account      of his observations,      with drawings on the plan already
detailed in the instructions        furnished by the Moon Committee of
the British Association.        At the conclusion of his appointed period
of observation, the instrument to be again at the disposal of the
scientific    body   to which it      belongs,   either   to be  transferred   to
another     observer, or to be again entrusted           to the first observer,
according      as may    seem   best for the attainment       of the object in
view.
    18.  I   entertain no doubt that, after the operation of one or two
 years, each yielding fruit, there will be no other difficulty of obtaining

  1862.]                                 37
 suitable observers than the difficulty of choice among several proper
 persons, who will be glad to give their services.          To remove any
 difficulty  as to the first  trial,  I  presume to offer for the first two
 years my own services at       Oxford; having already sketched out           a
 definite plan of work, which has not yet        been attempted, and which
 I believe myself able to accomplish.
    19.  It  would be no part of my plan to take photographs            of the
 moon,    but   rather   to obtain    from    other  observatories   the  best
 examples of this kind of work, and devote          every available hour to
 eye-sketching    on a large scale of the exact      appearance of selected
 parts of the lunar disk.
    The drawings thus made, scrutinized and corrected in succeeding
years, would     gradually   and not very slowly      grow up to complete
eye-draughts     of the moon, under the conditions         of sunrise, mid
 day, and sunset;      and would themselves be again a starting-point
for the guidance of     even closer scrutiny,   with the greatest  telescopes
and the sharpest eyes.
    20. Finally, my proposal,     if allowed  to make one, would be, that,
for the purpose of securing a series of satisfactory drawings of the
physical features of the moon, a six-inch achromatic, by Cooke, con
structed    for the purpose,     be  purchased    out of the funds     of the
Government      Grant Committee, and held by a Board composed of
three Members of the Royal Society, to be nominated in the first
instance and the number afterwards filled up by the Council of the
Royal Society, in trust for the      use   of observers to be appointed by
the Board, each for a limited period, and for a defined area of work :
the drawings and observations to be communicated,            at least once a
year,   to the Board.      Cost of the instrument       not to exceed     320
guineas, of a moveable house not to exceed        £50.

" Theoretical     Considerations on the Conditions under which the
       Drift Deposits containing the Remains of Extinct Mam
       malia and Flint-implements              were    accumulated       ;  and on
       their   Geological     Age."       By Joseph         Prestwicii,        Esq.,
       F.R.S., F.G.S,        Received     March 20, 1862.
                                   (Abstract.)
    In his former paper on the subject of the Flint-implements *, tbe
author postponed       the consideration of the theoretical          questions,     to
allow time for a fuller investigation of the physical phenomena.                 The
points then sought to be established were,             — the   artificial   make of
the specimens,— their position          in undisturbed       ground,  — and their
contemporaneity with the extinct            animals.    The points for present
consideration    relate to the structural and physical phenomena, and
to various theoretical questions.
    In the present paper the author proceeds to show that the flint-
implements are found along the line of existing river-plains at heights
varying from 20 to       TOO  feet  above the rivers, and that the beds of
sand and gravel in which they             are imbedded can be divided into
two more or less distinct      series, one continuous along the bottom of
the valleys and rising but little above the river-level, and to which he
proposes to apply the term
                                   " Low-level      Gravels," and the other in
detached masses on the heights            flanking   the valleys, and at 50 to
200 feet above the rivers, and which he designates as the                    "High-
level Gravel*    f."      Both gravels consist of debris derived                from
rocks in the valleys through which the present rivers or their tribu
taries flow, and they both          occasionally     contain organic       remains    ;
both are, in fact, related to former plains and present valleys.
   * Read before the Royal Society 26th May, 1 859 ; Phil. Trans. 1860, p. 277.
   t At the reading of this paper, the author used the terms " Terrace Gravels "
and " Valley Gravels ;" but he thinks it better to revert, with limitations, to terms
which he suggested some years since, but has not hitherto defined.

    This structure        is then shown to apply         to the Waveney,    where
there is a terrace of gravel on both sides of the valley at a level of
about 40 feet above the river, and to which position, but to a more
lacustrine condition, the Hoxne deposit belongs.               Sections are given
of this valley, and also of the valleys of the Lark at Icklingham and
of the Ouse at Bedford, showing the constancy of this structure.
In    the valley of the Thames the phenomena are more complicated
and are reserved for future consideration, notice being merely taken
of the implements found at Heme Bay and Whitstable.
     Owing     to the absence    of marine newer and post-pliocene beds in
the North of France,           these  gravels are better exhibited      and more
distinct,     being free from       rock-fragments      and boulders   foreign   to
 their own origin and        area.   Hence     it has arisen that this part of the
 geological      series  has been     more     investigated  in France    than   in
 England.         In the admirable review of the Quaternary formations by
 M. d'Archiac, two general conclusions are set forth. With the first
 of   these   the author perfectly agrees.          It is that each large hydro-
 graphical basin, although the boundaries may not be marked by any
 important elevation, has its own exclusive drift, and that in no case
 is there a mixture of the transported materials of the separate basins.
 The author, however, dissents from the opinion that these drifts,
 containing       the remains of large extinct mammalia, have in any way
 depended on or resulted from any general cataclysm destroying these
 creatures      nearly simultaneously       over wide continents and entombing
  their remains in the sand, gravel, and shingle of the valleys and
  in the earth of the caverns          ;   neither can he consider the excava
  tion of the valleys to be anterior to the spread of the drift-gravels.
  On the contrary, he refers the phenomena to long-continued                 river-
 action.
      An account is then given of the valley of the Somme, and it is stated
  that   the relation between the high- and low-level              gravels, which
  could not be proved with respect to St. Acheul and St. Roch, has
  been made clearly apparent at          Montiers near Amiens, by the opening
  of a new ballast-pit on the side of the railway, some 50 feet above
  the level of the old gravel-pits in the valley just below, and in which
  latter flint-implements        were   first found by the author in the spring
  of last year.       In the upper ballast-pit     a considerable number    of land
  and freshwater shells and some mammalian bones have been found,

                                      40                           [March 27,
but as yet no flint-implements.        This deposit, as also the now well-
known flint-implement-bearing        beds of St. Acheul, are considered to
belong to the high-level      gravels, whilst the gravel of St. Roch and
that of the old Montiers pits are placed with the low-level            gravels.
Both    sets of gravels   are also developed     in the neighbourhood        of
Abbeville,   and both there contain flint-implements       ;  Moulin Quignon
belonging to the higher level, and Menchecourt and Mautort (village)
to the lower level.
    In the course of last year M. Gosse discovered flint-implements          in
association with the remains of the Mammoth              in some gravel -pits
near the well of Grenelle at Paris.      This bed belongs to the low-level
gravel.     The same gravel is also worked to the S.E. of Paris at the
Gare d'lvry, where, as at Montiers, it abuts against the hill-side.
On the hill      above, and 115 feet higher, there occurs at Gentilly a
deposit of sand and gravel, with land and freshwater shells and mam
malian remains, precisely like that at St. Acheul.           At Charonne, on
the opposite side of the valley and distant 4 miles,         a similar deposit,
corresponding in its height above the river, in its collection of fresh
water shells, and in its mineral contents, is met with.               No flint-
implements have yet been found in these beds,             but in every other
respect they agree with the gravel of St. Acheul.              These deposits,
which have      been described by   M. Duval and M. Charles d'Orbigny,
contain the same debris as       the present Seine valley, and amongst it
fragments of granite derived from the hills of the Morvan, at a
distance of 120 miles from Paris.
    It is then shown, by reference to the works of          M. Leymerie,    M.
Cornuel and other geologists, that the valleys of the Seine and of its
tributaries    above Paris are occasionally    flanked by heights capped
with gravel containing       at  places remains of the Elephant, Deer,
Horse, &c.        In some instances these gravels rise to a height      of 1 90
feet above the river, but the general height is from 60 to 150 feet.
Sometimes they expand to a breadth of 4 to           5 miles, but they more
usually form narrow belts.        Various other French authors are then
quoted, to show that the same structure           prevails in the valleys of
the Oise (where one instance of a flint-implement is recorded by M.
de Verneuil), of the Marne, the Aire, the Aube, and their numerous
tributaries  ;   and in each instance it is shown that the materials,
both of the high- and low-level gravels, are derived strictly from the

1862.]                                        •11
district through which the valley                   passes   ;    that
only the Seine valley contains granite from the
Morvan, the Oise slate-rock debris from the Ar
dennes,     the Marne nothing               older   than     oolitic
debris, whilst the Thcrain and the Somme valleys
contain nothing but debris of the chalk and ter
tiary strata. The same rule applies to the English
area ; but the fact is not so apparent, owing to
various    conflicting      elements pointed out by the
author who shows, by                a map    of the two coun
tries, how great are the range and spread of these
beds, and how large a proportion                    of our drift-
gravels are of fluviatile origin.
   The High-level Gravels.            — From        the facts re
corded     by      the    several    independent        observers
abroad,     and from his own observations in this
country,    the author arrives at a general proposi
tion illustrated by the accompanying diagram,
which shows, — 1. D, a major valley or plain of
denudation anterior to the excavation of the river-
valley.     2.   e, a   non-fossiliferous     drift on the slope
and base of D.           3. C, the river-valley.        4. d, the
high- and        c, the low-level gravels.           5. a, recent
alluvium.        6.    A, the present river-channel.
   The high-level gravels (d) appear                on both sides
of the valley, and their connexion before the                      ex
cavation of C is pointed out.                This is   one   of the
points     insisted      upon     by the author;           the two
having     been       generally     considered as contempo
                                                                          :'/
raneous, or even sometimes the higher-level                        de
posits as newer than those of the lower level.                       It
is to be observed that              the phenomena here re
ferred to relate to broad valleys, and not merely
to river-channels.
   The     loess is not shown in the diagram,                    other
wise the section represents the condition of the
case on the           supposition    that    all the parts are
 complete.        But this rarely happens.             Some low-

                                       42                          [March 27,
level gravel is constant, but the high-level          gravels are only occa
sionally preserved.      Sections are then given to explain the cause of
their  absence  — such   as where the valley     C being wider than the ori
ginal bed of the old river which deposited the gravel d, the latter has
been necessarily altogether removed.
   That the formation of the higher gravels can be owing to the
action of the present rivers is clearly impossible under existing con
ditions  ; for not only    are  they far above     the level reached by the
rivers at the highest floods, but also the sectional area of the valleys,
compared to that of the present rivers, is so vast, that in no possible
way, except by the sea, could they now be filled with water.              Sec
tions are given of the valleys of the Waveney,            Ouse, Somme, and
Seine, showing a disproportion         between the rivers at their highest
floods and the old valleys, on the average,         about  1 : 500  ; and it is
shown, with respect to the great flood of the Seine in 1658, when the
waters at Paris rose to a height       of 29  feet, that  it would require a
flood of at least one   hundred times that magnitude to fill (with the
 water even in a state of rest) the valley of the Seine to the level of
the high-level gravels of Gentilly and Charonne.
    That the isolated    beds  of high-level gravels must at    one time have
 been connected in length       and breadth is evident from the circum
 stance of these detached parts having certain characters in common,
 and from the fact that     if the deep valleys which they overhang, and
 the transverse valleys which they pass over, had then existed, they
  would have presented insuperable barriers to the deposition of the
 gravels at levels so much higher.
    That the transport of this drift could have          been   caused  by the
 bursting of lakes, by the sudden melting of the glaciers and snow of
  mountain-chains,    or by the transient passage of a body of water over
 the land is not possible, because the spread of the debris would have
 been   more general, would have held its course more irrespective of
 the  existing watersheds, and would have shown an amount of wear
 in proportion    to the distance travelled    ;  whereas in each basin the
  debris is local, however low the watershed.         None of the slate and
 oolitic debris of the Oise valley traverses into the valley of the
  Somme,     notwithstanding     the watershed between       them is only six
miles broad and eighty feet high.
    There   are two ways    in which the author conceives the spread of

1862.]                                 43
the debris in the various directions         and distinct  areas   could   have
been effected    ;  the one by the rise  of the land from beneath the       sea,
and the other by the action of rivers on a larger scale than the
present ones.       As the later tertiary deposits show the existence of
seas   or of lakes over the districts in question, it follows as a necessary
consequence that when the land rose from beneath them, a mass of
debris,    in quantity and length of transport proportionate to the
greater or lesser rate of elevation, must have been spread over the
bottom of the channels along which the water flowed off.                Nearly
associated with the high-level gravels there are remnants of another
drift which may have had this older and independent origin.                This
mode of formation could not, however, be applied to the valley gravels,
as they contain freshwater shells such as live in rivers, with land
 shells and mammalian remains, proving the existence of a dry land.
     The author concludes that the high-level gravels are the result
 of river-action which took place at a period before the excavation of
 the present river-valleys.      With regard to the mode of formation of
 these gravels, he remarks on the materials being often transported
 a considerable      distance, — the frequent presence of large blocks or
 boulders of the harder rocks, — the presence        of  a certain proportion
 of angular     deTjris, — and the commonly     confused bedding and con
 tortions.     He shows this to exist in England and in France, and
 supports     the case by quotations from various French          authors.    It
 is then shown        that in the valley of the Somme these phenomena
 are    most   marked     and decisive, — large blocks of sandstone, some
  weighing four to five tons, and derived from tertiary strata twenty to
  forty miles above Amiens, being found in the St. Acheul gravels,
 and the beds being much contorted. These contortions do not depend
  on   any pressure exercised by the blocks, but result from some dis
 turbing power applied and removed. To illustrate this point refer
 ence is made to two sections in his former paper (Phil. Trans, for
  1860, p. 299).
     The author conceives that the only adequate cause to produce many
  of these  effects is river-ice, the transporting   power of which is well
  known, whilst      he quotes the observations    of travellers in Northern
  America to prove the power of such ice to pile-up the shore
  shingle in great conical heaps.       That the old pleistocene rivers were
  also  larger and more rapid than the existing rivers is evident from

                                               44                            [March 27,
the great quantity of débris, the prevalence of gravels, the coarseness
 of the   sands,      and the general absence          of mud-sediments.          Another
 agent of considerable power is referred to, viz. ground-ice,                   but is re
 served for consideration          further on.
    The Fauna                                            —
                       of the High-level Gravels. The organic remains are
 considered with reference especially to the climatal conditions of the
 period,    and it is regretted that,             owing    to the scarcity      of fossils
 except at a few places,          and to the want of specific information              with
 regard to the mammalian                remains and the levels, the evidence on
 many points is unavoidably incomplete.                  The best-determined group
 is that of the Mollusca,         in examining which the valuable assistance
 of Mr. Gwyn Jeffreys is acknowledged.                    The author gives a Table
 showing      the      group   of land and freshwater            shells inhabiting,       in
 Englan          id France, the      area now described, from          which   comes out
 the striking result that out of 109 living species                    43 are found in
 the deposits of the high-level               gravel period.      There is     a scarcity
 of  Unioi>:   -     and Paludinidae, whereas Limnaeidae and Helicidae are
 very com         *a.    In many places shells        are scarce or altogether want
 ing  ; but this is common in all rivers subject to floods                   o r bringing
 down much shingle.             All   the species are of existing forms, and all,
 with four exceptions, inhabit the same districts as formerly.                       Their
 range is then reviewed, and             it is shown that though         a considerable
proportion        of them    are found     in the South of France,         a   still larger
 proportion       exist in Scandinavia,        and that as many as thirty-five out
of the forty-three          species    are met      with in Finland, including the
common forms, such as Succinea putris, S. Pfeifferi,                     Helix hispida,
 H.nemoralis,        H. pulchella, Pupa        muscorum,     Limnceus pereger,      L.pa-
lustris,   L. truncatula, Planorbis corneus, P. vertex, P. marginatus,
P. albus, P. spirorbis, Bythinia tentaculata, Valvata piscinalis, Pisi-
dium amnicum, &c.             From     these and other facts      it is concluded that,
while there is nothing in the Mollusca to necessitate a climate different
from that of the present day, there is nothing to require restriction
to an identical climate, while at the same time the tendency of deve
lopment      of the group        is rather      in a northern     than in a southern
direction.
    The   several      genera and species of Mammalia are then considered,
the principal being Elephas primigenius,                Rhinoceros tichorhinus,         Bi
son priscus,        with   several   species     of Equus, Bos, Cervus, whilst          the

1862.]                                           45
Reindeer is found in deposits of the same period ; and an opinion is
expressed that the evidence with respect to the climatal conditions
furnished by the Mammalia, although slight, is more definite than
that obtained from the Mollusca, and tends to show the probability
of the climate at the period of the high-level gravel having                                                   been
colder than that of          these latitudes at the present day.                                 The flora is
scanty and of little avail.                 It   is then remarked                that           if   we had to
depend only upon the organic remains for decisive evidence of the
nature of the climate of the period under inquiry, we should at
present fail to arrive at any safe and exact conclusion. If, however,
these indications are taken in conjunction                        with the physical features,
the conjoint evidence has weight and more preciseness ; and the author
concludes, from a review of all the facts, that there must have been
a mean winter cold           of not      less than 20°, and possibly as                              low    as 1 0°,
or from    19° to 29° below the mean winter                           temperature               (39° )      of this
part of Europe.             The   cave evidence would have helped this question.
   The Flint-Implements. — These works of man are                                       first         discovered
 in beds of the high-level gravel period.                         The most           ori*             j-y shapes
are the large spear-head form, either                        with      a    sharp point                or      a   flat
 rounded one, and with the butt end sometimes blunt, and at other
 times chipped to an edge.                   With regard to the manner in which
 they came to be imbedded in the gravel,                              it    can only be surmised
 from their condition, from our present experience, and by considering
 the uses to which they could possibly have been applied.
   These conditions are then reviewed, and                            it   is   shown that the flint-
 implements rarely or never show indications of atmospheric weather
 ing;    that they are rarely worn, but are usually sharp and angular,
 like some of the large unworn                   flints which have been attributed to
 transport by ice       ;    also that they are most common where the evi
 dence    of ice-action       is       the greatest, as at St. Acheul and Moulin
 Quignon.    The climate of the period having been severe,                                           it   is   essen
 tial to keep in mind the usages of tribes under like conditions                                               at the
 present day.           The mode of life of the Chipweyan                           Indians and the
 Esquimaux         is   then considered          ;    and   it   is   shown that            a        hatchet, an
 ice-chisel,   a   file and knives, of stone or metal, are all the instruments
 they need or use.                It   is   further shown that when in winter the
 usually abundant supplies of Reindeer fail, these people resort com
 monly to fishing           in the frozen rivers, and then use their ice-chisels

for making holes in the ice.        These implements are also in daily use
for keeping open the water-holes.          Analogous facts are quoted from
Wrangel respecting Siberia.           The author suggests therefore that
some    of the mysterious flint-implements (such as fig. 5, pi. 12, Phil.
Trans. 1860) of St. Acheul may have been used as ice-chisels.                Rea
sons are then assigned for their presence         chiefly at particular spots ;
and reference is made to other forms of flint-implements,            all of which
admit of explanation, except those of a flat ovoid shape, common at
Abbeville, which are unlike any instrument           in  use amongst any exist
ing uncivilized tribes.
    Notwithstanding the probable severity of the climate, it was one by
no means unsuited to the existence of man, whilst the character of
the contemporaneous animal life of the period was perfectly fitted for
his support and sustenance.
    A difficulty   has been    raised because     hitherto no human bones
have    been found    in these gravels   ; but when it is considered how
scanty is the population      in northern    latitudes, -and how dispropor
tionately    numerous are the great herds of Deer, Oxen, and other
animals (fossil remains of which are yet comparatively rare), this
 fact, taken in conjunction with the foresight of man, indicates
 how small are the chances of finding his remains.                  Nevertheless
 in other     deposits probably     of the  age    of   these  gravels, such as
 some   of the  caves near Liege    described by Schmerling,        the scattered
 bones of man have been found in association with             a like mammalian
 fauna.
    The Low-level Gravels.     — Connected with        this subject is the exca
 vation of the valleys,      and the duration       of that operation.       The
 author mentions how he hesitated to assign at first a much higher
 antiquity to the higher gravels than to the lower gravels, or rather,
 admitting a difference of age, to decide whether the excavation of the
 valleys might not have been effected       by some more powerful agency
 acting through a short interval of time, and by so much contracting
the period by which        the St. Acheul deposit preceded that of St.
 Roch   ; but after repeated visits to Amiens, and looking at the ques
 tion from every point of view, he finds himself unable to discover             a
 sufficient explanation    in the direction     first sought, and obliged to
adopt, in part, views differing materially in some points from those
 he at first thought to be the more probable.             The low-level gravels

 1862.]                                      47
have been         frequently     described,    and the author      confines himself
chiefly to pointing out the difference between them and the high-
level gravels.         The climate at the one period has          been  described as
one    of considerable severity        ;  but there is evidence to show that in
some part of the pliocene period, previous                 to  that  time, the cold
was    still more     severe.     At the period referred to the greater part of
England        was under      the sea, whereas Switzerland          and the greater
 part   of France had emerged            at an earlier or a miocene period,       and
 there is no sufficient proof of their having been                subsequently sub
 merged.         This   was the period     of the wonderful     extension of the old
 European glaciers, which descended in the Swiss Alps, the Jura,
 and the Vosges to within 1200 or 1000 feet of the sea-level, the
 existing glaciers standing at 3400 to 3500 feet.               M. Leblanc    has cal
 culated that such a difference of level might be accounted for by a
  reduction in the mean annual temperature of 12|° Fahr. ; but the
  author questions this, as the gradients of the glacier beds were much
  less after they had emerged from the mountain-passes.                  The growth
  of the old glaciers       is rather the result     of the great cold than    a mea
  sure of it.        Still it  can   be conceived that their      growth    would be
   checked when the temperature had risen from the extreme cold to a
   point   1 2 £°  below the present mean annual temperature.             This would
   reduce the mean annual temperature here to 37i°,               — that of Moscow
   and Quebec, with which the climate at the higher gravel period has
   been    before compared, being respectively 40° and 41°, — and would
    agree   with what has         been    considered    the probable    mean    winter
    temperature of that period, viz.          one between 10° and 20°.
       Taking this     as the starting-point,     the effect of such conditions with
    reference to the quantity of ice and snow stored up during this period
    of cold, and to its effect      on the river-discharges     for many years after
    wards during the period of the valley gravels, has to be considered.
    The melting of the winter snow would necessarily cause spring floods.
    Another cause of floods is the fall of rain whilst the ground is still
    frozen.     These causes, combined possibly with a larger rainfall, must
    have afforded to the old rivers, either permanently or at all events
    during spring-time,        a volume    of water far exceeding any present sup
    ply, and giving them more of a torrential character.                 Instances are
     quoted from Sir R. Murchison's 'Russia' and Wrangel's 'Siberia,'
     and others, to show how this is still the case every spring in northern

 countries,   causing    a rise in the rivers of from       10 to 40 feet,   and
 inundating the adjacent valleys.
    Other forces, however,      besides   an increase in the water-power,
 seem required to account for the excavation        of the great valleys, and
 the author thinks that cold and ground-ice           have performed a very
 important part in the operation.       In  support of this view, he adduces
 the opinion of Arago and the observations of           M. Leclercq and Col.
 Jackson, both of whom show how constantly this ice is formed in
 cold climates in rivers with stony and gravelly bottoms, such as the
 old post-pleiocene     rivers must have been.         Amongst other obser
 vations given are     those of M. Weitz, who       states  that in the north
 of Siberia the formation of ground-ice        can be seen in the rivers at a
 depth of 14 feet and more, and that in           "rising from the bottom,
 the masses of ice bring up with them sand and stones, and let them
 down at places far distant from whence they came ;" and he concludes,
 " that  not only does the current occasion a change in the bed of the
 river by its erosion of the looser soil, which     it carries from   one place
 to deposit in another, but that the ice, which forms at the bottom
 of rapid rivers in very cold countries, tends also to       effect a change   in
 the beds of those rivers."
    Another agent would co-operate with the last ; this is the freezing
 of the ground and the rending of rocks by frost. Taking extreme
cases, Crantz shows to how great an extent this operates in Green
land   ; Dr. Sutherland gives    some   still more striking instances on the
 shores of Barrow Strait,       and Sir   J.  Richardson    on the Mackenzie
 River.   Even in our country, the disintegration        produced during one
 severe  winter on a fresh vertical section of chalk is very striking.
A   remarkable instance is quoted from Sir R. Murchison's              '
                                                                         Russia,'
of  a long terrace    of angular blocks of limestone broken up and left
by the winter-ice 30 feet above the summer level of the Dwina
near Archangel.
   With all  these combined operations, the author       still doubts whether,
without an uplifting of the land, the effects in question could have
been produced     ;  and he shows that the coasts of this part of England
and France are fringed here and there by a raised beach, which he
correlates with the low-level gravel of Abbeville, whilst the high-level
gravel of St. Acheul is correlated with beds occupying             on the coast
a level higher      by 50 to 100    feet,  marking the difference of level

1862.]                                   49
between the two periods.            The   effect  of this slow elevation would
be to increase the velocity         and erosive power of the rivers.           This
action, with the other agencies before alluded to, operating upon the
successive portions of the substrata, has gradually worn even those
deep and     long valleys, through which         so many     of the rivers of these
districts flow.     According to variability in the rate of elevation, to
intervals of repose, or to deflections in the current and velocity of
the river, there may exist intermediate levels or terraces of gravel, and
variations in the inclination        of the   slopes,  which may add much to
the complexity of the problem.
   The Fauna of the Low-level Gravel. — Of the forty-three species
of Mollusca found in the higher gravels, thirty-four occur also in the
low levels, together with seven others, making a total of forty- one
species.     Added to   these, there are eight marine species found at        Men-
checourt, with the Cyrena Jluminalis of the Nile and of Grays.                With
this one exception, they are all common living species of England
and France.        As with the former group, there is nothing to give a
definite clue to the character of the climate of the period.                   The
general absence      of southern forms, and the preponderance of such
as  have a wide northern          range, may, however, be noticed.            With
regard to the Mammalia,          the number of determined species is small,
and the general argument follows nearly the same line as that re
lating to the Mammalia of the higher gravels. As with the Mol
lusca, most of the species are common to the two series, whence it
is inferred     that there was no great or sudden break, and that the
change both of conditions and of climate was transitional.                 There is
one   genus only, viz. the Hippopotamus,              about which       some  diffi
culty has     been felt  with reference to the condition of climate.          Four
tusk teeth of this creature have been found at St. Roch, and in this
country its remains are found associated with those of the Reindeer.
Without pretending to explain the difficulty, the author               does not see
why,    if  the other large Pachyderms           were   fitted, as they are now
known      to have been, by warm covering and special adaptation                  to
inhabit cold climates, this extinct         species   of Hippopotamus should
not also have been so adapted.
   The physical phenomena point to            an increased volume       of water in
the rivers, and want those marked indications of ice-action seen in the
high-level     gravels.    Still, boulders of considerable        size were  trans-

ported.     From this fact, and the general balance of evidence furnished
by the fauna, and also from the contraction of the excavation as the
valleys became deeper, the author infers a gradual amelioration in
the temperature, ending in the present climatal conditions.
    Flint-implements.   — The    author observes that flint-implements       are
nowhere so abundant in the low- as they are in the high-level gravels.
The pointed lance-shaped form with blunt butts of the latter is
almost wanting in the former, whereas the ovoid disks of Menche-
court are rare at St. Acheul      ;  again, flakes or flint-knives    are com
mon in the low-level       gravels and rare in the higher beds.          Of the
twenty-four specimens found in the low-level gravel at Paris, twenty-
two are mere flint-flakes.        The author is disposed to attach some
value and significance to this difference of form, and observes, that,
admitting      the climate to have become       less  severe   during the low-
level gravel period, it would follow that the necessity of having the
strong ice-chisels would have diminished.          In all  these cases we are  of
 course much limited to conjectures, seeking to make them in accord
ance    with what   we know    of life under like conditions, and guided by
 the probabilities     of the concurring circumstances.           The mode of
 distribution    of the flint-implements      at the    two   periods certainly
 seems to afford some grounds for believing that the difference         of form
 may arise from difference in the pursuits and occupations of the pri
 mitive    tribes by whom      they were used —pursuits         necessarily and
 primarily influenced by the climate and life of the period.
     Concluding Remarks. — The question of time is then entered upon,
 and    it is shown that the flint-implements          must be carried back
 through the periods of the low- and of the high-level              gravels, and
  that they must be considered to be antecedent to the excavation of
 many of our great river -valleys.           All  these   phenomena     indicate
  periods of long and great changes.        The author only slightly touches
  upon the formation of the loess, which he concludes to be the result
  of temporary floods ; and he remarks that, so far as the question of
  the antiquity of the fluviatile gravels is concerned, little value need
  be attached to the additional        element presented by this covering of
  loam and brick-earth.        This deposit is     succeeded    by the alluvial
  beds of the valleys connected more immediately with our own times.
  With regard     to a measure   of time, the author     does not consider   that
  either the excavation of the valleys or the life evidence of the periods

1862.]                                    51
furnish available data;          nor does     he admit the formation        of the
channel between England and France in the calculation              ; and he gives
reasons to show that this channel is of older date than generally as
sumed, and that the separation existed at the time of the high-level
gravels, and had attained somewhat of its present dimensions at the
time    of the newer gravels.        Most of the land and freshwater shells
and the Mammalia had crossed over at a period anterior to                     this;
and, as even now at          the Island of Saghaleen in lat. 52° N., the
narrow strait freezing during the winter would admit of the passage
of large land animals and man during the cold periods following the
more extreme glacial conditions.
    The author, however, suggests two new modes by which he con
ceives that eventually some approximate                and more exact estimate
may be made both of the age of the high-level                gravels and of the
lapse of time since the extreme glacial period, and embracing there
fore the several periods under consideration.             At present the evidence
is only sufficient to indicate the possibilities of the problem, but it
will need many years of careful observation before sufficient data can
 be obtained for accurate calculation.
     1 st.  With the high-level gravels there         are connected a number      of
 sand and gravel pipes perforating the underlying             chalk to the depths
 generally of from      5  to 50 feet, and from      1  to 10 feet wide, or more.
 As these are     caused    by the slow action of carbonic acid in the water
 gradually percolating through the overlying porous beds, dissolving
 the chalk or other calcareous strata, and gradually letting down the
  superincumbent       drift, it  is evident that    if  the rate of solution and
 removal can be determined, one element for the calculation of a cer
 tain period will be obtained.         In  this various meteorological questions
 will have to    be considered.
     2nd.   In conducting observations        on the temperature   of  deep mines,
 wells, &c., certain discrepancies in the increment of heat at increas
 ing depths and at different         places  have been noticed.       No explana
 tion of these anomalies has         been offered.     The author    suggests   that
 they may arise from           disturbing    causes   originating  with   a former
  period   of intense cold.     At Yakutsk, where the ground is now frozen
 to a depth of 382 feet, the permanent line of 53° Fahr. would, taking
 at an average an increase        of  1° for every 60 feet, be found at a depth
 of 1642 feet.       If,  from some geological change, the mean tempera
                                                                        e 2

                                       52                            [March 27,
ture of Yakutsk were raised to that of our own climate, this line or
 53° would undergo a vertical displacement of 1550 feet.               The time
required for its uniform re-adjustment over a large area would depend
upon various conditions, the chief one being the conductivity              of the
different strata.     The question, therefore, arises, whether traces of
perturbation in the temperature of the outer part of the earth's crust
 in these latitudes, resulting from the action of the extreme cold of the
glacial period, may not yet exist, and,        if so, whether they may not
admit of exact determination with reference to the time elapsed since
the removal of the disturbing cause.
    In conclusion, the author thinks that in the present            state  of the
inquiry it would    be premature to attempt to fix even approximately
 the lapse of time attaching to the flint-implements.            It  is obvious,
however, that our present chronology with respect to the first appear
ance   of Man must      be very greatly extended     ;  but, like a mountain-
 chain in the distance, its vast magnitude           is felt before an exact
measurement of its height and size can be taken.
    Attention is then directed    to the remarkable uninterrupted         succes
sion of life from the pleistocene period under review to the present
 time — a succession so large and important,       that it is not possible to
 imagine the occurrence of any intervening             catastrophe of such a
 nature as to destroy the life of the period over this part of Europe at
 any recent geological period.       There are difficulties in the problem,
 especially the disappearance of the larger animals          ; but the remark
able and convincing       feature in the case is the transmission          to our
time of so large a proportion         of the small and delicate land and
 freshwater shells, which even now follow almost precisely the same
law in their distribution    as they did at these latest geological periods.
    Looking   at the special nature    of the glacial period, and seeing its
 exceptional character, the author feels strongly impressed with the
belief that its  effect  has possibly been to give increased rigidity and
immobility to the flexible crust of the earth, and to produce a state
of equilibrium which might otherwise have been of long and slow
attainment,    whereby it has been rendered fit and suitable for the
habitation and pursuits of civilized man*.
   * In this and his former paper the author has used the term "pleistocene"
in the sense of post-plciocene, including also some beds placed in the newer
pleiocene.

       Tate, Esq.         Received     March 20, 18G2.
                                     (Abstract.)
    In  a former paper        selected   for  the  Bakerian     Lecture,  entitled
"  Experimental       Researches     to determine the Density        of Steam at
different Temperatures,         and to ascertain the Law of Expansion            of
 Superheated Steam" (Phil. Trans. 1860, p. 185), it was shown that
although Dumas, Gay-Lussac, and other distinguished physicists
had determined the density of          steam at 212°,    it was, however, left  for
 these researches to ascertain the law of density, volume, &c. at all
 temperatures,      and also the law of expansion of superheated steam.
These experiments         have therefore been continued, and have elicited
 remarkable results as regards the rate of expansion at various tempe
ratures.
     The earliest experiments        on  this subject were made by Mr. Frost
 in Am erica, but without sufficient accuracy to be of scientific value.
  Mr. Siemens has also experimented on             steam    isolated from water    ;
  his results give a much higher rate of expansion for steam than for
  ordinary   gases  ;  but, owing to some obvious defects of        Mr. Siemens's
  method of conducting         the experiments, we consider his results are
not reliable.
     For  gases,   the rate of expansion is expressed by the formula             for
 constant volume,
                                     ?-=E+f                                     (I)

  where   E   is a constant determined by experiment, and decided by
  Regnault    as 459    in the  case  of air.   In the paper alluded to, it was
  shown that, with a certain proviso, the rate of expansion of super
  heated steam nearly coincided with that of air.                 Within   a short

                                   54                          [April 3,
distance of the maximum     temperature of saturation   the rate of ex
pansion of steam    was found   to be exceedingly variable; near the
saturation-point  it is higher than that of air, and   decreases  as the
temperature is increased,    until it becomes  sensibly identical   with
that of air.    The results upon which this law   was   based were   too
limited in their range for much numerical accuracy in the constants
deduced.
   Hence it has been our object in the present paper to supply the
deficiency in the previous one, by affording experimental data of the
expansion of steam at higher temperatures and with a greater range
of superheating than    was possible  with the apparatus employed in
ascertaining the density of steam.      The results obtained in these
later experiments, however, confirm the general law deduced from the
 previous ones.
   The figure represents the apparatus used when the pressure did

 not exceed that of the atmosphere,         consisting of a glass globe (a)
 3 inches in diameter, and stem 35 inches long; the capacity was
 known to a point (6), where       a piece of platinum wire   was twisted to
 mark accurately the point at which the mercury column in the stem
 was to be brought     to maintain a constant volume in the globe.
     A  1^-inch tube (d),    filled with mercury, rested upon the frame
 (e  e).    The weight of the tube and frame       was  counterbalanced     by
weights (w to). By such an adjustment the tube (d) could be regu
lated with facility, preserving the upper level of the mercury column
 at one uniform      height.   A  cathetometer (g g), with vernier (A), to
read the lower and variable level of the mercury column, was intro
duced.       To heat the globe, the oil-bath (k)     was used, fitted to the
tube (t) by a stuffing-box (») ; the oil-bath is itself immersed in a
mercury bath (f), surrounded by a coil of jets of gas (m m).
     The globe, filled with dry and warm mercury, the air-bubbles
being extracted by means of an air-pump, was inverted to form a
Torricellian vacuum.       A  small glass globule of water was then in
serted, the platinum wire fixed in its place, and an india-rubber         cap
fitted to the extremity of the stem.        Being transferred to its place,
and the india-rubber      cap replaced by an open glass cistern,      so that
the glass (d) could be elevated to its position, the jets were lighted,
and the temperature elevated to 300°.
     From this point the levels of the column      were read off at intervals
 of 50° until the temperature of saturation       was reached.    The levels
 were    taken in a series of descending temperatures, to avoid the in

 as explained    in our previous paper on the density of steam.
    Twelve cubic inches of mercury were measured into the globe, and
a file-mark     made on the stem,     below which, at a distance of 14*45
inches, another file-mark was made, affording a fixed point for ascer
taining the correspondence of the upper file-mark with the readings
on the cathetometer.

atmosphere at the time.                   By deducting the column             so corrected from
the reading of the barometer at the time, the total pressure in the
globe is obtained.   The readings of the thermometer are corrected
for the portion out of the oil-bath. The pressure of mercurial vapour
is calculated from data supplied with great courtesy by ML Regnault,
and embodying the results of unpublished                           experiments.            The pres
sure of this vapour is assumed to be the same as that in a vacuum,
as the vapour               in the globe remains still for               a sufficient      time    (it   is
believed) for saturation to take place.                           In   this view we have been
strengthened by              M. Kegnault's opinion.               By deducting the pressure
of mercury vapour from the total pressure in the globe, the pressure

II. " On         a  New Method of Approximation applicable to Elliptic
      and Ultra-elliptic Functions." — Second Memoir. By                  Charles
      W. Merrifield, Esq.              Communicated by       William Spottis-
      woode, Esq., F.R.S.            Received    March 20, 1862.
                                       (Abstract.)
      Since my first memoir on this subject was read before the Society
 in May 1860, Mr. Sylvester has published a method, more general
 than mine, of applying rational approximation to facilitate the com
 putation       of the integrals of irrational      functions.     His process, at
 which he had arrived independently, included, a majori, the one which
 was the subject of my memoir.              Aided by his papers, my subsequent
  studies have enabled me to view the method with more generality, as
  well as with more precision            and completeness of detail, and        I   am
  now able to present          it in a sufficiently finished and practical      shape
  for the immediate          use  of the computer.      I  append auxiliary Tables
  to facilitate its use in certain cases.
       I begin with the common radical form, starting from               Mr. Sylves
   ter's   definition     of the approximants.       Then decomposing the ap-
    proximant into partial fractions by means of the roots of unity, and
   increasing indefinitely the number of these fractions, I show that the
    method is in reality the application of quadratures to a definite integral
    which    is substituted for the surd.       The application of the process to
    integration      in like manner rests     on the substitution, for the single
    indefinite     integral,   of a double integral,    definite in respect of one
    variable, and indefinite for the other.        The form of this double integral
    is such that the indefinite integration can be performed directly             ; and
    the application       of quadratures    to the definite one is facilitated by a
    peculiar property of functions of the form                   r-s-, namely, ' that
                                                          1+nsin2^
     the quadrature does not require the use of differences, but is obtained
    simply from the mean of the ordinates.                Legendre had previously
     noticed and discussed this peculiarity,          which is    best illustrated   by
     effecting the quadrature by differential        coefficients instead of differ
     ences.     It   will be found that these coefficients    (which   are all  of odd

vanishes at both the limits    and 90 degrees.

which gives        success to the method.
     In   a   second section      I    have given with some detail the mode                          of
effecting the actual computation                of elliptic functions             by   this means.
I   have given several formulae           for using trigonometrical tables with the
exactness       which     these    calculations require, and    think they will be
                                                                     I
found handier for the purpose than those usually given in the books;
at all events     I   find them so myself.            Some of them are my own, and
some are taken,         with more or         less modification,       from Legendre.
     In   a   third section    I   have stated what has been done with                        a    view
to the extension of the method to radicals of                    a   higher index than the
square, and to        a   certain class of differential equations.
     It   should be understood that these processes                  only enable us to find
the integral from the amplitude.                 They do not         enable us to find the
amplitude, modulus, or parameter from                   a   given value of the integral.

     The Lecturer             of the more interesting phenomena
                          gave an account
of the eclipse, and of the methods employed in observing and
recording them        ;    the details of his observations being given in an
elaborate Paper bearing the above title.                    The Lecture       was illustrated
by   a    great    number of diagrams and models.                     The photographic
images of the eclipse were projected                   on   a    screen bv means of the
electric lamp, and some of the more striking phenomena were imi

    The author, for            some    time previous to the organization                     of the

July 18th, 1860, but       as soon as he was informed ot the Astronomer
Royal's views      he   agreed    to join   his   party,    now   known     as the
Himalaya Expedition, from the name of Her Majesty's ship which
conveyed the astronomers composing it to Spain.                     He attributes
much     of the   success    of his operations to the admirable arrange
ments of Professor Airy in England, and to those concerted with Mr.
Vignoles in Spain ; for he was able in consequence greatly to increase
the extent   of his preparations, and to convey           a complete temporary
observatory fitted up with all the numerous requirements which are
essential in astronomical photography.             Besides himself,      his party
consisted of    Mr. Beckley of the Kew Observatory, Mr. Reynolds
(now Mr. De la Rue's private assistant), Mr. Downes, and Mr. E.
Beck, and subsequently the late Mr. Clark.                The author expresses
himself greatly indebted to        these  gentlemen for their most efficient
assistance.
    The party took up their station at            a village   called Rivabellosa,
situated near the town of Miranda de Ebro             ;  the site selected   was a
 thrashing-floor,   on which the observatory was erected.
     The instruments     employed consisted of the Kew heliograph,              for
 the photographic      records  ;  an achromatic     telescope,    by Dallmeyer,
 mounted on a sort of alt-azimuth         stand contrived by the Astronomer
 Royal, which permitted of an equatorial movement by the ingeni
 ously arranged joint action of two racked radius bars.              To this tele
 scope   the author fitted a diagonal       eyepiece    of his own contrivance,
 which allowed of the        use   of reflexion from plain glass in the first
 instance, and then from a portion           silvered on the top surface the
  instant the period of totality commenced.           By its   means he avoided
  the perplexity and loss of time occasioned in unscrewing and screwing
  portions of the apparatus at the most critical period.            To these were
  added a small      transit   theodolite,   three chronometers,        two baro
  meters, and several thermometers.
     The weather proved so unpropitious that it was with much diffi
  culty the objects of the party could be carried out ; and it was only
  by using every available opportunity that          even the    Kew instrument
  could be placed in position.
     The geographical position of the site of the observatory           was ascer
  tained to be — north latitude 42° 42', west longitude                11'   42"7,
  elevation above the mean high-water mark 1572-4 feet.

   The author       made    two sketches     of the luminous        prominences
during the period of totality,       on paper previously      ruled to represent
the position-lines    drawn on a piece       of parallel glass placed in the
focus of the eyepiece,        which    magnified   about      60 times.    These
position-lines    consisted of a square calculated to exactly include the
lunar disk, and two external squares, one exactly one minute of arc
distant from the central square and from the other.                The angles of
the    squares   were   joined    by   diagonal  fainter    lines.   The whole
system was moveable through an arc of 90°, and its position could
be read off on a graduated          external circle divided from        10 to 10
degrees.     The drawings were by chance          made     of nearly the exact
diameter of the lunar disk in the photographs (4 inches), and proved
very valuable in interpreting the phenomena revealed by the latter,
 as the one could be compared by superposition            with the other, and
the several prominences be thus identified.
    One of the prominences, situated about 30° from the north point
 towards the east, became visible several minutes before totality, even
 during the employment of the unsilvered portion of the diagonal
reflector.     As the sun disappeared the author watched for the so-
 called   Baily's   beads,   but   no such phenomenon occurred,            which
occasioned no surprise to him, as he had always believed that it arose
in all   probability    from   the atmospheric     disturbance of an image
formed by a telescope       wanting in definition.
    The author     goes on to describe the various appearances          presented
by the several protuberances,         which were not all of        a rose-colour,
and those which presented this hue were much paler in colour than
his previous reading had led him to expect.               He    is able to speak
with considerable certainty        on this point, having before the eclipse
painted several colours on his drawing-paper,          and was thus enabled
to compare these directly         with the prominences by means of the
light emitted by the corona, it being sufficiently great and polychro
matic for that purpose.          The light of a lamp which was at hand
proved not only useless,       but was detrimental       in making      the com*
parisons.     There   was a considerable amount       of detail, both of form
and colour, in the prominences, which the author has shown in two
coloured drawings which accompany the paper            ;  these are founded on
the original sketches, which are also given in fac-simile, but to some
extent corrected by means of the photographs.

    That the prominences belong to the sun and not to the moon               was
 rendered evident to the observer by the progressive covering of the
 luminous     prominences on the east in the direction          of the moon's
 motion, and the gradual uncovering of fresh prominences on the west            ;
 while prominences         situated in a position nearly at right angles to
the moon's path shifted their angular            position on the moon's edge
 several degrees       during the observations.        The prominence     which
 became     visible before totality, which the author         designates by   A,
was    found to     have  shifted 3° 25' on the moon's limb in an interval
of about 2£ minutes ; it was therefore evident that the region of the
moon which at the commencement of the period was in apparent
contact with the prominence was at some distance from it at the end             ;
and as the prominence           underwent   no change    during that time, the
theory     falls to the ground which ascribes the phenomenon of the
luminous protuberances to some peculiar action of the moon's edge
on   light coming originally from the sun.
    The author describes the general effect of the eclipse to the unas
sisted eye.       He was particularly struck with the peculiar illumination
of the surrounding landscape as the sun became reduced to a small
crescent ; the shadows of all objects were so sharp and the light so
brilliant that it reminded him of the illumination produced by the
electric light    ;  at the same time peculiar     hues were assumed by the
sky and landscape, which suggested the idea that the light of the sun
near the periphery is not only less intense than that of the centre,
but that it may be different in quality.
    No attempt       was made to obtain accurate observations     of the corona,
but nevertheless a few seconds           were devoted to this phenomenon.
Even several minutes before totality the whole contour of the moon
could be distinctly seen         ; when totality had commenced, the moon's
disk appeared of a deep brown in the centre of the corona, which was
extremely      bright near the moon's limb and appeared of a silvery
white, softening off with a very irregular outline and sending forth
some     long streams.       It  extended generally to about from 0-7 to 0-8
of the moon's diameter beyond her periphery.
    The darkness during the totality was not nearly          so great as  might
have    been expected from accounts of previous total eclipses.             The
illumination was markedly distinct from that which occurs in nature
on any other occasion, and certainly was greater than on the brightest

moonlit night, although at the time the light appeared to the author
as less   bright than what he remembered of bright moonlight.                                       By
subsequent trials            he was led to conclude                that the light during a
total eclipse most resembles that degree of illumination                              which exists
in a clear sky soon after sunset, when, after having made out a first-
magnitude star, other stars of less brilliancy can be discerned one
after another by an attentive gazer.                          Jupiter and Venus were the
only objects the author had time to identify, but some neighbouring
observers saw also Castor.
  The most important part of the paper treats of the photographic
observations. The several preparations are minutely described, and
drawings, showing the general arrangements of the observatory, are
given.    In the focus of the secondary magnifier of the Kew helio
graph,    two position-wires,              crossing    at right angles, are fixed at
approximately              an angle   of 45°     to a parallel           of declination.           The
object-glass has an             aperture of 3*4 inches and a focal                       length      of
50 inches     :    the primary focal image of the sun at his mean distance
is 0*47 inch       ;   but before it is allowed to fall on the sensitive plate, it
is enlarged to about 3-8 inches by means of an ordinary Huyghenian
eyepiece.         The object-glass           is so constructed           as to ensure the coin
cidence of the chemical and visual foci                   ;   this coincidence         is,   however,
disturbed         in   a   slight   degree    by the Huyghenian magnifier, which
renders   a       slight adjustment          necessary.         For ordinary sun-pictures,
and those of the several phases of the eclipse except the totality, the
aperture was reduced to               2   inches, —   a   peculiar instantaneous appara
tus being employed to regulate the exposure                             of the sensitive plate.
  The driving-clock   of the heliograph was, for convenience, kept
going during the taking of the partial phases of the eclipse but                             ;       it
was not really necessary to keep     in motion, because the time of
                                                  it
exposure certainly did not exceed the                     -g'^th   of   a   second.
   The position-wires, by stopping off the sun's light, are depicted in
the negatives as white lines crossing the solar disk. It was essential,
in order to turn           these several pictures to account, to note exactly the
time of their being taken, which was done                          by   Mr. Beckley; the click
ing noise made by the instantaneous apparatus,                                  when     it      struck
against   a   stop after releasement, indicating the epoch, which                                  was
noted to the nearest half-second.                     The exact position of the cross

wires was also ascertained by observations        of the sun      made on each
side   of the meridian   ;  this was necessary, because,        in consequence
of the weather, the pole of the heliograph could              be only approxi
mately adjusted in position.
    Upwards of fifty plates      were    placed in the heliograph       between
llh   28m a.m. and 4h 16m      p.m. on    July 18th  ;  some before the com
mencement of the eclipse, and some after.           During totality two pho
tographs were obtained.        One picture was    produced on a plate which
was exposed from      the exact commencement of totality             during  the
minute succeeding this epoch       ;  the second picture was exposed from
about a minute previous to the reappearance of the sun until not
more than a second before he became visible.             In  these pictures the
several prominences are depicted with great clearness           ; and when one
negative is superposed on the other,           corresponding      parts exactly
coincide.    During the taking of the second photograph, an excusable
curiosity on the part of two of the assistants disturbed the telescope
twice, so that the prominences have depicted themselves three times             ;
but there was no difficulty in stopping out the images not belonging
 to either of the three phases thus recorded.           The author has more
 over turned    this  accident to account,       and estimated the relative
 brightness of the prominences in comparison with the sun's photo
 sphere   ; and he considers that they are at least 600 times less bril
 liant than it.    This conclusion has       been drawn from the minimum
 time required by the prominences to depict themselves, which can be
 made out from the photograph          in question.
     By means of   a new micrometer contrived         for that purpose by the
 author, the several photographs         have been measured and discussed.
 The position-angles       of the line joining the sun's centre and the
 moon's centre, and the distances of these             centres for the several
 epochs of the photographs,       have been calculated and compared with
 the corresponding     values calculated by      Mr. Farley for the geogra
 phical position of the observatory.        Other calculations have also    been
 made from the photographs           and compared with certain elements of
 the eclipse calculated by     Mr. Carrington. The results show that the
 photographic    method of observing solar phenomena is capable of
 great exactness.

tained from the photographic         measurements, was         11  "-8, calculation
giving as a mean 12"-8.        The relative diameter of the moon, that of
the sun being taken as unity, as derived from measurements of the
photographs,      comes   out 1*0511,   which     is precisely the theoretical
number     ; on the other hand, they tend to show that the diameters at
present assumed       for the sun and moon, taken conjointly,              are about
4"-0 in    excess  of the truth.
   The paper is accompanied by an extensive series of calculations,
which it is not here necessary to describe. Those, however, relating
to the measurements        of the positions of the luminous prominences
on the two totality-pictures      have especial     interest.    These measure
ments were made         in two   ways:    1st,   the original negatives were
measured by the author's new micrometer               ; 2nd, enlarged positive
copies were      taken on glass,    and the contours       of the prominences
traced and etched upon the glass, which was afterwards centered on
a  dividing     engine and divided,     the divisions      being      subsequently
etched.       Copper   duplicates  were   then made of the glass plates,
which   served to    print off diagrams which accompany the paper.
   Without describing minutely the measurements, it will suffice here
to state that the results go to prove that the luminous                prominences
must belong to the sun and not to the moon.                    For example, the
change in the angular position of the prominence at               a  right angle to
the moon's path, and designated        A in    the paper, has been calculated
to have been 5° 21' for the assumed geographical                  position of the
station  ;   by measurement of the two photographs            it is 5° 32'.     The
motion of the moon in covering and uncovering a prominence in the
line of her path was calculated to have been 92''r8           ; by measurement
it was found to have been 93"-7.          The accordance of         these numbers
is so extremely close,     that it would be difficult      to obtain more con
vincing proofs that the luminous prominences belong to the sun.

     When    I  was honoured      by an invitation     to deliver the Croonian
 Lecture,   I  at first hesitated to undertake the task, however gratifying
 to me, because      I  was not prepared    with   a subject  of discourse which
 I  thought likely     to prove  of sufficient general interest to the Fellows
of this distinguished body, engaged as they are in the pursuit of very
various branches of " Natural Knowledge."                I felt that on such an

original research, but      I feared  that the matter     I  had actually at my

            Termination      of the Nerves in the Voluntary Muscles.
     The investigation of the termination                 of the nerves in the muscles
has for some time occupied the attention of various able inquirers,
but the results attained            are by no means               in mutual accordance.
 The recent researches of Kiihne, in particular,                        on the      muscular
 nerves of the Frog, have led him to conclusions differing so widely
 from those of Wagner,             Reichert,       Schaafhausen,        Beale and others,
 that   I was induced to apply myself to the question,                    in the hope that
 I  might be able to contribute something towards its elucidation*.
     While previous observers have been unable to trace the muscular
 nerves     further than the surface of the muscular fibres, Kiihne                            f
    * As  the more immediate purpose         of my present inquiry was to examine into
 the accuracy   of Kiihne's  recent   descriptions,     I did not deem it necessary in the
 Lecture   to do  more  than   advert   to the   labours    of previous inquirers.    In order,
 however, to prevent misconception,        I  think  it  as well to  explain  that  whilst  pale
 nucleiferous branching fibres have been seen and repeatedly described as the ter
 minal ramifications of sentient nerves, some observers have also described the
 nerves as ending on muscular fibres by similar pale filaments.             Thus Axmann, in
 1853, represented    the nerves of the cutaneous          muscle of the mole as ending       in
 networks of fine fibres; and more recently, Schaafhausen               (1859) described the
 terminations of the nerves in muscles as a very fine network which could be ren
dered visible by means of carmine.         In justice to Dr. Beale also, I must here state
 that, in the account he has given of his elaborate researches on this difficult point
 of microscopic anatomy      (Phil.  Trans. 1860), he describes the nerves of striped
 muscles as terminating on the sarcolemma           in a network of pale fibres connected
 with nuclei, rendered visible by carmine and chemical reagents.                   Speaking of
these fibres, Dr. Beale observes (p. 616) that their
                                                            " general appearance and refract
                                                                                          " ; he
ing power are the same in every part except where the nuclei are situated
 adds (p. 617), that "the axis-cylinder gradually loses its hard fibrous character
 (frog), and the white substance its peculiar refractive power and consistence.             The
 whole fibre, as seen in my specimens, seems to consist of a very transparent and
perhaps    delicately granular substance,       which can be shown to be composed of
fatty and albuminous materials," &c.           Judging, however, from Dr. Bealc's figures,
which represent the terminal network of the nerves distributed on the muscular
fibres of the mouse, and from his description, I am led to conceive that he has not
observed what Kiihne and I have seen.             He does not mention that he has seen
single dark-bordered nerve-fibres running out into simple and ./in6-brauched pale
fibres, and, moreover,    gives  no   figures    showing such      ramifications.    It is true
Dr.   Beale says that the same pale nerve-fibres         he has described    and figured   from
the mouse, occur also in the frog ; but from what I have seen I cannot admit that
pale fibres, of the size and with the arrangement             represented in his figures from
the mouse, are to be met with in the frog. — A. K.

  believes he has discovered that the nerve-fibres, on reaching a mus
 cular fibre, penetrate into its interior     and end amidst the muscular
 substance by several pale branches.      He   states that the nerve-fibre, on
 reaching the muscular fibre, divides into several branches which retain
 their characteristic  dark contours until they enter the muscular fibre,
 within which they     become    pale and faintly outlined.     He conceives
 that the tubular membranous sheath of the nerve-fibres coalesces with
 the sarcolemma, and that the branches when they enter the muscular
 fibre lay aside not only their membranous sheath but their white
 substance, to which they owe their dark outline, and are in fact re
 duced to mere ramifications      of the axis-cylinder or central thread of
 the original fibre.
     In connexion with these internal     fibres, Kiihne further describes
 certain bodies which he proposes to name           " terminal nerve-buds
                                                                             "
 (Nervenendknospen).        These are attached laterally to the pale fibres,
 which then may end at some distance beyond in free pointed extre
 mities, while some of the pale fibres appear actually to terminate
in these end-buds.       The bodies in question are stated to be oval-
shaped corpuscles,      smaller than the well-known        muscular    nuclei,
usually pointed    at their  distal extremity, where they bear a minute
 filamentous tuft.    According to Kiihne      each consists  of a little oval
mass of finely granular substance, into which a fine filament,           appa
rently derived from the axis-cylinder of the pale nerve-fibre, enters,
like a pedicle, at one end, and runs along the middle as a sort of axis-
cylinder of the corpuscle, at the free end of which it swells out into
a small interior pyriform body containing minute spherules very dif
ferent in aspect from the granules of the surrounding          granular sub
stance.    The structure thus described presents, as Kiihne observes,
some resemblance to that of a Pacinian Body, but yet with marked
differences, and he does not lay any great stress on the point.
     These observations of Kiihne were made with a magnifying power
of from 1000    to 1800 linear, on fresh muscular fibres (from the gas
trocnemius of the frog) immersed in vitreous humour or blood-serum,
also on fibres prepared by macerating         a portion   of muscle for    24
hours in extremely dilute sulphuric acid, then digesting for an equal
time in distilled water at about 100°     F., and finally shaking it briskly
with a little water in a test-tube so as to separate         the tissue into
single fibres.

    Believing    that the wide divergence in the conclusions                  heretofore
arrived at has been owing in great measure to difference in the methods
of investigation employed, I made many trials in order to find out re
agents which would increase the transparency of the muscular fibres
without attacking or        at least obscuring the finer fibres            of the nerves,
and have found the following to be well adapted for the purpose in view.
1.  Extremely dilute acetic acid*.          2. Diluted hydrochloric acid in the
proportion     of  1  part of acid to 1000 of water;             but as this reagent
eventually softens and destroys the muscles, it is well to observe that
the suitable time of exposure to it is from about 12 to 24 hours.                        3.
Artificial digestive fluid, the      use of which for       a similar reason     requires
precaution.       4. Very dilute nitric acid in the proportion of               1 part   of
acid to 1000 of water.
    The object      selected  for examination          was for the most part the
cutaneous pectoral muscle of the frog, in which the ramification                         of
the    nerves has been        so    successfully      traced    and represented          by
 Reichertf.       In general    I   have found       it better not to       separate    the
muscular fibres, although         I have    not omitted also to examine single
 fibres from the same         muscle, and from            the gastrocnemius.           The
 magnifying power employed was from 500 to 600 linear, obtained
by Hartnach's lenses        "k   immersion" No.          9  & 10.    I   have also    tried
 a power of from 1000 to 1500 as used by Kiihne, but                   I  could discover
 nothing by its aid which         I   did not   see    equally well with the lower
 amplification.
     In proceeding now to give an account of my own observations,                         I
 have first to state that     I   have been able to confirm the observation
 of Kiihne that in the frog's muscles the nerve-fibres really branch out
 at their ends into delicate pale filaments — a fact not hitherto                  recog
 nized by Wagner, Reichert            and others, who have           investigated the
 relation of the nerves to the muscles in that animal.
     But whilst agreeing with Kiihne           as to the existence         of  these pale
 fibres,  I  am satisfied that they are situated, not            within the muscular
 fibre but on its surface, as       I  shall more fully explain hereafter           ;  and
 that they lie outside the sarcolemma, through                   which they do not
 penetrate.      As to their nature, Kiihne regards them              as prolongations

 of the axis-cylinder alone        ;  but it decidedly appears to me that, besides
 the    axis-cylinder, they        are     furnished       with    a  prolongation      of the
 membranous sheath          ;  indeed       I  have seen this so clearly in a great
 many favourable instances, that                I   can   have no doubt on the point.
 According to my view, therefore, the delicate membranous sheath
 does   not quit the nerve-fibre and                coalesce    with the sarcolemma,          as
 Kuhne believes, but continues              to surround a pale prolongation              of the
 soft contents     of the nerve-tube.             As to the matter contained in the
 membranous         sheath,    it no doubt always comprehends                        the axis-
 cylinder, and is chiefly formed by a prolongation                       of that structure     ;
 but   I have   seen examples in        which the contained matter showed slight
 varicosities     and a certain darkness of outline, from which                        I  infer

from each other at the commencement of the pale fibres, yet in their
further progress       these structures         coalesce     together, and the terminal
fibres then appear as uniform pale filaments.                     They    are still, however,
to be regarded as tubes          ;   for, in the first place, they are prolonga
tions    of  a decidedly      tubular fibre, and, secondly, when treated with

certain reagents, such as acetic acid, they exhibit a precipitate                             of
fine sparse granules in their interior, as               Kiihne has also observed                 ;
although when examined in the fresh state, or after being treated
with hydrochloric acid, or artificial                  digestive  fluid, they appear
pellucid and uniform throughout.                 It    is further worthy of remark,
that whilst the pale fibres are for the most part rectilinear prolonga
tions of the dark-contoured              fibres, instances occur in which a dark
fibre ends by dividing at once into two or three pale fibres.                             More
remarkable still are the cases in which a pale fibre comes off laterally,
and sometimes at right angles from a dark fibre, or where two pale
fibres come off together from opposite                   sides   ;   because       such cases,
which Kiihne appears not           to have seen, or at least has not represented,
are well calculated to show that the pale fibres are furnished                         with   a
prolongation of the membranous sheath.
   The next question of interest arising from Kiihne's observation
refers to the bodies which he looks upon as peculiar terminal organs,
and names the terminal nerve-buds.                    As regards      these corpuscles,          I
must confess that, after the most careful investigation,                       I   have failed
to discover that they possess            the peculiar       internal       structure which
Kiihne    assigns      to them.       Considering         the skill       and      address in
microscopic investigation which Kiihne                  has evinced in his inquiry,
and feeling persuaded that he must have met with what                                 seemed
to him sufficient indications            of the structure he has described,                   I
bestowed the greatest pains on the examination                        of   these     so-called
end-buds.        I   studied them in muscles and muscular fibres, both fresh
and treated with reagents.           I   employed the same magnifying powers,
and equally good lenses        ;   but the only conclusion             to which       I   could
arrive   is,   that the corpuscles in question are nothing                      but ordinary
nuclei connected with the membranous sheath of the pale nerve-fibres,
not essentially differing from those found attached to the sheath                             of
the dark-contoured        fibres from which the pale fibres are derived.                      It
is   true that some of them show                 a    dark streak in the middle or
towards the border, which at first sight might suggest                         a   peculiarity
of structure    ;    but the appearance     is   obviously due to          a   fold or crease
on the surface, and the same             thing   is    seen in the undoubted nuclei
of the dark-contoured          fibres.      Their shape, position,              and relative
size may be judged        of from the figures    I      have given    ;    and I    have only
further to remark, that in fresh preparations                    they are usually very

   1862.]                                71
  faint, and therefore somewhat difficult to recognize         ;  but with certain
  reagents, such as acetic acid, they become           darker, more granular,
  and somewhat shrunken,       with an irregular outline     ;   with others, such
  as  hydrochloric acid, they appear more homogeneous and pale. As
  to their situation, they are attached along the fibres ; and I have
 never seen them at the ends, as Kuhne in some instances found,
 although sometimes they are placed very near the end. Sometimes
 one is placed in the angle of division of a fibre.          They appear to be
 attached laterally; yet       I  cannot doubt that they lie within the
 membranous sheath of the pale fibre, although             the prolongation of
 the latter over them cannot be shown as a separate structure.                  Were
 further evidence required          concerning    the   true     nature      of these
 corpuscles,   I  might add that nuclei      of precisely the       same character
 exist on the pale terminal fibres of the sensory nerves distributed to
 muscles, as   I   shall more fully explain in the sequel, and indeed on
 the final ramifications of nerves in general, of which we have examples
 in the skin of the mouse and frog, in mucous membranes, in the
 cornea, and in the electric organ of the torpedo.
     I come now to a more difficult question, namely, whether the pale
 end-fibres of the nerves really lie within the muscular               fibres or not.
 Important     as the    determination     of this question      is   in relation to
 physiology,     I  can confidently    say  that  I  entered upon          it without
bias, and     studiously    put aside every consideration which might
 militate against the notion that the nerves penetrate into the muscular
 fibres.   Indeed I myself at one time thought that in certain parts of
the cutaneous pectoral muscle of the frog          I had seen muscular fibres
 penetrated by nerve-fibres.         On    careful investigation,        however,   I
became convinced that the seeming interior              situation        of the pale
fibres is an illusive appearance, and so many proofs against its reality
presented themselves, that         I  was finally constrained        to come to a
different conclusion from Kuhne on this point also.
     According    to my view, therefore, the pale terminal ramifications           of
the nerves lie wholly without the muscular fibres, that is, on the outer
surface of the sarcolemma.        In support of this   opinion     I may, without
insisting on negative evidence, which may be less regarded, adduce, in
the first place, the fact that not unfrequently a pale fibre may be seen
running on     a muscular fibre towards       the border, and then turning
round to the other side, obviously outside the sarcolemma.                    Again

                                           72                                 [May    I,
a pale fibre running      along the border of a muscular fibre sometimes
presents serpentine bendings, which appear alternately under and over
the muscular fibre, and in the latter case are clearly exterior to the
sarcolemma.         Moreover    I have observed that the pale fibres derived
from one dark fibre are sometimes distributed to two muscular fibres,
and must therefore run outside and between them, — an appearance
not reconcileable with the descriptions              of Kiihne, who       states  that
nerve-fibres     retain their     dark    contours      until they penetrate the
muscular      fibre, and that the whole of the terminal               pale filaments
derived from a nerve-fibre are contained within one muscular fibre.
     In  further corroboration of what has been said             I may add, that in
 surface-views of the parts in question the pale nerves always appear
above the cross striae of the muscular               fibre, also above its nuclei       ;
which fact would, it       is true, not decide whether          the pale fibres were
 outside or inside the sarcolemma, but is sufficient to prove that they
 do not lie amidst the contractile substance.              Further, this contractile
 substance within the sarcolemma may, by means of dilute hydro
 chloric acid,    be softened and reduced to a           fluid  state, and neverthe
 less the pale fibres retain their original position unaltered, even when
 the liquefied     contents of the sarcolemma with the muscular nuclei
 flow backwards and forwards within the tube.                Lastly, when muscular
 fibres are treated with acetic acid of a certain strength, the whole
 contents of the sarcolemma are squeezed                  out in the form of long
 transversely striated cylinders        ; so that     on   cutting   across the fibres
  of  a muscle near the part where         it receives   a nerve, and treating     it in
  the    way   indicated,    the proper       substance of the fibres          may be
  examined apart from the sarcolemma, at the place where their nerves
  reach them.        Now, on repeatedly trying this experiment, I have
  never found a trace of the nerve-fibres on the extruded portions,
  whilst on the other hand they             are still to be seen on the emptied
  sarcolemma.
      It remains for me yet to say a word as to the mode in which the
  pale nerve-fibres actually        terminate,    a point     on which     I  confess    I
   have still some doubt.        It  is true that      I have observed apparently
  free ends as represented by Kuhne            ; but, on the other hand, appear
   ances   sometimes present themselves which suggest the question,
   whether on the muscular fibre, as in the physiologically              allied electric
   organ of the torpedo, there may not be an extremely fine network

 1862.]                                  73
in which the pale nerve-fibres terminate.              Thus in many     cases there
is an appearance      on the pale fibres of numerous            short, pointed    or
blunt, lateral processes,    or at least a certain want of definition in their
outline, indicating that they may possibly send out still finer offsets.
At the    same time    I have not been able to trace the matter further in
this direction   ;  and as regards the few undoubted cases of conjunction
of the pale fibres which I have hitherto met with,             I  am not disposed
to interpret them in the above sense.               Moreover     we can often see
the pale fibres so sharply and beautifully defined, and maintaining              so
long their rectilinear course, that       it is difficult not  to regard them as
the true terminations      ; so that   the above-mentioned appearances to
the contrary may perhaps be owing to the effect of the reagents used,
which, while they clear up the muscular              fibres, may attack more or
less the extremely delicate substance of the pale nerve-fibres.
  On the Distribution     of Sentient Nerves in the Muscles of the Frog.
    Having thus laid before the Society the results of my observations
on the motorial nerves of the frog's muscles, I have now to speak
 of the terminations       of other    nerves   which     are distributed    to the
muscles of the same animal, and which are probably sensory in their
office.     Nerves    which    are   probably     of    a  sentient   nature   have
already    been    observed in human         muscles by myself,        and in the
cutaneous pectoral muscle of the frog by Reichert, who takes the
same view as to their nature.         As, however, the mode of termination
of these nerves has not heretofore been fully investigated,                 I  have
been led to extend my inquiries         to that question, and beg leave now
to state the principal results.
    The sentient nerves of the cutaneous pectoral muscle of the frog
are supplied by the common moto-sensory nerve of the muscle
(fig. 2, a a a), from which they              come    off at different points as
single fibres, and, proceeding to       the muscle, branch out upon it in its
whole extent, even in parts which are destitute of motorial                 nerves.
As regards the details of distribution, however, there             is not even an
 approach    to uniformity in any two muscles, and therefore, instead
of attempting       a general description,      I  will refer   to fig.  2,   which
 represents an individual case as seen under a low magnifying                power,
 carefully copied from nature.
    In this   instance the sentient nerves consisted             of five principal

                                                                   [May    I,

   1862.]                                       75
  truncules as they may be called, each, however, being but a single fine
 fibre  ; one of these (fig. 2 4), larger than the rest, supplied the upper
 part  of the muscle with branches, two (c, d) went to the middle, and
 two rather long ones (e,          f)   were distributed      on the lower part of the
  muscle.      As to the original source of these truncules,               I  agree     with
  Reichert in thinking that they               are   all derived from     one   principal
 sentient    fibre, which is mixed up with the more numerous                         motor
 fibres in the small nerve a, a, a, which is supplied                 to the cutaneous
 muscle.        It  is true that        I  have not been        able, any more than
 Reichert,     actually     to trace back         these   truncules    to their     parent
 fibre in the trunk of the common nerve.                   Nevertheless     I feel much
 confidence      in believing that          they    arise in the     way    stated   ;   and
 especially because       I  have met with cases in which the parent fibre of
 all the sentient nerve-fibres            of the cutaneous muscle         escapes      from
 among the motorial           fibres of the common muscular nerve at some
 distance from the muscle            ;  so that     its division  into the secondary
 truncules may be seen.           Moreover     I  have never seen fibres,    which from
 their final distribution may           be reckoned as motory, coming from the
 sentient    fibres, nor the latter          from     the former   ; although     I    have
 sometimes met with a deceptive appearance to the contrary, caused
 by true motor         fibres attaching         themselves for a little way to a
 sentient fibre, and then seeming to come off as branches of it.
     In their    progress the dark-bordered             sentient fibres for the most
 part tend towards the outer or cutaneous surface of the thin muscle,
 on reaching       which      they     branch     out upon it underneath          a     thin
 fascia, which covers the muscle and forms also the wall of an adjacent
 lymph-space.
     The terminations of         these sentient nerve-fibres were not           seen      by
 Reichert,    and doubtless because he used potash in his examination
of them    ; but with the aid of some of the reagents already mentioned
they may be traced out, although                  from their extreme tenuity and
paleness this is no easy matter.                 Their mode of termination           is on
the whole similar         to that of the motor nerves, only the pale end-
fibres have a more extended distribution and are much finer.                           The

    figures will serve better than a long description to give a correct
    idea of their terminations.             Whilst fig.              2, drawn under        a low mag
    nifying power, represents their general mode of distribution, fig. 3
    shows a small part of their ramification and two or three termina
    tions,   highly magnified.             It    will          be   seen       that the larger     fibres
    divide and redivide into smaller branches, which still retain their
    dark contours, but give off in their course lateral pale branches, and
    finally end in pale and numerous prolongations.                               In the pale fibres,
    at their commencement         the membranous                      sheath is distinct from the
    contained fibre, which doubtless consists of the axis-cylinder,                              with at
    first some part of the medullary                       substance       ;   in their progress the

smaller in size   ;  indeed the extreme prolongations          are in some places
attenuated to the size of filaments of connective tissue.                 Their fine
terminations,     moreover, lie quite superficially       in the perimysium       or
sheath of the muscle, and between it and the muscular                    fibres, and
are in  a great measure confined to the outer or cutaneous surface ot

under surface.
                          Nerves   of  the Blood-Vessels.
   Besides the sentient nerves which            I have here described,        I have
found, in the same cutaneous muscle of the frog, nervous filaments on
the blood-vessels, although         I  have not yet been able fully to satisfy
myself   as to their      source and distribution.        These vascular nerves
entirely agree in character with the pale sentient fibres, and, like them,
are furnished    with nuclei.      I have   found them chiefly on small veins,
and on fine vessels on the arterial side of the capillaries, which were,
however, destitute of a muscular coat.            On  these vessels   I have  traced
them a considerable way, passing from one branch                   to another and
often dividing, but have not been able to observe distinct terminations.
Now and then also          I have recognized them on vessels possessing a
decidedly    arterial    structure   ;  but  I  am   unable to state anything
positive as to their arrangement in this case, inasmuch as the nuclei
in the outer coat of the small arteries occasion much difficulty in fol
lowing out   pale nucleiferous fibres.       Once only    I was  fortunate enough
to trace the origin of one of these vascular fibres from a dark-bordered
sentient fibre  ;   and this observation, so far as it goes, together with
their distribution     to vessels destitute    of a muscular coat, favours the
notion that the nerve-fibres in question are of the sentient kind.
      On the Nerve-tufts in the Cutaneous Muscle                of the Frog.
   In  the same muscle of the frog to which             I  have already made so
constant reference,      there may be observed, and most commonly about
the end of the winter season, from three to five objects of peculiar
structure, which at first sight appear to be of the nature of tactile
corpuscles or terminal nerve-bulbs, but which really do not belong
to that class of organs.          The objects in question are indicated in

 They     are found on the finer muscular fibres, and appear on a super
 ficial inspection as nodular swellings or somewhat thickened portions
 of the fibre, marked by          a profusion    of rather roundish      nuclei, and
 receiving a single very thick nerve-fibre,           loosely surrounded       by its
 comparatively wide membranous sheath.                 On further examination it
 is found that the nerve-fibre, on reaching the nodule of the muscle,
 is wound up at one or more spots on the surface into a coil or tuft, in
 the mean time undergoing repeated division            ; and for the most part it
 may be seen to enter the muscular fibre, in which the dark-bordered
 fibres, becoming finer, are finally lost to view.

    The last-mentioned        fact struck     me   as specially   important, inas
much as it seemed to afford an instance of the penetration of a nerve
into the interior of a muscular          fibre, as maintained by Kuhne.           On
a careful       examination,    however, of the structures         in question in
muscles       rendered    transparent     by   acetic acid,    I found that the
apparently       simple muscular fibre bearing the swelling is really a
small bundle of from three to seven fine fibres (fig. 5), and that the

   cular fibres.

     On tracing       the peculiar     and seemingly       simple     muscular   fibres
  towards the ends of the muscle,           I  found that they there evidently
  consist of several smaller but still transversely              striated fibres, and
  this brought to my mind the bundles of fine muscular fibres described
  by Weismannf, and known to me also from actual inspection, which
  induced that observer to infer the occurrence of longitudinal divisions
  of the striated fibres.       This led  me to study these bundles singly by
 treating the cutaneous muscle with strong                solution    of potash, and
 then    I  found    that   it is precisely    these    particular    bundles which
 (appearing as single fibres)         exhibit   the peculiar      swellings with the
 coiled nerve.       In  the situation   of the swelling the finer component
 fibres of the bundle cling fast together, even after the operation of
 the alkali, and a certain amount of striated granular uniting matter
 is  found between them, which may               be  partly the remains of fine
nerve-fibres and capillaries, and some accompanying connective tissue.
Now,     if it be  admitted that the finer muscular fibres composing the
 bundle are generated by the division of thicker muscular fibres, as
Weismann         justly concludes,      the   explanation      of    the   nerve-tufts
becomes      easy  ; inasmuch      as they may be conceived to arise from a
simultaneous growth and division of the nerve-fibre belonging to the
parent muscular         fibre, in order that each        of the young muscular
fibres may obtain its branch of nerve.              The process by which this is
effected cannot be        satisfactorily studied in consequence of the close
cohesion of the fine muscular fibres at the spot, but most probably
the original pale terminal fibres of the parent nerve undergo further
development by growth            and by multiplication         of the nuclei,    so as
finally to supply all the          new  muscular     fibres  ;  and   I  think it not

  unlikely that a part    of the numerous nuclei in the neighbourhood
  belong to the nerve-fibres.
     Simultaneously    with the increase of its terminal fibres the dark-
 bordered parent fibre doubtless augments in thickness, which explains
  the fact, otherwise difficult to understand,         that it is invariably   of
 much    larger  size   than   the   nerve-fibres   proceeding    to the other
  muscular fibres.
     From what has     been stated    it will thus be seen that the relation   of
 the nerve to the peculiar structures described does not support the
 views of Kiihne.
   On the Termination      of the Nerves in the Involuntary Muscles, and
        on the disposition of the Nerves in the Heart of the Frog.
     Having, to the best of my power, investigated the ending of the
 nerves in voluntary muscles, I thought it right to extend my re
 searches  to those   of the involuntary muscular organs, respecting the
 ultimate terminations of which very few, if any, satisfactory observa
 tions have been heretofore made known.
    The muscles    I selected  for examination were those of the heart and
 pharynx of the frog, and the methods of preparing them were the
same as for the voluntary       muscles.
    The  nerves of the frog's heart      are the two nervi vagi or pneumogas-
trics, which, having reached the heart at the place where the venous
sinus joins with the right auricle, enter the septum between            the two
auricles, and proceed therein to the ventricle.        During this part of their
course the two trunks of the vagi, which join together at their entrance
into the heart, are almost everywhere beset with numerous ganglionic
cells.   These cells in some parts form larger masses, well described
by Bidder several years ago*.           One or two of these masses lie in the
                                                               " superior auri
upper part of the septum, and may be called the
cular ganglions
                 ";   another is situated in the lower part of the septum,
near the ventricle, the "inferior auricular ganglion";          and a very re
markable and constant ganglion is seated in each of the two larger
valves placed between the ventricle and the auricles, — these           are the
"  ventricular ganglia
                         " of Bidder.
    Apart from  these larger    ganglionic     masses   on the trunks     of the
vagi, there are found, although without regular arrangement, gangli-
                             * Miiller's Archiv, 1852.

onic cells, single or in small clusters, on the larger branches distri
buted to the venous sinus and the auricles, but none on those of the
ventricle  ; so that the ganglionic     matter of the ventricle exists only
at  its venous aperture.
    Respecting    the microscopic    structure of these parts, it is known
that amongst the ganglionic cells there are many which give origin
each to only one nervous fibre, and have therefore been termed                  uni
polar cells, whilst there are others that apparently give off no fibres,
and are named apolar cells        ;  but it is as yet altogether          unknown
whether the proper or radical fibres of the vagi connect themselves
with the ganglionic cells of the heart or not, and it         is equally uncertain
from what immediate source the nerve-fibres proceeding to the mus
cular substance of the heart are derived.
    Most physiologists    seem to believe that the fibres         of the vagus or
pneumogastric are not directly        distributed   to    the muscular fibres of
the heart, but that they act only through the medium of the gan
 glionic cells, and that the fibres derived from         these celb are the real
 motory nervous elements.           So far as   I  know, however, notwith
 standing its importance, no one has hitherto examined into this matter.
     My own inquiry has had a twofold object           :   first, to ascertain the
 relation of the pneumogastric to the ganglionic cells             ;  and secondly,
 to find out the mode of termination of the ultimate divisions                of the
 nerves on the muscular fibres.
     As regards the first question, all my observations tend to show that
 the nervous system of the frog's heart is constituted on a very simple
 principle. There are, in fact, two distinct although associated systems
 of nervous fibres distributed to every part of the muscular walls of
 the heart   :  namely, first, the proper or radical fibres of the vagus,
 which   pass  through the ganglia of the heart, without,            so far as I can
 discover, connecting themselves with the ganglionic cells, and proceed
 straightway to the muscular fibres      ;  and secondly, fibres derived from
 ganglionic cells, which are associated with the original              vagus-fibres,
 and run with them to the muscular tissue.
     The obvious bearing of this matter on important questions of phy
 siology requires that   I  should here explain the grounds on which the
 conclusion now stated is founded.          On this head       I have first to state
 that, in following with the microscope and with the aid of potash the
 fibres of the vagus as they pass through the several ganglions of the
     VOL.  XII.                                                          G

heart,  it is  easy to see that they     run through these bodies without
forming any connexion with the ganglionic cells.              Of course I do not
pretend to have traced every individual fibre, but        I can speak positively
of the large majority, and conclude that thesame holds good generally,
the more so as the ganglion-cells themselves present conditions which
corroborate this conclusion.         These cells, that is to say, all of them
which   are connected      with nerve-fibres and whose connexions can         be
clearly made out, are unipolar, or send out but a single fibre, and
that in a peripheral direction, without having any connexion with the
transcurrent fibres of the vagus.         Bipolar or multipolar cells    are not
to be seen: some apparently            apolar cells present themselves, but
concerning these it may be doubted whether they are not unipolar
cells whose issuing fibre is in some          way hidden from view.       I may
add that, as the cells lie mostly at the side of the vagus and its branches,
and not amongst its fibres, their relation to the latter is less difficult
to determine.
   From what has         been   said I  feel justified in my conclusion that
there are   in the frog's heart two distinct systems of nervous fibres,
one ganglionic,      the other directly proceeding from the vagi or pneu-
mogastric nerves.
   Defore proceeding, in the next place, to describe the terminations
of the  nerves,    I  have to explain that the muscular tissue of the frog's
heart is entirely made up of short spindle-shaped uninucleated fibres,
or fibre-cells,    resembling in every respect those described by me in
the involuntary       muscles generally, except that they have very distinct
transverse striae.      These striated fibre-cells, as correctly described by
Weismann,       are arranged so as to form larger        and smaller bundles,
and these unite into a network which, in each of the three parts of
the heart, is continuous throughout.           Now, respecting the nerves, it
is easy  to show that their smaller branches, composed of dark-bordered
fibres from the vagus and the ganglion-cells, also form a general net
work, with larger and smaller meshes,          on or between the secondary
muscular fasciculi.       As the ramifications become finer the component
nerve-fibres     gradually   lose their medullary      sheath, and are finally
continued     into pale nucleated filaments which lie singly or two or
three together in the finest muscular bundles.           The last terminations
are pale, nucleated fibres, entirely agreeing        in aspect with those    de
scribed as the ends of the sentient nerves in the voluntary muscles.

  18612.]                                  83
 They enter here and there into the fasciculi of muscular fibre-cells,
 ramify in these bundles, and end in very fine pointed extremities. The
 muscular fasciculi are on the whole rather richly supplied with these
 terminal    fibres, so that two or three may be readily found in each
 bundle by any one accustomed to such investigations.               Still it is plain
 that the nerve-terminations       are  by no means equal in number to the
 muscular fibre-cells, so that several of the latter must be governed
 by one and the same terminal nerve-fibre.
     The   same     mode of nerve-termination         as  in the heart prevails
 in the non-striated       muscular    tissue of the pharynx and bladder           of
 the frog, excepting that the terminal fibres are more scanty               ; but  as
 these   run over   a larger extent    of the muscular tissue before coming
  to an end, their comparative rarity may be compensated by their
  acting at the same time upon a larger number of the muscular fibres.
     With   these remarks     I  conclude the account of my anatomical in
 vestigation of the terminations of nerves in muscles.          It will be obvious
 to every one conversant with the physiology of the muscular system,
 that many of the facts on which             I  have dwelt are of more or less
 importance in reference to physiological questions           ; and  I would    have
 gladly availed myself of the opportunity now            so courteously afforded
me    of addressing this learned Society, to take up also the physiological
 side  of the question, did     I not fear to have already made too large a
 demand on your patience.           I  refrain therefore from entering on so
large a subject, and shall take leave only to offer the following as what
appear to me to be the more interesting physiological inferences from
the anatomical facts       I have described.
    1.  As the motor nerves lie outside the sarcolemma, and                are con
fined in their      distribution to    a comparatively      short portion of the
muscular      fibre, it may be inferred       that there must be action at a
distance.
    2.  As the ends of the motor nerves             are pale fibres destitute      of
medullary sheath, it would appear that the latter is of but secondary
importance.        The   same fact may perhaps also afford an explanation
of the special action of certain poisonous          agents,  as the urari, on the
ends of these nerves.
    3. The muscles have numerous sentient nerve-fibres distributed at
their surface, or on the surface of their larger divisions.
                                                                   g2

    4. The heart,     at least the heart     of the frog, has two distinct     sets
of nervous fibres, those of the pneumogastric                 and those from the
ganglion-cells, which are both distributed to the muscles. The vagus
therefore acts directly on the muscular fibres of the organ, and the
well-known      experiment of Weber        can scarcely be explained      through
a supposed action of the vagus on the ganglia.                 On the other hand,
the ganglia and their fibres are also motorial               organs of the heart,
and alone act when        it is separated from the body.

    Crushing usually took place at 1000 to 2000 lbs. additional pres
sures beyond the above limits, up to which the compressions were
tolerably uniform.
    The discussion of these Tables fully presents     some interesting and
 novel results.
    Generally the quartz rock is less compressible than the slate      ;  the
softest quartz, however, is much more compressible than the softest
slate in a direction   parallel  to the lamination of both.      In this di
rection also the hardest slate is more than double as compressible as
the hardest quartz.    Transverse to the lamination, however, both the
hardest slate and quartz have nearly the same coefficient of compres
sibility, which is very small for both.         In the latter direction also
the softest slate and quartz have almost the same coefficient, but one
about four times as great as for the hardest like rocks.
   The author points out several conclusions of much interest dedu-
cible from these experiments as to the physical and geological con
ditions under which these rocks were formed and consolidated.            The
compression by natural forces has already been greatest in directions
transverse to the lamination.      The great compressibility     in the op
posite directions, or parallel to the lamination, appears to arise chiefly
from the mass of the rock being made up of minute wedge-shaped
mineral particles, deposited all with their largest dimensions on the
plane of lamination,   and so acting on each other like wedges.
   Some curious circumstances in the mode of giving way of the rocks
under pressure are shown by the author           to be probably connected
with their   mass  being formed      of  an aggregate    of several simple
minerals.
   He points out the great differences in wave-transmissive power in
directions transverse to and parallel to the lamination which these ex
periments disclose.     The specific gravities of the several specimens
of rock are then given, to enable the modulus of elasticity to be ob
tained in feet, and the general results of the experiments are com
prised in the following Table (p. 87)      : —
   The author then proceeds to apply       these results to the comparison
of the theoretic and actual transit-periods of the wave of impulse.
   The general expression for elastic wave-propagation in a homo
geneous medium may be expressed by an equation of the form
                         V=V^L=         8-024 4/h,

    where   L  is the modulus of elasticity in feet.       Where, from want of
    homogeneity or shattering, &c., as found in nature, the experimental
    value of   V differs from this, we may express it by the        same form    of

    rocks, taken together, was to the theoretic velocity due to their mate

     so that nearly eight-ninths      of the full velocity of wave-transmission
    due to the solid material is lost by reason of the heterogeneity and
     discontinuity    or shattering of the rocky mass as      it is piled together
    in nature.
        The author then shows that           were the rocks quite solid, the velo
     city of wave-transmission would         be —

    per second.
        Mean of     slate and quartz parallel to lamination    V=7659 feet per
     second.
        This difference is probably reversed in nature by reason of the
     greater discontinuity in the former direction.            The author then
     shows that his results, which appear at first sight to conflict with
     those of an analogous character obtained by Helmholtz and others
     for wood, in the three principal directions of its section, are strictly in
      accordance and analogy with the results of these experimenters.
        The author concludes by deducing             some  conclusions as to the
     bearing power, safe load, and proper direction as to lamination when
     exposed to pressure, of these rocks, of a practical character, and valu
     able to the civil engineer or architect.

        Augustus Waller, M.D.,F.R.S. Received April 12, 1862.
    In  the   *
                Proceedings   of the Royal Society,' No. 46, 1 have given
a brief account of the effects of refrigeration of the ulnar nerve in
man, by the application        of   ice.     After repeated experiments on this
nerve on myself,         I never had occasion to witness any permanent
disturbance      in the nerve from the application of the ice, beyond a
slight hyperesthesia, which may have been partly due to the increased
attention of the mind directed to the part whose functions were under
investigation.
     The like immunity        does    not extend to experiments in which a
much greater degree          of cold is employed,          as  will  be seen from the
 following instance      :—
     September 13,1861. — A freezing mixture, consisting of equal parts
 of pounded ice and common salt, was applied to the elbow of the left
 arm over the ulnar nerve.               The subject of the observation was a
 gentleman in perfectly sound health, aged twenty-seven.
     Before the application of the mixture, the temperature between the
 little and ring fingers and the index and median was the                   same.  Suc
 cessive observations gave the following results             : —

    In   the course of the application            the following    results were ob

    Soon after the application of the freezing mixture, the nerve began
to be painful from the elbow downwards              ;  after twenty-seven minutes'
application      the little finger was already somewhat paralysed and in
sensible.     When the nerve was compressed or vibrated, it               was found
to be very sensitive and tender, and its excitability            much increased*.
    After thirty-two minutes the symptoms                were —
    1st. Paralysis of the movements of the little finger almost com
plete.
    2nd.    A  state  of semi-flexion of all the fingers, diminishing from
the little one outwards, so that they could not be straightened com
pletely by the extensor muscles.
    3rd. Great weakness in all the fingers and thumb, so that great
difficulty    was experienced      in grasping or holding any object.
    4th. Complete loss of the power of abduction and adduction of
the fingers, so that when they were extended as far as possible they

the tips of the fingers so as to render it tense, and then suddenly removing them.
By so doing a sound is generally produced by the nerve, as by a vibrating cord.
This little operation causes a slight degree of pain, sufficient to enable us to judge
of the degree of sensibility of the nerve. It likewise causes slight movements of
the last finger from muscular contraction, sufficient to indicate the degree of ex
citability of the nerve.   For further account see my paper on the subject of irri
tation of the ulnar nerve, &c. in the ' Medical Gazette.'

together.
   After fifty-two minutes the freezing mixture was withdrawn, and
the skin at the elbow, which was completely frozen, was allowed to
thaw.    During this process the arm and hand becamejrapidly very pain
ful upwards and downwards in the course of the nerve, the pain even
extending to the chest, where there was a feeling of great uneasiness
and constriction.      At the same time the heart's action was so much
lowered as to threaten immediate syncope, which was, however, pre
vented by a free administration       of ammonia and spirits.       An hour
after the removal of the freezing mixture        the temperature (Cent.)
was as follows   : —

    September   1 6th. — Over  the skin which had been frozen there was
vesication   and inflammation     of the subcutaneous tissue, which was
swollen around the part blistered to the extent of 2 or 3 inches over
the arm and forearm.        Over the prominent parts of the elbow-joint
the bones were     very tender on pressure.     The ulnar nerve was like
wise exceedingly      painful to the touch up the arm and down the
forearm and the hand.          The brachial plexus was very tender at
some points.       Over the little finger and the inner side of the ring
finger the skin was nearly insensible.         Friction over these parts
caused a sensation of heat, pricking, and discomfort.          The tempera
ture of these parts was not more elevated than other parts of the
hand.     The paralysis of the muscles of the hand was in the same
condition as on the 14th. The two points of compasses, when more
than an inch apart, were felt as one over the palmar surface           of the
little finger.

some stiffness in that finger, and                a     complete inability, when the fin
gers are extended, to bring them into opposition with one another.
  The spot on the upper arm to which cold was applied  now quite                      is

     There    still considerable numbness in the little finger and on
             was
the inner side of the palm of the hand.    The fingers could now be
extended almost as completely as those of the right hand, but they
could not be easily expanded, or brought into opposition                                   with       one
another.      At times the nerve               was very      painful along its whole course,
from the elbow downwards.                       This    is   mostly the case after the arm
has been used        a       little.   Pain    at these times, even         if   not actually pre
sent, was easily induced by placing the arm in                          a   dependent position
so as to cause congestion of its vessels, and                       it   was immediately re
lieved by elevating the limb above the head so as to deplete the ves
sels.     The nerve was very sensitive to pressure all along its course,
from the elbow downwards, although all painfulness arising from the
inflammation         produced in the cutaneous tissue by the cold had dis
appeared for some days.

rienced in the little finger and inner side of the left hand                               ;   and on
withdrawing both hands their temperature                          was —

    The effect of the reduction of temperature on the paralysed hand
was very      distinct; the three inner fingers were more or        less contracted,
the little one being semiflexed, and could not be extended completely,
those of the right hand being easily extensible.
    In half     an hour the temperature of both hands had risen to —

     There is still    a feeling of stiffness in the little finger, accompanied
 with slight inability to move it. There is also considerable sensi
 tiveness along the course of the ulnar nerve in the palm of the hand
 when compressed or percussed.                The fingers can be moved to and
 from     one    another more freely, but the power of so doing is still im
 perfect    ;   and that of grasping, so far as the whole hand is concerned,
 is much weaker than in the other hand.                 Cutaneous       sensibility is
 decidedly inferior over the dorsal and palmar              surface of the inner
 part of the hand and two corresponding fingers when compared with
 the right,       but the sensibility to cold is the reverse         ; whenever the
 left hand becomes cooled by exposure, the little finger is always more
 or less painful.        Vibration of the nerve at the elbow produces the
  same effect on both sides.

  1862.]                               95
     For about two weeks during the cold weather in this month there
 existed over the palmar surface of the left little finger a chilblain, the
 only one to be found on either hand.
     The left hypothenar eminence was likewise then discovered for the
 first time to be less firm and smaller than on the right hand, as if
 atrophied    in consequence of the results of the experiment          ;  and to
 such a degree that the swelling          formed    by this eminence on the
 inner side of the hand, which was considerable           on the right hand,
 was nearly absent on the       left.                       -  -
     To ascertain how far this difference is normal in right-handed
 persons,   I  examined     the hands of several persons accustomed to
 manual labour, where the preponderance of the upper right limb is
 great  ; but  I  found much less than in the present instance.          I must
therefore attribute this atrophy of the left hypothenar eminence partly
to the semi-paralysis of the muscles, and especially to the diminished
nutrition from constriction of the vessels.
                       Compression    of the Ulnar   Nerve.
    I  compress this nerve simply by resting the elbow on some hard
body slightly padded, and holding a heavy book in the hand                     to
increase the weight on the elbow, which would               otherwise be     in
sufficient.
    The symptoms are sensory, motory, and vaso-motory.
    The sensory symptoms are those first perceived, being the well-
known formication over the palmar territory of the nerve, viz. the
little finger, the inner    side  of the annular, and the hypothenar emi
nence.
    The symptoms of      anaesthesia   over the dorsal surface of the hand
and fingers do not appear until a later period, when the anaesthesia
is considerably     advanced in the palmar portion.
    While the    anaesthesia   is gradually progressing, the muscles of the
hand governed by the ulnar nerve become weakened, stiff, and im
perfect in their movements.
    The first muscles which lose their power            are the interosseous,
which govern the adductive and abductive movements of the fingers.
On trying alternately to spread out and to bring the fingers in con
tact, we find them to move imperfectly            and weakly, in a trembling
uncertain way, like the movements          of old  age.   Later still the little

                                         96                                 [May         15,
finger cannot be placed in apposition with the annular, but remains
apart at an angle of 10 or 15 degrees.              At the     same    time paralysis
of the abductor and adductor muscles of the other fingers takes
place.
  The index and thumb alone retain              some   of their powers of adduc
tion and abduction     ;   the former probably from the action of its proper
extensor   ;   the latter from its abduction         not being animated by the
ulnar nerve.
   When paralysis of         these   muscles is complete, the appearance                  of
the hand, when the fingers are in extension, is pathognomic,                      and as
follows   :—
   The little finger in complete adduction at about an angle of 40°
from the annular, which is likewise a little apart from the median.
Both these fingers are slightly flexed and incapable of complete ex
tension.  The flexor muscles are much weakened, as might be anti
cipated from the distribution of the ulnar nerve.                 In    addition,       the
flexion movements of the thumb           and the extensor power of this and
all the fingers    are considerably weakened.
   The tendency of the fingers to semiflexion, and the inability of
the little, the annular, and even to a slight extent the median finger
to accomplish      complete extension is probably referable to the state
of tonicity of the paralysed flexors.            The weakness of the extensor
and flexor powers of the thumb are not, in my opinion, sufficiently
accounted for by the lost power          of its adductor muscle.                Still   less
can we account for the diminished power of extension of the other
fingers by any direct or descending action             of the ulnar nerve.          I   am
led therefore to refer the diminished           power, in this case, of the ex
tensor muscles of the fingers to reflex action of the ulnar nerve.                       In
support of this view,      I may state   that   I   have not unfrequently           expe
rienced, after vibrating the ulnar nerve at the elbow, a great lassitude
of the whole limb, particularly marked over the deltoid muscle, to
so great an extent as to occasion much discomfort for at least an hour
afterwards.
  Vaso-motory symptoms. — Under this head                 I include
                                                      all the per
turbations of temperature of the integuments animated by the ulnar
nerve, which attend its compression.
  Mechanical      irritation of this nerve, such         as   vibrating   it,   will fre

 fingers, while the others remain nearly unaffected.
     It is still more easy to ascertain this influence when the nerve is
 paralysed by pressure.
     Thus, in the following observation, I found —

     In  other experiments      on compression    of the ulnar nerve   I   have
 observed a much greater fall of temperature as the integuments be
came insensible.
     With regard      to the elevation    of temperature, I have never been
 able to obtain it by compression of the ulnar nerve to the extent
 produced by refrigeration.
                    Compression   of the Left Radial Nerve.
     Feb.   10, 1862. — This nerve was compressed at the lower part           of
its course at the arm, where        it winds round the humerus to its        ex
ternal side.      This  was effected   simply by pressing the outer part of
the arm against the padded arm          of a chair.
    In about half     an  hour the skin of the back of the hand had         be
come somewhat insensible,         and the muscles of the forearm so much
weakened       that  the   hand    dropped    by  its  own  weight.    These
symptoms continued          to increase until the extensor muscles of the
forearm were quite paralysed.            Examination    three-quarters  of   an
hour after the commencement of the experiment gave as follows               :—

    The skin over the back of the forearm, that of the carpus, of the
thumb, of the two first phalanges of the index, and over the outer
half of the thenar eminence       was nearly insensible    to the contact      of
external bodies   ;  but when pricked or pinched, pain was produced
of   a hot, burning character, which lasted for about a minute after
the removal of the cause.        Over the back of the other fingers, i. e.
the median, annular and little fingers, and the last phalanx of the
index, no loss   of sensibility could  be detected.
    Flexion of the fingers     was very imperfect   ;  their tips with diffi
culty could   be made to touch       the palm of the hand.          The move
ments    of the last phalanx of the thumb were almost paralysed,
 while those of its second phalanx and metacarpal bone appeared
little affected.
    The apposition of the tips of the thumb and index,               as well   as
 that of the thumb and median, could be made, but not that of the
 thumb and tips     of the two last fingers.  All extension of the carpus
 on the forearm was impossible.        The hand, when left to itself, fell
 into a state of semiflexion of the carpus on the forearm, with semi
 flexion of the fingers   ; while the thumb placed itself on the palm          of
 the hand by the flexion of its metacarpal bone and first phalanx,
 the second phalanx remaining unbent.
     The movements of supination of the forearm and abduction                  of
 the carpus were almost entirely paralysed.

     One minute after removal of the pressure the thumb                could be
  flexed at both phalanges into the palm of the hand            ;  apposition   of
  the thumb and annular finger was possible.          The skin over the part
  supplied by the nerve was rather less numb.
     Two minutes later the carpus could be placed in a straight line
  with the forearm, but could not be retained in that position.

   Thirteen minutes later the hand        was in the  same condition.           All
delicate movements, such as buttoning and unbuttoning the dress,
were impossible, although the sensibility at the tips of the index

 back of a chair so as to compress the median nerve and brachial

vessels about 2 inches above the bend      of the arm.      In  the course of
about half an hour the nerve became          paralysed, and the following
symptoms were observed.
   Motory Symptoms. — The thumb          was incapable     of flexion  at the
last joint, but could be flexed on the metacarpal bone,           so as to be
brought in contact with the tips of the three first fingers, but not
with that of the little finger.       There was considerable stiffness of
the thenar muscles, particularly of the abductors.           The index      and
median fingers remained slightly flexed, but by an effort of the will
they could be straightened     and could perform all movements         of    ad
duction and abduction.       The index could only      be made to flex very
slightly, but the median could be completely flexed. The annular
and little fingers retained all their movements, but felt weak.
Flexion of the entire hand on the forearm was imperfect, and the
muscles of the external part of the forearm felt very stiff.
    Sensory Symptoms.     — The    thumb   and two first fingers felt cold
and numb, and nearly       insensible, but when pressed, a sensation          of
heat was experienced.       The insensibility   at the tips    of the thumb
 and two first fingers was nearly complete when objects were brought
 in contact with them.      Numbness     of the skin existed at the ante
rior part of the forearm.

II. " On           the Rigidity of the Earth."               By Professor           William
            Thomson, F.R.S.              Received April 14, 1862.
                                          (Abstract.)
     The author proves that unless the solid substance of the earth                          be
 on the whole of extremely rigid material, more rigid for instance
 than steel, it must yield under the tide-generating influence                          of sun
and moon to such an extent as to very sensibly diminish                             the actual
 phenomena of the tides, and of precession and nutation.                            Results of
a mathematical theory of the deformation                     of elastic spheroids, to        be
 communicated            Royal Society on an early occasion, are used
                        to the
to illustrate this subject.  For instance, it is shown that a homoge
neous incompressible elastic spheroid of the same mass and volume
as     the earth, would,         if of   the same rigidity      as glass,       yield about $,
or     if   of the  rigidity as steel, about $ of the extent that
                      same
a perfectly fluid globe of the same density would yield to the
lunar and solar tide- generating influence.  The actual phenomena
of tides (that        is,   the relative motions of     a   comparatively light liquid
flowing over the outer surface of the solid substance of the earth),
and the amounts of precession and nutation, would in the one case be
only   \,       and in the other    $*   of the amounts which              a   perfectly rigid
spheroid of the        same dimensions, the same figure, the same homoge
neous density, would exhibit in the same circumstances.                             The close
agreement with the results of observation presented by the theory of
precession and nutation, always hitherto worked out on the suppo-

 sition that the solid parts       of the earth     are perfectly   rigid, renders it
 scarcely possible to admit that there can be any such discrepance
 between them as 3 to 5, and therefore almost necessary to conclude
 that the earth is on the whole much more rigid than steel.                       But  to
 make an accurate comparison between theory and observation, as to
 precession,    it is   necessary      to   know   the absolute     amount        of the
 moment of inertia about some diameter                ; and from this we are pre
 vented by the ignorance in which we must always be as to the actual
 law of density in the interior.           Hence the author anticipates that the
 actual deformation of the solid earth by the lunar and solar influence
 may be more decisively tested by observing the lunar fortnightly and
 the solar half-yearly tides*.            These tides, it may be supposed, will
 follow very closely the        "                          " of   Daniel Bernouilli
                                   equilibrium     theory
 for all oceanic stations, and the author suggests              Iceland     and Tene-
 riffe as two stations well adapted for the differential observations that
 would be required.
     The earth's upper crust        is possibly on the whole as        rigid    as glass,
 more probably       less  than more.          But  even  the imperfect        data for
judging referred      to above, render       it certain that the earth as        a whole
must    be far more    rigid than glass, and probably        even more rigid than
steel.     Hence the interior must be on the whole more rigid, probably
many times more rigid, than the upper crust.                  This   is  just what,     if
the whole interior of the earth is solid, might be expected,                 when the
enormous pressure in the interior               is considered  ;  but it is utterly
inconsistent with the hypothesis held by so many geologists that the
earth is a mass       of melted matter enclosed in           a solid shell      of only
from    30 to     100   miles thickness.          Hence   the investigations        now
brought forward confirm the conclusions arrived at by                  Mr. Hopkins,
that the solid crust of the earth cannot be less than 800 miles thick.
The author indeed         believes    it  to be extremely improbable           that any
crust thinner than 2000 or 2500 miles could maintain its figure with
sufficient rigidity against the tide-generating            forces of the sun and
moon, to allow the phenomena of the ocean tides and of precession
and nutation to be as they are.
   * High tide,  as far as the influence of either body is concerned,    is produced   at
the poles, and low (average)    water at the equator, when its declination, whether
north or south, is greatest, and low water at the poles and high water at the
equator, when the disturbing body crosses the plane of the equator.

III. " On      the Difference       in the Properties of Hot-Rolled and
        Cold-Rolled Malleable Iron, as regards the power of re
        ceiving and retaining Induced             Magnetism    of Subperma-
        nent Character."      By George Biddell Airy, Esq., F.R.S.,
        Astronomer Royal.           Received   April 22, 1862.
                                     (Abstract.)
    The author    states that he had been desirous       of examining whether
differences in the degree of change of subpermanent magnetism, such
as are exhibited     by different iron ships, might        not depend on the
temperature at which        the iron is rolled      in the last process of its
manufacture.        By the good offices of Mr. Fairbairn he had received
gratuitously from Richard Smith, Esq., Superintendent of Lord
Dudley's Iron Works at the Round Oak Works near Dudley, twenty-
four plates of iron, each      16   inches long, 4 inches broad, and     i inch
thick    ; twelve of which,      after having been manufactured       with the
others in the usual way, had been passed through rollers when quite
cold.      Each  set of twelve    was divided into two parcels     of six each,
one parcel     being cut with the length         of the bars in the length of
extension of the fibres of the iron, the other being cut with the
length of the bars transverse to the length of extension.
    For experimenting on these, a large wooden frame was prepared,
capable of receiving the 24 bars at once, either on a plane transverse
to the direction      of dip  at   Greenwich,    or on a plane including the
direction    of dip.    In  some      experiments, these planes were covered
 with flag-stones, and the bars were laid upon the flag-stones ; in
others, the bars were laid immediately upon the wood.              While there
lying, they were struck with iron or wooden hammers of different
 sizes.    The bars of the different classes were systematically inter
 mingled, in such a way that no tendency of the arm to give blows of
 a different force or kind in special parts of the series could produce
 a class-error in the result.        For examination of the amount of polar
 magnetism in each bar, it was placed at a definite distance (5 inches)
 below a prismatic compass, which was used to observe the apparent
 azimuth of a fixed mark        ;  the bar was then reversed in length, and
 the observation was repeated in that state.
    The number of experiments           was 2 1.   They  were varied by differ-

         ence in the succession       of positions of the bars, difference of time
         allowed for rest, difference in the violence of the blows, &c.
            The principal results appear to be the following        : —
             1 . The greatest amount        of magnetism which     a bar   can receive,
         appears to be such as will produce (on the average            of bars)   a com
         pass-deviation of about      1 1 °, the bar being 5 inches below the com
         pass.    It was indifferent     whether     the bars rested on stone or on
         wood, or whether they were struck with iron or with wood, the bars
         lying   on the  dip plane while struck.
            2.   When the bars, thus charged, lay on the plane transverse to
         the dip, they lost about one-fifth of their magnetism in one or two
         days, and lost very little afterwards.
            3. When the charge of magnetism is smaller than the maximum,
         the diminution    in a day or two is nearly in the same proportion            as
         for the maximum.
            4. The effect of violence on the bars, when lying on the plane
         transverse to the dip, is not in all cases to destroy the magnetism
         completely, sometimes it increases the magnetism.
             5. The Cold- Rolled Iron receives (under similar violence) or parts
         with (under similar violence) a greater amount of magnetism than
         the Hot- Rolled Iron, in the proportion of 6 to 5.
             C. There is some reason to        think that the Hot-Rolled Iron has       a
         greater tendency to retain its primitive magnetism than the Cold-
         Rolled Iron has.
             7. There is some      reason to think that, when lying tranquil, the
         Hot-Rolled Iron      loses a larger      portion of its magnetism than the
         Cold-Rolled Iron      loses in the    same time.

     appear to have been obtained.                                  All    these questions depend on the
     decomposition             of       a decomposable ternary quadric,                                         which decompo
     sition itself depends on that for the simplest case, when the quadric
     is a perfect           square.             Or      we may            say     that              in     the first instance
     they      depend on the transformation                                of         a    given              quadric        function

    Dear General Sabine, — I             have ventured to think that a word
 of my proceedings may         be acceptable to you, though          I have been
much more tardy in getting into observing order than             I had   expected.
It  is indeed only now that       I am able     to make observations without
finding some one part or other        of my apparatus capable of improve
ment.     At length, however,       I  find my hopes exceeded         in the per
fection, precision, and facility      with which my colossal equatorial is
directed and carried on      : the driving motion is indeed as perfect and
uniform,     I   believe, as that of any telescope         with which       I  am
acquainted.      For the luxury of observing two assistants        are necessary,

1862.]                                     109
when the observer has really nothing              to do but keep his eye at the
telescope.
    We have      passed   through what         was  called, for this climate, an
unusually cloudy winter, and it is only now that the weather is                      be
coming settled for the summer, and only now that                 I  may be said to be
entering upon regular work.             I  have indeed carefully observed some
of Lord Rosse's      nebulae,    and in at least two or three instances can
fully confirm the spiral character attributed to them by his Lordship,
— not, I think, when the objects are well seen, to be overlooked, even
when the mind is not previously possessed                   with the idea.        I  am
making     careful drawings of these           nebulae   as  I   see   them, some of
which closely resemble Lord Rosse's, while others are so different
as to suggest      (with the fact of the lost nebula in our remembrance)
the idea of a    real change of form.          With new objects, however, of so
much delicacy it is necessary to survey them again and again, under
different circumstances, in order to arrive at a trustworthy conclusion.
    One object, on which        I  scarcely intended to bestow any attention,
has fascinated me greatly          —I     allude to the moon, in which            I   see
 minute details with a hardness and sharpness and reality                       I   have
 never seen before.      My opportunities of scrutiny have, however,                been
 fewer than might have been supposed, from my having frequently been
 engaged    in showing this very popular object to many visitors.                   Yet,
 notwithstanding      that    I  have   thus been able to         see   more into the
 moon than ever      before— so     much so that      I believe,   if a carpet the size
 of Lincoln's Inn Fields        were laid down upon its surface,           I should be
 able to tell whether    it  was round or      square,
                                                       — I see    nothing more than
 a repetition     of the    same    volcanic    texture — the     same    cold, crude,
 silent and desolate character which smaller telescopes usually exhibit.
     Saturn   is just now an object of much less physical beauty than
 when    I was here in 1852.        I observed, however,       on the 15th    of April,
 the passage    of Titan on to the disk of the planet, near the northern
 limb, a   phenomenon which of course can only be observed in or near
 the present position of the ring, and therefore interesting                  from its
 rarity.
    With respect to the climate, I have not yet used this telescope in
its most favourable season.            In 1852 I may be said to have gauged
 the purity of the sky during the Indian summer with an aperture of
 two feet   ; now  I have    been gauging      it during   a less favourable season

                                       110                              [May 22,
 with   a four-foot   aperture ; and therefore     it is no wonder       if I find
 nights    of the requisite  degree   of tranquillity somewhat more rare.
Yet   I  find my own physical strength insufficient        to allow me to use
up half the quantity of available sky, and my next want will probably
be some efficient and energetic assistance       in the duty of observing.

II. " On      the Theory of the     Motion of Glaciers."          By William
        Hopkins, Esq., F.R.S.          Received April 14, 1862.
                                   (Abstract.)
    Almost all the numerous discussions which have taken place during
the last twenty years respecting our theories of glacial motion have
had for their object the assertion of some            particular view, rather
than the establishment of a complete and sufficient theory founded
on    well-defined    hypotheses    and unequivocal      definitions,    together
with   a careful comparison     of the results of accurate theoretical in
vestigation with those of direct        observation.     Each of     these views
has been regarded, improperly, in the author's opinion, as a Theory             of
 Glacial Motion.      The Expansion Theory ignored the Sliding Theory,
though they were capable of being combined ; the latter theory was
equally ignored by the Viscous Theory, in which, moreover, instead
of the definitions of terms being clear and determinate, no definition
of viscosity was ever given, though that term designated the funda
mental property       on  which the views advocated by this theory de
pended.       Again, the Regelation Theory is not properly a theory of
the motion of glaciers, but a beautiful demonstration of a property
of  ice, entirely new to us, on which certain peculiarities         of the mo
tions of glaciers depend.
    When     we shall have obtained a Theory      of the Motion of Glaciers
which shall command the general assent of philosophers,              no qualify
ing epithet will    be required for the word theory      ; it would indeed     be
inappropriate,     as seeming to indicate     the continued      recognition    of
some rival theory.       If, for instance, it should   be hereafter    admitted
that the sliding      of a glacier over its bed and the property         of rege
lation in ice are equally necessary, and, when combined,                perfectly

1862.]                                              Ill
sufficient       to account         for the       phenomena of glacial           motion,    there
would be a manifest impropriety, not to say injustice,                               in selecting
either of the terms sliding or regelation by which to designate this
combined         theory.        The author           makes these       remarks       because   he
believes that the preservation of the partial epithets above mentioned
has a tendency to prevent our regarding                        the whole subject in that
more general and collective aspect under which                         it is   one   of the prin
cipal objects of this paper to present it.
     This object must necessarily give to the present paper something
of the character of a           resume          of what has hitherto    been done, whether
it   be our purpose to adopt or reject the conclusions                         of others. There
are periods        in the history of almost every                 science      when its sound
and healthy progress may almost as much demand the refutation of
that which is erroneous as the establishment of that which is true.
It   is not intended,           however, to enter into any review of the past
labours of glacialists with respect to exploded theories, but only to
notice those more recent researches and speculations which appear
either to demand refutation as erroneous, or to be admitted into any
well-founded         theory     as    correct.
     With       a view, in the first place, to remove the ambiguities which
have beset         this subject from the want of explicit definitions, the
author enters into the following                    discussion and explanation of terms
employed to express properties of ice on which our theories of glacial
motion must essentially depend.
     1.   The external forms of all bodies in nature may                        be changed in a
greater or less degree, and without                       producing    discontinuity     in their
mass or destruction             of their internal structure, by the action of any
external forces, the original                    or undisturbed       form     from which      the
change of form is to be estimated being that which the body would
assume      if   acted on by no external               forces whatever. This change of
form necessarily implies                  a     change in the relative positions of the
component          particles of the mass,                 or a certain greater or smaller
amount of molecular mobility, or power in the particles of moving
inter      We may speak either of the general change of the form
          se.
of the whole body, or of that which takes place in each of its small
elementary portions             ;    it   is,   in fact, in this latter sense that we are
obliged to regard          it   in any accurate investigations, because the change
of form for different elements will usually                      be different.         Change of

                                         112                             [May    22,
  form in an element may or may not be accompanied by a change of
 its volume.      In   the first case it leads   to cubical extension or com
 pression   ; in the latter, merely to extension or compression of the
 surface and not the volume of the element.            It may be called super
ficial extension or compression.          These changes of volume and form
 in any element must         be produced by the forces acting on       it.    Thus
 we may conceive      linear extension alone produced at any interior point
 of the    mass by two equal and opposite         tensions acting on two ele
 mentary component particles there in the direction of the line joining
 their centres of gravity, while compression alone would result            if those
 tensions were changed into pressures.            In such    cases   extension or
 compression would be the result of forces which may be called direct
 or normal forces.        In the  case above mentioned,   in which the volume
 and density of every element of the mass remain unaltered, there
 can be no such direct normal action as that        just mentioned.        It must
 be perpendicular      to the normal action, and therefore a transversal or
  tangential   action.      There would be no tendency to make the con
 tiguous particles approach to or recede from each other, but to cause
 the one to slide tangentially past the other.
     If the body have a structure         like that of any hard, vitreous or
  crystalline mass, pressure at any point will tend to break or crush
  the body, and thus to destroy the continuity of its structure.               This
  tendency will be opposed by the resisting power of the substance.
  The tendency of the direct or normal tension is          to separate    the con
 tiguous particles, and thus produce a finite fissure, or a discontinuity
 in the    mass.    It  is resisted by the normal cohesive power; and in
 like manner the transverse or tangential action             is resisted   by the
  tangential   cohesion,    or that which prevents the component particles
 from sliding past each other.         Again, when the component particles
 at any point of a body are relatively displaced, they have always a
certain tendency to regain their originally         undisturbed position, and
 the force thus excited, considered with           reference to the force of
 displacement at that point, affords a measure of what is called the
 elasticity of the body.        Since the force of restitution may vary from
zero to the corresponding force of displacement, the elasticity, when
measured by their ratio, may vary from zero to unity.
    2. We may now define such terms as solid, plastic, viscous, and
the like, with all the accuracy which their definitions admit of.               We

   1862.]                                  113
   may call a body emphatically          a   solid body when it        possesses   the
                           :—
  following properties          (I) small extensibility and compressibility,
  (2) great power of resistance and great cohesive power, both normal
  and tangential, and (3) great elasticity.          It will thus require a com
  paratively great force to produce any sensible relative displacement
  among the constituent         molecules of the body       ; if   we conceive the
  force required to become infinitely great, we arrive at absolute rigidity
  as  the limit of solidity.         Again,    we   shall  best,   perhaps,    define
 plasticity or viscosity,    if we  suppose the forces of displacement to be
  such as to produce only       a small transverse or tangential displacement
  of the constituent particles, i.    e. a  superficial, not a cubical, extension
 or compression.        Then   if the force of restitution bear only an inap
  preciable ratio to the corresponding force of displacement, i.            e. if the
  tangential    elasticity be not   of sensible magnitude, the mass may be
  emphatically     said to be  plastic. This is the essential condition of
 what may with strict propriety be termed plasticity                ; it might also
 be added that, as bodies are constituted in nature, the force required
 to produce      the original displacement in plastic bodies will be small
 as compared      with that required in solid bodies. Viscosity and semi-
 fluidity  are  terms which only express similar properties of bodies, but
 usually indicating that still smaller forces only are required to produce
 a given displacement      in such bodies than in plastic ones. The limit
ing   case is  that of perfect fluidity, in which both the forces of original
 displacement and those of restitution are indefinitely small.             In  these
latter cases the tangential cohesion is necessarily small, and such also
 (as bodies are usually constituted)        will be the normal cohesion.          At
the same time the power of resisting compression of volume may be
very great, as in fact it is in nearly all masses not technically desig
nated as elastic masses.         In other words, the normal elasticity, with
reference to pressure, may be of any magnitude, while the tangential
elasticity equals zero.
    It will be observed that a body is here spoken          of  as  held in a state
of constraint by internal forces, but without any kind of dislocation
which should destroy its continuity or injure its structure.               If, how
ever, the external forces should be sufficiently increased, the structure
of  a vitreous or crystalline mass, or that       of any  mass possessing hard
ness and brittleness,     will  be destroyed by a pressure greater than its
power of resistance can withstand         ;  or the continuity of its mass will

be destroyed by any normal tension greater than the normal cohesion ;
or, again, by any tangential tension greater than the tangential cohe
sion.     The normal tension would thus produce           an open fissure   ; and
the tangential tension would cause one particle of the mass to slide
past another, but without producing any open discontinuity.                On the
contrary, in a properly plastic or viscous mass            there is no definite
structure for excessive pressure to destroy         ;  there is no question as
to the formation of open fissures       ;  and the characteristic absence       of
 tangential elasticity allows of any amount of change in the relative
 positions of the constituent particles of the mass without breach of
 its continuity.
     It would of course be impossible to draw an exact and determinate
 line of demarcation between solidity and plasticity, but it is not there
 fore the less certain that there are bodies which do unequivocally
 possess the property     of solidity, and others which do as unequivocally
 possess the property of plasticity, according to the definitions here
  given of these terms.      Solidity and plasticity with respect to nume
  rous cases in nature thus become           determinate properties       of those
  aggregates    of material particles which we call bodies. Ice, a vitreous
  or crystalline and brittle mass, which will neither bear any but the
  smallest extension without breaking, nor more than the smallest com
  pression without being crushed, must be solid, and cannot be plastic,
  if  we are to use those terms as significant        of determinate properties
  of bodies.
      3. The advocates    of the viscous theory would not probably admit
   the necessity of the above rigorous definition of the term viscous in
  its application to glacier ice. But the defect of that theory has
   always been in the entire want of any accurate definition of that term.
   When such definition     was demanded,      it was said that glacier ice must
   be viscous, because   a glacier adapted     itself to the inequalities of its
   valley as a viscous mass would do.           This was equivalent to saying
   that the mass was viscous because        it moved in a particular manner,
   instead of asserting that the mass moved in that particular manner
   because   it was viscous.     Now this kind of inversion of the direct
   enunciation    of the proposition    is only admissible when there is no
   other physical   cause than the one assigned, to which        it  is conceivable
   that the observed phenomena should             be ascribed.      Thus   we may
   assert  with perfect conviction, that gravity exists        as a property     of

 1862.]                                   11&
matter and acts according to a certain law, because the bodies of the
solar system move as         if such were the case     ;  but the conclusiveness
of this inductive proof of the proposition — that          " gravity   is a property
of matter
             " — rests
                       entirely on our conviction that matter has            no other
property by which       we    could equally account for the phenomena of
the celestial motions.        And so with regard to glaciers.           If viscosity
were the only conceivable property of ice by which we could possibly
account for the observed motion of glaciers, then would the observed
phenomena of that motion perfectly convince us of the existence                      of
the property      in question.      But here the two        cases entirely      differ,
inasmuch as there was no general conviction, nor even a decided pro*
liability at the time    I allude   to, that no physical property of ice could
exist besides viscosity which might           account for the observed pheno
mena of a glacier's motion        ; and at the present time it is proved that
there is another property of ice by which those phenomena are per
fectly accounted for, and the inductive              proof   becomes       altogether
valueless.     Moreover, in the case of universal gravitation,            the induc
tive proof is the only possible one, whereas in glacier motion we are
 concerned with a property which, in whatever sense the definition                   of
 it may be regarded, must be as capable of being rendered patent by
experiment in ice,     if it  exist, as in any other substance.
    The answer, then, that was given to the question — what is visco
 sity ? — comprised no definition at all of that term.                 The viscous
 theory ignored the possibility       of the molecular mobility of a glacial
mass    united with the preservation of its continuity, being attributable
to any other property than that which was designated as viscosity,
but without giving any exact definition of the term.              If it   was meant
 to define by   it the property which       is here defined by the same terms,
the theory had a legitimate claim to be considered a physical theory,
because    it assigned  a determinate      physical   property as the cause of
certain    observed phenomena.           In this   sense,  however, the author
conceives that it would now be admitted to be entirely disproved                    by
Professor Tyndall's experiments, in which the ice exhibits so clearly
the property of solidity, and the absence of all indication of plasticity.
It   may be presumed that the hypothesis               of viscosity could only
have been adopted in the first instance from the apparent absence of
any other property of ice which might account equally well for the
molecular mobility of the glacial mass.
                                                                     i   2

    4. But    if the determinate property of viscosity, as here defined, be
not recognized in ice, what, it will be asked, is really the idea which
has been attached to the term plastic or viscous                ?    The question, as
already observed, is difficult to answer.           Perhaps the best way of doing
                                                                           '
so is to refer to the     Prefatory Note       to  Principal Forbes's        Occasional
Papers
          '
            (p. xvi).     He there intimates that the expressions            " bruising
and re-attachment,"         and  " incipient     fissures re-united       by time and
cohesion,"     used by him in 1846, are to be regarded as having the
same meaning as the expression
                                          "  fracture    and regelation,"        first in
troduced into the subject in 1857.             Now there      is no ambiguity what
ever  in this latter expression.        " Fracture     "  means the breaking and
splitting of the ice regarded         as a    brittle and crystalline        solid,   and
could never be intended to have the slightest               reference to viscosity.
In fact the expression is altogether inapplicable            to any body     which     can
be called viscous without a violation of scientific language.               Still this, it
may be said, may be only a want of strict accuracy of expression, rather
than of accuracy of conception.         But    if a notion of cracking       and break
ing, so foreign to any idea of plasticity, should be admitted, it could not
be said that a glacier moved as         it  is observed to move, because it was
plastic,    but merely that it moved as            if it were     plastic.      The true
inference from the motion would have been that glacier ice possessed
not necessarily real plasticity,        a definite property          of bodies, but       a
quasi-plasticity, which expresses no determinate property at all, but
may consist with many different properties.                 It merely expresses, in
fact, the power of the component elements of the mass of changing to
a certain extent      their relative positions.       But this is not the peculiar
 property of ice ; it is common, indeed, to all bodies exposed to dis
 ruptive forces which, as in the case of ice, the cohesive power is un
able to withstand.         The  mass   of any other substance,          as well as that
 of  a glacier,   will then  be broken into fragments            sufficiently small to
 allow  it to follow the impulses of the external forces acting on it. To
say, therefore, that a glacier moves as            if it  were    plastic is not to as
 sign to ice any property peculiar to itself, and therefore does not pro
perly constitute      a physical theory of glacier motion at all.
    5. But if we       pass over the difference between true plasticity                and
 that which,     as we have pointed         out, is merely apparent,          there still
remained the great difficulty, which was only removed by the experi
ments of     Mr. Faraday and Dr. Tyndall. Every                 one who believed ice

   1862.]                                   117
  to be a solid body, believed as a matter of necessity that a glacier
  must, on account of the external conditions to which it is subjected,
 be excessively broken and dislocated in the course            of its motion. The
 author was himself        one  of those who fell into the error of attributing
 too much influence to        the larger and more visible disruptions of the
 mass   ;  but the great difficulty was in the perfect subsequent reunion
 of portions which had thus            been   separated, whether      by larger or
 smaller dislocations.       And    here  it will necessarily  be asked whether,
 in the expressions      above quoted,
                                           " re-attachment

                                     separated portions when again brought
 into contact, really mean the same thing as reg elation 1 This question
 the author thinks can be answered only by saying that, whatever
 might    be the intended      meaning of those expressions, they failed to
 convey to the minds of others the most remote idea of regelation, as
 a property     of  ice at a particular   temperature.      No better proof can
 be given    of this than the general conviction which appeared to flash
across the mind of every glacialist when he first heard of Professor
 Tyndall's experiment, that the recognition of the property of instan
taneous regelation was a well-marked and important discovery, which
had at once        completely removed a great stumbling-block            in glacial
theory.      In  fact, the viscous      theory assigns no physical        cause for
the reunion in question.          All  we could do, before the publication       of
those experiments, was to infer from the observed               facts that ice did
possess    some property     which facilitated the reunion of      separate  pieces
in contact    ;  but this was like the attempt to define viscosity by an
appeal to the phenomena which that property was intended to ex
plain.    Regelation has, in fact, no connexion with viscosity, but stands
in direct antagonism to it.
    An imperfect plasticity in ice has sometimes           been spoken of.     The
fact is, all solid bodies may be said to have an imperfect plasticity,            if
we chose to admit this vagueness           in scientific language, since all are
capable of greater or less extension or compression.           As to the apparent
plasticity inferred from the motion of glacial masses, and arising from
the crevicing of the ice as already explained, it has no relation what
ever to real plasticity.        Such crevices are the necessary consequences
of the external forces acting on the glacier, and are as essential to the
theory of regelation as they are unconnected with any property of
plasticity.

                                        1 18                            [May 22,
     The author then briefly describes the experiment, by which it is
shown that ice will slide down an inclined            plane at an inclination to
the horizon less than that of any known glacier, provided its lower
surface be in that state of disintegration          in which it will necessarily
be when its temperature        = zero (C).         The motion  is then slow and
uniform.       That glaciers do slide over their      beds, has been established
as clearly as     it can  be by the comparatively few observations which
have been made on the subject              ;  and every existing glacial valley,
 and every valley which          is believed to have been       such at former
 geological      periods,  testify to the truth of that conclusion.             The
 author also explains that both theory and observation agree in the
 result that the temperature of the lower surface of a glacier of any
considerable      depth in the latitude        of the Alps must necessarily        be
 =zero      (C).     He regards this sliding motion as far too important a
 part of the whole motion of a glacier to be neglected in any com
 plete theory of that motion.
      The author then proceeds        to investigate certain properties      of the
 internal tensions and pressures at any point            (P) in the interior of      a
  mass    held in a state of constraint         by external forces.      He shows
 that    at  every point    (P) there     are three determinate      directions, at
  right angles to each other, in which the direct tension is such that
  in one of them it is a maximum, in another a minimum, and in the
  third neither     a complete maximum           nor a complete minimum       ;  it is
  convenient to call this the mean axis.            The tensions or pressures in
  these directions are called      principal tensions or pressures      ; there are
  also two other directions through           P characterized by a peculiar pro
   perty.     If  we take two adjoining particles, P and P', in the line of
   maximum tension, that tension will exert a greater effort than there
   will  be in any other direction      to separate    those particles  ; or  if   the
   internal force be the maximum pressure, those points will be more
   compressed together than in any other direction.             In  the two direc
   tions (now to be defined) the forces on P and P', acting perpendicu
   larly to the line joining those particles, will exert a greater tendency
   than is exerted in any other direction, to separate           them by making
    one slide   tangentially past the other, and then to twist and contort
   any internal elementary portion           of the mass.    These two directions
   are perpendicular      to each other, and bisect the angles between the
    directions of maximum tension and maximum pressure.              This problem

  1862.]                               119
 is treated entirely mathematically      ; it is the typical problem of this
 part of the subject.     The results   are applied to a real glacier by the
 analogy which it bears to the typical one.
    For the application of      these  analytical    results, the author then
 considers the nature of the forces called into action by the two pri
 mary characteristics of the motion of a glacier — that its central move
faster than its marginal portions, and the portions near the upper
 faster than those near the lower surface of the mass.           He also takes
 account of the modifications to which these forces may be subjected
 by changes of form and inclination           in the containing valley.       He
 likewise  explains   the different    modes in which        the mass    may be
 fractured when the forces become such as to overpower its powers of
 cohesion or resistance.      If  the cohesion give way to the maximum
 tension, an open fissure must be formed              in  a direction    perpen
 dicular to that tension.    If the resisting    power of the ice give way to
 the maximum pressure at any point, the mass will be crushed at that
  point, but its continuity will be immediately restored by regelation,
the internal constraint will      be momentarily       removed, and the mass
 will move on.     By  a repetition   of this process the glacier is enabled
 to move   forward, preserving at once the continuity of its motion, of
 its mass,  and of its structure.
    The veined structure of glacial    ice is then examined, and     it is shown
 that, so far as Professor Tyndall's pressure theory of that structure
 involves the condition of the structural       surfaces being perpendicular
 at each point to the maximum pressure there, it is perfectly accordant
 with the theoretical results of this paper.        Whether the structure     be
 marginal, longitudinal    and central, or transversal, this is equally true,
assuming always that the structure in each locality is the direct and
 immediate consequence      of the forces acting there and tending to pro
duce it.     Probably, however, the veined structure in one locality
may have originated in another from which it has been transmitted
by the motion of the glacier.        Supposing this to be so entirely, the
author examines how this motion of transmission would modify the
forms    of the transmitted      structure.     Practically, and within the
limits to which observation has yet extended,              these modifications
would    produce   forms sensibly coincident        with   those which would
result, as in the previous case considered, from the immediate action
 of the forces, independently of transmission.           The respective effec

                                                 120                                     [May 22,
tiveness    of these two              causes,     therefore,     in producing          the veined
structure in any particular locality is not at present determined.                                      Its
determination would require more accurate and detailed observations
than have yet been made on this subject.
      The differential theory of the veined structure is then considered                                     ;
but here the author               dissents entirely         from        all Professor Forbes's
mechanical        reasoning,          by which he professes to                     determine            the
positions    of the surfaces of maximum                     differential        motion,     which,
according to this theory,               are coincident         with the structural              veins.
Mr. Hopkins contends that the actual differential motion of two con
tiguous particles must necessarily take place in the common direction
of their motions.             He cannot understand the                   effectiveness     of such
motion in any other sense, in producing the phenomena in question.
He has investigated for this                    case the forms         of the veined surfaces,
but finds them altogether different from the observed forms                                     ;   and
with respect to Prof. Forbes's investigation                     he cannot possibly admit
it,as he at present understands it.
   The author then examines the intensity of the dislocating forces
acting on the glacier. He demonstrates Prof. Forbes's error in
supposing       that    it   is   much augmented by an enormous hydrostatic
pressure within the mass, tending to push                          onward in the direction
in which                                                    It is it   proved that, under the
            it    may be most free to move.
existing conditions          of   a   glacier, the hydrostatic             pressure from the
water contained in the pores of the mass can but little exceed the
atmospheric pressure on its surface.                      But Mr. H. shows that there
must in many localities be               a   very large increase in the intensity of
the    internal       tensions and pressures arising                   from the free sliding
motion of the whole glacier.                 Where the motion of               a   particular       part
of the   mass    is   retarded by local circumstances, there will probably be
an enormous pressure upon                  it   a   tergo, from the mass behind                     ;   or
there may, in other cases, be              a    great additional tension, arising from
the freer motion of the mass in front.                     Hence the dislocating forces
must often be greatly increased, the dislocation                          is   ensured, and the
operation of regelation brought into action                 ;    and the continued motion
of the glaciers       is   preserved when         it   might otherwise be arrested.

III.   "Experiments on Food; its Destination and Uses."   By
       William S. Savory, Esq., F.R.S. Received May 1, 1 862.
                                            (Abstract.)
   The experiments which are related in this paper refer to the                                 des
tination of food and its uses.
    Abundant,        nay, superfluous evidence has been furnished to prove
that no      one principle      of food will alone suffice for nutrition                ;   but clear
and unequivocal evidence is still wanting to show how far each prin
ciple of food       is essential to life and health, provided all else save that
one be sufficiently supplied.                  This is     a very different question.
    Again,      ever since     Liebig's famous classification of food into plastic
or nutritive       and respiratory           or calorifacient,        some     most important
questions in connexion with it have engaged                         the attention of physio
logists.       Amongst them are these                 :—
    Is any food destined            to the production          of heat without being con
                               of the   tissues — that               any portion of the food
                                                              is,
cerned in the repair                                          is
directly burnt in the blood             ?
    Is any portion of albuminous food directly calorifacient, that                                 is,
burnt in the blood without forming tissue                      ?
  This last question has more recently assumed another form, viz.
what   the source of urea
       is                    Is  derived wholly from the metamor
                                       ?         it
phosis of tissues, or directly to some extent from the blood                          ?     In other

grade metamorphosis into urea, carbonic acid, and water                             ?
    The experiments were performed upon rats* and                              a    hawk.       The
animals were fed upon different                  diets, and the experiments may be
divided into three classes accordingly.                      In    one class   the diet was        a
non-nitrogenous one, consisting of equal parts                       by   weight of arrowroot,
sago, tapioca, lard, and suet           ;   for this mixture was found upon analysis
to yield only *22 per cent, of nitrogen.                      In another     class the diet was
a   nitrogenous one.           It   consisted of lean veal from which every visible
particle of fat had been carefully removed.                         This yielded upon ana
lysis only 1*55 per cent. of fat.                     In   the third class the diet was            a
mixed one.         It   consisted     of   a   combination of the two former diets.
    * Rats   were chosen as subjects        for these experiments because they are omnivo
rous and     will readily   feed on almost any kind of diet.      Moreover from their size
they are very convenient to manage.

                                                                               I

   The weight, temperature, and general condition of the animals
were especially noticed, and in some cases the urine was collected and
the amount of nitrogen       it contained determined.
   From     these experiments the following     conclusions are drawn   : —
   Nitrogenous     materials are not only calorifacient, but, at least under
some    circumstances,    sufficiently  so to maintain   alone the requisite
temperature.
    It is in the highest degree       probable that, under certain circum
stances, nitrogenous materials may prove directly calorifacient without
forming tissue.
    Non-nitrogenous     substances are, at least under some circumstances,
directly calorifacient without entering into the composition of tissue
of any kind.
    While non-nitrogenous       food only is taken, all the nitrogen which
is excreted in the urine, and more, may be accounted for by the dis
integration of the original tissues, without assuming that any fraction
is assimilated from any other source.
    While life cannot     be maintained     without  nitrogenous   food, even
 though every other kind be abundantly         supplied, death in this case
 being due to loss of tissue, life and even health and the normal tem
 perature can be maintained, at least for a long period, upon a diet
 almost exclusively     nitrogenous, with proper inorganic substances in
 which there exists only      a small fraction   of non-nitrogenous matter.
 Such a minute proportion of fat must be         but a poor representative of
 non-uitrogenous    food.
    Moreover in these experiments some of the rats sustained a loss
 of weight considerably above 50 per cent.
    The difference in this respect between former experiments and
 mine may be, perhaps, in some measure accounted for by considering
 the immediate cause of death in the former ones.            Chossat satisfac
 torily showed that the subjects of his experiments died from cold.
 In  my experiments, the animals being freely supplied with calorifa
 cient food, this cause of death was for a while averted, so that time
 was allowed for a    further disintegration of tissue.
    When their temperature is maintained from external sources, or
 when they are freely supplied with calorifacient food, warm-blooded
 animals may die rather from waste           than loss of temperature,      as
 perhaps is the case with cold-blooded       animals when they are starved.

  Lastly, in        these experiments the significant fact appeared, that while
the weight, strength, and general condition of the animals varied very
widely under the different diets to which they were subjected, no con
siderable fluctuation was observed in their temperature.                        Even the
slight variation from time to time recorded seemed rather to result
from other causes than to depend directly on the food.
IV. " On a New Series of Compounds containing Boron." By
    Dr. Edward Frankland, F.R.S. Received May 15, 1862.
                                         (Abstract.)
  This paper contains the full details of the author's researches on
boric ethide — a body partially described by Mr. B. F. Duppa and
                            '
the author in the               Proceedings of the Royal Society,' vol. x. p. 568,
and also their extension to the homologous                        compound     containing
methyl.
  Boric ethide combines with ammonia with great energy ; if a few
drops of boric ethide be passed up into a dry eudiometer filled with
mercury,         and dry ammoniacal          gas be then admitted into the same
tube, each bubble of gas collapses with a shock like that produced
by     a bubble     of   steam projected into cold water.             The analysis of the
body thus formed leads to the formula
                                      NH, + B(C1H,),.
     Ammonia boric ethide is a somewhat oily liquid possessing an aro
matic odour and an alkaline reaction.                     It   cannot be distilled, except
in     vacuo,    without decomposition.   Carbonic acid has no action upon
 it,   even     in the presence of water, but other acids decompose     in            it
 stantly and liberate boric ethide.                  Exposed to atmospheric air, am
monia boric ethide scarcely absorbs                  a   perceptible amount of oxygen,
 even after the lapse            of several hours.
       The author considers boric ethide              to be formed from boracic ether
 and zincethyl           by the substitution         of the ethyl in zincethyl for the
 oxygen in boracic acid,

                                less probable, view
 in the supposition that the three atoms of ethyl in boric ethide were
 already present in the boracic ether, the action of the zincethyl being
simply to remove the whole of the oxygen from the boracic ether.
 Kekule    has,   in fact, unreservedly adopted this latter view of the re
action.
   So long as the organic radical of the zinc compound and that                                        of
the boracic ether are identical, it is impossible to prove whether the
three individual atoms of ethyl in boric ethide were originally present
in the boracic ether, or have been derived from the zincethyl.                                       In
dicating       by an asterisk the atoms of ethyl which                              finally become
part of the boric ethide, it is impossible to prove conclusively whether
the reaction takes place according to the first or second of the fol

   Although       we     cannot thus label, as it were,                       the atoms taking
part in the reaction, we can unerringly                      trace the movements of the
alcohol radicals,       if   we secure         their identification           by varying        their
composition in the two compounds used in the reaction.                                   The study
of the action of zincmethyl upon boracic ether would obviously thus
decide between          these     views.       If   boric ethide were produced from
these materials, Kekule"s            hypothesis          would           be established    ;   but   if,
on the other hand, boric methide were                            the result of the reaction,
then the correctness of the view originally taken by                              Mr. Duppa and
the author would             be proved         to be correct.             The following results

         Boracic ether.      Zincmethyl.     Boric methide.    Ethylate of zinc.
     The formation of boric methide under           these circumstances proves
 conclusively that the corresponding          ethyl compound is formed, not
 by the removal of the whole of the oxygen from boracic ether, but
 by the actual substitution of the three atoms of oxygen in boracic
 acid by three atoms of ethyl      ; whilst boric methide is in like manner
 produced by the similar substitution of methyl for oxygen, which is
 quite in harmony with the mode of formation of very numerous com
pounds in the organo-metallic        family.
    Boric methide exists at ordinary temperatures             as a colourless and
transparent gas possessing a peculiar and intolerably pungent odour,
irritating the mucous membrane and provoking a copious flow of
 tears.    Its specific gravity is 1-93137.         It retains its gaseous con
dition when exposed to a cold of —16° Cent.             ;  but at 10° Cent., and
under a pressure of three atmospheres, it condenses                to a colourless,
transparent,     and very mobile liquid.        It is very sparingly soluble in
water, but very soluble in alcohol           and in ether.        In contact with
atmospheric      air, it takes fire spontaneously, burning          with      a  bright
green flame,    which is very fuliginous    if the volume of the       flame be con
 siderable.    If the gas issue into the air through      a tube -j^th    of an inch
 in diameter, the amount of smoke is surprisingly great              ;  2 or 3 cubic
 inches of gas, when consumed in this way, filling the atmosphere of a
 large room    with large comet-like flocks of carbonaceous matter. This
 curious phenomenon is probably due, in part at least, to the forma

                                                 126                                       [May       22,
tion of a superficial coating of boracic acid, which envelopes the par
ticles of carbon and prevents their combustion.                              Suddenly            mixed
with atmospheric air or oxygen, boric methide explodes with great
violence. In contact with atmospheric air, both boric methide and
the vapour of boric ethide exhibit two distinct kinds                           of spontaneous
combustion.         Thus when         these bodies issue very slowly from a glass
tube into the air, they burn with a lambent                            blue flame invisible in
daylight, and the temperature of which                          is so low that a finger may
be held in       it for    some   time without             much inconvenience.                   Under
these circumstances partial             oxidation           only takes place, and               it is to
the products thus formed that the peculiar pungent odour of boric
ethide and boric methide is due.                   When, on the other hand,                       these
bodies issue into the air more rapidly, the lambent blue and nearly
cold flame changes to the green and hot flame above mentioned.                                             I
have not examined the spectra of the two differently-coloured                                   flames
from the same compound            ;   but they doubtless present a widely different
appearance, thus affording another instance of the dependence of the
spectra of bodies upon temperature,                   —a        phenomenon to which               I   re
cently called attention in the case of                 lithium*.
   Boric methide           is not acted      upon by binoxide of nitrogen                        or by
iodine.        Solution of bichromate of potash scarcely affects                          it,   but the
addition of concentrated sulphuric acid at once determines the re
duction of the chromic acid.   When boric methide      allowed to                is
bubble through          water into chlorine, each bubble burns explosively
with   bright flash of light and the separation of carbon
       a                                                     has no                   :   it
tendency to unite with acids.    Concentrated sulphuric acid has no
action upon       it;     when mixed with hydriodic acid gas,                     it      suffers no
change     ;   but, on the other hand,           it   is   freely absorbed by solutions of
the fixed alkalies and by ammonia.                         If   a   very rapid current of the
gas    mixed with half its volume of marsh-gas be passed                                  through      a
stratum of strong solution of ammonia only half an inch deep, not                                      a
trace of boric methide escapes absorption.

crystalline compound.       The latter is   also formed when boric methide
is passed into solution      of ammonia.       The colourless liquid stratum
which     forms upon the surface soon solidifies when it is placed over
sulphuric acid in vacuo.        A  quantity of the compound obtained by
this latter process was purified       by solution in ether and subsequent
recrystallization    : on being submitted to analysis, it yielded numbers
corresponding to the formula
                               NH3 + B(C2H3)3.
    Ammonia boric methide is deposited from its ethereal solution in
 magnificent arborescent crystals, which rapidly volatilize without re
 sidue when exposed to the air.          They possess a caustic and bitter
 taste and a   very peculiar odour, in which both the smell of ammonia
 and that of boric methide can be recognized.             Ammonia boric me
 thide fuses at 56° Cent., and boils at about        1 10° Cent.    In a current
 of air, or better of carbonic acid, it sublimes at         a very gentle heat
 and condenses in arborescent crystals.            Several determinations      of
 the specific gravity of the vapour of ammonia boric methide gave
 the   mean     number    l-253, which       indicates   that   the vapour     of
 ammonia boric methide consists of equal volumes of boric methide
 and ammonia united without condensation.                Thus the formula of
 ammonia boric methide is a four-volume formula*             —a    state of con
 densation which is usually        considered to be abnormal,        and which,
 where     it occurs, is generally explained by the assumption of           a de
 composition      of the body   at the moment      of conversion into vapour.
 The proof of the disunion or integrity of the vaporous molecule of
  ammonia boric methide would be interesting in connexion with these
  so-called anomalous vapour-densities,        but the author regrets his in
 ability   to offer any sufficiently  decisive solution of this problem     ; for
 although fused chloride of copper absorbs ammonia from the vapour,
 yet it does so under circumstances which            admit of the assumption
  that  the vapour of ammonia boric methide is decomposed                 by the
  chloride of copper.
     Ammonia boric methide scarcely absorbs           a perceptible   amount of
  oxygen at ordinary temperatures, even after several days' exposure to
  the gas; but it takes fire below 100° Cent. when heated in contact
  with the air.     Its vapour   is also very inflammable     ;  thus when am
  monia boric methide is placed under the receiver of an air-pump, and

the air is being withdrawn,         the explosion of the mixture of air and
vapour in the cylinders of the pump is frequently determined by the
rise  of temperature consequent upon the depression of the pistons
when the rarefaction has become considerable.
    Boric methide       is also   absorbed    by aniline    with great avidity.
Acids expel the gas from this compound unchanged.
    Terhydride of phosphorus has no action upon boric methide.                 A
mixture of equal volumes of the two gases is spontaneously inflam
mable, burning     with     a yellowish-white    flame, in which the charac
teristic green tinge attending the combustion of boric methide is no
longer perceptible.
    Compounds    of Boric Methide with Potash, Soda, Lime, and Baryta.
— Solution of    caustic potash absorbs boric methide with great energy.
The saturated solution, exposed over sulphuric acid in vacuo, dries
down to a gummy mass, which scarcely exhibits signs of crystalliza
tion.    The   same body may be more conveniently             formed by decom
posing ammonia         boric   methide with alcoholic       solution  of potash,
taking care to employ an excess of the former.              On evaporation over
sulphuric acid in vacuo, the excess of the ammonia compound vola
tilizes and is decomposed by the sulphuric acid, with the elimination
of boric methide    ;    thus the solution of the potash compound evapo
rates in an atmosphere        of boric methide.     Nevertheless, even by this
method     the potash compound could not be obtained in a state of
perfect purity, the numbers obtained on analysis indicating only re
motely the formula
                                 KO+B(CaH3)3.
    Boric methide     is also readily absorbed by solution        of neutral car
bonate of potash, bicarbonate of potash and potash boric methide
being apparently formed.           Although boric methide and potash unite
with remarkable energy, they are separated by acids with the greatest
readiness   ; even carbonic acid in the presence of water can expel boric
 methide from its potash compound            ; thus  if an aqueous solution of
potash boric methide be passed into carbonic acid standing over mer
 cury, the acid gas soon becomes         replaced by pure boric methide.
     Soda boric methide, baryta boric methide, and lime boric methide
 are similar bodies produced by the absorption             of boric methide   gas
 by caustic solutions of soda, baryta, and lime          ;  they are all readily
 soluble in water and react alkaline.

    Boric methide in combination with the alkalies and alkaline earths
has almost entirely lost its powerful affinity for oxygen; nevertheless,
when these bodies are placed in contact with a known quantity of
oxygen over mercury       for several days, the volume of the gas per
ceptibly diminishes.
   The great difficulty, not to say danger, attending the gradual oxi
dation of considerable quantities of a gaseous and spontaneously in
flammable body like boric methide         has prevented the author from
following this compound into its products of oxidation, as was done
in the   case  of boric ethide.    With     a graduated   supply of oxygen,
however, boric methide appears to comport itself like boric ethide,
and the compounds formed are probably homologous with diethylate
and dihydrate of boric dioxyethide.
    In conclusion, it can scarcely    be doubted     that the action upon
boracic ether of the zinc compounds of the remaining alcohol radicals
would produce the homologues of the bodies described in the fore
going pages.      It may also be remarked that the existence of bodies
like boric dioxyethide, in which one-third of the oxygen in boracic
anhydride    is replaced by ethyl,   altogether    abolishes any supposed
analogy    between carbonic    and boracic acids, whilst     it proves that
the composition of the latter acid is expressed by the formula B03,
or  some  multiple of that formula.

    Professor Forchhammer     was present at the Meeting, and, by request
of the President,    gave a statement   of the principal results of his re
searches.      He first, however, took occasion to express his great
satisfaction in being allowed the opportunity of personally and grate
fully acknowledging the liberality with which men of         science in this
country had entered into his views and supplied him with specimens
requisite for carrying on his inquiries   ;  and he particularly mentioned
the name of a late distinguished       Fellow of this Society, Sir James
Clark Ross, who had kindly furnished various samples of sea-water
procured in his Antarctic voyage.

    The number of elements hitherto found in sea-water the author
stated to be thirty-one, viz. Oxygen, Hydrogen, Azote in ammonia,
 Carbon in carbonic acid, Chlorine,         Bromine, Iodine in fuci, Fluorine
in combination with calcium, Sulphur            as sulphuric   acid, Phosphorus
as phosphoric      acid, Silicium as silica, Boron as boracic acid, discovered
by the author both in sea-water and in sea- weeds,             Silver in the Po-
eillopora alcicornis, Copper very frequent both in animals and plants
of the   sea, Lead very frequent in marine organisms, Zinc principally
in sea-plants, Cobalt and Nickel in sea-plants, Iron, Manganese, Alu
minium, Magnesium,         Calcium, Strontium and Barium, the latter two
as sulphates      in fucoid plants, Sodium, Potassium.            These twenty-
seven    elements the author himself had ascertained to occur in sea-
water;    the presence of the next four elements, viz. Lithium, Ctesium,
Rubidium, and Arsenic, has           been shown by other chemists.
    Of  these elements only a few occur in such quantity that their
determination has any notable influence on the quantitative analysis
of sea-water, viz. Chlorine, Sulphuric acid, Magnesia, Lime, Potash,
and Soda.      The others,     as far as  their existence has   been determined
in the sea-water itself,     are found    in the residue which remains after
evaporation to dryness and redissolution of the salts in water.
    The author next stated that in the water of the           ocean far from the
shores the principal ingredients always occur very nearly in the same
proportions.        If we assume     chlorine=100, the      mean    proportion  of
 the other leading constituents is as follows         : —
                           Mean proportion.       Maximum.          Minimum.
       Sulphuric acid       ..     11-89             1209              11-65
       Lime                         2-96               3-16             2-87
       Magnesia                    11-07             11-28             1095
       All  salts                181-1             181-4             180-6
    These proportions       apply only to specimens obtained at a long di
 stance   from shores, or in the open ocean.              In the interior of the
 Baltic, for instance, the proportion of chlorine to sulphuric acid is as
 100 to 14-97 — to lime as 100 to 7 -4 8 ; and the proportion of chlo
 rine to all salts as 100 to 223-0.          This constant proportion       of the
 different constituents      in the    ocean  depends evidently not upon any
 chemical combination         and affinity between the different substances,
 but upon the enormous quantity of salts in the whole ocean, which

 1862.]                               131
renders imperceptible      any difference that might otherwise arise from
the different proportion      in which salts   are carried    into the     sea by
rivers.    It depends, besides, on the uniform action of the numberless
organic beings inhabiting      the ocean which abstract sulphuric acid,
lime, potash, and magnesia from the water, and render them inso
luble.
    The mean quantity of solid matter in the water of the          ocean gene
rally, the author found to      be 34-304 per 1000.       To determine this
mean quantity he has divided the ocean into regions, viz.           : —
    1st Region.    Atlantic, from the Equator to 30° N. lat.            ;   mean
36-169.
    2nd Region.     Atlantic, from 30° N. lat. to    a line from      the north
of Scotland to the north of Newfoundland         ; mean 35*976.
    3rd Region.    From the northern boundary of region          2 to the south
coast of Greenland    ;   mean 35-556.
    4th Region.    Davis's Strait and Baffin's     Bay;   mean 33-167.
    5th Region.    Atlantic, between      0 and 30° S. lat. ;    mean 36-472.
    6th Region.     Atlantic, between 30° S. lat. and       a line from       the
 southernmost point of Africa to the southernmost point of America               ;
 mean 35-038.
    7th Region.     Between Africa and the East Indian Islands           ;  mean
33868.
    8th Region.     Between the East Indian and the Aleutic Islands              ;
 mean 33-506.
    9th Region.     Between the Aleutic and the Society Islands          ;  mean
 35-219.
     1 0th Region. The Patagonian stream of cold water         ; mean 33-966.
    11th. The Antarctic region ; mean 28-563.
    Besides these regions of the great ocean, the author enumerates
 some    other regions, which are under the decided influence of the
 surrounding land.        Such are the North Sea, with a mean quantity
 of solid matter of 32-806 per 1000; the Kattegat and Sound, with
 a mean of 15-126; the Baltic, mean 4 807; the Mediterranean,
 mean about 37-5    ;   the Black Sea, mean 15-894.        Of the proportion
 in the large bays of America the author had only            one observation,
 viz. in water from the Caribbean Sea, in which the quantity of saline
 matter was found to be 36-104 per 1000.
    The author then showed that the equatorial regions contain the
                                                                  k2

                                     132                            [May 22,
  greatest percentage of saline matter, and that this peculiarity            is
  owing to the evaporation under and in the neighbourhood          of the line
  being greater than the quantity of water supplied by the rain falling on
  the sea and by the rivers flowing from the land    ;  that the equilibrium
 is maintained    by polar currents, which bring water with less saline
 matter to the equatorial    regions.    The   mean    quantity of saline in
 gredients in the equatorial regions of the ocean         is about 36- 2 per
  1000, while in the polar regions it is about 33-5.
      The North Atlantic Ocean contains much more salt than the South
 Atlantic, which the author explains by the prevailing influence of the
 Gulf- stream ; and from his analyses of many samples of water taken
 in the current which flows from N.E. to S.W., between Iceland and
 the east coast of Greenland,     he thinks it highly probable that this
 East Greenland current is in reality not a polar current, but a return
 ing branch of the Gulf-stream, its mean quantity of salt being nearly
 the same as in the northern part of the Atlantic Ocean, viz. 35-5
 per 1000.
     The author then compared the Mediterranean with the Baltic, and
 stated that there is a double current at the entrance of the Baltic as
 well as in the Straits of Gibraltar  ; but with this difference, that the
under-current     of the Mediterranean    runs out of, and the surface-
current generally runs into, that sea     ;  whereas the under-current      of
the Baltic is an entering one, and the surface-current of the Sound
generally runs out into the Kattegat        and North Sea.      He showed,
moreover, that the deep water in both seas is richer in salt than that
from the surface, and consequently has a greater specific gravity.
     In the Atlantic   he found  the reverse, viz. that the quantity       of
saline ingredients in the water decrease* with the depth,        if the sam
ples are taken at some distance from the shore      ;   and as his analyses
are sufficiently  numerous, and include specimens from great depths
(12,000 feet), he considers this unexpected result to be tolerably well
established.     He thinks that this fact would prove the existence of
a polar current in the depths of the Atlantic, as well as in some parts
of its surface.
    In  the sea to the east of Africa he found the quantity of saline
matter slightly increasing with the depth.

I.  "Dissections     of the Ganglia and Nerves of the (Esophagus,
       Stomach, and Lungs."         By Robert Lee, M.D., F.R.S.
      Received    May 13, 1862.
   On the   1 "th of  July 1861I  resolved to dissect the nerves of the
human stomach immersed in alcohol,          as  I  had done those of the
uterus and heart, with magnifying powers of six and twelve diameters.
Having procured from Dr. William Dickinson at St. George's Hospital
a healthy stomach with three inches of the oesophagus, and having
thoroughly washed away the contents, and the blood from the vessels,
it was placed in a shallow vessel and covered with rectified spirit.
With the help of my dissecting lens,     a pair  of small straight forceps,
a pair of small curved forceps, and curved needle,       I  proceeded cau
tiously  to remove all the white      condensed cellular     membrane in
which the trunks and branches of the par vagum on the oesophagus
were imbedded, and the sheath of slender fibres of cellular mem
brane closely investing all the nerves.    Two glands situated near the
termination of the oesophagus in the stomach were likewise removed.
   The trunks and branches of the par vagum having thus                been
completely laid bare, the whole oesophagus         appeared covered    with
ganglionic    plexuses of nerves, and distinct    ganglia formed on the
nerves were clearly seen.     Some of these ganglia had the usual ap
pearance of ganglia of the great sympathetic, with nerves entering
and nerves passing out from them, and these branches passing into
other ganglia.     Some of the ganglia formed on the trunks          of the
par vagum were       long and thin, presenting      the appearance which
Mr. Joseph Swan has called gangliform membranes. Near the cardia,
both trunks of the par vagum terminated            abruptly   in long solid
ganglia of a reddish colour and firm texture ; and from these numerous
small branches of nerves with ganglia were sent to the whole cardiac
extremity of the stomach without being accompanied with arteries; and
others were sent to the coronary artery, and accompanied this artery
with all its ramifications to the lining membrane of the stomach.
   On examining minutely the ganglia and        nerves  of the  oesophagus,
numerous branches were seen passing down between the strong lon
gitudinal muscular fibres of the oesophagus      to the circular   muscular
fibres of the middle coat,   upon which plexuses of nerves with small

 1862.]                                135
ganglia were formed.       Some branches of nerves were seen passing
from the middle coat of the oesophagus        into the lining membrane.
   After having completed the dissection of the oesophageal ganglia
and nerves, the nerves continuous with them were then carefully
traced throughout      the walls of the stomach from        the cardia to the
pylorus.     The peritoneal coat having       been  removed, a thin strong
tendinous expansion was seen underneath, covering the whole convex
border of the stomach and a great part of both the anterior and
posterior   surfaces ;  the removal of this fascia was necessary        before
the nerves could be traced.
   If  the preparation be now examined, numerous            small nerves will
be seen proceeding from the abrupt termination          of the par vagum at
the cardia, and distributed extensively over the cardiac extremity of
the stomach, to the muscular       coat.    Numerous branches of nerves
can be seen passing down between the muscular fibres of the outer
to the subjacent muscular        coat,   and largely   distributed    over the
fibres of this coat.
   The two trunks of the par vagum, divided into numerous branches,
 can be seen passing forward to the coronary artery, which has been
cut  across, with all the nerves proceeding from the semilunar ganglion
which united at the cardiac extremity of the stomach with                 these
nerves continued from the par vagum.
   The trunk and all the branches of the coronary artery           are accom
panied with nerves from the par vagum and semilunar ganglion, and
in this dissection the nerves with the arteries have          been traced ex
tensively to the lining membrane of the stomach.             The branches of
the coronary artery are seen passing down through the muscular coats
generally, about midway between the smaller and larger curvatures,
accompanied     with nerves upon        which ganglia      are   formed; and
numerous branches of nerves are seen passing to the muscular coats
from the nerves which accompany the arteries.
   I will not attempt further on this occasion to describe the ganglia
and nerves of the oesophagus and stomach displayed in this dissection,
from which it is obvious that there are two sets of nerves distributed
throughout the walls of the stomach,        one to the muscular coats, the
other destined to supply the lining membrane.
   I  have made elaborate dissections of the ganglia and nerves of the
whole oesophagus,    stomach, alimentary canal, and lungs       ; but of these

   to demand.

         M.B., F.R.S., Professor of Physiology and of General and
        Morbid Anatomy in King's College, London ; Physician to
         King's College Hospital.          Received June 19, 1862.
                                    (Abstract.)
     After referring to the views entertained on the mode of termina
  tion of the nerves in the tissues generally, the author proceeds to
  consider the arrangement of the nerves           in muscle.        The old view
  was that nerves terminate in loops         or networks which are external
  to the sarcolemma.       More recent researches had proved that these
 loops and networks are composed of coarse dark-bordered fibres,
 and from them finer fibres had been followed to the surface of the
 elementary fibres, and it was concluded that these               terminate upon
  the sarcolemma      mfree   ends.    In the Philosophical Transactions for
  1860, a paper by the author was published, in which it was shown that
 the distribution    of nerve-fibres to the muscles of the      mouse was much
 more extensive than was generally             supposed,     and    that    to each
 muscular     fibre,   pale   nerve-fibres    with    nuclei     are    distributed
 throughout      its  entire  length  ;  that    numerous     fibres     cross   the
 elementary fibres at various angles, and thus the appearance of a
network     of nerve-fibres is produced.         This network       is   upon    the
 same plane as the capillaries, and can be stripped           off the surface of
 the sarcolemma with these vessels.           Last year Kuhne published            a
memoir      on the termination       of the   nerves   upon     the    elementary
muscular fibres of the frog,        and supported      his view expressed in
previous     papers,   that the   nerves penetrate      the    sarcolemma       and
terminate in close relation to the contractile           tissue*.      Kiihue   en
deavoured to show that the white substance of the nerve ceases at
the sarcolemma, and that a pale nucleated fibre, the continuation                 of

  the axis-cylinder      of the nerve, perforates the sarcolemma and termi
  nates in free extremities beneath. In connexion with these pale fibres
  he described special organs of an oval form and containing a nucleus.
  In the   Croonian Lecture for the present year, Professor Kolliker stated
  that he had failed to demonstrate the peculiar organs described by
  Kiihne, that Kiihne's pale fibres are outside the sarcolemma, and that
  the nerves terminate in free ends, the sheath of the nerve being con
  tinued for some distance over the pale fibre*.            He also described     some
  nerve-fibres, which for the most part ramify over the surface of the
  muscle.       These    he regarded      as  sensitive    fibres.    Kolliker and
  Kuhne     agree that the muscle receives but a small supply of nerves,
 that their supply is limited to one part of the muscle, and that a
 comparatively very small portion of each elementary fibre is brought
 into relation with the nerves         at all.     The author's conclusions         are
 quite at variance with these views.            Although in many       cases the fine
 pale nerve-fibres could not be followed for any great distance from their
 origin, in some instances this had been done.               The pale fibres consist
 of   a bundle     of very fine fibres, which divides and subdivides into
  smaller bundles, and these,        after being followed to the edge of the
 muscular fibres, can often be traced a long way amongst the fibres
 of connective tissue, and        can    sometimes even be followed to other
 trunks.      The author had      seen many fibres less than the         str.Wijth   0I>
 an inch in diameter, which had been proved to consist of at least two
 fibres.     Many of the so-called connective tissue corpuscles, close to
 the sarcolemma, are really the nuclei of very fine pale nerve-fibres,
 which form,      as in the mouse, networks on the surface          of the muscular
 fibre  ; but the meshes are larger and the fibres much finer in the frog
 than in the mammal or bird.
     The author showed that the distribution                of the dark-bordered
 fibres to many muscles of the frog is by no means                    so limited     as
is    generally     supposed.     The     elementary      fibres   of the     inferior
muscle of the eye of the frog are              crossed by dark-bordered         fibres
at intervals of the       ^th of    an  inch.    The author showed that what
appears to be the outline of a dark-bordered             fibre near its peripheral
distribution, really consists of        a finer nerve-fibre     in many instances.

Fine nerve-fibres run in the         same     sheath with the      dark-bordered
fibres.     Some of these fibres are the direct continuation             of dark-
bordered fibres.      There are often also fine fibres to be demonstrated
external to what appears to be the sheath of the fibre.                    Nuclei
are connected     with the dark-bordered         fibre, with the fine fibres in,
and with those external to the sheath.              The pale fibres of Kiihne
and    Kolliker are always compound, and consist of —
    1 . A very fine fibre prolonged from the dark-bordered fibre.
    2. Very fine fibres continuous with those in the sheath of the
 nerves,   or external to it.
    The author concludes, from           numerous       observations    upon  the
 distribution   of  nerves   in many different tissues, that the general
 disposition of the finest fibres is the same as that of the coarser
 trunks and fibres.      In passing from the trunks towards the ultimate
 distribution   of the nerves, it might       be said we   meet  with finer and
 still finer networks and plexuses        ;  the finest fibres visible with the
 highest    powers (1700 diameters) being composed of more than a
 single fibre.    It is therefore probable that in all cases complete cir
 cuits exist.    The author maintains that the really important part of
 the peripheral     nerve-fibres only commences at the point where the
 dark-bordered nerve-fibre seems to cease.              Beyond   this there is a
 most elaborate network, the fibres of which are compound and com
 posed of very fine fibres.      The meshes of this network and the fibres
 differ much in size in different tissues.          The active elements of the
 tissues lie in or upon the meshes of this network.
     The author then     discusses   the relation of the terminal branches of
 the nerve-fibres to connective tissue.          His views  are briefly expressed
 in the conclusions      given below.       In   order to  see  the appearances
 described by the author, the tissue must be mounted in some fluid
 which reflects highly, like syrup or glycerine.             The fine fibres he
 has seen cannot be demonstrated              in specimens mounted in fluids
 composed mainly of water.
     The paper is accompanied with upwards of forty figures copied
 from specimens magnified by a twelfth or by a twenty-sixth of an
 inch object-glass made by Messrs. Powell              and Lealand, and magni
 fying respectively 700 and       1 700 diameters linear.

                                  Conclusions.
    1.  In certain muscles of the frog the distribution of dark-bordered
nerve-fibres is pretty uniform in every part.        Although in the       case  of
the pectoral     a greater number      of nerve-fibres is distributed       to the
central part of the muscle, fibres may be traced from the large bundle
almost to the extremities        of  some   of the muscular fibres.         Many
branches which easily escape observation pass between the muscular
fibres, and their      subdivisions    supply   neighbouring       fibres, or are
gradually lost in the connective tissue.
    2. Fine nerve-fibres are most easily demonstrated on the external
surface of the sarcolemma near the nerve-trunks         ;  but reasons have been
advanced in favour of the conclusion that every elementary muscular
fibre is more or less freely supplied with nerve-fibres throughout              its
entire length.      Many of the fine nerve-fibres on the surface of the
muscular fibres become gradually very faint, until from their extreme
tenuity we are no longer able to follow them.
    3. Fine nerve-fibres in direct continuation       with the dark-bordered
fibres, and less than the jTiToToth of an inch in diameter, have been seen
to divide into finer branches which have nuclei in connexion with them.
    4. The pale fibres delineated by Kuhne and Kolliker, and by them
 considered terminal, consist of —
           a. Fibres about the 3T*Vootn of an 'ncu m diameter, or less,
        resulting from the subdivision of the dark-bordered fibre.
           b.  Fibres resulting from the subdivision of fine nerve-fibres
        ramifying in the sheath of the dark -bordered fibre, or situated
        external to it.
    5. Nuclei are found in connexion with —
           a.  The dark-bordered      fibre itself, near its terminal       ramifi
        cations.
           b.  The fine fibres which     are the direct     continuation    of the
        dark-bordered    fibres.
           c.  The fine fibres in the sheath, or external to it.
    6. The nuclei and delicate fibres above referred to are arranged so
 as to form networks, the meshes         of which vary much in size, situated
 with the capillaries on the external surface of the sarcolemma. The
 fibres  of this network    are compound, and consist       of finer fibres which
 are   distinct from, and do not    anastomose    with,   each other.     The fine
 fibres continued     from some of the dark-bordered            fibres, as well as

                                            140                           [June     19,
    those ramifying      in the sheath of the nerves,          may sometimes be
    followed over six or more elementary muscular fibres, and form, with
   other fine branches, networks, many of the meshes being as wide as
   a muscular fibre.
       7.   Fine nerve-fibres with nuclei connected with them exist (not
   unfrequently to the number of four or five) in the sheath of the
   dark-bordered nerve-fibres near their distribution          ;  and some are also
   found external      to what     appears to be the outline of the sheath.
   Some of these result from the subdivision of a dark-bordered              fibre.
      These fine fibres and their nuclei           have been hitherto      included
   under the head of ' connective tissue.'
      8. The connective tissue around the elementary muscular fibres,
  and in connexion with the nerve- fibres, is composed of —
             a. Nuclei which might         have taken part in the formation of
          the nerve-fibres, but which have degenerated, and a low form
          of fibrous tissue has alone    been produced.
             b.  Fibres and nuclei which were once active, and formed an
          integral part of the nervous system, but which have grown old,
          and have been replaced by new nuclei and fibres.
             e.  The remains of altered and wasted       vessels and nerve-fibres
          distributed to them, and wasted muscular fibres themselves.
      9. The nerves distributed to the voluntary muscles of the frog do
  not terminate in free ends, but there is reason for believing that
  complete nervous        circuits  exist.    In all  cases  the fibres resulting
 from the division of the ordinary nerve-fibres are so fine that many
  cannot be seen with a power magnifying less than 1000 diameters, and
 there is evidence of the existence of fibres which could only be demon
 strated by employing         a much     higher   magnifying      power.   It  is by
 these very fine fibres alone,        and their    nuclei, that the tissues      are
 influenced.       The ordinary      nerve-fibres   are  only    the cords which
 connect this extensive peripheral           system, which    has   been traced in
different tissues      far beyond the point to which the dark-bordered
nerve-fibres can be followed, with the central organs of the nervous
system.
     10.   The facts and conclusions        above  stated, with reference    to the
distribution of nerve-fibres to the voluntary muscles of the frog, are
in accordance with the arrangement of the finest nerve-fibres demon
strated in many other tissues of the same               animal, and agree with

    many appearances observed by the author in connexion with the peri
    pheral distribution of the nerves, not only in certain tissues of man
    and the higher mammalia, but also in invertebrate animals.
        1 1.  The distribution   of the finest branches of the nerve-fibres        can
    only be demonstrated in tissues which have             been immersed in fluids
    which refract highly, as syrup or glycerine.

           Man, Mammalia,           and     Birds."       By Jacob Lockhart
           Clarke,      Esq., F.R.S.       Received    May 20, 1862.
                                        (Abstract.)
       In   the first stage of development the spinal cord consists simply
   of  a canal surrounded by a single layer         of small cells or nuclei, which
   are not distinguishable from each other in regard to size or structure,
   and are so closely aggregated as to appear in actual contact.                After
   a time this homogeneous layer, while           it increases  in depth,  separates
   irregularly into two strata, the inner stratum forming the epithelium,
  and the outer the grey substance.             This differentiation of structure
  proceeds gradually,        and is not at first marked by any definite line of
  separation,      nor by any apparent difference in the structure            of the
  component         cells.    At the    same   time there is gradually       formed
 around       the walls of the nuclei a granular          substance, which unites
  into processes or fibres, and constitutes a continuous network, by
  which all the nuclei or cells of both layers are uninterruptedly con
 nected.        In the grey layer there is at first no apparent difference
 between the nuclei or cells of the anterior               and posterior   portion,
 although in each portion           dark or more closely aggregated groups
 may be observed in connexion              with roots of the nerves.      As   deve
 lopment       advances,    however, while the nuclei of the posterior grey
 substance remain for a long time but little altered, those of the an
terior substance increase in         size, become more granular,      and are con
nected by thicker fibres united in a coarser network.                At the    same
time, in the separate groups of the anterior                  grey substance, the
granular       network     around the nuclei assumes        a coarser and sponge
like structure, until it constitutes        a number     of large roundish or irre
gular and adjacent cells with thickening and nucleated walls. While
these are in course of development, the contained nuclei are forming

                                          142                              [June 19,
within them and around themselves               a gradually    increasing layer     of
finely-granular      substance.     The thick cell-walls         have all the ap
pearance commonly assumed by connective tissue, and are continuous
with that tissue in the grey substance of the cord.
    In  the intervertebral    ganglia there is some difference in the man
ner in which the nerve-cells make their appearance.                The small cells
or nuclei gradually enlarge, assuming a variety of shapes                ;   and it is
not till they have      increased to a considerable         size that nuclei     and
granular contents are observable within them. These cells, like those
of the cord,    are connected, not only       with  each other, but    with fibrous
prolongations     from the sheath of the ganglion,          with the intervening
connective tissue,     and with the sheaths of blood-vessels, in one un
interrupted     network.    The fibres of the posterior roots of the nerves,
as they    pass   through the       ganglion,    split up and subdivide into
fibrillae, which become successively continuous with processes of
series of the nerve-cells, which for the most part are cup-shaped or
pyriform.
    The processes of the epithelium           around the canal of the cord are
directly continuous with the connective tissue and with the sheaths
 of blood-vessels and pia mater at the surface.
     In the early stages of development, then, it appears that there are
 two kinds of nuclei in the grey substance of the cord : that one kind
 developes the general network of tissue which pervades the entire sub
 stance,  but proceeds no further       ;  that each of the other kind, while it
 is connected with this network,          as well as with the true nerve-fibres,
 developes around itself a nucleated wall, which is still connected, and
 ultimately   blended with      the surrounding        reticular   structure,    but,
 proceeding further, it again forms around itself and within the cell-
 wall   an  increasing    layer of granules.         The granular      contents of
 the cells are connected with their walls, which they form                    around
 themselves   ;  the walls of the cells are continuous with the connective
 tissue, and this again is continuous with the sheaths of the blood
vessels and pia mater       of the surface,     as well as  with the   processes    of
 the epithelium     : so that    the connective tissue of the cord would
 appear to be intermediate        in its nature    between   the nerve-tissue and
the pia mater on the surface        ;  but there is no reason to believe that
the connective tissue could ever be developed into nerve-tissue.

IV.    "Observations      made    on    the   Movements of the Larynx
        when viewed     by means of the Laryngoscope."              By John
        Bishop, Esq., F.R.S.        Received     June 5, 1862.
    I had not   contemplated any further investigation on the physiology
of intonation by the human organs of voice, had not my attention
been aroused by the facility afforded by the apparatus of Professor
Czermak, of seeing what actually takes place in the larynx during the
production     of vocal sounds.
    The tact of the Professor in applying the instrument in his own
case, and the impunity with which he is able to bear its presence in
the sensitive parts of the pharynx,       are great advantages.
    In many persons the       presence    of any foreign body      so applied,
usually produces, by reflex action,      a sense  of sickness in the stomach.
    In ordinary    breathing the glottis is wide open, and the arytenoid
cartilages are thrown wide apart      ;  but on the production of the most
simple sound, these cartilages are suddenly and rapidly closed, and
the   edges  of the vocal cords come into juxtaposition with each other
so as to   leave no interval between them in their entire length.
    In  the production    of the lower tones of the voice the vocal cords
may be seen to vibrate throughout their whole length, and even at
their prolongations at the     base of the arytenoid cartilages ; they seem
to vibrate also throughout their entire breadth.          As the pitch of the
 tones rises in the scale, the length of the cords in a state of vibration
 diminishes, and they are pressed more closely against each other            : as
 the tones become       more acute, the pressure is increased, and the
 tension of the vocal cords augmented         ;  the breadth of the cords is
also diminished.
    When the chest tones have arrived        at the limit of the scale  of acute
 range, and the falsetto tones commence, the glottis is seen to be more
 closely pressed together, and the edges only of the vocal cords are
 suffered to vibrate, as Garcia has already observed.            On the other
 hand, while     the chest tones    are   produced, a larger surface of the
 vocal cords is in a state of vibration.         When the falsetto     tones are
 produced, it appears      that the very extreme edge only of the cord
 vibrates, and a much less expenditure of breath is required.             While
 the highest     notes  of the voice   are intoned, the vocal cords are so
 closely pressed together, that a small portion          only of the glottis is

                                         144                                [June   19,
seen to  yield  to the pressure,   which takes place nearly at its central
portion.
   From the inspection of the vocal organs now               so easily obtained,      it
may be stated in general terms that, as the voice ascends                      from its
lowest to its more acute tones, the lengths of the vibrating portions
of the vocal cords      are  proportionally diminished, while            at the same
time their tensions are increased      ;  and, in fact, they present the same
phenomena as those of musical chords, and they appear to obey the
same laws, as    Ferrein   so long since      supposed, and which have since
been confirmed by      Muller and by myself.
   Moreover, the vocal cords form a kind of valve, which is situated
in a tube, and acts on the column          of air in the manner of        a reed.
   It is observed that while the pitch of the tones               of the voice      be
comes   more grave, the epiglottis         is depressed and the          pharynx      is
relaxed  ; and, on the contrary, as the pitch becomes more acute, the
epiglottis  is raised and the pharynx           becomes contracted          :   the de
pression of the epiglottis      probably      assists   in deepening the pitch
of the vocal tube in the       same   manner as        the lid of an organ pipe
does.
   In the production and modulation of the               voice,  it  is astonishing
with what accuracy some persons are able to produce at will, sounds
of a determinate pitch      and of a quality which charm and captivate
the ear of a musician.          The muscles which           are  principally con
cerned in this faculty are the thyro-arytenoid             and the lateral crico
arytenoid.     The crico-thyroid    is limited to stretching the vocal liga
ments.
   The   mere   turning of the vocal cords on their             axes,    out of the
vocalizing    position,   does  not afford      sufficient    space    for ordinary
breathing, as supposed by       Mr. Willis, but      we find that the arytenoid
cartilages   and    vocal   cords  are    widely    separated during          ordinary
breathing.
   With regard to the controversy         as to whether the vocal organs are
to be considered     as a stringed instrument        or as a reeded pipe, it has
been thought     by some physiologists         that the same        organs cannot
possibly perform the offices      of both.       However, under the denomi
nation of reeded pipes, we find a great variety of form and structure,
and it is not difficult to conceive    that while the time of an oscillation
of the vocal ligaments obeys the          same laws as musical           strings, the

valve  of the glottis in opening and closing the vocal tube performs
an action resembling that of some of the musical reeds.
   The human organs of voice have       been considered by a great many
distinguished   philosophers as constituting     a reeded   instrument, and
the relation in which     they stand to instruments of that character
has been already discussed in my paper in the ' Transactions
                                                                     '
                                                                       of the
Royal Society for the year 1846; it only remains to remark that
the phenomena brought to light by means of the laryngoscope tend
to confirm the idea that the vocal organs really perform          the double
effect both of reed and string.
   In  ejaculatory sounds, such as the production       of the syllables ha,
ha, ha in laughing, the glottis is opened at each          intermission   and
closed at each intonation of sound, thus producing a rapid succession
of opening and closing the glottis.
    In a paper published    in the 'Proceedings of the Royal Society*,'
by Manuel Garcia,     a great number    of observations  on the movements
of the glottis  are described   ; many of these have been verified both
by Professor Czermak and by myself, and we cannot but be gratified
by the advance which has been made in our knowledge of the action
of the vocal organs during intonation, and that the speculations and
controversies which have existed on some points are, by the applica
tion of the laryngoscope, now brought to a satisfactory conclusion.
   The great differences which we find to exist in the quality of the
sounds produced — those, for example,       of the chest, and those of the
falsetto character, the causes of which have excited so much specu
lation — are in reality effected by very simple changes in the mecha
nism of the larynx.
    It would have    been   possible to extend this paper by pursuing
the inquiry into the details of the special action of the muscles,
and the distribution and functions of the nerves of the larynx, as
well as the play     of the several cartilages, but       I  have restricted
myself to the actual phenomena presented to the eye, and to the
acoustic deductions arising out of the movements of the larynx, more
especially those of the thyro-arytenoid      ligaments.
   The   waves  of sound generated by the larynx in the column of air
contained in the vocal tube, set the whole of the membranes sur
 rounding the tube in a vibratory, reciprocating motion, and we know

from the researches       of Savart, and from pathological data, that these
movements are        essentially necessary to the production of the most
simple sounds     ;   for when   these   membranes are incapable of being
put into  a state   of vibration, the sounds of the voice     are extinguished,

V. " Anatomy and Physiology of the Spongiadae." — Part III.
       By J. Scott Bowerbank, LL.D., F.R.S.                            Received
       June 18, 1862.
                                    (Abstract.)
    This paper   is the   third part of the Anatomy and Physiology of the
Spongiadae.     The author, after pointing out the inefficiency, or rather
the non-existence of a definite arrangement of species of sponges,
proposes to establish a series of orders, suborders, and genera, the
distinguishing    characters of which are to be founded on the structural
peculiarities of the various organs of the animals which have been
described in detail and named in the first and second parts of the
paper.     The term Amorphozoa, proposed by De Blainville as a
designation of the class, is rejected, as all sponges cannot be considered
as shapeless,   many genera and species exhibiting          much constancy in
their forms, while that of Porifera, proposed by Dr. Grant, is adopted,
as the porous mode of imbibition of nutriment is universal in this
class  of animals.      The author also    agrees  with Dr. Grant in dividing
the class into      three great orders, dependent on the nature of the
substances of which the skeletons are constructed.                 These three
great divisions are designated by Dr. Grant in the following order            : —
1st, Keratosa,     having skeletons of horny structure, with few or no
siliceous spicula; 2nd, Leuconida,           the skeletons composed of cal
careous spicula; and 3rd, Chalinida,            the skeletons constructed       of
siliceous spicula.      The author, for  reasons stated  in detail in the paper,
proposes to change the order of this arrangement, placing the cal
careous sponges first, under the designation of Calcarea.          The siliceous
sponges are placed second, and designated              Silicea, while the first
order of Dr. Grant, Keratosa, is placed last.          With    these exceptions
of arrangement and designation, the orders are essentially those
established by Prof. Grant in his " Tabular View of the primary
divisions of the Animal Kingdom."

    The first of     these   orders      (Calcarida)     has  hitherto      been   repre
sented by the genus Grantia only              ;  but   as the genus as established
by Fleming contains          sponges      having      very differently      constructed
skeletons, the author has divided the whole of the species of calcareous
sponges that have been named and described into the four following
genera, Grantia, Leucolenia,           Leuconia,      and Leucogypsia,        in accord
ance   with four distinct types of skeleton-structure which               are found to
exist among the sponges originally arranged under the genus Grantia
of Fleming.
    The second order, Silicea,         is very much more extensive than that
 of Calcarea, and, from the striking varieties it affords in the con
 struction of the skeletons, it allows of a subdivision into seven sub
 orders.    The first of   these consists       of sponges having spiculo-radiate
 skeletons, and contains thirteen genera, as follows             : — Geodia, Pachy-
 matisma,      Ecionemia,     Alcyoneellum,           Polymastia, Halyphysema,
 Tethea, Halicnemia,       Dictyocylindrus, Phakellia, Microciona, Hy-
  meraphia, and Hymedesmia.
     The second suborder consists of spiculo-membranous sponges ; it
 consists of one genus, Hymeniacidon.              The third has spiculo-reticulate
  skeletons  ;  it contains four      genera,    Halichondria, Hyalonema,             Iso-
  dictya,   and    Spongilla.      The fourth suborder has spiculo-fibrous
 skeletons   ; it contains two genera, Desmacidon and Raphyrus. The
 fifth suborder has compound reticulate skeletons ; it has but one
 genus, Diplodemia.          The sixth suborder has solid                siliceo-fibrous
 skeletons   ; it contains   one genus,      Dactylocalyx.         The seventh sub
 order has canaliculated         siliceo-fibrous      skeletons, and contains         one
 genus, Farrea.
     The third order, Keratosa, is also divided into                seven suborders.
 The first, consisting of solid non-spiculate             kerato-fibrous       skeletons,
 is represented by one genus, Spongia               ;  the legitimate      type of the
 genus being the cup-shaped and finest Turkey sponges of commerce.
 The second suborder has solid semi-spiculate kerato-fibrous skele
 tons ; it contains at present but one genus, Halispongia ; the type
of which is the     coarse massive sponges            of commerce from the West
 Indian Islands.       The third suborder has solid, entirely spiculated
kerato-fibrous     skeletons   ;  it has    one    genus,    Chalina   :   the type of
this genus is one of the commonest of the British sponges, Halichon
dria oculata of Johnston.            The fourth suborder is characterized by

                                         148                          [June     19,
having     simple    fistulo-fibrous    skeletons;    it contains   one   genus,
 Verongia.      The fifth suborder contains sponges which have               com
pound     fistulo-fibrous   skeletons,    and   is represented by the genus
 Auleskia.      The sixth suborder consists of sponges having regular
semi-areno-fibrous skeletons, and is represented by the genus Stema-
tumenia.       The seventh suborder has irregular and entirely areno-
fibrous skeletons ; it is represented by the genus Dysidea.                   The
whole of these genera (those previously established as well as the new
ones proposed by the author) have been characterized in accordance
with their anatomical structures.
   The author concludes his paper with            a dissertation on the discri
mination of species, and a general review of those portions of the
organization that may be applied with advantage to their scientific
description.      The principal sources for this purpose being — 1st.

       The author       states that about twenty crania were brought from the
excavations at Wroxeter.                       Of   these,    two were    discovered at the
bottom of a hypocaust,                    seven     feet below the surface      of the earth.
Of the remaining nineteen, which                           were   dug up in the          Orchard
some         distance from the other                excavation, nearly one-half,          that is
nine, were more or less deformed.                            As the deformed skulls were
found        lying under          less   than two feet of light earth, whilst those
which were buried under, and pressed by,                           seven feet   of rubble or
heavy earth were not deformed, he thinks that the pressure theory
alone will not satisfactorily                  account for the phenomena.                The idea
occurred to him that some chemical agency was at work in the former
casewhich did not operate in the latter.   He ascertained by experi
ment that the soil of the Orchard was acid, reddening litmus, whilst
that of the hypocausts was neutral or alkaline.
       The author        goes     on to show that the acidity             of the soil of the
Orchard, and of vegetable mould in general, is due to the presence
of free carbonic and nitric acids, which are not to be detected in
earth taken from some depth, such as that of the hypocaust or a
deep       That carbonic acid is capable of dissolving bone (that
         pit.                                                                                     is,
carbonate and phosphate of lime)    abundantly provedis   more than             by
one experiment.               A   dried and weighed slip of bone was introduced
into    a    bottle with distilled water highly charged with carbonic acid
gas.         In   a   month's      time   it   had decidedly lost weight and become
.   mc ./hat      flexible.
The          author's first impression was that humic acid was the solvent
to*~ne in the earth.                     He believes that traces of alkaline humates
may always be discovered in                     "the washings" of soil, but that this
fact has nothing to do with the solution of buried bones, and there-
kfci-a^e      does not pursue the subject.
this    g(   author draws, therefore, the following conclusions                  :   —
dria ochat the distortion of the skulls found at Wroxeter                           is   not   congenital,
        but posthumous.

     2. That pressure alone is not the cause of the deformity.
     3. That besides the softening effect of continuous moisture acting
 for ages upon the cartilaginous       or animal matter of the bones, there
 is  proof of the presence of free carbonic and nitric acids very gene
 rally in soils, and more particularly in black mould, such as that of
the Orchard at Wroxeter.
     4. Nitric acid may also       be discovered   in small quantity.     But
carbonic acid is almost always present in soil where air and moisture
come in contact with organic matters           in a state of decomposition.
 He thinks that this is the principal       cause  of the solution of bone in
 the earth, rendering it softer, and more ready to bend or break.
     5. That the distortion must occur at a comparatively early period
after interment, because when all, or nearly all, the animal matter of
the bones is destroyed, they cannot bend.
     Lastly. That  some   of the apparently bent bones are really broken ;

        Stokes, Sec. R.S. Received June 19, 1862.
     Having  so recently been      honoured   by the Council of the Royal
Society with a grant from          the Donation    Fund for the purpose of
defraying some of the expenses of my researches on this new element,
I   should not have ventured to offer to the Society so incomplete a
notice as the present one, had       I not within the last week heard that
a continental    chemist, Professor      Lamy, of Lille, has recently    been
fortunate enough to meet with a residue containing thallium in con
siderable quantities,    and has isolated       the element     and prepared
several of its compounds      :  it therefore appears advisable at once to
place on record a description of several compounds of this body
obtained since the date of my first announcement of its discovery in
March 1861, but which       I   had purposely avoided publishing in order
that it might form part of a more complete memoir on the subject
which    I had hoped at some future        day to have the honour of sub-

1862.]                                     151
mitting to this Society.          I  trust that, under these circumstances,              I
may be pardoned for bringing before the Royal Society an incomplete
account of this new element.
   The occurrence of        a brilliant  green line    in some selenium residues,
whilst examining them for tellurium, led                  me   first to suspect the
presence    of    a new element.         This had      been    derived from a con
siderable    quantity     of the seleniferous deposit from the sulphuric
acid manufactory at Tilkerode in the Hartz Mountains, which had
been kindly placed at my disposal by Professor Hofmann                        ;  and the
residue was that left behind            on distilling the selenium which had
been prepared from         the deposit by appropriate           chemical treatment.
The    processes    through     which it had       passed    limited    the elements
which could by any possibility           be present to some          half  dozen    ;  and
as  I  was pretty confident that none         of these presented       in the spectro
scope the phenomenon            of  a single bright-green         line, it became of
interest to investigate the subject further.               In March 1861* I            was
enabled to announce definitely             that   the green-line       substance was
decidedly a new element,         and that from some of its reactions it was
probably     a   high member of the sulphur, selenium, and tellurium
group,    although     I  hesitated to assert       this positively.        The paper
alluded    to contained a       sufficient number of the reactions of this
body to    enable    me   to prove chemically,       as well as optically,         that  I
was dealing with a new element possessing well-defined                      characters.
Pursuing the investigation, I was enabled in the following Mayf to
give a further account of this body, and to propose for it the name
of Thallium (symbol 77), from the Greek OaWos, or Latin thallm,
a budding twig, — a word which is frequently employed to express
the beautiful green tint of young vegetation, and which                     I   chose   on
account    of the green line which it communicated to the spectrum
recalling   with peculiar vividness the fresh colour of early spring.
In   the same note I gave the localities and description of several
minerals in which        I  had found the element, and also a method of
extracting     it from them in         a pure   state.     Considering       that   I  had
sufficiently     announced     the    discovery in these papers, which                were
republished in nearly every chemical journal in Europe,                   I  turned my

attention towards procuring a source of thallium which would enable
me to prepare this body on the large scale           ; my experiments having
hitherto been confined to mineralogical specimens which              I  had diffi
 culty in tracing to their source, and the whole amount of thallium
 which    I   had as yet obtained not exceeding three grains in weight.
    After     some delay,   Mr. Thornthwaite was good enough to supply
 me with a considerable quantity of crude sulphur distilled from
 Spanish copper pyrites.          In this I found thallium present to the
 extent of one or two grains to the pound, and up to within the last
 few months it has been from the element prepared from this source
 that  I  have been working.         I have recently, however, succeeded        in
 finding an ore containing thallium, which          is worked in this country,
 and from which         I hope to be able to prepare the metal in larger
 quantities.
    I  have found the following         the most advantageous method for
 extracting the new element from sulphur or pyrites           : —
    Powder the ore very finely, and dissolve it as completely as possible
 in strong hydrochloric acid, with gradual addition of nitric acid until
 all solvent action     ceases ; then dilute  with water, and filter.     Evapo
 rate down to drive off the excess of nitric acid, add a little sulphuric
acid   if  necessary, and take care that the solution does not get dry,
or even pasty.         Then dilute with water, and heat gently, to be cer
tain of getting all the soluble portion dissolved.           Filter : if lead be
present, the greater portion will be left behind in this operation in
the form of insoluble sulphate.          Dilute the filtrate considerably, and
add a solution        of carbonate of    soda  until the reaction is distinctly
alkaline    ;  then add an excess of solution of cyanide of potassium (free
from sulphide of potassium).           Heat gently for some time, and then
filter.     The precipitate contains the whole of the lead and bismuth
which may         be present as carbonates,     whilst the thallium is in solu
tion.     A    current of sulphuretted hydrogen now being passed through
the liquid, precipitates all the thallium, whilst the copper, antimony,
tin, and arsenic remain dissolved.          If cadmium    and mercury are pre
sent, they      will accompany the thallium.       The former    can readily be
dissolved out by warm dilute sulphuric           acid, which has scarcely any
solvent action on the sulphide of thallium, whilst this in its turn can
be separated from the sulphide         of mercury by being boiled in mode
rately dilute nitric acid, in which the sulphide of mercury is insoluble.

These two metals           are, however, seldom present with                              thallium in the
ores which       I   have examined.                 The nitric-acid solution                 is now to be
evaporated       to dryness, the residue dissolved in hot dilute sulphuric
acid,     and a piece of pure metallic zinc placed in the                                      liquid; the
thallium will        be at       once precipitated             in the form of              a deep-brown
powder, which soon changes to a heavy black, granular precipitate.
The metal can             be obtained          in the coherent form by fusion in hy
drogen.
     This method of analysis is given on the supposition that all the
above metals are present.                      It   may generally be much abridged, as
the ore is seldom of so complicated a character.                                     If   there is a diffi
culty in procuring perfectly pure zinc for the reduction of the sulphate
to the metallic       state, this can be effected by passing a weak voltaic
current     through       the liquid, using platinum                         poles   ;    the metal will
then be precipitated in the reguline, or spongy state, according to the
strength    of the current.              I    have not been very successful in reducing
the oxide by hydrogen.                The current of            gas carries the volatile oxide
away from the heated part of the tube before complete reduction
takes place.         It    is,   however, probable,                 from an observation made
towards the conclusion   of this experiment, that, with a longer tube
in proportion to the quantity of material, kept at good heat through          a
out its length, this plan might give good results, the metal being
considerably less volatile than the oxide.
     In   many cases, when minute traces only of thallium accompany
large quantities of other metals,                       it   may be advisable to repeat the
whole or some of the above operations, in order to purify this element
from foreign metals which may have escaped complete removal.
I      now pass on to            a   description         of thallium and its chemical                    re
actions.
     Thallium in the pure            state     is   a   heavy metal, bearing               a   remarkable
resemblance to lead in its physical properties.                               Its specific gravity is,
however,    higher — about           1   2.     The freshly scraped surface has                     a   bril
liant metallic lustre not quite               so blue in colour as lead, and                 it   tarnishes
more rapidly than this latter metal.                           It   is   very soft, being readily
cut with   a   knife and indented with the nail                     ;   it   may also be hammered
out and drawn into wire, but has not much tenacity in this form.
It   easily marks paper.             The fusing-point               is   below redness, and with
care several pieces may be melted together and cast into one lump.

                                                154                                  [June 19,
There    is,   however, generally          a    loss in this operation, owing to its
rapid oxidation.           The metal itself           does    not appear to be sensibly
volatile below    a     red heat.      I      have made no special attempts at pre
sent to determine the atomic weight, although                        from two estimations
of the amount of sulphur in the sulphide                     it   appears to be very heavy.
The figures obtained did not, however,                       agree well enough to enable
me to speak more definitely on this point, than                         that
                                                                           I       believe    it    to
be above       100.   I    may mention that           I    obtained this element in the
pure metallic         state    and exhibited          it   to several friends as early as
January last     *,    and should then have published an account of                          it,   had
it   not been for the reasons already mentioned.                        Thallium        is   soluble
in nitric, hydrochloric,            and sulphuric acids, the former attacking                       it
with greatest energy, with evolution of red vapours.
   Oxides of Thallium. — Thallium forms two, and probably three
oxides   :   one possessing basic properties, which                I   shall call the oxide          ;
another containing            more oxygen, possessing acid properties, which
may therefore be called thallic acid; and most likely                               a   third, or
suboxide, which forms the first portions of the precipitate formed by
zinc in solutions of this metal            ;    the first action being         a   darkening        of
the solution,         and the production of           a    deep-brown powder, which by
longer contact with zinc turns to                a    dense black precipitate.

bath, but not carrying           it   to dryness,      a   of deliquescent crystals
                                                           mass
is   obtained on cooling, which are              decomposed upon addition of water
with separation of         a   white or pale-yellow precipitate, which appears
to be    a     subnitrate,       and an acid            solution     containing       nitrate        of
thallium.       If the     liquid   is   evaporated quite to dryness and kept at                     a
temperature of 100° C. for                a   little time, the nitric acid         goes off, and
leaves   a   residue of thallic acid.
     Thallic Acid. — This acid            is   soluble in water, and may be obtained
in the crystalline            form from its aqueous solution.                  It    then forms
crystals, which are permanent in the air, and have an acid reaction to
test-paper.       The thallates of the alkalies                   are also soluble       in water,
and may be prepared              by   dissolving the acid in the alkali, or by fusing
 thallium or its oxide with           a   mixture of alkaline carbonate and nitrate.
The method      I      originally published for extracting thallium was based

upon the formation in this manner of an alkaline                                thallate soluble in

of potash is added to                a soluble salt     of oxide of thallium.
     Chloride of Thallium. — If a                current of dry chlorine is passed over
precipitated thallium at a moderate heat, they combine with formation
of a volatile chloride, which condenses in the cool part of the tube in
the form           of    a    pale-yellow      crystalline    powder,          fusing       together in
parts to a crystalline lump.              Water only partially dissolves this, with
production          of    a   white insoluble residue.  Dilute hydrochloric acid
added to the              turbid solution immediately                    renders   it clear     ;    upon
evaporating             this solution        over a water-bath,           white crystals            of the
chloride are deposited.                 When the nitric-acid solution of thallium or
its sulphide is evaporated with                   an excess        of hydrochloric acid, and
then more hydrochloric acid added and the evaporation repeated to
a syrup,          a residue is obtained           which is apparently decomposed by
water with production                  of     a white    precipitate       :   this is chloride         of
thallium      ;    it    is insoluble or nearly so in water, but readily soluble in
dilute hydrochloric or nitric acid.
     Sulphide           of Thallium. — When             sulphuretted           hydrogen       is passed
through the acid solution of chloride of thallium, a partial precipita
tion of a reddish-brown powder takes place ; this appears to be a com
bination of the chloride and sulphide, and the metal is never entirely
removed from solution by this means.   The best method of obtaining
the sulphide is to precipitate it with sulphide of ammonium in an
alkaline solution : unless a large quantity of thallium is present,
no immediate effect is produced beyond the darkening of the liquid                                        ;
it   assumes          tint, which becomes rapidly more and more
                    a brown

thallium separates in the form of     deep-brown heavy precipitate

of sulphide of ammonium, ammonia, or cyanide of potassium.                                             Its
complete           precipitation        as    sulphide      from    solutions        containing        an
excess      of cyanide of potassium affords                  a     ready means of separating
thallium from several metals with which                        it    is    frequently associated.
It   is   difficultly soluble in hydrochloric or sulphuric acids, but readily

so in  nitric acid.   When dry, it is     a deep-brown, almost black powder,
 fusing and volatilizing when heated        : when pure, it is neither so fusible
 nor so volatile as sulphur     ;  but when it occurs with an excess of this
latter  element, it is very difficult to separate from it by sublima
tion.
    Carbonate    of Thallium is precipitated upon adding an alkaline
carbonate to the acid chloride solution            ; it is moderately soluble in
an excess    of carbonate of ammonia, and readily                so  in cyanide of
potassium.      This is a very definite reaction, and         enables   thallium to
be separated with accuracy from lead and bismuth.
    Sulphate of Thallium. — When the hydrochloric or nitric solution
is evaporated down with sulphuric acid, the more volatile acid is
driven off and the sulphate is left behind.                It  is crystalline    and
soluble in water.
    Iodide  of Thallium    is precipitated as a yellowish-red powder upon
cautious addition of iodide of potassium to a solution of thallium.                It
is readily soluble in excess of iodide      of potassium, forming       a colourless
solution.
    Phosphate    of Thallium     forms a white flocculent precipitate soluble
in mineral acids, but sparingly soluble in acetic acid.
   Ferrocyanide of Thallium is white and insoluble in water.
    Cyanide of Thallium is precipitated as a white or light-brown
powder upon the cautious addition of cyanide of potassium to a so
lution of thallium.       It  is readily soluble in an excess of the pre
cipitant.
    Chromate    of Thallium     is a pale-yellow precipitate soluble in acids
and reprecipitated upon neutralization           with ammonia.
    No precipitates are produced when a solution of thallium is mixed
with protochloride of tin, oxalic acid, carbazotic acid, sulphurous
acid, or protosulphate      of iron.
    Most of   these reactions have been          independently verified by my
friends   E. O. Brown, Esq., and          J.  Spiller, Esq., of the Chemical
Department, Woolwich Arsenal           ; and   I am glad to be enabled to take
this opportunity     of expressing my obligations to them for their
valuable aid.     The reactions are sufficient to prove chemically that
the body under examination is a new element.                Its behaviour in the
spectrum apparatus is perhaps the most conclusive                   test upon this

1862.]                                   157
point. When a minute portion of the metal (the sulphide, chloride,
or, intact, any compound of thallium) is introduced into the flame of
the spectroscope,      it immediately produces         a single green line, per
fectly sharp and well defined upon          a black ground,        and of extraor
dinary purity and intensity, almost equal            to the sodium-line     in bril
liancy.     It is not, however, very lasting.       Owing   to its great volatility,
a portion introduced at once into the flame merely shows the line as
a brilliant flash, remaining       only a fraction    of a second    ; but if it  be
introduced     into the flame gradually,      the line continues present for a
much longer time.         If, also,  a piece   of metallic thallium       be intro
duced into the flame on a platinum wire loop, they fuse together, and
the alloy gives the green line rather more permanently, although                   of
course fainter.
    Working on      a small scale,  it is not easy to obtain these compounds
 free from soda    ; but when that is effected, and a tolerable quantity of
 substance is held on a loop of platinum wire in a flame, the green
 colour is most brilliant, and produces very extraordinary effects upon
 the appearance of surrounding             objects.      If thallium could be
 obtained in quantity, this ready means            of producing     an intense and
 homogeneous green light could not fail to be applicable to some useful
 purpose.
    The green line of the thallium spectrum appears to be unaccom
 panied by any line or band in other parts of the spectrum. A flame
 of sufficient temperature to bring the orange line of lithium into view
 produces no addition to the one thallium-line ; and an application of
 telescopic power strong enough to separate the two sodium-lines a
 considerable     distance apart still shows the thallium-line single.               I
 consider therefore that      I am justified in stating that thallium pro
 duces the simplest       spectrum     of any known       element.     Theoretical
 inquiries into the cause of the spectrum lines, and their relation to
 other constants of an element, may be facilitated now we know a metal
 which gives rise to luminous vibrations of only one degree of refran-
 gibility.    The remarkable simplicity of the thallium spectrum offers
 a strong     contrast   to the complicated        spectra given by mercury,
 bismuth, and lead — the metals to which it has the most chemical
 resemblance.
    The position of the green line        does not coincide      with any definite
 line in the solar spectrum.       According    to  KirchhofFs theory,     we must

                                          158                                [June 13,
therefore assume that thallium is not present to any great extent in
the sun.    Under the highest telescopic power of my apparatus, the line
appears to be absolutely identical in refrangibility with a sharp well-
defined line in the barium spectrum, to which Professors Bunsen
and Kirchhoff       have given the name BaS.               Want of material has
hitherto prevented        me from      taking accurate measurements of the
distance between the thallium-line and the principal lines of the solar
spectrum.
    This green line is       an exquisitely    delicate test for the presence          of
thallium,    and shows     it to  be a somewhat widely distributed             element.
Many specimens of crude sulphur contain it (especially when rather
dark-looking). In most cases it is only necessary to set fire to as
large a piece of sulphur (less than a pea) as the platinum loop will
hold, and when it has nearly burned away to blow it out, and
then introduce it at leisure into the flame of the spectroscope, for
the thallium to show its presence            by a bright-green        line which will
flash for an instant into the field of view.                Although the greater
part of the thallium is left behind after burning off the excess of
sulphur in this manner, some of it volatilizes, and consequently, if
the specimen gives no indications             of thallium     by this treatment, it
will   be advisable to dissolve out as much            of the sulphur       as  possible
with bisulphide       of carbon, and then           to   test the    residue      in  the
 flame.
    Thallium is a constituent           of very many mineral             ores.      Upon
examining      a large collection       of cupriferous      pyrites    from     different
parts of the world,      I   found it present in more than one-eighth.                  It
is not confined to any particular           locality   ;  neither   does    it  seem to
bear any relation to the presence or absence of arsenic in the mineral.
 I  have, however, very rarely met with            it in pyrites in which copper
 was absent.      In  most cases it is only necessary           to powder        a small
 fragment     of the mineral and ignite          a  little of it in the flame on
 a   moistened     platinum      wire,   for the green line to           be    distinctly
 visible.
     If  a thalliferous     pyrites is finely powdered and then heated to
 redness in a glass tube, as much as possible out of contact with air,
 the sulphide of thallium, together with some free sulphur, sublimes
 from   it and may     be condensed by appropriate             arrangement.          This
 sublimate gives the thallium-line with great brilliancy.

    Owing to the frequent occurrence of thallium in copper ores, it is
very probable that this element may sometimes be present in com
mercial copper, and may give rise to some of the well-known, but
unexplained,     differences of its quality.       I am    at present engaged in
investigating this subject, and have already found some indications of
thallium in commercial products.
    I  have no hesitation in saying that in          some    of our large copper,
sulphur, and sulphuric-acid       works, thallium is at the present time
being thrown away by the hundredweight                :   a very   slight modifica
tion of the present arrangements of the furnaces and condensing
flues, or even an examination of some of the residues, would enable
nearly the whole of this to be saved.              Bearing     this in view,   I am
 now in communication       with several large consumers of thalliferous
 minerals.     My applications have without exception been met with
 the utmost courtesy and most obliging offers of assistance, and there
 is therefore every probability that       I shall soon      have an opportunity
 of preparing this new element in considerable quantities, and thus be
 enabled to pursue the investigation with more comfort and accuracy
 than hitherto, when my stock of material has had to be counted by
 the grain.

     In  this paper the author pursues an inquiry the commencement
  of which    was communicated      to the Chemical         Section of the British
  Association   last year.   Owing     to the employment         of   a prism  of bi-
  sidphide of carbon, he was then led to believe that the photographic
  effects of the electric spectra produced by the different metals were
  in  a great degree similar,  if not   identical.      Subsequent investigations
  have, however, shown him that the absorbent effects of the bisul
  phide upon the chemical rays are so great, that the conclusions then
  drawn    from observations     made     by this refracting       medium     require

                                         160                         [June 19,
    very considerable    modification.    Notwithstanding the great length
   of the chemical spectra obtained by the aid of the bisulphide, not
   more than one-sixth or one-seventh      of the true extent of the spectrum
   produced    by the electric spark between various metals is procured,
   as may be shown      by comparing the spectrum with one of the          same
   metal furnished by the use of a lens and prism of rock-crystal.
       Rock-crystal, however,    possesses but a comparatively small refrac
   tive and dispersive power, whilst it almost always affords some trace
   of double refraction in   one portion or other    of the spectrum procured
  by its means.
      In  searching   for some    singly  refracting   medium    which should
   possess sufficient  refractive and dispersive power to enable       it to be
  used advantageously in the construction of lenses and prisms suitable
  for this inquiry, the author       was  led to examine the photographic
  absorption of a variety of colourless substances which appeared per
  fectly transparent to the luminous       rays.    The experiments detailed
  in the first portion     of the present paper refer to this absorbent
  action  of various media upon the chemical rays of the spectrum ;
  whilst the second portion of the paper is devoted to a description of
  the electric spectra of some of the more important elementary bodies,
  and the effect    of varying the     gaseous   media in which the sparks
  producing these spectra are made to originate.
      1. The  Photographic Transparency          of Bodies. — In the experi
  ments upon the absorbent action of the different media, the source
 of light employed was the electric spark              obtained  between two
  metallic wires (generally of fine silver), connected with the terminals
 of the secondary wires of a ten-inch induction-coil.         The light, after
 passing through a narrow vertical slit, either before or after traversing
 a stratum of the material        the chemical     transparency   or diactinic
 quality of which was to be tested, was allowed to fall upon a quartz
prism placed at the angle of minimum deviation for the mean of the
 refracted rays.     Immediately behind this was a lens of rock-crystal,
and behind this, at a suitable distance, the spectrum was received
upon     a collodion-film   coated with iodide of silver; this was sup
ported in the frame of a camera, and after an exposure, generally
lasting for five minutes, the image was developed by means of pyro-
gallic acid, and fixed with cyanide of potassium.
     The general results of   these experiments were as follows     :—

 1862.]                                 161
    1.  Colourless bodies which are equally transparent              to the visible
rays, vary greatly in permeability to the chemical rays.
    2. Bodies which are       photographically        transparent     in the solid
form, preserve their transparency in the liquid and in the                  gaseous
states.
    3. Colourless    transparent solids which exert a considerable pho
tographic absorption, preserve their absorptive action with greater or
less intensity both in the     liquid and in the gaseous states.
    Whether the compound         is liquefied by heat or dissolved        in water,
these conclusions      respecting liquids are equally true.            The perfect
permeability of water to the chemical rays, conjoined with the cir
 cumstance that in no instance does the process of solution seem to
 interfere with the special action upon the incident rays of the sub
 stance dissolved, renders it practicable to submit           to this test a great
 number of bodies which it would otherwise be impossible to subject
 to this species of experiment on account of the extreme difficulty of
 obtaining them in crystals of sufficient        size and   limpidity.
    Glass vessels cannot be employed to contain the liquids during the
trial.    Flint-glass, crown, hard white Bohemian, plate-glass, window-
 sheet, and Faraday's      optical glass, all, even in thin layers, shorten
 the spectrum by from three-fifths          to four-fifths or even more of its
 length. Mica produces a similar effect. Indeed, the only substance
 which the author found could be employed with advantage is rock-
crystal cut into thin slices and polished.           The value of this material
 in researches upon the more refrangible end of the spectrum was
 pointed out by Prof. Stokes and M. E. Becquerel several years ago.
In order to hold the liquids for experiment, a small trough was pre
pared by cutting a notch in a thick plate of plate-glass, the sides
being completed by means of thin plates of quartz, which were pressed
against the ground       surfaces of the plate-glass by the aid of elastic
bands    of caoutchouc   ; a stratum    of liquid of     0*75  inch in depth was
thus obtained for each experiment.
    The substances which, after atmospheric               air and certain other
gases, are most perfectly diactinic,         are  rock-crystal,    ice, as well as
pure water, and white fluor-spar.            Rock-salt is scarcely inferior to
them,    if  at all.  Then follow various sulphates, including those of
baryta, and the hydrated sulphates of lime and magnesia, as well as
those   of the alkalies.     The carbonates of the alkalies and alkaline

                                                 162                                      [June 19,
earths, as also the phosphates, arseniates, and borates, are likewise
tolerably transparent, though saturated solutions of phosphoric                                   and
arsenic acids exerted considerable absorbent power                          ;   so also   did those
of the alkalies, potash, and soda, possibly from the presence of a
trace of some foreign colouring matter, as those liquids had an ex
tremely faint greenish tinge.
   The soluble fluorides,           as well as the chlorides and bromides                    of the
metals of the alkalies and alkaline earths, are freely diactinic, but the
iodides are much less so, and exhibit                     certain peculiarities.            All   the
organic acids and their salts which were tried by the author exerted a
marked absorptive action upon the more refrangible rays.                                  Amongst
those subjected to experiment were the oxalates, tartrates, acetates,
and citrates, those mentioned first in order having the greatest ab
sorptive action.       It   is,   however, much more difficult to obtain or
ganic compounds in          a   stateof purity sufficient to furnish trustworthy
results, than   is   the case     with the salts of the inorganic acids.    The
author, therefore, expresses himself with more reserve                               upon some of
these organic bodies,       particularly the              acetates,    than in other cases.
The different varieties of sugar are freely diactinic.
  Amongst the salts of inorganic acids, the nitrates are the most
remarkable for their power of arresting the chemical rays.                                 A   solu
tion of each of these salts, in all the instances tried, cut off all the
more refrangible rays, and reduced the spectrum to less than                               a   sixth
of its ordinary length.  The chlorates, however, do not participate
in this absorptive power to nearly the same extent.
   Although the sulphates,              as   a   class,    are largely diactinic,          the sul
phites are much less so         ;   and the hyposulphites               cut off about three-
fourths   of the length of the spectrum, leaving only the                                  less   re
frangible portion.
   Of eighteen different liquids tried                    by   the author, two only can be
regarded as tolerably            diactinic,      viz. water, which              is   eminently    so,
and absolute alcohol, which, however, exhibits                         a   considerable falling
off.   The liquids which follow               are mentioned           in the order of their
chemical transparency, those most transparent being mentioned first                                :
— Dutch liquid,        chloroform,           ether; then benzol and distilled gly
cerin, which differ but little          ;    then fousel oil, wood-spirit,               and oxalic
ether, which are also nearly alike                  ;     acetic acid, oil of turpentine,
glycol,   carbolic acid, liquid paraffin,                 boiling     at 360°        F., and bisul

 1862.]                                   163
phide of carbon.        Finally, terchloride and oxychloride of phosphorus,
although perfectly colourless and limpid, arrest all the chemical rays.
    The experiments upon aeriform bodies yielded important results ;
they show but little coincidence with those of Tyndall on the
absorptive power of the gases for radiant heat.                 These experiments
were made by interposing           in the track of the ray between the ver
tical slit and the quartz prism, a brass tube two feet long, closed at
each end air-tight by means of a plate of quartz.                      Each   gas  or
vapour in succession was introduced              into the tube, and the results
compared with those produced by causing the rays to traverse the
tube when filled with atmospheric air.
    Amongst the colourless          gases, oxygen,      hydrogen,   nitrogen,    car
bonic acid, and carbonic oxide exhibit no absorptive power.
    Olefiant gas, protoxide        of nitrogen,     cyanogen, and hydrochloric
acid exert a slight but perceptible absorbent effect.              But in the    case
of coal-gas      the absorptive       action is extremely marked,          the more
refrangible half of the spectrum being cut off by it abruptly.                   The
absorption     exerted by sulphurous         acid is still more powerful and as
sharply defined      ; sulphuretted hydrogen and the vapour of bisulphide
of carbon exhibit       a still more decided absorbent action        ;  the effect of
the terchloride and oxychloride           of phosphorus       is not less   marked.
This absorbent action of these different compounds of sulphur and
phosphorus      is very striking.
    Coal-gas    appears to owe its remarkable             power of arresting the
chemical     rays to the presence of the vapour of benzol and other
heavy hydrocarbons         ;  since the vapour of benzol at 65°, diffused to
saturation through a column of atmospheric air two feet long, exerts
a  still more powerful absorptive         effect than coal-gas.
    On the other hand, the         effect  of  a similar   arrangement, in which
the vapour of ether, of chloroform,           and of oil of turpentine was sub
stituted for that of benzol, gave effects which,              though     perceptible,
were much less marked.             An arbitrary     scale is laid down, by     which
a comparative       estimate of the absorptive power of each compound,
whether     solid, liquid, or gaseous,         may be effected with tolerable
accuracy.
    With   a view    of facilitating the production of        a spectrum on a flat
field, at a uniform distance at all points from the prism, the author
instituted a    series  of experiments, in which       a small metallic speculum

                                       1(54                            [June 19,
was substituted    for the lens of rock-crystal     ; but the loss   of chemical
power in the reflected rays was so considerable, and this loss occurred
so unequally    at different points,     that the method was abandoned.
The results of the photographic         action of light reflected at an angle
of 45° from the polished surface of several of the principal metals is
given.     The reflexion from gold, although            not very intense, was
found to be more uniform in quality than that from any other metal
that was tried.     Burnished lead also       gave very good results.        The
reflexion from silver is singularly        deficient in some portions of the
less refrangible   rays, although     in most other parts the reflexion is
tolerably perfect, except for rays of extremely high refrangibility.
   2. The Electric Spectra        of   the  Metals. — The author proceeds
then to detail his experiments upon the spectra obtained by causing
the sparks caused by the secondary current from the induction-coil
to pass    between electrodes composed of various               elementary sub
stances,   and he gives photographs of the impressions obtained from
collodion negatives of a considerable number of different elementary
bodies.     The spectra were procured by arranging            a quartz-train   in
the manner already described.           Among the elements          so examined
are the following    :—
      Platinum.             Arsenic.                      Copper.
      Palladium.            Tellurium.                    Aluminum.
      Gold.                 Tungsten.                     Cadmium.
      Silver.               Molybdenum.                   Zinc.
      Mercury.              Chromium.                     Magnesium.
      Lead.                 Manganese.                    Sodium.
      Tin.                  Iron.                         Potassium.
      Bismuth.              Cobalt.                     f Graphite,   and
      Antimony.             Nickel.                    \ Gas-coke.
   The commencement of each spectrum in its less refrangible portion
is similar in nearly all cases ; and as it is this portion only which is trans
missible through bisulphide of carbon, this circumstance explains the
similarity of all the spectra procured by the author from different
metals in his earlier experiments, already laid before the British Asso
ciation.   In the  more refrangible parts of the spectrum great and cha
racteristic differences between the results obtained with the different
metals are at once manifest.       In some    cases, as  in those of copper and
nickel, the action is greatly prolonged in the more refrangible extre

1862.]                                 165
mity, whilst the intense and highly characteristic spectrum of magne
sium is much shorter.
    In  many cases metals which are allied in chemical properties ex
hibit   a certain  similarity in their spectra.       This occurs, for example,
with the magnetic metals, iron, cobalt, and nickel, and with the
group embracing bismuth, antimony, and arsenic. The more vola
tile metals exhibit generally the most strongly marked lines.               Cad
mium, for instance, gives two intense groups.              Zinc, two very strong
lines near the less refrangible extremity,          three near the middle, and
four nearly equidistant       lines towards      the termination     of the more
refrangible portion, whilst in the spectrum             of magnesium the che
mical action is almost suddenly            terminated    near the middle     by  a
triple group of very broad and strong lines.
     It will be observed, on examining the photographs of           these spectra
 of the various metals, that the impressions, particularly in the more
 refrangible portions, consist of a double row of dots, running parallel
 with the length of the spectrum, and forming the terminations of
 lines rather than lines themselves, as though the intense ignition of
 the detached particles of metal, necessary to furnish rays capable of
 exciting chemical action, had ceased before the transfer of these par
 ticles to the opposite electrode had been completed.
     If each  electrode be composed of a different metal, the spectrum
 of   each   metal is impressed separately upon the plate, as is evident
 on examining the photographs.
     When alloys are employed         as electrodes, the spectrum exhibited
 is that due to both the metals          ;   but if  the metals made use of are
  approximatively     pure, the spectrum is hardly to be distinguished       from
  that of the      pure metal.      In   the case when       alloys are   used as
  electrodes,   it is not always the more volatile metal         which impresses
 its spectrum       most strongly.     A specimen of brass, for example,
  containing   38 per cent. of zinc, gave a spectrum which could not be
  distinguished     from  that of pure copper, though           an alloy of three
  parts   of gold and    one   of silver    gave a spectrum in    which the lines
  due to silver predominated.
     The author then proceeds to describe a number of experiments
  upon the transmission of sparks between electrodes of different
  metals in a current of several different gases.             The apparatus    em
  ployed consisted of    a glass tube ; into the side an aperture was drilled,
      VOL.  XII.                                                      N

  which could     be closed  by  a plate  of quartz    ;   the ends of the tube
  were closed by ground brass plates, each supporting a pair of brass
  forceps, into which the electrodes were fitted    ;    through the axis of the
  tube a current of each gas was transmitted              at the ordinary    atmo
  spheric pressure.
     Among the     gases thus tried were hydrogen,        protoxide   of nitrogen,
 carbonic acid, carbonic       oxide, olefiant  gas,      marsh-gas,    cyanogen,
 sulphuretted hydrogen, sulphurous acid, nitrogen, and oxygen.                 The
 spectrum obtained from the same metal varied considerably in these
 different media.       In  hydrogen   the intensity of the spectrum was
 greatly   reduced, and the more refrangible          rays were wanting,        but
 no new rays       made   their appearance.     In   carbonic      acid, carbonic
 oxide, olefiant gas, marsh-gas, and cyanogen, the special lines due to
 the   metal    were produced, but in each       a series      of identical lines
 appeared, and these new lines were referable to the carbon                   con
 tained in each of these gases.      Each   gas exhibits special lines       which
 are continued     across  the spectrum, and are never interrupted             like
 those of the metals.
     The author observed that many of these         gases, such as protoxide
 of nitrogen, hydrochloric and sulphurous acid, presented a consider
 able obstacle to the passage of the sparks from the induction-coil.
 X. " On the Long Spectrum of Electric Light."                     By Professor
        George      G. Stokes, M.A., Sec. R.S. &c.              Received     June

                                  (Abstract.)
    The author's researches on fluorescence had led him to perceive
that glass was opaque for the more refrangible invisible rays of the
solar spectrum, and that electric light contained rays of still higher
refrangibility,   which were quite intercepted by glass, but that quartz
transmitted     these  rays freely.   Accordingly he         was led to procure
prisms and a lens of quartz, which, when applied to the examination
of the voltaic arc, or of the discharge of a Leyden jar, by forming a
pure spectrum and receiving it on a highly fluorescent substance,
revealed the existence of rays forming a spectrum no less than six
or eight times as long as the visible spectrum.             This long spectrum,
as formed     by the voltaic arc with copper electrodes,          was exhibited

 at   a  lecture   given   at the Royal Institution        in   1853; but the
 author, for   reasons   he mentioned, did not then further pursue the
 subject.     Having subsequently found that the spark of an induction-
 coil with a Leyden jar in connexion with the secondary terminals
 yielded a spectrum quite bright enough              to work by, he resumed
 the investigation, and examined the spectra exhibited by a variety of
 metals as electrodes, as well as the mode of absorption             of the rays
 of   high   refrangibility by various substances.         The spectra of the
 metals may be viewed at pleasure by means of fluorescence, and the
 mode of absorption of the invisible        rays by a given solution may be
 at  once observed    ; but there are difficulties attending the preparation
 in this way of sufficiently accurate maps of the metallic lines ; and
 the great liability of the rays of high refrangibility to be absorbed
 by impurities     present in very minute        quantity renders the certain
 determination    of the optical character, in this respect, of substances
which    are  only moderately opaque a matter of considerable difficulty.
 Having found that Dr. Miller had           been    engaged independently     at
 the same subject, working by photography,              the author     deemed  it
 unnecessary to attempt a delineation of the metallic lines (for which,
however, he has recently devised a practical method that was found
 to work satisfactorily),    or to examine further the absorption of rays
of high refrangibility by solutions of metallic salts, &c.
    The present paper contains therefore mainly results obtained in
other directions in the same wide field of research. Among the
 metals examined, the author had found aluminium                  the richest in
invisible rays of extreme refrangibility        ; and accordingly aluminium
 electrodes were employed when the deportment of such rays had to
be specially examined.        As the bright aluminium         lines of high re
frangibility do not appear to have been taken by photography, a
drawing of the aluminium spectrum is given, with zinc and cadmium
for comparison.
    The author has also described and figured the mode of absorption
of the invisible rays by solutions of various alkaloids and glucosides.
Bodies of these classes, he finds, are usually intensely opaque, acting on
the invisible spectrum with an intensity comparable to that with which
colouring matters act on the visible.         This intensity of action causes
the effect of minute impurities to disappear, and thereby increases
the value of the characters observed.          It  very often happens that at
                                                                  n  2

some   part or other of the long spectrum a band of absorption,                    or
maximum of opacity, occurs          ;  and the position of this band affords
a highly distinctive character of the substance which produced it.
    Among natural        crystals,  besides    the   previously   known      yellow
uranite, the author found that in adullaria, and felspar generally, a
strong fluorescence is produced under the action of the rays of high
refrangibility,   referable not to impurities,      but to the essential con
stituents   of the crystal.      A particular     variety of fluor-spar       shows
also an interesting feature, though         in this   case referable to an       im
purity, exhibiting       a well-marked      reddish     fluorescence under       the
exclusive influence of rays of the very highest refrangibility.                This
property renders such a crystal a useful instrument of research.
    With  some metals broad,       slightly convex electrodes      were found to
have a great advantage over wires, exhibiting              the invisible   lines far
more    strongly,    while    with    some   metals    the difference     was    not
great.
    The blue negative light formed when the jar is removed, and the
electrodes are close together, was found to be exceedingly rich in
invisible   rays, especially     invisible   rays of moderate refrangibility.
These exhibited       lines independent      of the electrodes, and therefore
referable to the air.      This blue light     has a very appreciable duration,
and is formed by what the author calls an arc discharge.
    The paper concludes with some speculations as to the cause of the
superiority of broad electrodes, and of the heating of the negative
electrode.

    When    a plane-polarized      beam    of light is incident on a polished
 surface at a    certain angle of incidence, and polarized in a certain
azimuth, the reflected beam of light is circularly polarized.
    The tangent of this angle of incidence is called by the author the
 Coefficient of Refraction, and upon it appears to depend the brilliancy
 of a polished surface.

    The determination of the optical constants of               these   substances
leads to many interesting          conclusions ; among which the following
may be stated       : —
    1.  That transparent bodies, as well as metals, possess a coefficient
of reflexion, which is sometimes very sensible, although there are
bodies in which it is very small.
    2. That Silver is the only substance which possesses the qualities
 of brilliancy and lustre, represented by the coefficients of refraction
and reflexion, in a high degree.
   3.   Of the metals which        have  high brilliancy and little lustre may
be named Mercury, Palladium, Zinc, and Iron.
   4. Of the metals which have high lustre and little brilliancy
there are only two, Gold and Copper.

the optical constants of the alloys of copper and zinc, which cannot
be given in an abstract.
    6.  In the details of the several experiments, the author calls atten
tion to several remarkable laws, or indications of laws, which appear
to him to require some notice from theorists.
    a. When the azimuth of the incident beam is less than the circular
limit, the axis major of the reflected ellipse, at the principal incidence,
lies in the plane of incidence ; but when the azimuth is greater than
the circular   limit, it is perpendicular   to the plane of incidence, and
as the incidence varies, the axis major twice approaches to a     minimum
distance from that plane.
    b. There appears to the author to be some indication       in the expe
riments on metals, that the quantity known to theorists           as  (j)   is
not a function of the incidence only      ; a conclusion which,  if  correct,
would require the intervention of a third wave suppressed, or some
such theoretical supposition, to account for it.
XII. " On      the Loess    of the Valleys of the South of England and
        of the Somme and the Seine."             By Joseph Prestwich,
        Esq., F.R.S.      Received June 19, 1862.
                                  (Abstract.)
    In this paper the author takes up and      discusses a point connected
 with the former inquiry, but postponed in the paper he read before
 the Royal Society in March last, a recent visit to France having led
 him to form     a conclusion    with regard to the origin of the Loess
 sooner than he then expected.
    On that occasion he referred the loam and brick-earth, with land
 and freshwater shells, which occurs in the valleys and on many of the
 hills in the South of England and North of France, to temporary in
 undations of the old rivers.      On the present occasion he shows that
 this deposit is intimately     connected with the origin of the river-
 valleys and with the fluviatile high- and low-level gravels described in
his last paper.

 1862.]                                         171
      Reference is first made to the Loess of the valley of the Rhine,
 and the author accepts Sir Charles Lyell's explanation that                                     it is the
 result of a river-deposit         ;    but   he does not agree            in the explanation          as
 to the mode which led to the actual results, so far as the present
 district is concerned.
      One difficulty in understanding             the spread of the loess in England
 and France has always heen the greatly different levels on which it
occurs, being present in the bottom of the valleys, and occurring                                      on
ground        1 00,    200, and 300 feet          higher.              This evidently         places    it
 beyond the reach of inundations with the valleys formed as they are
 at present, and the prior origin of which                               the common            covering
 of   loess    might lead    one       at first to infer.               But   if,   instead of start
ing at the present low levels, the valleys be taken at the level the
author showed them to have had at the period of the upper high-
level gravels,  will give base for the original river-levels of 00 to
                      it               a                                                          1
 200 feet above the existing valleys, and therefore                           it     will reduce the
difference of level of the higher deposits of loess to be accounted for,
to 100 or 150 feet.           In       many cases      it    is   less, but   it    is   still consider
able.     It   thus brings the whole of the loess within the possible range
of inundations of the old Post-pliocene                       rivers at different periods of
their    age   ;   the higher beds of loess having been                             deposited during
floods at an early period,              and before the excavation of the present
river-valleys,        and the lower beds having been deposited after the ex
cavation of the valley, and while some of the old meteorological con
ditions still prevailed.
   The author shows that the loess                    is,   in fact, like the high- and low-
level gravels, always connected with river-valleys, although                                it   extends
much beyond the limits of these beds, rising to much higher levels,
and extending far beyond their limits.                        He then shows that in the
valley of the Somme, the difference between the highest levels of the
loess and the upper gravels thus becomes reduced to 60 or 80 feet                                      ;
in the Oise, to apparently                 about 50 feet          ;    in the Seine valley, to
about 120 to 150 feet        ;     and in the Bresle valley to 70 feet.
  The     loess       contains the same mammalian                       remains and the same
species   of land mollusca             as the gravels.                Of freshwater mollusca           it
contains hardly any.
   Notwithstanding the extension of the loess over the higher grounds
flanking the river-valleys, still such grounds are always bounded                                      by

higher hills, which seem to have formed barriers to its further spread.
It   seems, therefore, that although                 the connexion of these several and
                             it is,
distinct deposits                     owing to their irregular        and wide spread, not
always apparent,                      is   probable that they are      related to the same
phenomena, and that they present two phases                             of   causes   having     a
common aud contemporaneous origin.
     In all    rivers subject to floods, three forms of sediment will be de
posited: first, gravel and shingle in the more direct channel; secondly,
sand in the more sheltered places                   ;   thirdly, fine silt where the flood-
waters are at rest out of the direct channel.
     In such manner the author conceives the high- and low-level
gravels and the loess of all the levels to have been formed.

low levels        ;   like, in fact, the rivers in arctic regions, but to             a    greater
extent.           Such       conditions         show their    great    erosive    power,      and
furnish the evidence wanting                      on the former       occasion to prove that
such greater             power had existed.               Though   a   greater rainfall       was
inferred from other causes, this more direct evidence was wanting.
   The author mentions his discovery, on the occasion of his last visit
to Paris, of freshwater shells of the genera Limneus and Valvata at
two places in the low-level gravels of Paris, and again at Rouen.                              He
also gives        a   section of some remarkable contortions,                which he refers

    The fluviatile origin of the different gravels,   as well as the greater
action of ice at the higher levels, is therefore confirmed,    as is also the
suggestion that the volume of water carried down at the period in ques
tion by the rivers was infinitely greater than it now is.       At the   same
time the view now given both explains the origin of the loess,        so long
an unsettled problem, and harmonizes with the hypothesis               before
advanced in explanation of the accompanying general phenomena.
XIII. " On      the Simultaneous        Distribution of Heat throughout
        superficial parts of the Earth."        By Professor H. G. Hen-
        nessy, F.R.S.       Received June 19, 1862.
                                    (Abstract.)
    The principal object of this memoir is to develope the laws of the
distribution of temperature in the portion of the atmosphere in con
tact with the earth, and to point out the connexion between the phe
nomena of aerial temperature and those of soil and oceanic tempera
ture.     The author maintains that hitherto no perfect physical repre
 sentation of the distribution of heat over the earth's surface has
 been obtained.       Humboldt's luminous method of representing the
 distribution of mean temperatures necessarily presents us with the
 temperatures of places at those hours of local time when the tempe
 rature happens to be equal to that of the entire day.       But such hours
 occur at different places not at the same moment of absolute time, and
 therefore the isothermal     lines traced by the aid of their results alone,
 are not   true isothermal      lines in the same sense as we understand
 an isothermal    line or surface within crystals, or other definite geo
 metrical solids which have been recently the subjects of thermological
 inquiry.
    The distribution    of sunshine at the outer limits of the atmosphere
 and at its base is   first considered, and the nearly circular shape of
 the lines of equal sunshine is pointed out.        After showing the con
 nexion between these lines and the simultaneous isothermals for the
 air, land, and water, the author proceeds to more particularly discuss
 the aero thermal lines.     As the term isothermal line   has become     uni
 versal in the sense of a line joining places possessing the same mean
 temperatures, the author proposes to designate the true lines of si

                                       174                             [June     19,
multaneous equal temperature as synthermal lines.               If any    number
of places have the same temperature at a given hour corresponding
to the mean time of any one meridian, these places will be synthermal,
and a line joining them will be a synthermal line.           For this purpose
the meridian of Greenwich         has been selected,     and a series     of syn
thermal    Tables   have been      calculated    for different     places    corre
sponding to the Greenwich          hours.    For the construction        of   these
Tables, the hourly observations of temperature made at the British
Home and Colonial Observatories, the observations of Russia, Austria,
Prussia, and Central Europe, as well as those of the United States,
have been employed.         The few    series   of hourly observations made
by Arctic and African travellers have       been also applied    ;  and in addi
tion to the Tables thus directly constructed, others have been deduced
by interpolation    for stations whose geographical         position rendered
it desirable to bring them into the general view of temperature-dis
tribution.   All  results expressed in Centigrade and Reaumur degrees
have been reduced to the Fahrenheit           scale.  A   fresh set of Tables
has been formed from those corresponding to local time, with hours
corresponding to the meridian at Greenwich.
    The synthermal Tables thus obtained show, as might be a priori
expected, still greater differences between the temperatures of places
in the same parallels of latitude than the Tables of mean temperature.
Thus Rome and Tiflis differ in latitude by only 13', and the mean
temperature of Rome is 50,1 in excess of that of Tiflis.               At 8 a.m.
Greenwich time, they are synthermal,           both possessing the tempera
ture of 59°- 1, while at  7  a.m. Tiflis surpasses Rome by 0o-6, and at all
other times besides these Rome surpasses Tiflis.               At    4 a.m.     this
excess amounts to 9°-5.         Although Pekin is situated in the isother
mal line which passes     close to the Isle of Wight, it is synthermal at
5  a.m. (Greenwich) to some place 6° warmer than Rome, and pro
bably therefore on the north coast of Africa, and is synthermal
with a point north      of the     Orkneys at between        8   and    9   in the
evening.    Similar comparisons of distant places in both hemispheres
lead to similar results.      It appears that during certain periods of the
day, alternately hot and cold spaces exist in the interior of the con
tinents compared to the surrounding         oceans.    In the southern hemi
sphere the rising of synthermal         temperatures appears to be a little
inferior to what it  is in the northern,     if we compare together stations

 1862.]                                  175
with nearly corresponding       latitudes      and differences of longitude in
both hemispheres.
     From the results tabulated in his synthermal Tables, the author has
projected on an equatorial map of the world, the synthermal lines of
4 a.m. and 2 p.m. Greenwich         time.      This map clearly exhibits the
risings of the synthermals, and the existence of spaces of maximum
temperature.      The synthermals in both hemispheres rise towards the
poles opposite these spaces, and converge towards the space of mini
 mum tropical temperature.        In   islands circumstanced like the British
 Isles, the synthermals may be represented by two systems of closed
 curves, one for the day with an interior space of maximum tempera
ture, and the other for the night with an interior space of minimum
 temperature.     These groups would           be connected somewhat      in the
way of the magnetic curves delineated by Gauss in his Theory                   of
 Terrestrial   Magnetism     (Taylor's Scientific        Memoirs,  vii.).    The
shapes of these groups would closely resemble the isothermals already
published by the author*, and which, from the small differences of
longitude in our islands, may be conceived to represent very closely
the synthermals of 9 a.m. and 8 p.m.
     The probable shapes of the lines of equal soil temperature, or syn-
geothennals as the author calls them, are next considered ; and it is
shown that they must not only present far more remarkable                  devia
tions from equatorial parallelism than the synaerothermals, but also
that their diurnal rising must be very considerable.
     The author points to the connexion between some of his results
and the diurnal law of the wind force discovered by Mr. Osier ; and
he also shows how the abnormal regressions of temperature in the
latter months of spring may be partly explained by the circumstance
that, although     the isothermals      of mean temperature during         these
months do not deviate widely from equatorial parallelism, the syn
thermals not only swing to a greater extent than during most              of the
other months of the year, but that they          are also more closely crowded
together.
    These results are most strikingly developed during the month of May.

XIV. "On           the Differential      Coefficients and Determinants           of
       Lines,      and   their    application    to Analytical     Mechanics."
       By A. CohEN/Esq.              Communicated by Professor Stokes,
       Sec. R.S.        Received May 8, 1862.
                                    (Abstract.)
    1. The object of this paper is to develope a new method of proving
and extending the formulae of analytical mechanics, and at the same
time to show how the different steps themselves, in the analytical work
by which those formulae are generally arrived at, exactly correspond to
mechanical or geometrical facts, just as it is shown in modern geo
metry that the various equations of analytical geometry are capable
of important interpretation.
    2.  If  OA and OB       be two straight lines drawn from the        origin O,
then for well-known reasons          AB may    be called
                                                         " the  complete differ
ence" of      OA    and OB, and may be denoted by (OB)          —            Simi
                                                                   (OA).
larly,  if OA     and OB represent two successive states of a variable line
 P  at times t and t + at, then the line whose direction is the limiting
                                                                     AB
                                                                     —
 direction    of AB, and whose magnitude is the limit of                 , will  be
                                                                      at
 called  " the complete     differential coefficient" of P, and will be denoted
by D,(P).
    3.  It  is easy to see that the line      which represents, in magnitude
 and direction, a particle's velocity is the complete differential coeffi
 cient of the particle's radius vector, and that, similarly, the line repre
 senting the particle's acceleration is the complete differential           coeffi
cient of the line representing the velocity, and is therefore the second
 differential coefficient of the radius vector.
    In  this case, therefore, Kinematics may be considered as the cal
culus of the first and second differential coefficients of lines.
    4. The following is the fundamental           theorem concerning the dif
ferential coefficients of lines      : the differential  coefficient of a line is
compounded of what would be the differential coefficient            if the length
alone varied, and of what would be the differential coefficient             if  the
direction     alone varied.      Supposing   the line to move in one and the
same plane,      it is easy to deduce from     that theorem the expression for
a line's differential      coefficient, and by applying to the component

 1862.]                                 177
parts    of that expression the      same theorem again, we arrive at the
elements of which a line's second differential coefficient is composed.
Moreover,     since those first and second    differential coefficients are the
representatives of a particle's velocity and acceleration, we are led by
these investigations at once to all the analytical formulae for motion
in one plane relatively to moving          axes,    and are at the same time
enabled to give to those formulae a very simple interpretation.
    5.  I  conclude the first chapter by indicating         how all the results
thus obtained may       be made to flow from the ordinary mode            of repre
senting lines by means of imaginary quantities.                For instance, by
differentiating    the expression r&J~-i twice successively, we obtain
 which expression is evidently compounded of the radial and trans
 versal accelerations of a particle.
     6. On passing to the general      case of  a line moving     in  space, a new
 conception has to be introduced      —one,   however, which presents itself,
 more or less disguised, in almost all the ordinary formulae of statics and
 dynamics.       Let OA and OB be two straight lines ; draw OD perpen
 dicular to and equal to twice the area of the triangle AOB ; then OD
 may    be called "the determinant"      of OA and OB, inasmuch          as its pro
 jections on three   axes  of coordinates  are the simplest determinants that
  can be found with the coordinate projections of O A and         OB. Moreover,
  if OD    be drawn   in such  a direction that to an eye      looking along DO
  the rotation from     OA to OB appears a       positive rotation, OD will be
  called the determinant of OA to OB, and may              be denoted by
                                 det (OA, OB).
      7. The connexion of the determinant, as above              defined, with the
  axis of a couple and with statics in general is self-evident.           Nor is its
   connexion with dynamics less intimate         ;  for if OA   represent in mag
   nitude and direction the angular velocity with which, and the instan
   taneous axis about which, OB is revolving at time t, then the linear
   velocity of a particle at B, the extremity of OB, is represented in
   magnitude and direction by det       (OA, OB).
      8. Having thus defined the determinants             of lines,   I  proceed to
   prove a few fundamental        propositions     concerning    them, which will
   often be found very useful in abbreviating and giving a clear meaning
   to complicated analytical work.        Moreover, those propositions indi

                                                        178                                         [June 19,
cate a remarkable                symbolical                    (P, Q) and
                                                      resemblance between det
the product PQ. For instance, it may be proved that if P, P', Q be
any three straight lines, then the resultant of det (P, Q) and det (P', Q)
is det      (P+P', Q),           where     P+P'            denotes the resultant                  or complete
sum       of P and P'.
     Again, it may         be shown that the complete differential coefficient                                  of
det (P, Q) is exactly similar                    in form         to the differential            coefficient of
the product P, Q.
     9.    Furnished       with these propositions,                          it is    easy to extend the
formulae of the first chapter to lines moving in space of three dimen
sions.
   Let A denote the instantaneous axis about which, and the angular
velocity with which, a line R, whose length at time t is r, revolves,
then the complete differential                        coefficient of          R   is the resultant of —
in the direction of R, and the determinant of A                                      to   R, or
                          D(    (R) =
                                         (J      1|   to
                                                           R)
                                                                  +det (A, R).
This is the fundamental proposition concerning the differential coeffi
cient of a line. Applying it to the component parts of the last for
mula, we obtain a somewhat remarkable expression for the second
differential          coefficient of a line, and therefore also for a particle's
acceleration.            That expression easily leads to the formulae for the
acceleration of a particle relatively to any moving axes, and also to a
very simple proof of Corioli's beautiful theorem concerning relative
motion.          The      use    of this method is illustrated by showing how it
enables us at once              to write down the equations for the motion of the
simple pendulum, taking the earth's rotation into account.
     10.   I   now pass to the dynamics of a rigid body.
     Compounding            the momenta of the different particles of a body as
if   they were forces, they may be reduced to a single momentum at O
and a couple of momenta.                     The former                 I   call the body's single mo
mentum, and denote it by                 U   ;    the latter        I       call the body's momentum
couple, and denote
                                 it,   or rather denote its axis, by                       H.      If now   the
external forces acting on the body be similarly reduced to                                          a   force   P
at O, and             couple whose axis          is   G,   it   may be shown that D' Alembert's
               is a   contained in the proposition                  " that        P   and    G    are respect
principle
ively the complete differential coefficients of                               U   and     H."

     11.    U H, the body's single momentum and momentum couple,
                and
may be found without difficulty in the ordinary way.     In the case of
a rigid body moving about a fixed point O, if A, B, C be the moments
of inertia, and wz, wy, ux be the angular velocities of rotation about
the principal         axes O^        O    ,   Oz, then         H is the resultant of Aw„ Bay
C«ir.       Let then A denote the instantaneous axis and angular velocity
of rotation, then D, (H)                      is,
                             by one of our fundamental theorems,
equivalent to det (A, H), together with

and by D'Alembert's principle D,                               (H)   is   the axis of the resultant
couple formed by transferring                       to   O     all the external forces.
       The last theorem includes Euler's equations, and the different
     12.
extensions which those have of late received.     have attempted to           I
show that, in solving mechanical problems, the above theorem will be
generally found more useful than any of those equations.                                       Moreover,
it   serves to explain          the geometrical reason, independently                           of Euler's
equations, why the results are so much simplified in the case of two
of the principal moments of inertia being equal to                                  one another.
     13.    In order to illustrate how advantageously and how completely
the most complicated                 formulae of dynamics may be interpreted,                          I
have given       a           proof of Euler's equations, and have
                      direct analytical
then shown that the consideration of each step of the analytical
work leads to         an extremely short demonstration                         of the   same equations
by means of the theory of the differential coefficients and determinants
of lines.

lished in the Transactions   of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, entitled
" On     the Application of the Theory of Probabilities to the Question
of the Combination of Testimonies                  or Judgments."                   The latter con
tains also the foundations                 of the general analytical                 theory of the
method.  But the complete development of that theory is attended
with mathematical difficulties which I have only just succeeded in
overcoming.
   A   correspondence on the subject                   between       Mr. Cayley and myself
also appears in the current                 (May) Number of the 'Philosophical
Magazine,'     and     I   owe   it   to   Mr. Cayley that these further researches,
of the results of which                an account           will here   be given, were under
taken.
   I   shall make but few remarks here upon the                             it   priori grounds of
the method.       Generally it may be said that the solution of a question
in the Theory of Probabilities                depends upon the possibility                    of men
tally constructing the problem from hypotheses which appear, whether
as a consequence of our knowledge or as a consequence of our igno
rance, to be simple and independent.                         When the data           are the proba
bilities of simple events, and no conditions are added, the problem is
in theory sufficiently easy, the sole difficulty consisting in the calcu
lation of complex combinations.      But when the data are the proba
bilities    of compound          events,      or when the events                  are connected by
absolute conditions expressible in logical propositions,                             or when both
these circumstances are present, the                difficulty of the required mental
construction becomes greater.                  If we assume the independence of the
simple events from which the compound                              events        according    to their
expression in language are formed, we meet, first, the difficulty that
the number of equations thus formed may be greater or less than
that which is requisite to obtain a solution                   ;   and, secondly, the far more
fundamental      difficulty that the conditions under which the solution,
supposing      it to       be obtained, is analytically              valid may not coincide
with the conditions under which the data                             are possible.           It   seems
indeed likely — at any rate the evidence of particular examples points
uniformly to the conclusion — that any attempts to construct the pro
blem upon hypotheses which, while not involved in the actual data are
of the     same nature as those data             ('.   e.   which might conceivably have
resulted as facts of observation from the same experience from which

 the data were derived), limit the problem, and lead                                            to solutions
 which      are    analytically           valid under conditions               narrower         than those
 under which the data                    are possible.
       But the         of mathematical logic enable us, without any
                   processes
 addition to the actual data, to effect the required construction of the
 problem formally— formally                           because     the hypotheses which are re
 garded     as ultimate and independent                         in that construction            refer to an
 ideal      of things.
          state         The nature of the conceptions employed, and
 their connexion with the conceptions involved in the actual statement
of      the problem, are discussed in the paper.                               It   is sufficient to say
here that, whatever difficulty there may                             be   in   these conceptions as
conceptions,        there is nothing                  arbitrary in the formal procedure of
thought with which they are                           connected.   The probabilities of the
ideal events enter as auxiliary quantities into the process of solution,
and disappear by elimination                           from the final result, but they are
throughout treated                 as probabilities,            and combined according to the
laws of probabilities.   I will only say here that the difficulty which
has been felt in the conception of the ideal events appears to me to
arise from        a misdirected attempt to conceive those events by means
of    the events in the statement of the problem                               — the    true order       of
thought being that the events in the statement of the problem are,
not indeed in their material character, but as subjects of probability
and     of relations affecting probability, to                       be conceived by means               of
the ideal    events.
      Now the probabilities which constitute the actual data will in                                 gene

actual experience.              Those conditions admit of mathematical expres
sion.
     Generally,    if the events in the data

a system    of inferior limits expressed by linear functions of the other
quantities, and a system of superior limits also so expressed.
  Thus,     if A, B, C      represent any simple events, and                            if pt   represent
the probability of the concurrence of B and C,                       p2      that of the concur
rence of C and        A, p3 that of the concurrence of A and B, then plt pv ps
must, in order that they may be derived from experience, satisfy the
conditions
as well as the conditions implied in their being positive proper frac
tions.
   On the other hand, the ideal          events being by hypothesis simple and
independent,          the auxiliary   quantities which represent their proba
bilities will be subject to no other conditionpriori than that of    a
being positive proper fractions — to no other condition h priori,
because    their actual values are determined in the process of solution.
   Now the most general results of the analytical investigation are —
   1st. That the auxiliary quantities representing the probabilities of
the ideal events admit of determination                         as positive proper fractions,
and, further, of a single definite determination as such, precisely when
the original data supply the conditions of a possible experience.
   2ndly. That as a consequence of this the probability sought will
always lie within such limits as it would have had if determined by
actual observation from the same experience as the data.
   The proof of         these propositions        rests upon certain general theorems
relating to the solution of a class of simultaneous algebraic equations,
 and, auxiliary to this, to the properties of afunctional determinant.
   The following          are the principal       of those theorems                 :   —
   1st.    If     the elements of any symmetrical                    determinant                 are all   of
 them linear homogeneous functions of certain quantities a,, a                                             aT
 — if the    coefficients of these quantities in the terms on the principal
 diagonal of the determinant are all positive — and                           if,   lastly, the coeffi
 cients of any of these quantities            in      any row of elements are propor
 tional to the corresponding           coefficients             of the    same quantity              in any

grounds of the method, it is a perfect method of interpolation.           The
analytical investigation, however, shows that, for the mere purpose          of
interpolation, the process might be modified by altering the coefficients
of V without affecting its form     ; but it indicates at the same time that
such modifications have no definite analogy with that process by which
weight is assigned to astronomical observations, and, from their arbi
trary character, lead to results which cannot properly be regarded as
expressions of probability in any sense.

    In this     communication         the author has described two additional
kinds of electro-deposited antimony possessing the property of evol
ving heat ; one of them is obtained from a solution of bromide, and
the other from a solution of iodide of antimony                ;    there is also given
additional information            respecting the peculiar heating-antimony               ob
tained from the aqueous terchloride.
    The following        is a   brief statement and comparison of            some    of the
properties  of the three kinds of thermically active antimony.    The
specific gravity of the chloride deposit is 5-8, the bromide one 5-44,
and the one from the iodide 5-25.                  The amount of heat evolved is
greatest with the one from the chloride               solution, and least with that
from the iodide      ;   the former        all its heat at 60° Fahr., by
                                        evolves
contact with a      red-hot wire, the bromide one at 280° Fahr., whilst
the iodide      one requires a temperature          of 340° Fahr.     ;    the latter also
acquires a reddish-brown            colour by exposure to solar light.
    The chloride deposit contains about              6*3 per cent.    of saline matter,
the bromide one about 20, and the one from the iodide liquid about
22-2.  The quantities deposited by a single equivalent of zinc were
about 42-5 in the chloride, 50 in the bromide, and 51 in the iodide
solution.
   The explanation proposed of their formation                is,

                   by                                                          Received
         June 14, 1862.
    The following facts relative to sulphur in what                  is   called purified
coal-gas, are additional to those already submitted to the Royal So
ciety.

                                           186                          [June 19.
    When    I  first made known the action of heated lime upon coal-gas,
chemists accounted for the phenomena observed by two assumptions :
— I. That     the sulphur-compound          decomposed was free bisulphide      of
carbon.      II. That    the decomposition was due to a reaction between
water and bisulphide according to the following equation             :
                          CS2  + 2HO=2HS + CO,.
 It was easy to show that these assumptions were erroneous,               but ex
 ceedingly difficult to demonstrate the truth.
    That the sulphur in       gas does not usually exist as free bisulphide     of
 carbon is proved thus.
    Gas which has been purified at the gas-works by lime, and which
 contains    20 or 30 grains        of sulphur in 100 cubic feet, may be
passed for a considerable time through a tube containing              cold slaked
lime without producing discoloration ; but           if the same gas be charged
 with a minute quantity of bisulphide-of-carbon               vapour and passed
through the       same lime-tube, the lime becomes        yellow and green from
 decomposition of the bisulphide of carbon.
    If instead      of passing the   gas  through lime it be passed through
triethylphosphine,        the beautiful red crystals which this base gives
with bisulphide of carbon are not formed ; but if the base be dissolved
in alcohol or ether, and the gas passed through this solution, the red
crystals are formed,        as  Dr. Hofmann first proved.         The alcohol or
ether dissolves out the bisulphide of carbon from the hydrocarbon
compounds of which it forms a part            ; and when it is thus dissolved   it
reacts with triethylphosphine.
    Naphthalin, benzole, and other fluid hydrocarbons condensed from
purified gas yield sulphide of hydrogen and other sulphuretted com
 pounds    by simple distillation,        yet these do not produce the well-
known red crystals with triethylphosphine.             They may, moreover, be
digested for weeks in an         alkaline solution of oxide of lead without
producing any sulphide of lead.             Under similar treatment bisulphide
of carbon yields hydrosulphocarbonate            and sulphide of lead in a few
hours.
    If the sulphuretted        fluid hydrocarbons      condensed from     gas  be
mixed with ammoniacal alcohol and heated, and an alcoholic solu
tion of acetate of lead be then added, a black precipitate is formed
after some time, which evolves           sulphide  of hydrogen upon addition
of  an acid.       In this  case   neither hydrosulphocarbonate nor hydro

  1862.]                                  187
  sulphocyanide of ammonia is formed          ; yet it is well known that both
 are formed when bisulphide of carbon is added to ammoniacal alcohol.
 The erroneous view of the action of heated hydrate of lime upon the
 sulphur-compounds in gas arose, I think, from the generally received
 opinion that the blackening of lead-salts by a gas is a proof that that
 gas is sulphide of hydrogen—joined to the fact that sulphide of hy
 drogen is one of the compounds produced by the action of the heated
 lime.    If the sulphide      of hydrogen      had been    separated from the
 mixture of   gaseous   compounds       produced, the truth would have been
 apparent ; but as,   I  believe,   all experimenters have failed to separate
 them, the subject was obscure.            After having failed in many pro
 cesses devised by myself and suggested          by others,  I  at last   removed
 the sulphide of hydrogen, and showed that the blackening of lead-
 salts is no proof of the presence of sulphide of hydrogen.              Ordinary
 purified gas was passed over heated hydrate of lime, then through a
 considerable quantity of well-washed hydrated peroxide of iron, over
 lead-paper, and subsequently through moist slaked lime.                 The per
 oxide of iron was slightly blackened, and        withdrew every trace of sul
 phide of hydrogen : the lead-paper became black, and the slaked
 lime yellow.     This yellow lime gave a primrose-coloured solution
 with water, which precipitated lead- and silver-salts brownish red,
 thus showing the presence of impure hydrosulphocarbonate of lime.
    To  be certain of the    absence    of sulphide of hydrogen,     some    of the
 yellow lime was treated with hydrochloric acid, and the gases evolved
 thereby were conducted into a solution of potash.             The potash solu
 tion gave no reaction with nitroprusside of sodium, showing the
 absence of sulphide of hydrogen, and when boiled with nitric acid
 gave no precipitate with a salt of baryta.
    The hydrochloric solution of the lime contained               a sulphur-salt,
which was obtained       as sulphate     of lime when nitric acid     was added
and the whole was boiled.
    The blackening    of the lead-paper in this      case could not be due to
sulphide of hydrogen, as that compound was absent.                Nor  I  think is
it due to the hydrosulphocarbonic            acid which passed over, and in
contact with, the lead-paper, and was arrested by the lime.               The red
compound which this acid produces with lead-salts is said to turn
black rapidly ; and the red compound produced by a lead salt, and
those   of Berzelius and      Zeise,   undoubtedly   does so blacken,      as also

                                        188                                [June 19,
 does that produced by a salt        of lead and an alkaline peutasulphide.
 I have, however, obtained a       red lead-salt by the reaction of crystal
lized hydrosulphocarbonate         of lime and basic       acetate   of lead, which
 remains red after drying in the air at ordinary temperatures and ex
 posure for weeks to the free atmosphere.             I  therefore conclude that
 the blackening     of the lead-paper in the        above case was not due          to
 hydrosulphocarbonic        acid, but to some       unknown        or   unsuspected
 compound.
    In  order to understand this matter fully,        I  commenced some inves
tigations   into   the reactions of bisulphide         of carbon with metallic
 oxides and other compounds,           a portion     of which      I  have now the
pleasure of submitting.
    Red Crystallized       Lime-Salt.   — Slaked      lime and       bisulphide     of
carbon are mixed in a close vessel, and allowed to stand for three or
 four days.      The lime at first     becomes     of   a pale primrose-colour,
which gradually deepens to a fine lemon-yellow.               Water added      to the
yellow lime gives a solution of a gold-colour,           which precipitates salts
 of lead and silver reddish brown, and salts of mercury brown.                 These
precipitates become black upon standing a short time.                  If the yellow
 solution be allowed to remain for a few days in contact             with the lime,
crystals   are   formed which will be very small,             and so distributed
 through the lime as merely to give it a fine salmon-colour.
    This lime-salt is of    a bright ruby colour, and by the following pro
cess  it may   be  obtained in beautiful crystals.         Freshly slaked lime is
to be mixed with so much water that, when stirred,                it will aggregate
into small lumps about the        size of peas. These lumps         are dried upon
a sand-bath     till they  are hard, and    will bear handling without pro
ducing    powder.      The lumps (quite free from dust) are placed in
tubes not more      than an inch in diameter. When the lime is cold, bi
sulphide of carbon is poured upon it in sufficient quantity to saturate
the lime, and leave a few drops in each tube.              The tubes     are corked,
and allowed to stand for three or four days.             Water is then poured in
carefully, so as     not to remove any powder from the lumps of lime,
and the tubes are closed and allowed to stand as long as the crystals
increase in size.     To obtain the crystals, the mother-liquor is poured
off, the mass of lime, &c. is dried at ordinary temperatures, and the
crystals are picked out.        For  success,  it is absolutely necessary that
the lime should      be in lumps, the vessel in which the reaction takes

place of small diameter, and that undecomposed bisulphide                  of carbon
be present.
     Crystals     so prepared   appear to be perfectly permanent         ;   they do
not undergo alteration from several weeks' exposure to atmospheric
changes.        I  have not yet obtained them free from adhering lime, as
all acids which will dissolve the lime decompose the crystals.                  They
are soluble in water, but cannot be recrystallized from their solution.
All    the solutions    I have yet tried decomposed without           crystallizing.
Other      processes   have equally failed to furnish a salt which can be ob
tained dry and pure        ; and I  am therefore unable at present to         furnish
reliable concurrent analyses which will establish its formula.
     I  have not ventured an explanation of the reaction, because                I am
not yet acquainted with the compounds produced and their relative
proportion. To ascertain whether an explanation based upon a reaction
between the elements of water and bisulphide               of carbon was tenable,
I caused      caustic lime to be heated to whiteness in a platinum crucible
for two hours, and cooled out of contact with air.                When cold, this
anhydrous lime was saturated with dry bisulphide of carbon ; and in
a short time the lime became of a greenish-yellow colour, showing the
progress       of  a reaction  between the dry lime and the bisulphide              of
 carbon.
     Some of the reactions of this salt are remarkable           ;  and more than
 one will exhibit the liability to error from the use of any but the most
 perfectly crystalline, dry, and clean specimens.             Baryta-water      added
 in   excess throws down from an aqueous solution             of the pure salt an
 amorphous, red, insoluble         precipitate  quite as brilliant in colour as
 vermilion.        If this be washed directly after precipitation,       the colour
 is retained for a considerable period       ; but  if left in the mother-liquor,
 it soon darkens.         The washed salt dries    a brickdust     red.
     If,  instead of the perfectly pure lime-salt, a solution of the salmon-
 coloured compound, which is formed when the salt is prepared in
  large vessels     and with powdery lime, be taken, a brownish-yellow
 crystalline      double salt of baryta and lime is formed, which is very
 soluble in water.
     Nitrate of baryta gives lemon-yellow crystals in a red-brown mother-
  liquor with solution of the salmon-coloured mass, but an amorphous
  dirty grey precipitate in a yellowish mother-liquor with solution of
  the pure salt.

     As  soon as a quantity   of the latter   can be prepared,      I hope to iso
 late the acid.
     Salts of the oxides of barium, magnesium, strontium,             silver, zinc,
 manganese, and chromium have been prepared by the direct action                  of
 bisulphide   of carbon.      Some of these      differ  considerably from the
 salts prepared by Berzelius by the action of the bisulphide of carbon
 upon the sulphides of the metals.         The process which furnishes the
 lime-salt well crystallized will be   tried with other compounds, and the
 results submitted to the Society.
    A  very offensive suffocating gas is evolved during the decomposi
 tion of bisulphide of carbon by lime, which is injurious,             if  not poi
 sonous   ; and having suffered severely from breathing           this and other
 noxious compounds derived from the same source,             I think it right to
 call attention to it.     I have formed a gas         of similar properties by
passing bisulphide      of carbon and hydrogen together through heated
lime, and should not be surprised if it prove to be the long-sought
 simple sulphide of carbon.
    Slightly ammoniacal alcohol breathed from            a cloth   appears to be
the best restorative for the severe depression caused by respiring the
offensive gases and vapours above named.
XX. " On       the Geometrical Isomorphism of            Crystals."         By the
        Rev.  W. Mitchell.         Communicated by Dr. Frankland.
        Received   June 12, 1862.
    In  a paper
                 " On   the Geometrical     Isomorphism      of Crystals," pub
lished in the Philosophical      Transactions     for 1857, by    H.  J.    Brooke,
F.R.S., it    was   shown that all the substances crystallizing              in the
various forms of the pyramidal          and rhombohedral         systems might
be regarded to be as isomorphous          as those belonging       to the cubical
system .
    This isomorphism      was shown by so      taking the arbitrary primitive
pyramid of the one      system, or the rhomboid of the other, as to bring
these forms nearly isomorphous       for every substance in the one system
or the other.     In  this way tables were formed showing that the same
notation for any form would be not strictly isomorphous,              but plesio-
morphous for any other form of another substance bearing the same
notation.

 1862.]                                  191
     It is the  object of the present paper to show that not only the forms
of the pyramidal and rhombohedral          systems,   but also those of the pris
matic, are as strictly isomorphous          as those    of the cubical      system.
This is effected by demonstrating all the forms of these three systems
to be but partial developments of the cubical system.                Consequently
every form can be indicated by the symbols of the cubical system.
In other        words, instead of having      distinct    axes    and   parameters
for each system, and for every substance in that system, all are
referred to the rectangular axes and equal parameters of the cubical
system.
     The pyramidal system       is regarded as a tritohedral       development of
the cubical       system, the faces so developed being all symmetrically
taken with respect to one of the cubical            axes.    Thus, adopting the
notation for the cubical system in             the last edition of Phillips's
 '
    Mineralogy,' the two     faces  of the cube  0 0  1 and 0 01 will form the
basal pinacoids, while the remaining faces         1 0 0, 0  1  0, 1 0 0, and 0  10
 will give the direct square prism.
     The    faces of the rhombic dodecahedron 110,          1 1 0,  1 1 0, and 110
 will give those of the inverse square prism.
     There will be two groups of square pyramids derived from the
 four-faced cubes, the first in the development of the faces indicated
 by the symbols
                           kOh,    Okh,     kOh,      Okh
                           kOh,    Okh,     kOh,      Okh;
   the second by
                           hOk,     Ohk,    hOk,      Ohk
                           hOk,     Ohk,    hOk,      Ohk;
   the poles   of both of these forms always lying in the zone 0 0 1,10 0.
      The remaining eight faces of the four-faced cube, when developed
   symmetrically     with respect to the cubic axes, viz.
      hkO,      khO,     khO,    hkO,     hkO,     khO,       khO, and hkO,
   give the octagonal prism.
      The inverse square pyramids are derived from the tritohedral
   development of the faces of the twenty-four- faced trapezohedron and

   The tritohedral development of the form               hkl    gives the ditetragonal
pyramid   ;  of   these there are three groups.

   Ditetragonal      pyramids       may also be developed from the faces of
the forms h h k and          kkh,    whose poles lie in the zones 0          1 1, 10 0,
and  1  0 1, 0   1  0.
   The forms of the hexagonal system are regarded as tetartohedral
developments of the cubical system, the groups of faces being always
taken symmetrically         with respect      to the diagonal      of the cube or   one
of the octahedral        axes.
   The two      faces    of the octahedron         111 and       Til thus     form the
basal pinacoids.

give one hexagonal prism, while the other is derived from six faces
of the twenty-four-faced          trapezohedron, whose symbols are
              2    11,     112,        12  1,    2  11,    112,       12  1.
   The dihexagonal prisms            are derived from those faces          of the form
hkl which      lie in the zone       1  0 1, 2  1  1.
   There are three groups of positive rhomboids,                    two derived from
the three-faced         octahedron,      and one       from    the  twenty -four- faced
trapezohedron.

   The following    are the symbols      of these groups   : —

   The last group is restricted to those forms of        A A A whose poles lie
between those of     11 1  and 112, &c.
   The direct rhomboids         are all derived from the form       hkk,  and
consist of two groups,

   The forms of the prismatic system are then shown to be formed
by an analogous development of faces about the rhombic axes ;
making two of the         faces  of the rhombic      dodecahedron   the basal
pinacoids.
   In examining the Tables accompanying the paper, in which all the
known   faces  of crystals are expressed in the notation of the cubical
system, it will be seen that the indices are necessarily somewhat large.

   This inconvenience is more than compensated for by the fact that
the angular elements of every face, and its relation to another face,
can at once be calculated from the symbols of the faces by very easy
formulae.    The magnitude of the indices       are also shown to be much
diminished by using approximations         bringing every pole to its place
on the sphere of projection within     5  or 6  minutes — an approximation
not greater than that constantly used to make observations tally with
the calculated symbols.
XXI. "On        the Forces      concerned      in producing      the larger
       Magnetic    Disturbances."        By Balfour Stewart,            Esq.,
       M.A., F.R.S.      Received June 14, 1862.
                                 (Abstract).
   The author begins by alluding to        a previous communication     made
to the Royal Society, containing       an account    of the great magnetic
storm of August 28-September           7, 1859,    in which he had shown
that the first effect   of this great disturbance was to diminish in
intensity   both components of the earth's magnetic force at Kew,
during   a period  of about six hours.       Such an effect, he argues, can
 scarcely be supposed due to any combination            of earth-currents, of
which the period is only    a few minutes.
    But another appearance     is noticeable on the photographic       curves
which regard the progress of this great disturbance.
   While the great wave of force had a period of about six hours,
 there   were superimposed      upon    it smaller   disturbances   having  a
period of a few minutes, and therefore comparable in this respect
with earth-currents.
    These smaller disturbances are of very frequent occurrence, and
show themselves in the Kew magnetograph curves as serrated appear
 ances, occasionally magnified into peaks and hollows.
    Two hypotheses may     be entertained regarding them.
    1st.  They may be conceived to represent small and rapid changes
in the intensity of the whole disturbing force which acts upon the
magnet    ; and since (as stated above) this force cannot be supposed
due to earth- currents, so neither can its variations be caused by these.
    2nd. The peaks and hollows may be supposed due to the direct
action of earth-currents   upon the magnets.

1862.]                                               195
  The following argument is advanced                             to show that            the second of
these hypotheses is untenable.
     Let us compare together the two magnetic disturbances of August
and September                  1859      and August 1860             ;    and suppose the peaks
and hollows of the disturbance curves of these dates to be caused by
earth-currents.                This would require that currents of the                        same name
should have simultaneously travelled between Margate and Ramsgate,
and between Ramsgate                       and Ashford during the latter disturbance,
whereas          during            the   former    these    currents         should      have been of
different names, that is to say, the one positive and the other negative.
According to Mr. Walker's                           observations          however, on both these
occasions a current between Margate and Ramsgate was simultaneous
with     one     of the       same name between Ramsgate and                          Ashford.
     Thus,       if   we adopt the second hypothesis,                        it would appear that
these lines ought                    to have been affected differently                   on these two
occasions, whereas by observation                          they were affected in the same
manner       ;   the conclusion              is that this hypothesis does not represent
the truth.
     The author then shows that earth-currents                             observed      simultaneously
with     a very abrupt disturbance                  which commenced about                 1   lh   1 7m   a.m.,
September             1,    1859, would lead us to infer that the former are induced
currents due to sudden and rapid changes in the magnetism of the
earth.
     Referring now to the first hypothesis, which                            asserts that the peaks
and hollows represent small and rapid changes in the intensity of
the whole disturbing                     force which acts upon the magnet, it would
follow that                these    peaks and       hollows     should in this case comport
themselves with regard to the three elements of the earth's magnetism
in the     same way as the whole                    disturbing           force of which they repre
sent the changes.                    Thus,    if   the tendency of the great body of the
disturbing force               is to raise the curves for the three elements simul
taneously, then a small peak in one element should correspond to a
peak, and not to a hollow, in the other two.                              But   if,   on the other hand,
the tendency of the disturbing                          force   is   to raise one         of the curves
and lower the other two, then                       a   peak in the first should correspond
to   a   hollow in the others.
     This    is   shown to be the case in the disturbances extending from
the beginning of 1858 to the end of 1860                             ;     and the author therefore

                                       196                          [June    19,
concludes that peaks and hollows represent small and rapid changes
in the intensity of the whole disturbing force which           acts upon the
magnet.
    It is then shown that use may be made of these peaks and hollows,
if we  wish to analyse the forces concerned in producing disturbances.
Let us suppose that several independent forces          are concerned.     It  is
very unlikely that a small and rapid change takes place at the same
instant in more than one of these.           The measurement therefore of
simultaneous abrupt changes for the three elements may enable us to
determine the character of one of the elementary disturbing forces at
work.
    It is not even necessary to confine ourselves to very rapid changes,
provided we take peaks or hollows which present a similar appearance
for all the   elements,   as such can only be produced by the action        of  a
single force.
   The author then shows that        a peak  of the horizontal   force always
corresponds to a peak of the vertical force, and not to a hollow, and
that, when similar peaks are compared together, the horizontal-force
peak is always as nearly as possible double in size that of the vertical
force.
   This curious fact would imply that the resolved portion of the
disturbing force which acts in the plane of the magnetic meridian is
always in nearly the same direction.        The dip of this resolved por
tion will be about     1 7i°.
   It  is also found that a declination peak corresponds to a peak of
either force, except in the case of the great disturbance of August to
September 1859, during the most violent portion of which a peak of
the declination corresponded to a hollow in either force.         The length,
however, of a declination peak does not bear an invariable            ratio to
that of a   force peak — this ratio varying much from        one disturbance
to another, but not much from one part to another of the same dis
turbance.      In this last    case, however, the variation     of the ratio,
although not great, is yet greater than that of the ratio between the
two force peaks     ; so that   it is somewhat    difficult to obtain similar
peaks when comparing           the declination   curve with that of either
force.
    It thus appears that the force which acts upon the magnets does
not vary much from one part to another of the same disturbance,

   1862.]                                197
  and   it therefore   becomes   possible to give the elements of this force,
  which will thus characterize the disturbance.
     The author then attempts, by means of comparing similar appear
 ances, to represent the force at work for each disturbance between the
  beginning of 1858 to the end of 1860.              The great disturbance of
  August to September 1859 is here remarkable as one in which two
 independent      disturbing forces   seem to have acted at once,       — one of
  these being of the normal type, in which all the elements were raised
 or  depressed    together, while in the other the declination was raised
 when both elements of the force were depressed.
     It will  be observed that this method      of analysis  does not completely
 determine      the   disturbing force, but merely fixes the line of its
 resultant action, along which the force itself may be either positive
 or negative    ; or, again, there may be two nearly opposite forces acting
 against    one    another, the visible    disturbance    denoting   merely  the
 difference in strength between the two         ; and there is some reason to
 think that this last supposition represents the true state of the case.
     For while the definite relation which exists between the peaks of
 the two force-components shows that all disturbing forces affect these
 in nearly the      same way, yet sometimes, though very rarely,          in the
general progress of the curve one of the elements will be above the
normal while the other is below it.          Now, this may      be accounted for
in the following manner.          Suppose we have a disturbance producing
an elevation in the horizontal       force represented by +40, and one in
the vertical force represented by +20.             This will   be of the normal
type.      Suppose now that at the same time we have another force
nearly similar, whose action on the two force-elements is represented
by — 39 —21. This is also sufficiently near the normal type. The
result of these two disturbances superimposed will be + 1 and — 1,
showing      that the one element is raised above          its normal position,
while    the other is depressed below it.          This idea of two opposite
forces acting simultaneously in disturbances is that entertained by
General Sabine from other considerations.

      tric Signals through Submarine Cables."             — Part I.     Laws of
      Transmission        through       various lengths of one Cable.        By
      Fleeming Jenkin, Esq. Communicated by Prof. Wheat-
       stone. Received May 20, 1862.
                                      (Abstract.)
   Professor     W. Thomson has in various papers stated and                 de
veloped the mathematical             theory    of the transmission   of signals
through long submarine cables.              The present paper contains an ex
perimental research into the same            subject.  The conclusions arrived
at by theory are confirmed           by the experiments, and some new facts
of considerable importance         are established.
   All  the observations in this part of the paper were made on the
Red   Sea cable,    when coiled in iron tanks at Birkenhead.
   By observation on        a reflecting galvanometer, an arrival-curve      was
obtained for various lengths           of cable with various arrangements of
battery.      By arrival-curve         is  meant the curve representing       the
gradual rise of the current at the remote end of the cable when the
near end is put in permanent connexion with the battery.
   The analysis of the various arrival-curves led to the following con
clusions   : —
   1.  "The      electromotive      force has     no appreciable effect  on the
velocity with which the current is transmitted.
   2.  " The    rate of decrease in the current at the remote end, after
contact has been made for a given time with earth at the near end, is
the same as the rate of increase observed after making contact with
the battery at the near end for an equal time."
   With reference        to   the use     of alternate  positive and    negative
currents as compared with alternate connexion with the positive or
negative pole of a battery and earth,
   3.  It   was found that        the    " reversals in  no way modified      the
arrival-curve     during     its increase, nor did they modify        the curve
showing the decrease of the current."
   The   effect  of ordinary morse signals was next observed on the gal
vanometer through various lengths of cable.
   The changes in the received current, caused by repeated dots, by
repeated dashes,       by dots and dashes alternately,        and by dots and
dashes    separated by a pause, were observed at different               speeds.

  1862.J                                    199
 Repeated dots, when represented graphically,                 give an even wavy line
 with large amplitudes of oscillation for slow              speeds or through    short
 lengths,       but    rapidly approaching a straight line as the            speed   of
 transmission or the length of the cable was augmented.
     If   the maximum permanent deflection caused by the battery be
 called 100,         dots sent at the rate of       15  per minute through       2192
 knots of cable caused oscillations in the received current of 12*7 per
 cent.    ;   and sent at the rate of 50 per minute, this caused an oscillation
 of   less than      1 per cent.
     4. From this it was concluded               that   "on all     submarine   cables
 there is a limit to the number of signals which can be sent per mi
 nute, a limit which cannot be exceeded by any ingenious contrivance."
     If we continue        to call the maximum        deflection due to permanent
 contact 100, the mean height of the current observed during dots is
 below 50, on account of time lost between the two contacts while
 moving the sending-key.
     When        dashes or lines are sent, t. e. long contacts       with the battery
  followed by short earth-contacts, an even wavy line is obtained, the
 mean height of which is above 50              ;  and when dots and dashes          are
  combined, the curves representing the changes of the current become
  very irregular,        sometimes flying above        50,   sometimes falling below
  this line     ;  and when long pauses, or a succession of long battery-con
  tacts are introduced, the curves become              hopelessly confused, especi
  ally at the higher        speeds, so that the signals cannot be disentangled,
  even when the change of current can be continually followed.                   From
  this it is concluded that,
      5.    "There     is a wide margin between the        limit  set to the speed   of
 transmission by the gradual diminution               of the received signals, and
 that    set by     their interference."
     Reverse currents have been recommended as a means of accelerat
 ing the rate of speaking through submarine cables.                   Their effect was
 tested     ;  the arrival-curves     and signal-curves       obtained by their use
 differed in no way from those obtained by simple currents and earth-
 contacts.         Hence it was concluded that,
     6.   " The     use  of reverse  currents does not alter the limit set by the
gradual diminution of the received signals, nor that set by their in
terference."
    It   occurred to the author        that,  if  by any means the current could
invariably after         each signal be brought      to one constant strength and
                                                                        p2

 maintained at that strength             between the signals, the confusion         of
 interference would be avoided.             He considered that,   if the  second   or
 earth-contact of each signal bore a fit proportion           to the first contact,
 this object might be effected ; and he considered that a succession of
 very short pairs of contacts of a certain relative length, would main
 tain the current at the constant final strength during any pause sepa
 rating signals.     He therefore prepared a paper band with openings cut
 so as to   make pairs of equal battery- and earth-contacts for dots, long
 battery-contacts,     followed by nearly equal earth-contacts, for a dash,
 and a succession of pairs of very short contacts wherever a pause was
 required, the battery contacts being rather the shorter of the two.
     The   success  of this plan      was such that the signals were      distinctly
 recorded, not only by the galvanometer, but by a relay when the total
 variations caused by the shortest signals were invisible on the galvano
meter, i. e. even less than       1   per cent. of the maximum final current.
     7. Hence     it was concluded that by the means adopted, or by
analogous means,
                         "  signals can be sent without confusion             at any
speed    which will allow the shortest signal used            to cause   a sensible
variation in the received current."
     These experiments were tried on dry cable coiled in iron tanks, and
might therefore not be applicable to extended and submerged cables.
     The author has, however, proved that the retardation and insula
tion of an iron-covered cable are very little affected by the mere pre
sence or absence       of water    ;   and wherever the conclusions        obtained
from the experiments agree with the deductions of theory,                 it is clear
that the experiments and theory confirm               one another, and the con
clusions may be safely applied to the practical              case  of a submerged
and extended cable        ; for it   is impossible to suppose that     results due
 only to an accidental arrangement of the cable should by chance
 coincide with the deductions from a defective hypothesis.
     The experimental        arrival-curves    do not exactly     agree   with the
curve given by Professor          W. Thomson        (Proceedings    of the Royal
Society, 1855.        Phil. Mag. 1856).
    The experimental curve approaches its maximum much more slowly
than the mathematical          curve, and continues to rise       1 or 2 per cent.
long after all effects from retardation as given by theory would cease.
    Some of this effect may be due to the mutual influence of the coils
of the cable*     ; but the greater part of the discrepancy         is due to the
   *  Vide paper  read by Professor     W. Thomson at the British Association, Aber

change of the insulation due           to continued electrification, first published
by the author in a paper read before the Royal Society in 1859-60*.
     The identity of the arrival- curve during increase and decrease
shows that,
     8.    "The      apparent increase of resistance of the gutta percha is
rather due to an absorption of electricity which is again given out,
than to a real change in the conductivity of the material."
     The theoretical and practical conclusions on the effect of repeated
signals were next examined.                Little change of insulation could take
place during the repeated signals, because the greater part of the
cable remained continually electrified; and greater coincidence between
the experiments and the theory was therefore to be expected.
     The curve expressing the rate at which the amplitude of oscillation
in the received current diminishes as the number of signals increases,
 was constructed from Professor W. Thomson's equationsf ; and the
 experimental         amplitudes with 1500, 1802, and 2192 knots of cable
 in circuit, were found to coincide in the most accurate manner with
 this curve — establishing completely the soundness of the mathemati
 cal theory.
      9. These results prove beyond all question that            "  the rate of trans
 mission varies as the square of the length, whether by rate of trans
 mission be meant that speed at which repeated signals fail to produce
 any sensible effect, or the rate producing so great an amplitude that
 common hand-signals can be received without confusion."
      It   is also found      (when small compared with the total resistance)
 that,
      10.    "The     resistance of the battery and receiving instrument pro
  duces nearly the same effect as the addition           of an equal length of sub
 marine cable."
      If the    amplitude of oscillation       in the received current caused by
  dots at any one speed through             any one straight     cable were known,
  the amplitude        through any other cable at any other          speed could im
  mediately be taken from the curve, now verified by experiment.
      Unfortunately        this one fact is wanting.     The author hopes to        be
  able to supply the want in the second             part of this paper.

    A brief notice of some of the experiments contained in this paper
                                    '
has already appeared in the           Proceedings.'    Their object      was  to
ascertain with accuracy the lowering of temperature, in atmospheric
air and other gases, which takes place on passing them through a
porous plug from a state of high to one of low pressure.                Various
pressures were employed, with the result (indicated by the authors in
their Part II.) that the thermal effect is approximately proportional to
the difference of pressure on the two sides of the plug.           The experi
ments were    also tried at various temperatures, ranging          from   5°  to
98° Cent., and have shown that the thermal effect,          if one of cooling,
is approximately    proportional   to the inverse square       of the absolute
temperature.     Thus, for example, the refrigeration          at the freezing
temperature is about twice that at 100° Cent.            In   the case of hy
drogen, the reverse phenomenon of a rise of temperature on passing
through the plug was observed, the rise being doubled in quantity
when the temperature of the gas was raised to 100°.              This result is
conformable     with the experiments of Regnault, who found that
hydrogen, unlike other gases, has its elasticity increased more rapidly
than in the inverse ratio of the volume.            The authors have also
made numerous experiments with mixtures of gases, the remarkable
result being that the thermal effect (cooling) of the compound gas
is less than it would be if the gases    after mixture retained in integrity
the physical characters they possessed while in a pure state.

    The author, after referring briefly to the       researches    of previous
inquirers, and the hypothesis now generally adopted, that the bright
lines observed in these spectra depend so absolutely on the chemical
nature of the substances present that their occurrence is an unerring
test of that presence, expresses      his belief that it cannot be admitted

in its full extent without much more decisive proof than has yet been
afforded.     It   assumes,
     1.  That each substance has a set         of lines peculiar to itself.
    2. That those lines are not produced or modified by any molecular
agent except heat.
    3. That the spectrum           of  one substance is     in nowise modified by
the presence of another         ;  and in such cases      both spectra coexist in
dependently, and are merely superposed.
    4.   As may     be inferred      from 2, that electricity       does  not make
matter luminous directly, but only by heating it              ; so that the electric
spectrum differs in nothing from that produced by heat of sufficient
intensity.
     His attention    was directed to this subject several years ago          by the
 difference of colour of discharges in carbonic oxide at common and
 diminished     pressure   ;   and the results of his experiments appear to
show that none of these four points is universally true.
     His apparatus consisted of           a powerful     induction machine, with
 which    a Leyden    jar was connected ;       of prisms, first  one  of 45°, after
 wards one of 60° (whose deviations were reduced to the scale of the
 first) ; and of an optical theodolite, in which a collimator with a
 variable slit gives the beam whose spectrum is observed.                 He points
 out an important defect of this arrangement, and discusses the pro
 bable liabilities to error proceeding from the graduation reading only
 to minutes, and from other sources of uncertainty.
     The media of discharge were air, nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, and
 carbonic oxide, to which were added in some instances the vapours
 of mercury, phosphorus, and bisulphuret of carbon. For electrodes,
 23 metals and graphite were used — 15 with each of the five gases at
 common pressure and at one              of  0°#2,   the others only with some of
 them.      In all,   185   different spectra were measured, of which 93
 were at common pressure.
     At common pressure the spectra show               a number   of bright lines on
 a coloured    ground, the light of which is in general stronger towards
 the red than the violet end, and strongest in the green.                   In  some
 this ground     is so  bright    as to efface all but the most luminous lines       :
 this is especially the      case  with hydrogen.       Of the lines,  some are very
  brilliant ; but they range in light down to the very lowest degree               of
  faintness, such that (at least with the author's apparatus) they can
  only be seen when the room is entirely dark, and are bisected with

                                      204                               [June 19,
  great difficulty.    They vary also in width, from a mere hair's breadth
  to six or seven   times the apparent width of the slit.
     On exhausting the tube in which the discharge is made, at first
 the only change is that the brilliant lines lose a little of their lustre,
 till at pressures varying from 3° to 0o-5 the spectrum rather suddenly
 fades away, sometimes leaving only         a  suspicion of one or two lines       ;
 with others the least-refrangible rays vanish, while the violet remain,
 though very faint, especially with aluminium.             In hydrogen spectra
 the three bright bands of this gas vanish at unequal densities ; and
 it is remarkable that this occurs when the          gas is diluted to the same
 proportions by mixing air with it.
     Exhausting yet further, this transition          spectrum becomes       again
 bright  ; fresh lines appear, and it is changed into a new one, which,
 however, is never as splendid as that at common pressure, especially
 at the red end, and in     which the very brilliant lines     are less frequent.
 This want makes the difference between the two kinds of spectra
 seem greater than it really is.       Fewer lines are visible in the rarefied
 media, and of these about four-tenths        are not found     in the spectra of
 common pressure.
     If the tables in which the measures        are given be examined in re
ference to the points alluded to as doubtful, it will be obvious,
     1. That many lines    are found  in all the gases, and in many, perhaps
 all the metals   :  the existence of such lines must be independent of
 the chemical nature of electrodes or media        ;  it is otherwise with their
 brightness, which may be intense with one substance and feeble with
 another.     This unchemical     origin  is  still more clearly shown by        a
 modified experiment of Pliicker, where the discharge is made by the
induction of glass without the presence of any metal.            When the same
glass vessel was filled in succession with nitrogen, oxygen, and hy
drogen, though not above twenty-three lines were seen in its capillary
tube, and those very faint, yet more than half the number were
common to two of the gases, or to the three.              These might perhaps
be referred to soda or lead detached from the glass         ; but some of them
are not found in those spectra.
    2. The difference between      the common-pressure,          transition,  and
rarefied spectrum shows that the character and even the existence               of
certain lines depend on the mere density of the medium, the chemical
circumstances remaining unchanged.
    3. That the spectra are not merely superposed without change is

 1862.]                                 205
 evident from several facts.       The spectra of air     do not   in every  case
 show all the lines of oxygen and nitrogen, and occasionally have some
 not visible in either of them     : the spectrum of graphite in oxygen is
 quite different from those of carbonic oxide.        There is even reason to
believe that for certain lines the actions of bodies may be antagonistic.
The spectrum of mercury electrodes and mercury vapour showed
48 lines, and the author expected that the spectra for any gas with
mercury electrodes would add to those of mercury the peculiar lines of
 that  gas, which could thus     be certainly determined.       In  the nitrogen
 spectrum, however, 20 of the mercurial lines had disappeared, in the
hydrogen      18, and in the carbonic oxide 13.
    4. The brilliancy or visibility of the lines is very little increased by
greatly augmenting the heating power of the discharge.                  The two
halves of the induction machine can be made to act either consecu
tively for tension, or collaterally for quantity.        In the latter case the
quantity    is doubled, and therefore the heating          power quadrupled.
When the apparatus is      so used, the violet bands are something brighter,
but not   so much so as to be noticed by an unpractised observer.            The
red and green show no appreciable difference          ;   but the author is in
clined to think the change may be greater in the ultra-violet part.           He
proposes, however, to repeat the experiment with coils of much greater
power as to quantity.      If electricity  can produce thermic vibrations     by
its transmission, there    seems no d priori reason     why it cannot produce
luminous     ones  ; and no evidence that it cannot is known to him.
   It  seems    to follow from these observations that the tendency to
show such lines belongs to matter in general, but that different forms
of it have different powers of manifesting that tendency, and that
those powers       may sometimes       interfere.  If   this be confirmed     by
further research, the result will     be that, though the electric spectrum
may give useful indications to the analyst, it should never be his sole
dependence, or be trusted without full cognizance of the conditions
which may affect its indications.

of certain terms in each series, may produce a division into                                                     4 squares
of every term of other series, and thus each term in the whole square
will at last be divided into 4 squares, and the first term will be so
divided into 4 square numbers that two of the roots will be equal to
each other; two of them will differ by                                       1,   and the algebraic sum of                     all
the roots will be equal to 1 .

     is not offered (at present) as a proof that it must be so, but as
a method by which that result may always (in fact) be obtained.

      any odd number 2n+ 1 be increased by 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, &c., the
(2n+l)th         term will be                   (2?i+l)2; other terms will have                                 a    distinct
arithmetic relation to n, and n+                                 1,       and the whole series will be such
that,     if the pth       term can be divided into square numbers whose roots
shall equal 2/j—                  1,    then every term of the whole series                                     can be so
divided that the roots of the                             (p+ l)th term will                     be   2p+   1, and so on

13 to 101, and beginning         with  13, a number be taken from each line
alternately, a series of the first kind will be discovered, viz. one in
creasing by 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, &c., and every term in that                        series   will
become the first term of another similar series                 ;   so that every odd
number in the small squares (except those in the top row) will be
terms in 2 such series, and the indices will be as marked in the
right-hand upper corner of         each square    ;  the numbers in the margin
1,  3, 5, 7, &c., and 0, 2, 4, 5, &c., are the indices of all the series,
parallel to them.
    Now    51  =0, 1,5, 5.       No two roots differ by           9  ;   but  5=5    ;  and
5  + 5 — 1 = 9.     As  5 = 5, all the numbers below 51, that is 53, 59,
&c., are divided into 4 square numbers, whose roots appear in the
diagram.        Again, 35=4a,      42 + (jT)=32,      S'+l,     and     35= —1,0,3,5,
which gives     7, the index    of 35,   as a term    in the      series increasing by
2, 4, 6, &c. ; and therefore          every term       may be           resolved    into 4
squares    ; but   as one   series crosses     a set   of  series,     it at length    fur
nishes the index, thus, 51,                 37,             31,          on arriving at

31.     2+3=5, the index of         31 as a term      in the     series increasing       by
4, 8, 12, &c.    ;  and 19 therefore       equals 0,     1,  3,   3; and —1, 3=4
(the index of 19 as a term in the 3rd series) ;              1 1 =0, 3, 1, 1.
    The method by which the division of certain                        numbers      into  4
squares is here accomplished            applies to      all numbers of the form
2n +   1 ;  but as the first term increases, the methods also multiply, so

connect    the double function        of this    class  of peroxides        with the
peculiar catalytic decompositions which            they undergo.        It   is shown
that the catalytic     decomposition     may be regarded as a combination
of these two actions,        an oxidation    and a reduction       simultaneously
occurring.      Thus in   an alkaline  solution of the peroxide of hydrogen,
protoxide of manganese is oxidized to peroxide.               In the acid solution
the peroxide of manganese is reduced to protoxide, the results being
expressed in the following equations         : —
                      Mn2 O + H2 O, = H2 O +         Mn, 02,
                      M n2  02 + H2 02 = Mn2 O +       H2  O+   0, ;
while the result of the catalytic decomposition effected by the peroxide
of manganese is given in the equation derived from the above by
elimination,
                              2H202=2H20 + 02,
the result being the same as though the peroxide of manganese were
alternately reduced and oxidized by the alkaline peroxide.                     We  are
thus enabled to analyse the catalytic action into its constituent                  de
compositions.
    That in numerous       cases the catalytic change is brought about              by
the intervention      of intermediate compounds, which are alternately
formed and destroyed during the action, is shown in various examples.
For instance, the addition of       a solution    of peroxide of sodium          to an
excess  of  a solution    of a protosalt  of copper     causes the formation         of
a  precipitate of a yellow peroxide of copper.            If, on the other hand,
a  few drops of the salt of copper be added to          an excess    of the alkaline
peroxide,    the same      yellow  body is formed, but the whole of the
 peroxide is ultimately decomposed         ; after the decomposition hydrated
protoxide     of copper remains.         Similar phenomena occur with               an
ammoniacal       solution    of the copper-salt.       If   a few drops        of this
solution   be   added to an ammoniacal solution              of the peroxide of
hydrogen,     the   solution becomes      of   a yellow    colour, and the cata
lytic action is set up. This action may continue, in dilute solutions,
for several hours ; during the whole of this time the yellow colour is
permanent     ; but ultimately,     when the peroxide is entirely              decom
posed, the blue colour of the ammoniacal solution of the protoxide
reappears.      The ammoniacal solution          of the protoxide         of copper
decomposes the peroxide of hydrogen into water and oxygen, precisely
as  sulphuric acid decomposes alcohol into ether and water.                     But in
this case the colour         of the solution gives actual evidence of the

presence of the intermediate             compound         by   the agency of which
the catalytic action is effected,        and which is formed, but disappears
from the final result.

         Submarine Cables of different lengths, andUnit of Speed    a
         for comparing Electric Cables by bisecting the Electric
         Wave." By Cromwell F. Varley, Esq. Communicated
         by Professor Stokes, Sec. R.S.                 Received June 19, 1862.
                                       (Abstract.)
  The present paper gives the results of                   some    experiments which
were     undertaken    to determine,      first, the relative speed of the elec
tric wave through cables of various lengths                ;   secondly, the retarding
effect   of the iron covering of the       cable    ;   and thirdly, methods for the
increase of the speed of the electric wave.
   When      a   long submarine      cable or subterranean wire is connected at
one end     through    a galvanometer to the earth, and the other end is
connected with a battery, a current flows through                    it,   deflecting the
galvanometer-needle      .
   If    the needle be made very light and small, so as to have but                     a
small amount of inertia, and the cable be long, the current will be
seen to arrive      after the      lapse of   a   short but appreciable interval of
time, and will gradually augment                  in intensity    approaching      to, but
never attaining,      the maximum.
   Professor Thomson           has investigated this subject mathematically,
and      arrived at the conclusion       that in submarine cables of different
lengths the speed       is   inversely as the square of the distance.
   Through the Atlantic Cable, the conducting wire of which weighed
 93 lbs. to the statute mile, and the length of which was rather more
than 2300 statute miles, the electric current                  did not show itself on
Thomson's         sensitive reflecting     galvanometer          until more than      one
 second after contact had been made with the battery at the other end.
    In experiments made by the author in 1854 upon 1600 miles of
 wire between London and Manchester, connected up in one continuous
 circuit,    the current was not visible upon the chemical recording
 instruments then       in   use   until after the lapse of about three         seconds.
    These experiments were repeated by Professor                    Faraday    ;   and he
 has made known         the results.

                                         212                          [June 19,
    From the imponderable nature of electricity (considered for a mo
ment as a fluid), from its in compressibility, and other circumstances,
the author infers that the electric current commences flowing out at
the one end at the very instant that contact is made with the battery
at the other end    ; but it is a considerable time before it reaches an
appreciable    strength   ;  it then  goes on augmenting       in strength, ap
proaching to, but never absolutely attaining,         its maximum force.
    As the first part of the      wave   commences to appear instantly, and
as the top    of the   wave would      require an indefinitely   long period  of
time to be reached, it will be evident that the part of the wave best
suited for investigation       is half the maximum, as at that period the
changes of its intensity in a given time are more rapid than at any
other.
    When attempting to measure by means of a galvanometer the
arrival of the wave at half its maximum, the weight and momentum
of the magnet of the galvanometer were found to interfere               so much
that, excepting through very long lengths of cable, nothing approach
ing   to an accurate determination         of the  speed   could be obtained.
The    use of electro-magnets       was equally,  if not more, objectionable,
 as they require    a very appreciable       but uncertain   time to be mag
 netized.
    The following method, however, of bisecting the electric wave has
 obviated these    difficulties,   and admits of the determination of the
 relative rates of transmission through cables of different lengths with
 very great accuracy.
    The machine used consisted of          an axle carrying two     " commuta
 tors."    This axle   was    driven   by clockwork,    governed, in one case,
 by a fly    rotating in mercury, and in the second experiment by
 means   of a fly in the air, together with a friction spring.
    The commutator consists of two wheels,           each wheel being in two
 halves.    Upon the broad edge of the wheel rest two springs, one of
 which is connected with one pole of the battery, and the other with
 the other pole.       The two halves of the wheel were constantly
 connected, by means of two other springs, the one with the cable
 wire, and the other with the earth,            so that   when the wheel was
 turned round, during one half of the revolution a positive current
 was flowing through the cable wire, and during the other a negative.
 The other commutator            on the same axle was      precisely similar in
 construction   ; but the two springs resting on the edge          of the wheel

 1862.]                                 213
were connected with two wires of a galvanometer, and one half of
the wheel      was   connected with the receiving end of the cable wire
tested, and the other         half of the commutator         was   connected with
the earth.
    The two commutators were         so arranged that when, by the rotation
of the wheel, the current of electricity from the battery            was reversed,
the connexions of the galvanometer were reversed also ; and there
fore, if the speed of the electric wave through the cable were inde
finitely great, the currents would flow through the galvanometer in
one direction, no matter how fast the currents in the cable are re
versed.     As, however,     a given amount       of time   elapses   before these
waves reach their maximum            at the distant end        of the circuit, and
as   also a given time elapses        after the battery        has been reversed
at   the   one   end before the current          is reversed at the       other   or
distant   end,   it is clear that by gradually augmenting              the rate of
rotation of the commutator         until the wheel is       a quarter    of a revo
lution in advance of the       wave, a point is arrived at when         the galva
nometer's connexions       are reversed precisely at the moment that the
wave reaches its maximum strength, and consequently the wave is bi
sected, one half of it flowing through the galvanometer in one direction,
and the other half in the other.            At this rate of rotation the galva
nometer falls to zero    ;  because,   the wave being exactly bisected, the
one   half tends to deflect the needle to the right, and the other           to the
left, but, owing to the weight of the needle and the rapidity of the
reversals, it (the needle) stands nearly steadily at zero.              The galva
nometer used consisted of a rather heavy astatic pair of needles
suspended by a silk fibre.         The wire acting upon the needles was
about the twentieth part of an inch in thickness, in order that it
should    offer no serious resistance to the electric current.              Its re
sistance was less than one Varley unit (1 mile copper wire              j\ inch  in
diameter).
   The rate of rotation      necessary   to obtain the first zero is the point
recommended for comparing the relative speeds               of the electric  waves
through submarine cables of different dimensions.
    By augmenting      the speed    beyond that necessary to produce the
first zero, the needle becomes deflected in the opposite direction and
gradually approaches a maximum            ;  that is to say, when the electric
wave is   half  a revolution    behind, the currents        all flow through the
galvanometer in one        direction   again.      This  is   termed the second

 maximum (the first maximum being that obtained when the wheel
 is not rotating at all) ; and by augmenting the speed still more, until
 the wave is three-quarters of a revolution behind, the wave is again
 bisected and a second zero is obtained, and so on.
     The great variation of                speed necessary to give these and other re
 sults was such that the means then at the author's                            disposal in the
 first experiments were not sufficiently regular to admit of very ac
 curate readings.
    The experiments now communicated were made upon two cables,
 one containing six conducting wires, a portion of which was laid in
 the Mediterranean.                 This cable had been lying exposed              to sun and
 weather in the East India Docks for some years, and the gutta percha
 had become deteriorated to a considerable extent                        ;    its exact length
 was not known              ;   and from these combined causes it could not be used
 for determining                the rate at which the wave travels through given
lengths, but it has served to demonstrate that Thomson's
                                                                                  " law of    the
            "   is substantially          correct in practice.
squares
     In   the experiments made on this cable, the resistance of the galva
nometer was equal to one mile of the cable.                       The battery power
used averaged from                  12    to 36 cells of Daniell's battery, each cell
offering a resistance of one-sixth of a mile of the cable.
     The first experiment                was made upon two wires forming             a loop    of
about 150 miles in length; and when the currents were reversed at
the rate of      15* 16         per second, the needle came to zero.
   The second experiment was made through three wires, that is to
say, 225 miles of cable. The speed then obtained was 6-57. Through
four wires       (i.   e.   double the length of first experiment)              3*78 reversals
per second were obtained.
  Through six wires, or three times the length of the first experi
ment, 1-75 per second were obtained, or inversely as the square of
the length.
     In the foregoing experiments the current                      was       made to pass up
one wire and down the second, up the                       third and down the fourth,
and so on    ;   but in experiment No.               5,   the current was made to pass
through all the six wires, one after the other, in the same direction,
the object being to determine,                 if   possible, what amount of retarda
tion was attributable to the magnetization of the iron covering.                             On
the current through the first wire ceasing,                  a   magneto-electric current
is   produced in the opposite direction                   to the first magneto-electric

1862.]                                   215
current   ;  and consequently,     when the wires were so connected that
the current went up one wire and down the second, up the third and
down     the fourth, as in      experiment     No. 4, the magneto-electric
action upon No. 2 wire is counterbalanced            by the magneto-electric
action upon No. 3, and so on          ;   but in experiment      No.  5 the mag
neto-electric current was in full force on all the wires.            The result,
however, did not show any appreciable difference in the speed of the
wave, as the machine then used could not be governed with sufficient
accuracy.
    Experiments     were made to determine the effect of applying resist
ance to one end     of the cable.   For instance,   a telegraphic instrument,
when applied to the cable, augments the resistance                of the circuit ;
and when a resistance equal to half that of the cable was applied at
one end, the rate of the electric wave through            it was decreased     to
 three-quarters.      When   a resistance equal to the whole        of the cable
 was added at one end, so as to double the resistance of the whole
 circuit, the   speed was reduced to about three-fifths      ; and when resist
ance double that of the cable was added, the speed was reduced
 rather more than one-half.
    Variations in the electromotive force produced            no  sensible varia
 tion in the speed of the waves.
    The second      series of experiments were tried upon the Dunwich
 and Zandvoort cable, after it was submerged, and consequently in a
 straight line, and not,   as in the previous experiment,      in a coiled mass  ;
 it was   therefore exposed to much less magneto- electric induction.
 The insulation of this cable was very high indeed.
    The experiments on this cable, among other results, show that
 doubling     the length   of the circuit reduced the       speed    nearly four
 times.     The experiments on the Mediterranean           cable showed that,
 with three times the length, the       speed was reduced nearly nine times.
 With twice the length the        speed was     reduced nearly four times, or
 inversely as the square of the distance nearly.
    The   mean    of the experiments through 270 miles of cable are 4 -76
 revolutions of the wheel per second, or 9-52 reversals of the current
 per second.
    In the experiments through 540 miles, or twice the length of
 cable, the speed was 1*326 revolution of the wheel, or 2-65 reversals
 per second.       The reason why they do not follow the law of the
 squares exactly, is probably to be attributed        to the resistance    of the

                                         216                          [June    19,
battery used on this occasion, and also to the fact of the magneto-
electric induction of the iron exterior.
   Experiment       9 shows that, on the introduction       midway in the cir
cuit of an escape (circuit derive!), the resistance of which is equal
to half the circuit, the first zero is obtained at the rate of 2-78 revo
lutions per second, or 5*56 reversals per second             ; the introduction
of this    escape about doubles      the speed of transmission      ; and thus,
by the establishment of a series of escapes judiciously along the cable,
the speed may be augmented to a very high degree without weaken
ing the current too much for the purposes of telegraphy.                   Expe
riments were then tried with currents of various durations ; and the
results of these       experiments are very important,       the highest speed
being obtained when the cable was connected to the battery for a very
short interval of time and immediately afterwards put to earth.                 In
this way, through the 540 miles, the speed of the wave was increased
from 1-326 to       37.
   In    the experiments in which resistances of various amounts were
 added to one end of the cable, the consequent retardations agree very
nearly with the results obtained upon the Mediterranean               cable.     It
was found to be immaterial        at which end of the circuit the resistance
was added      : this, however, can only hold good with highly insulated
wires  ;  for it is evident, upon   a little consideration of the matter, that,
where the line is imperfectly insulated, the resistance added at the
sending end will produce more retardation than            if  applied to the re
ceiving end.
    In the experiments on the second zero and second maximum, it
is shown that,      if the speed required to produce the first zero be taken
as unity, double that speed is necessary to produce the second maxi
mum, and four times the speed to get the second zero.
    Notwithstanding the difficulties          under which these     experiments
were made (from the necessity          of using  a machine the rates    of whose
motion could not be very accurately governed), the results are still
sufficiently accurate for all      "practical" purposes of submarine         tele
graphy     ; but such nice points as the retarding influence of the iron
covering      cannot    be inferred   with any precision from these experi
ments.       It  is certain, however, that in long cables the retarding
influence of the external iron covering is so small, compared with the
retardation due to electrical induction,         that it may be neglected in
 estimating the speed of the electric wave.

" On       the Production of Vibrations and Sounds by Electrolysis."

          1861*.
    1 .  Under     some circumstances,       which  I have already   briefly recorded
(Proceedings          of the Royal Society, No. 44. p. 177), vibrations of
singular beauty, accompanied by definite sounds, are produced at the
surfaces of mutual contact of a liquid metal and electrolyte by the
passage       of  an electric current.
    2. The most convenient              mode    of obtaining the vibrations and
sounds is as follows.          Take    a  circular disk of thin sheet glass about
2 or 3 inches in diameter, and procure               a  thin hoop of glass about
 1 inch wide and of the          same diameter as      the disk, by cutting off the
end of an ordinary          glass shade.        Coat one edge of the hoop with
melted sealing-wax, and place the hoop with that edge downwards

the junctions water-tight.             A   circular  vessel surrounded      by an an

of 8£ inches diameter*.
    3. Nearly fill the inner circular       space and the annular groove       with
pure mercury, and cover the mercury to about half an inch or more
in depth with a filtered solution composed either of 1 0 grains of cya
nide of mercury and 100 grains of hydrate of potash dissolved in 2-J
ounces by measure of hydrocyanic acid containing 5 per cent. of an
hydrous acid; or of 10 grains of cyanide            of mercury dissolved in        a
mixture of 3 ounces of hydrocyanic           acid and -J-th of an ounce of strong
aqueous ammonia         :  the latter solution must be used directly after it
is made, because      it   soon decomposes and loses its vibrating        power.
    4. Take either two or three of Grove's           cells, containing platinum
plates about     6 inches long and 4 inches wide, connect them intensity
fashion, and immerse the positive terminal            platinum wire in the cir
cular    pool   of mercury,        and   the  negative    wire   in the annular
ring of mercury       ;   or five Smee's cells, the acting surface of each
silver plate     being      equal  to  30 square inches, charged          with  one

 tion of hydrogen.            It is essential that the electric power be within
 proper limits, otherwise the phenomena will not occur, and I have
 therefore found        it very convenient to employ        a   wind-up battery, the
 plates of which can be instantly immersed to any desired depth in the
 exciting liquid.          The   one  I have used in nearly all the experiments
 described in this paper consists of ten Smee's elements, each plate
 being 7\ inches wide and 11^ inches deep, single zincs and single
 silvers, and capable of being immersed about 9 inches in the exciting
liquid    ;  it is sufficiently large to produce the phenomena in rings
 of mercury       8^ inches diameter and -^th         of an inch wide     : with small
 rings of mercury the plates are immersed only -|ths of an inch deep.
 It is advisable in all cases to produce the sounds by nearly the mini
 mum of electric power, because they are then generally more uniform
and more prolonged.              The introduction of     a coil  of stout copper wire
 (containing      a soft    iron core) into the circuit will considerably assist
the production of sounds if the cells are few in number.
     5. Instantly on passing the electric current, a series of small ele
vations, which        I   shall term vibrations or crispations, occur upon the
surface of the annular portion             of mercury, and impart to it the ap
pearance of a series         of transverse ridges, all radiating from the centre
 of the vessel*     ;  and these elevations or crispations are accompanied
 by definite sounds very similar to the humming of a large bee, and
capable of being heard under favourable circumstances at a distance
of upwards of 50 feet.               The sounds    are evidently     produced by the
vibrations.
     6. These elevations are exceedingly definite and uniform in size                   ;
 apparently all of them are at exactly the same distance asunder at
 any given moment             if the mercury is undisturbed         by other causes     ;
the    distance varies under different            circumstances from         about £th
of an inch      to a distance so small as to be scarcely distinguishable              by
the unassisted eye.            The apparent distance asunder of         each elevation
is probably        half the distance of the actual vibrations,             because   the
mercury is raised and depressed with great rapidity at each of those
spots   :   while one spot is in a state of elevation, the next adjoining
one is depressed        ;  and while the former spot is depressed,            the latter
is elevated, and        so on alternately     with such great rapidity       as to pro-

duce upon the eye at any moment the impression of double the num
ber of elevations that actually exist at that moment.            Elevations that
appeared to be about       \ th of an inch asunder      emitted the note     F.
    7. The position of the elevations in very narrow rings of mercury
is generally uniform, i. e. in lines radiating toward the centre of the
vessel   when the mercury is undisturbed         ;   but with rings    |th of    an
inch wide or upwards the elevations of different portions             of the ring
frequently fluctuate in their positions      ;  and under much rarer condi
tions the whole ring of elevations revolves (and sometimes rather
quickly) round an imaginary axis in the centre of the vessel, some
times in one direction       and sometimes in the other          ; but what the
conditions are that determine the rotation or its direction            I  have not
investigated further than to ascertain that the vibrations            are not in
 fluenced by a strong magnet.           The surface of the negative              or
 vibrating mercury never exhibited nodal points.
    8.  In  addition to the elevations which emit sounds, there are other
movements of greater amplitude,         i. e. undulations      about £th of an
inch in length     ; and also other motions of a more violent kind in
 negative pools of mercury, consisting of upheavals of mercury in large
masses at irregular     distances from each      other, as  if  large bubbles of
 gas were beneath (but no gas was observed), especially             in  a solution
composed      of 2J ounces of hydrocyanic acid and 1 00 grains of hydrate
of potash, on first electrolysing it.          Both these motions, like the
previous ones, occur at the cathode, but neither of them are attended
by appreciable sounds.        On rare occasions, with the full power of the
battery exerted upon the solution          given (3), undulations        have also
been observed      in the positive mercury surface, but they emitted             no
 perceptible sounds.
    9.  I  have not given a full description of all the numerous appear
 ances   of the various movements,     as similar phenomena         (though pro
 duced by other causes) have been minutely described by Mr. Faraday
 in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, 1831 ; and my
 remarks will be almost entirely confined to the vibrations that produce
 sounds, because     the other electrolytic movements have already been
to a great extent observed and examined by previous investigators.
    10. The phenomenon of definite sound is limited to those crispa-
 tions whose widths lie within certain limits      ;  when the widths between
 the elevations enlarge beyond     |th of   an inch, the sounds cease.        Fre

 quently feeble sounds            are heard a few seconds before crispations
 appear, and sometimes also a short time after they disappear, espe
 cially in    a solution     composed of     2f ounces of hydrocyanic acid,       100
 grains of hydrate          of potash, and 20 grains of cyanide of mercury.
 In  a weak solution of cyanide of potassium the sounds sometimes
 cease or become         inaudible     before the elevations disappear;        and in
 other cyanide solutions          I have occasionally    observed the sounds and
 crispations continue a short time after the electric current has been
 stopped    ;  there is probably, therefore, a liquid metal and electrolyte
which together will emit sounds without the aid of a battery, and                    I
 have made a few experiments (with Hg alloyed with K) to discover
them, but without success.               In  some   cyanide solutions the sounds
and crispations cease very suddenly             ; but in the one  I  have given   (3)
they remain nearly uniform about ten or fifteen minutes with a feeble
electric current, and then diminish gradually as a film is formed upon
the anode.         The crispations     are more steady   with  a moderate number
of large voltaic elements than with            a large number    of small elements.
On   some occasions, especially          with many elements of small surface,
two sets of crispations, one about half the width of the other, will
coexist and succeed each other alternately.
    11.  In    every case the      pitch of    the sound varied with the width
of the crispations        ;  the more base the sound, the greater was the
distance between the elevations.             The loudness of the sound appeared
to depend partly upon the depth of the crispations ; but this point I
have not determined           ; if the  specific gravity of mercury was less, or
that of the solution greater, the crispations would probably              be deeper
and the sounds louder.           Shallow crispations formed upon mercury in a
solution of iodide of potassium evolved no perceptible sound, although
their width was about -j-Mh of           an inch.   No loud sounds have      been ob
tained.       Rings of mercury 8£ inches diameter           gave no louder sounds
than rings       2\  inches diameter, although         the quantity of electricity
circulating     was much larger, the plates         of the battery referred to (4)
being immersed         9  inches deep in the former case and only          1  inch in
the latter case.        A    certain amount of time is occupied in the deve
lopment of the vibrations, and is distinctly observable where the elec
tric current     is feeble ; the vibrations and sounds being gradually deve
loped    as    the mechanical        resistances opposed by inertia,         gravity,
cohesion, adhesion, friction, &c. of the liquids              are gradually     over
come.      The vibrations are attended by movements in the                   mass  of

the liquids, consisting of currents of the electrolyte which flow from
the positive to the negative electrode, and of the mercury which flow
in  an opposite direction        ; these I  shall leave out of consideration, as
they are only secondary results.

described    (3).
                            Influence   of the Electrodes.
    13.   The crispations and sounds never (or very rarely, and under
conditions which I have not recently met with) occur at the anode ;
nor had the mass, size, form, or position             of surface, distance,     che
mical composition, or physical condition of the anode any effect upon
the direction of the rows of elevations, nor any direct effect (their
indirect    effects  will be described hereafter) upon the sounds.              The
elevations and sounds occurred with anodes              of all sizes  and shapes,
and in all positions      ;   also with anodes of platinum       wire and sheet.
A   ring cathode of mercury within a ring anode of mercury gave the
sounds equally well.           By using   a straight  and narrow strip of mer
cury as anode inside a narrow ring cathode, no difference in the size
of the crispations at different parts of the ring occurred.
    14. With regard to the influence of the cathode, the sounds
occurred as well with a very shallow layer of mercury as with a deep
mass.     Sounds were obtained with nearly as great facility in the central
pool    (if not  too large) by making that the cathode, as in the annular
portion.      The direction of the rows of elevations        was dependent upon
the form of the boundary outline of the negative mercury surface                 ; a
rectangular surface gave rectangular rows, and a circular surface gave
circular rows, and in each case the rows were parallel to the boundary
of the mercury surface : a small shallow ring of gutta percha held
upon the surface of a large rectangular cathode of mercury caused
 the rows of crispations to be circular inside the ring, whilst the rows
outside remained rectangular.              A  convenient apparatus,      though     a
 temporary one, for examining the direction of the rows              of crispations
 was made by       joining together rectangular pieces of thin sheet-glass
by sealing-wax in the form shown in fig. 6. The vessel is 3 inches
long, 2 inches wide, and 1 inch deep ; its lower part is divided into
 three equal portions by two strips of glass,          A and B, about \t\x of an

immersed in the outer pools.           The sounds
and crispations        were more definite       with
narrow      strips of mercury    \ih  of an inch wide than with wider             ones,
and with annular ones than with circular               or rectangular pools       :  the
annular      strip may be of any moderate diameter             ;  the best width of
mercury       to give a definite sound is about yy-th of an inch, because
there is then only room for two rows of moderate-sized elevations                       ;
when the rows are numerous, as in a circular or rectangular pool, the
 vibrations (and the sounds) are frequently irregular, and interfere
 with each other. On several occasions fine white sand was sprinkled
 upon variously shaped negative surfaces of vibrating mercury, but no
 signs of nodal points were detected.            The liquid    state   of the cathode
 appeared to be essential, as no sounds were produced on substituting
 a fine stretched platinum wire for the negative mercury.                   The anode
 nearly always contracts, and the cathode lengthens during the elec
 trolysis,   as  may be easily verified by employing segments              of rings of
 mercury for the electrodes.

 the glass vessel, fig. 2, open at its lower end, was placed in an outer

 and 7*5 parts        bismuth,   were placed in

    16.   The    mass   of the electrolyte is not essential to the sounds, it
only increases them by enabling a larger quantity                   of electricity    to
circulate    ;  the sounds were readily produced with the thinnest film
of liquid upon the surface of the mercury.                      Several experiments
were made to ascertain if the depth of crispations and loudness of
sounds would be increased by increasing the specific gravity                     of the
electrolyte by addition of various salts            ;  but no definite effects of that
kind   were found on gradually adding portions              of saturated solutions of
carbonate of potash and bromideof potassium to a good phonetic liquid.

    18. Numerous        experiments were made to determine                    the most
suitable composition of the electrolyte, also to ascertain the effects of
deficiency or excess of each of the ingredients.               1st.   With regard to
the hydrocyanic acid and hydrate of potash, the best proportions were
found to    be their chemical equivalents        (or a slight   excess     of acid) ; if
either the acid or alkali was in much excess,              the latter in particular,
films soon formed upon the mercury anode and stopped the action                          ;
a very large excess      of the acid      made    the solution      liable to become
brown     and lose its phonetic         capacity.      2nd.    With regard to the
cyanide of mercury,       if it was  omitted, or if it was present in too small
a quantity, the sounds did not occur immediately upon applying the
electric current, but only took place after the current                had circulated
some time (being occasionally reversed in direction),               and had thereby
caused sufficient cyanide of mercury to             be formed ; and         if it was  in
excess,   the sounds were irregular and feeble.              And 3rd.      If the  solu
tion was diluted with water, the loudness of the sounds diminished,
and by further dilution the sounds were altogether prevented ; if the
solution contained less than 10 or more than 50 grains of cyanide                      of
potassium     per ounce, the sounds rarely occurred.                   An equivalent
quantity of strong aqueous ammonia was substituted for the hydrate
of potash with equal advantage, except that the solution was much
more liable to decompose and become brown                ;  and it is probable that
the other     alkalies   might also      be substituted       for the potash with
success.    When a solution       becomes   brown, it loses its phonetic power ;
but this decomposition may be prevented, or at least greatly hindered,
   * In examining   these liquids, I observed that if mercury was shaken strongly in
a slightly decomposed    mixture of 2 ounces of strong hydrocyanic acid, 1 ounce of
water, and 30 grains of calcined magnesia, it remained in a finely-divided state
during several weeks, and might be washed many times with water without the
globules reuniting ; a similar quantity of alumina, or 10 grains of hydrate of pot
ash, was substituted for the magnesia with similar but less effectual results, which,
with the potash liquid,   were observed   only after it was partly decomposed      and  of
a brown colour.

 particularly in the cyanide of potassium solution, by not employing
 too great an excess of hydrocyanic acid, andelectrolysing the mixture
 with mercury electrodes as soon as it is made. From the various
 results obtained, it is evident that the sounds only occur under very
 special, limited, and probably complex conditions.
     19.  The  presence    of certain impurities    in the electrolyte did not
 prevent the vibrations       or sounds   ; for instance, chloride   of ammo
 nium, nitrate of ammonia, or bromide of potassium, added in mode
 rate quantities to the cyanide of potassium solution, produced no con
 spicuous effect.
    20. After the current has been passed a long time in one direction
 and is then reversed,      the crispations   and sounds do not occur at the
 cathode for a little time, partly because a layer of liquid containing
 an excess of cyanide of mercury has been formed at the surface of
 that electrode, and a layer of liquid with         a deficiency of cyanide of
 mercury has been formed at the other              electrode by the previous
 electrolytic   action ;  diffusion   of these layers by stirring the liquid
 hastens the reproduction        of the crispations and sounds.
    21.    By repeating the phonetic          experiment    many   times  with
 unguarded wires (4), the cyanide solution gradually loses its power
 of producing     the    sounds,    probably   from   acquiring  an excess of
 cyanide of mercury         by electrolysis, hydrogen being evolved and
 mercury replacing it : the loss of power does not result from an
 alteration in the electrodes, because with the same mercury and a new
 solution the power was restored, whilst with fresh mercury and the
same     liquid the power was not restored. The mercury remains
unaltered, except absorbing a trace of alkali metal, which is readily
removed by washing, and it is therefore not necessary to take fresh
mercury for fresh experiments.
        Influence  of Mechanical circumstances and Temperature.
    22.   In some solutions     (or with a feeble battery), where the crispa
tions did not spontaneously occur, a slight blow with the end of a
glass rod against the negative ring induced them to commence, and
also a similar blow sometimes stopped them.            Frequently, also, when
the vibrations have stopped, stirring the liquid reproduces them by
mixing the layers of altered liquid that accumulate about the elec
trodes.

    23. Raising the temperature of the solution to atoout 200° Fahr.
appeared to have no direct effect upon the vibrations, it only affected
them indirectly by allowing more electricity to circulate.               The appa
ratus employed for hot solutions was that shown in fig. 7 (15).
                       Influence   of the Electric Current.
    24.   In  nearly all cases the vibrations        and sounds were essentially
dependent upon the passage             of the electric current, and      ceased the
instant the current was stopped ; the exceptional cases being those
 already mentioned (10), in which the sounds continued a short time
 after the current was stopped       :  it is probable that in those     cases local
 electric currents were produced           by the action of the water upon a
 minute     quantity of potassium contained in the mercury,              and which
 had been deposited by the previous electrolysis.
     25. With regard to the influence of the direction of the electric
 current ; the vibrations and sounds only occurred where the current
 passed from the electrolyte into the metal, never (or very rarely, and
                                I
 under conditions which have not recently met with) where it passed
 from the metal      to the solution.       No direct effect of the direction of
 the current in the mass of the electrolyte              upon the crispations was
 detected by passing         the current       either   vertically or horizontally
 through the solution into the cathode.

     26. TwentySmee's        elements,   2\ inches    wide, and immersed ^thof an
 inch   deep,  with  a mercury    ring   If  inch diameter and i^-ths of an inch
 wide, gave     crispations -^th of an inch wide, and         a coarse base sound ;
 whilst four Smee's elements, 7£ inches wide, and immersed 9 inches deep
 in the same acid mixture, gave, with the same ring, fine crispations
  about   ^nd of     an  inch wide, and      a  high tone   ; and one Grove's cell,
  with   a  platinum plate      12 inches wide and 18 inches deep,          and the
  same    ring, gave very faint sounds of high tone without visible cris
  pations in the negative ring, and with fine crispations             if the pool of
  mercury     formed the cathode.            The crispations produced by the
  twenty small Smee's cells (charged either with acid 1 to 8 or 10 of
  water or    1 to 24) were less regular than those produced by ten ele
  ments of the same surfaces, or five pairs of the larger elements.

   produce a continuous sound, has been one            ;  and of Smee's cells three
   (28), except under certain special conditions (36) : the most suit
  able number of the former is two, and of the latter from five to ten,
  according to their size     ;  if this amount of power was much exceeded,
  the action became violent, then quiescent, and the sounds ceased.

  mersed    8\    inches, with which the sounds could                 be obtained    was
  two ; the pitch of the sound was rather high and very feeble                        ;  it
 lasted only about three seconds, and was not attended by any visible
^vibrations   :   2nd, immersed 5 inches, was three              ;  the tone was high
  and sound feeble, for a few seconds with visible crispations, and con
  tinued after that more feeble and without                 visible vibrations:      and
  3rd, immersed £ an inch, was four ; the sound was steady, tone
  moderately high, and crispations -j^th of an inch wide.                     And the
 largest   number that could be successfully used, — 1st, immersed 8k
 inches, was eight, and occasionally nine            ;   the crispations were then
 very narrow and the action violent            : and 2nd, immersed 5 inches,
 was ten, crispations very narrow and action violent.                  The largest sur
 face  of the   ten Smee's elements that would produce definite crispations
 and sounds was about           1\ inches    deep   by    7\   inches wide ; and the
 smallest surface of three elements that would effect it was about                   1  or
 2 inches    deep     by  7^ inches wide, and then only faint sounds were
 produced, lasting about two seconds, and unattended by visible vibra
 tions.    It is worthy of remark, that a small number of elements of
 large surface always produced small crispations and high sounds.
                     Influence   of Quantity of     the Current.
     29. The width of the vibrations           and the pitch of the sound are
 closely connected with, though          not solely dependent upon (40), the
 quantity of electricity which passes into a given amount of mercury
 surface in a given time.           With a surface of given size, the width of
 the crispations was invariably         decreased,   and the pitch of the sound
 raised, by either increasing the number of the plates (their depth
 of immersion remaining the same) or their depth of immersion.                        To
 ascertain the most suitable quantity of electricity, a voltameter was
 included in the circuit with the phonetic liquid             ;   the negative ring of

mercury was            2\   inches external diameter, and                     ^th of an     inch wide
= about     0-675 square inch of surface                      ;    the battery consisted        of ten
Smee's elements              7\   inches wide         (4) immersed           1^   inch in the exciting
liquid, and the quantity of hydrogen evolved in the meter whilst the
ring produced a moderate and steady sound, was 0*47 cubic inch in
three minutes          ;    therefore, with the solution of cyanide of potassium
given     (3),   the quantity of electricity required                        to give a good sound
in a ring containing                 1   square inch of mercury surface is equal to that
which will evolve about 0-232 cubic inch of hydrogen per minute                                          ;
this quantity approaches the minimum required for the purpose. In
a series of four other experiments with a ring of mercury containing
just one square inch of surface, and yielding a steady sound, the fol
lowing quantities of hydrogen were evolved in 3 minutes: — A 0-7,
B 069, C 071, and D 0-685 cubic inch ; that   0-233,   0230,                  is,   A       B
C 0-236, and D 0*228 cubic inch per minute: average = 0-2317
cubic inch per minute.
    30.    In    all   cases an increase              in   the quantity of electricity passing
(either by increase in the depth of immersion of the battery plates,
enlargement of the anode, diminution of the cathode, diminution of
conduction-resistance                    in the circuit, removal of films from the anode
by stirring, mixture  of strata of exhausted electrolyte     stirring,                     by
 rise of temperature of the electrolyte, &c.) was attended by an in
 crease in the number and     diminution of the width of the crispa-
                                             a
 tions,    until at length, by                    excessive   quantity of electricity passing,
 the movements became                      violent, and the crispations and sounds sud
 denly ceased.              Too large or too small                 a   quantity of electricity pro
 duced undulations (8) without sounds.
   31. With     given electric current,
                       a                                          a   wide strip of mercury gave
 wide crispations              and   a     base    sound, and         a   narrow strip gave narrow
 crispations and           a   high sound,          because       in the latter     case the quantity
 of electricity passing into given amount of surface was greater than
                                            a
 in the former.    Diminution of the conductivity of the electrolyte by
 dilution with water appeared to decrease more the loudness of the
 sounds than to alter their note, probably by decreasing the specific
 gravity of the solution, and thus diminishing the depth of the
 crispations.
    32.    In    producing           the sounds in            a   circular pool of mercury          by
 gradually immersing                 the battery plates, the first effects are furrows

in the Surface of the negative mercury parallel to the boundaries                     of
its surface, i.   e.  circular furrows,   one  within the other   ;  on immersing
the plates deeper, transverse furrows           occur superimposed          upon    the
others, and thus give rise to the little heaps or elevations (5, 6, 7)                of
mercury; the sounds           do   not occur until     the  latter furrows          are
produced.
   Similar    effects may be produced by mechanical means              :  if a watch-
glass  containing a little mercury is affixed by means of sealing-wax
to a flat and horizontal strip of window-glass           about 8 inches long and
3 inches wide, supported firmly at its ends, and vibration be induced
in the mercury by resting the end of a vertical glass rod upon the
strip of glass, and drawing wet fingers with pinching pressure down
the rod, and the vibration be gradually augmented, a similar series                   of
changes will be produced            by the gradual increase of mechanical
power to those produced by a gradual increase of electric power.
         Influence     of the Vibrations     upon the Electric Current.
   33.   It was    found, by interposing       a galvanometer       (with     a   short
and thick wire) in the circuit, that when the vibrations ceased, as
they sometimes do very suddenly, the quantity of the electricity
passing was instantly diminished, the needles shifting from 22 degrees
to  IS — an    effect, no doubt,    of exhausted solution accumulating at the
electrodes. To ascertain       if the vibrations  of the mercury and electrolyte
made the electric current intermittent, the current from three Smee's
elements, 7$ inches wide, immersed &£* inches in the exciting liquid,
was allowed to circulate through the primary wire of a RuhmkorrFs
induction-coil (kindly lent to me by Professor G. G. Stokes) (the
break-hammer being excluded) and the phonetic liquid, the ends
of two fine platinum wires from the secondary terminals being in
contact with a drop of solution of iodide of potassium, but no signs
of decomposition of the iodide could             be detected  with the aid of        an
eye-glass   ;   on applying,      however, the secondary terminals              to my
tongue, rather sharp shocks were experienced, and could                       be very
distinctly felt with the damp fingers of my two hands                ;   also a piece
of iron of proper size, and suitably held near or in slight contact with
the iron core of the coil, could be distinctly felt to vibrate.                If only
two of the elements,        immersed 8^ inches, were employed, and the
mercury electrodes reversed for a short time and then returned to

1861.]                                  231
their former position, and thus        a temporary  suspension of the vibra
tions (20) was obtained, no shocks were experienced at the secondary
terminals until the vibrations spontaneously recommenced — they
were then felt distinctly     ; nor were any shocks felt whilst a platinum
cathode of equal surface (one square inch) to the one of mercury
was employed as a substitute for the ring, although an equal quantity
of electricity appeared to be circulating ; nor were any shocks expe
rienced with two Smee's elements whilst the pool of mercury formed
the cathode,     because    no vibrations   of the mercury then occurred           ;
but on increasing the number of elements to four (immersed the               same
depths)    vibrations commenced, and induction currents occurred and
continued, not only whilst the phonetic crispations         existed, but also
whilst only the circular furrows (32), which emit no perceptible sound,
were visible.      The absence of induced currents with a battery nearly
but not quite strong enough to produce vibrations of the mercury,
did not arise from      a stoppage   of the battery current  ; for by placing
a voltameter in the circuit, conduction was found freely, whilst no
movements of the mercury could be seen.              The strength of the in
duced currents increased with the loudness of the sounds.                  It  ap
pears, therefore, that the intermittency        was not produced by simple
 electrolysis  of the solution, but by the vibrations, and     was not limited
 to such vibrations as produced audible sounds.
                 Influence   of Coils of Wire in   the Circuit.
    34 . Experiment      1. A coil of copper wire containing   1 54 feet   of  size
 " No. 26"    was included in the circuit with eight Smee's elements (4)
 immersed     8^ inches, and a phonetic vessel : without the coil the
 vibrations were very fine, and the sound acute and loud            ;  but with
 the coil they were coarse, and the sound base and feeble.               Experi
 ment 2.    A  coil containing     272 feet of   "No. 19"    copper wire in
 cluded in the circuit produced similar effects.         And, Experiment 3.
 A ring of    soft iron weighing 27     \ pounds,  outer diameter     12  inches,
 inner diameter     8 inches,   formed of cylindrical metal 2 inches thick,
 had wound upon       it in the manner of     an electro-magnet   152-^-
                                                                           feet   of
 four parallel and separately-insulated copper wires, size          " No. 1 7."
 Six pairs of plates, immersed 8 ^ inches, were connected in circuit, first
 with one length, and then with two, three, and four continuous lengths
 of the wire   ; every additional length of the wire made the vibrations

                                           232                            [Dec. 12,
wider, the sound baser and more feeble.                With three elements only
and the total length (610^- feet) of wire in the circuit, the crispations
were coarse and the sounds very feeble ; and on adding to the length
of the wire by interposing          an electro-magnet*        containing   390 feet
of "No. 12" copper wire, the vibrations and sounds were scarcely
perceptible. With twenty Smee's elements, 1\ inches wide and                 \  inch
deep,    crispations   -fth   of   an    inch    wide   occurred,    and were un
affected by introducing 240 feet of coiled double copper wire (size
"No. 17") into the circuit ; whilst with four Smee's, 7| inches wide
and   9 inches deep, the crispations were ^j-nd of an inch wide, and
instantly   became    -^th of an inch wide on introducing the 240 feet
of double wire into the circuit ; and with a single Grove's cell,
platinum     plate 18 inches deep and 12 inches wide, a high and very
feeble   sound occurred (without visible crispations               unless the pool
formed the cathode) ; but on interposing the 240 feet of double wire,
crispations of moderate width at once occurred in the ring, and
evolved a loud sound.           Other similar experiments yielded similar
results.    In all  cases   the greater the length of the wire (and appa
rently also the smaller its diameter) up to a certain limit, the louder
and more steady were the sounds             ;  and beyond that the feebler were
the sounds, until at length both vibrations and sounds entirely ceased.
   35.   It was repeatedly observed that the smallest number             of Smee's
elements, immersed 8£ inches, with which the sounds could, under
ordinary circumstances, be produced, was three ; but on interposing
the primary wire      of a RuhmkorfF        s  coil in the circuit, or the wire of
the electro-magnet (34*), continuous vibrations and sounds were ob
tained with only two elements             ;   and with the same battery and a
mixed     gas voltameter    t   in the circuit, it required       seven to produce
sounds without the coil, and five with it.
   36.   To further examine the influence of coils of wire upon the
range of battery power which might be employed,                I made a number    of
experiments, which are not necessary to be described in detail, as they

taining        a   massive iron core, enlarged the phonetic range of battery
power in each direction                   ;   it   enabled    a    less number        of elements and     a
less surface of plate to produce continuous sounds, and also enabled
a   larger surface             of the largest number (10) to                   be used     ;   in the latter
case      it   probably acted in part by diminishing                            the quantity of elec

900 and 1000 feet of size                       " No.   12   "),   coiled upon massive iron, also
enabled        a   less number            of elements to produce                  a   continuous sound,

the sounds did not occur for                        a   short time    ;    and in still feebler cases
the mercury required the assistance of mechanical disturbance (22) to
enable the crispations and sounds to commence.    It appears singular
that although            a     coil of wire must make the current more feeble,                            it
should enable            a      battery to produce the sounds which was already
too feeble to produce them.

bismuth         and antimony, interposed in the circuit with four Smee's
elements           7^   inches wide and            9   inches deep, had no perceptible effect
upon the vibrations.                     A    fine platinum wire          2   inches long, interposed
in a circuit with              a    battery and phonetic vessel, became red-hot, and
caused the vibrations                    to become       wider, and the tone of the sound
lower than when the wire was excluded, probably                                    by     diminishing the
quantity of the current.                        No new       effects were observed on using an

and more steady          ;  the sounds also increased in loudness, and their
tone rose       considerably.      On gradually     increasing    the number        of
elements from three to ten, and at the same time gradually diminish
ing their depth of immersion to fths of an inch, these effects of the
closed secondary circuit gradually and considerably diminished, and
ceased altogether when twenty Smee's elements, 2-J inches wide, and
immersed about         1   or 2 inches, were employed.        If the  current from

the coil being in circuit with a phonetic              vessel, and three      Smee's
elements, the crispations became a little wider and the sounds a little
more base.         Also     one length,  152| feet of "No. 17" copper wire,
wound upon the massive soft iron ring of Experiment 3 (34), in
circuit with seven elements, immersed 8J- inches, and a phonetic

double their       previous width,      and the sounds baser and long con
tinued.       And in   a second experiment        with the coil connected        as a

a similar       effect    to the coil itself, i.             e.   it makes the vibrations wider
and the pitch of the sound lower                         ;    and in making the crispations
wider, up to about             -p^th    of   an inch, the sounds also become louder,
and beyond that width the sounds become more feeble                                           ;   and the
presence of a closed secondary coil has the reverse effect, it makes
the vibrations           narrower, and the pitch of the sound higher.                               These
effectsof an iron core diminished on increasing the number of ele
ments to ten, and decreasing their depth to ths of an inch, and ceased  \
entirely on employing 20 Smee's elements                                2-J-   inches wide, immersed

tralize each other's effects.               The moveable secondary coil containing
                of " No.

and primary coil of the previous                         experiment (40), and six of the
large Smee's elements (4) connected as three : with the core and
without the closed secondary coil, the crispations were very wide ;
with the closed secondary and without the core, they were very
narrow ; and with the core and closed secondary acting together,
they were of medium width, about the same as                                   if   neither the core nor
the closed secondary were present                    :   the effects were very conspicuous.
These opposite effects of an iron core and closed secondary coil upon
the phonetic vibrations                 are analogous to their opposite effects upon
the brightness of the spark at the break-hammer of an induction-
coil   ;   the iron core increases, and closing the secondary coil decreases
that       brightness.         A cylindrical core of antimony                         9   inches long and
 2.j   inches diameter, employed instead of the iron core, had no per
ceptible effect upon the vibrations.

 then affected the tone of the sounds momentarily,               and the position

 similar and when they were dissimilar, but in the greatest degree
 when they were similar.

 with    a phonetic vessel      an electrolytic  cell containing     mercury elec
 trodes and a solution of iodide of potassium or dilute sulphuric acid,

 ing the quantity of the electric current.            Several vessels containing
 phonetic     solutions and annular       mercury     electrodes were     placed in
 one circuit, and sounds readily produced            in all of them     at the same

the magnet dipping into the electroly te, but no effect of the magnet

    I  have already shown* that the cyanides of the diatomic radicals
(at least those which form glycols) yield bibasic acids when treated
with potash, which contain four equivalents of carbon more than the
radicals    from which they are derived.            Analogy would lead us to
expect that the cyanides of the triatomic              radicals would yield with

  the same reagent tribasic acids, containing           six equivalents of carbon
  more than the original radicals.         Thus,   as we obtain   in this way from
  cyanide of ethylene (to take a particular           case) a  bibasic acid of the
  composition    Ca H0 Oa       (succinic acid), so from the tercyanide of
  allyle (C, H3 Cy3),    if  the analogy holds good, one ought to get a tri

     The following experiments were performed with the view of deter
 mining this point.
     One equivalent    of terbromide of allyle (C6 H, Br3) and three equi
 valents of pure cyanide of potassium were made to react upon each
 other, by exposing them, with the addition of a considerable quantity
 of alcohol, to the temperature of           a water-bath    in well-corked soda-
 water bottles.     After     16 hours' heating,    I  found that almost all the
 cyanide of potassium          had been     converted into      bromide.      I then
 separated the alcohol, which         I  assume contained impure tercyanide
 of allyle in solution, and introduced it together with a quantity of
 solid potash into a large balloon.          To this a reversed Liebig's con
 denser was attached, and heat applied by means of a water-bath,
 which occasioned the evolution of             a large quantity    of ammoniacal
 gas.    As  soon   as the     disengagement      of this   gas   had ceased,    the
 alcohol   was distilled     off, and the residue cautiously          treated with
 nitric acid in excess.      This liberates   an organic acid from the potash,
 and at the same time partially destroys a black tarry matter which
is present in large quantity.           The whole was evaporated          to dryness
at a low temperature, and the dry mass treated with alcohol, which
dissolves the free organic acid, but not the nitrate of potash which
accompanies it.        The residue obtained on evaporating the alcohol
was then neutralized          by ammonia,      and precipitated     by nitrate of
silver.    Finally,   the    acid was     separated from      the   silver-salt   by
sulphuretted     hydrogen,       and   twice   crystallized   from   water.     The
crystals   gave   on    analysis    numbers     agreeing very well         with the
formula    C„H, 0„.         I  obtained 41*24 per cent. carbon and 4*82
hydrogen, instead of 40-91 carbon and 4*54 hydrogen.                    I  have also

  This acid forms nearly colourless crystals, which                               are very soluble
in water, alcohol, and ether.                     They       have    an   agreeable      acid taste.
The free acid gives an abundant precipitate with acetate of lead,
soluble in strong acetic acid. The neutralized acid forms with per-
chloride     of iron    a reddish-brown              precipitate, from which               the acid
can be  partially removed by solution of ammonia.   Neither chloride
of barium nor chloride of calcium affects the neutralized acid. An
abundant precipitate, however, makes its appearance on the addition
of alcohol      to the mixed           solutions.        These reactions resemble those
of succinic acid.        It    is,   however, readily distinguished from that acid
by its behaviour when exposed to heat.                            Thus    it   melts when exposed
to the temperature of about                     158° Cent., and when subjected to                  a
higher temperature suffers decomposition.
   In order to satisfy myself that the nitric acid employed in the
process   I     have just described does not play                         a   part in the reaction
which generates         the new body, as            is   necessary        if   the equation given
at the commencement of this paper                       is   correct, I       have endeavoured to
prepare    it   without the aid of that acid.                       In this    I   have succeeded,
the body formed being identical                    in properties and composition with
that obtained by the first method.
   That this acid        is    tribasic, we cannot well doubt,                    if   we take into
consideration the manner of its formation, and the composition of its
silver-salt.      Nevertheless        I     will endeavour, by the examination of
several    salts, to obtain further evidence on this point.
 I      regret to say
                    I      have not yet succeeded in rendering the tercyanide
of allyle sufficiently pure for analysis.  On evaporating the alcohol,
in the midst of which the terbromide of allyle and cyanide of potassium
have reacted,     black mass
                    a           obtained exactly like tar in colour and
                                          is
consistence.        This I           partially purified            by solution        in ether.   On
evaporating the ether           a     brown liquid           is   left, which    is   very soluble in
 water.

II. " Notice      of Remarkable Hailstones which fell at Headingley,
       near Leeds, on the 7th of           May, 1862." By Thomas Sut-
        cliffe,    Esq., in    a  letter to Dr. Sharpey, Sec. R.S.
                                                       Headingley,   July  16tb, 1862.
   Dear Sir, —Allow           me    to offer   you some memoranda, which               I
made at Headingley,          near Leeds, on the 7th of May last, respecting
a hailstorm    which visited several parts of England on that day. It
appears that it arrived at Newark about 5 o'clock p.m., and was
succeeded by a tornado which did much damage                     ; then, pursuing      a
N.N.Westerly         direction    it reached Wakefield at 6.41.               The hail
continued to fall till about 6.58.           The afternoon at Headingley had
been remarkably        hot and close, and the atmosphere densely charged
with vapour     ;   at 6.45 the sky had become            so overspread      with dark
clouds that it was impossible to see anything within doors without
artificial light.     There    were    several   peals of thunder         and repeated
flashes of rose-coloured lightning.            The storm visited the villages on
the west of Leeds with especial violence, the hailstones knocking
down several       people, and breaking         nearly all glass exposed to the
w.s.w.
   The hailstones did not fall in        a continuous shower,          but in irregular
clusters   ; sometimes a field would           be   thick  ly strewed with them,
whilst an adjoining         one   escaped   with scarcely any        ;  one part    of a
greenhouse would         be much       broken,    and the remainder,           similarly
exposed, escape uninjured.           The district over which hail fell         was very
narrow.
   To illustrate the force of the falling            stones,    I  may mention that

                                                       2-10                                              [Recess,
circular holes were cut in glass without the sheet                                           being otherwise
injured.      I    have the end               of   a pendulous branch                  of   beech,    12 inches
long and -|ths of an inch in circumference, which was cut from the
tree, also several larger branches from apple and lilac trees, which
appeared to have been split from the adjoining boughs.                                             Some muslin
curtains     spread on the grass to dry were                                  torn by the hail                      with
numerous crucial rents.
      The hailstones           were       of different forms and              sizes.        I sketched             about
forty varieties; but            as many bear a certain resemblance to each other,
1   select four        of them for illustration.                These were taken out of deep
grass nearly half an hour after they had fallen.                                             Figures           1    to 4
represent them of the size and shape they had when                                            I    picked them
up.      The heaviest            I     weighed was only 2 ozs., but other persons
assert that they weighed some upwards                             of     5 ozs. each.              No.     1       had a
creamy white colour, with linear markings from the centre outwards                                                        ;
this variety appeared to constitute the nucleus of most of the larger
ones, around  which transparent ice had accumulated in rounded con
tinuous masses.    From the outside of some of the masses protruded
icicles ; the remains of two may be seen attached to the side of
No. 2. When the                 stones first fell, some           of      these icicles were                   l£ and
2 inches long,               and grotesquely           shaped.           It   has been asserted that
all the hailstones              had the white nucleus, but this was not the case
in our neighbourhood                  ;   35 per cent. of those               I   gathered were without
it,   and assumed             something of the shape of No.                            3,   which    seemed an
aggregate of crystals of clear ice.                     I      found one which was composed
of five large masses of ice, quite clear, and in size like five nutmegs.
There were some which did not correspond with any of the above
descriptions       ;    thus No.          4   has the round white radiated mass on the
outside of the clear ice.
I      annex meteorological reports for the day of the storm.

III. " On          the true Theory          of Pressure      as applied to Elastic
        Fluids."         By R. Moon, M.A., late Fellow of Queen's Col
        lege, Cambridge.           Communicated by Professor              Sylvester.
        Received       June 26, 1862.
                                         (Abstract.)
    It is the author's object —
    I. To show        that, in elastic fluids in motion, or tending to move,             it
is not generally true, or at least not accurately true, that the pies-
sure depends solely on the density, as is assumed                     in the ordinary
theory of the motion of elastic fluids.
    II.   To show that, within certain limits and under certain circum
stances,      pressure may be transmitted instantaneously from one point
of   an elastic fluid to other points situated at finite distances              from the
first, before any change has been effected in the density of the inter
mediate fluid — in a manner analogous to that in which, in the theory of
dynamics as applied to rigid bodies, force is assumed to be propagated
instantaneously from one point to another.
    III.    To show that in elastic fluids in motion, or tending to move,
 the pressure at any point in a given direction will consist of two
parts : — one depending solely on the density, which will be equal in
all directions      ; the other depending on the state of motion throughout
the fluid generally, and which will vary with the direction in which
the pressure is estimated.              The former of    these two constituents the
author       proposes to designate the statical pressure            ;   the latter,    the
instantaneous pressure.            The true pressure at any point in a given
 direction will be found by taking the sum or difference of the statical
 and instantaneous pressures, according to circumstances.

may be represented mathematically.

  A B C D is a vertical cylinder                            closed at the base
A    B, and having an air-tight piston C D capable                                      D
of moving freely in the upper part of it.
   Below the piston the tube is filled with air, which
at the time t is wholly free from impressed velocity,
but in which the density varies in the following
manner : viz., from A B up to an imaginary hori
zontal      plane    E F, the density is uniform                          ;    while
from      EF    the density gradually increases up to C D,
in such      a manner      that the effective force at every
point of the air between                 EF        and C D is exactly the
same, and equal         to/*.            Above the piston a vacuum
exists.  The piston is supposed to have weight,
but, for the sake of simplicity, the air under the
piston      is supposed to               be unaffected by gravity.
The weight of the piston is supposed to                                  be such
that      the effective force on each                         particle        of the
piston      is the same as that                    on each        particle of the mass of fluid
EC, viz./.
     If   the pressure exerted by the air which originally occupied the
space      AF   on that which originally occupied the space                                 EC     were to
continue during the time tl the same that it was at the time t, every
particle of the former mass of air (which we will designate as the air
in   A F)     would during           the time t , be under the action of the same
effective force/, and would therefore in that time describe the same
                                ft   2
length of path, viz.*^-                  ;    and on this supposition no change would
take place in the density of the air in                          EC      during the time         #,.      But,
according to the received theory, the pressure of the air in                                      A    F    on
that in     will continue unchanged until the density of the part of

  masses   of fluid    has changed.      Hence   change in the density       of the
  air in A F must precede change in the density of EC.
     On the other hand,         so long as the pressure     of the air in   EC   on
 the air in    AF    remains unchanged, the air in      A F will  remain at rest,
 and will therefore undergo no change of density.              But   as, according
 to the received theory, the pressure of the air in            £ C on the air in
 AF    depends on the density of the part of the         air in E C which abuts
 on the common boundary of the two masses                 of air, it follows that
 change in the density         of the air in   E C must precede     change in the
 density of the air in A F.
     But we have before proved the exact contrary, viz. that change in
 the density of the air in A F must precede change in the density of
 the air in    E C.     It is evident therefore that, according to the received
 theory, no change can, under the circumstances above supposed, take
 place in the density of either mass of air.
    If, however, the density in A F remain unchanged,            we have already
 seen that every particle         in E C will in  the time tl describe a space
            ft2
 equal to-^J-;     and   if  the density in   EC  remain unchanged, we have
 equally seen that every particle          of A F will  have remained at rest
 during   t1 ;  which is     a contradiction.    It appears therefore that       in
the case we have been considering             the received theory leads us to
an absurd result.
    It can   with still more facility     be shown that the received theory
leads to an absurd result in the following case.
    ABCD        is such a tube as before described     ;  but in
the present case we shall suppose it filled below the
piston with air of uniform            density in equilibrium,
the pressure of the air being such as to exactly sus
tain   the weight        W, of the piston.       As before,    a
vacuum is supposed to exist above the piston, and the
air is assumed to be unaffected by gravity.
    If a second     weight W2 be placed upon the piston,
we    know that the equilibrium will be destroyed.
But   if it  be true, as the received theory asserts,       that
the pressure of an elastic fluid depends solely on its
density, the pressure of the air on the lower surface
of the piston will       be exactly the same after     W, has

1862.]                                  245
been introduced       as  it was   before W2 was introduced ; and, since
action and reaction are equal and opposite, whatever be the pressure
of the air in the piston, the      same   will be the pressure  of the piston
on the air   ;  so that the pressure downwards       of the piston on the air
beneath will be the same after W2 was introduced as it was before ;
and the system therefore will continue in equilibrium after W2 has
been introduced ; which is absurd.
    By an argument too elaborate to         be indicated  within the limits of
this abstract, the     cause  of the failure of the existing theory in the
instance first above     considered is shown ; and it is proved that in the
second case the effect of the introduction        of the weight W, is instan
taneously to propagate through the air to a definite distance below
the piston     a finite  increase of pressure ; such increase     of pressure
having its maximum immediately underneath the piston, and thence
gradually diminishing till, if the tube be long enough, it finally
vanishes.      The depth to which the instantaneous increase of pressure
will extend will be defined by means of two considerations : — 1st, that
 the effective force on every particle of the piston and weight must be
 exactly the same as that on the air immediately below it          ; and 2nd,
that the aggregate moving           force developed in the piston      W, the
 weight W2, and the portion       of the air in the tube through which the
instantaneous pressure extends, must be equal to the moving force
 developed by gravity in W2 when free to move in vacuo.
    It is also shown that if instead of the weight on the piston being
 suddenly increased it were to be suddenly diminished,          exactly analo
 gous results, mutatis mutandis, would occur, — the effect of the sudden
 removal of part of the weight being instantaneously to diminish the
 pressure to a finite distance below the piston — such diminution having
 its maximum immediately beneath the piston, and thence gradually
 diminishing till, at a certain distance below the piston, the whole
 pressure will be exactly the same as it was before any part of the
 weight was removed.
    If the piston   were  wholly removed, the pressure of the air originally
 in contact with it at the instant of removal would be zero.
    It is then  shown that the addition to or diminution from the weight
 on the piston in the case last considered will produce no immediate
 change in the horizontal pressure in the air below the piston.
    It is next shown that in cases where there is no impressed velocity,

as   in the     case   first  considered    in this paper, the instantaneous
pressure pt may be expressed in terms of its partial differential co
efficients, and of the density at the point where the pressure is being
considered.
    It is also shown that, in the general case, where the whole or a
portion of the fluid is endued with velocity, the instantaneous pressure
may be ascertained by adding to the expression of the last paragraph
a term involving        the density and the partial differential coefficients
of the velocity at the point where the pressure is being considered.
    It is finally shown that, in the case of the transmission of a pulse
through a cylindrical        tube where the motions are small, the equation
of motion will      be  of this form,
                                                      -'
                                de      die'    dxdt
where x denotes the distance from the origin measured parallel to
the axis of a given stratum in the state of rest, y the same distance
at the time t, and        a2 and  V  are constants, the value   of a" being the
same as     in the ordinary theory.
   As this equation leads to the conclusion that there are two veloci
ties, it results that, except perhaps in very rare instances, in which a
duplication has been observed in sounds heard at very great distances,
the proposed correction of the theory of the motion of elastic fluids
will not practically affect the theory of sound.
    By the method adopted in the case of elastic fluids, the author
conceives     himself to have established that, in what are commonly
termed inelastic fluids, the pressure during motion will not be equal
in all directions.

    After adverting to the deficiency of existing knowledge respecting
the distribution and arrangement of the nerves of the liver, the
author states that he has recently made              dissections which  " prove
that all the arteries which         ramify throughout      the substance  of the

plexuses of nerves, which all arise from the semilunar ganglion and
solar plexus."
    In   a Postscript,     received October 4, 1862, the author           adds, that
from    an elaborate dissection       which he has made      since the date    of the
paper,
           " it  is demonstrated    —
    "   1.  That the nerves of the liver take their origin from ganglia
situated around the root of the hepatic artery, which are intimately
connected with, or actually form a part of, the semilunar ganglion of
 the great sympathetic.
    "   2. That the hepatic         nerves, thus originating,       proceed to the
liver along with the hepatic artery, hepatic veins, the            vena portae, and
 the hepatic ducts.
     "  3. That the hepatic nerves, on reaching the liver, send nume
 rous branches to the different lobes, along with the ramifications of
 the hepatic artery to every part of the organ, and that plexuses of

 branches       of the hepatic       artery  and surrounding        the   cystic  and

      Since the term      " pedal surface"     has but recently been definitively
  adopted*, it may        be well to state that    it indicates, simply, the locus
  of the    feet   of perpendiculars     let fall from a fixed point, the pedal
  origin, upon all the tangent planes of          a given surface.       It  is some
  times convenient, too, to regard the pedal surface as the envelope of
  a sphere, whose diameter is the radius vector from the pedal origin

  to any point on the primitive         surface.   The primitive     surface re
  maining unaltered,      the form    and magnitude      of its pedal vary,     of
 course, with the position of the pedal origin.
     In the first part of the memoir, of which the present note is an
 abstract, the volumes of pedals derived from the same primitive sur
 face,   but corresponding to different origins, are investigated, and the
 general formula found by means of which the volume of any pedal
 whatever may be calculated when that of any other is known.               From
  this formula are deduced the following new and very general proper
 ties of pedal surfaces     : —
     Whatever may be the nature         of the primitive surface, the origins
 of pedals of the same volume lie on a surface of the third order.
     It should be observed that the volume of the pedal is here under
 stood to be that of the conical space swept by the perpendicular,             as
 the tangent plane of the primitive takes all possible positions.              In
 this sense the term volume may clearly be applied to the pedals                of
unclosed surfaces.         It  is in fact to such surfaces that the above
 theorem applies      ; for when the primitive is a closed surface,       but in
 other respects perfectly arbitrary, the locus        of the origins of pedals
 of constant volume is a quadric, or surface of the second order.
 The whole series of quadric loci, corresponding to all possible vo
 lumes, constitutes a system of similar, similarly placed, and con
 centric quadrics, the common centre of all being the origin of the
pedal     of least  volume.
     From the three equations which determine the position of the ori
gin of the pedal of least volume, it follows that this origin always
coincides with the centre of the primitive,         whenever the latter pos
sesses such a point       ;   when, moreover, the primitive,     besides  being
closed, is everywhere convex in curvature,             and symmetrical      with
respect to three rectangular        planes, each origin-locus   is an ellipsoid
whose principal diametral         planes coincide with the planes of sym
metry.
    This is the    case with the pedals of the ellipsoid, which, ever      since
the researches of Fresnel on light, have been regarded with especial
interest.      Their properties form the subject of the second part of
the memoir.
    It  is shown that the volume      of any ellipsoid-pedal, the coordinates
of whose origin      are given, may be found      by simple differentiation of

            .
 1862.]                                 249
 the expression for the volume of the least or central pedal. Amongst
 the new properties of such pedals the following may be here
cited   : —
     The volume     of the pedal whose origin is at a corner of the rect
 angular parallelopiped described about the primitive ellipsoid is
 equal to four times the volume        of the central pedal, and to    twice the
 volume    of  the pedal at any     one of the eight points where      the ellip
 soid is pierced by the diagonals of the parallelopiped.
     Again, the algebraical sum of the volumes of the three ellipsoid-
pedals whose origins are at the extremities            of any three conjugate
 diameters    of a   concentric and co-axal quadric is constant, and equal
 to three times the volume        of the pedal at any   one of the eight points
 where this quadric       is pierced by the diagonals of its circumscribed
 rectangular parallelopiped.
     From this theorem several others         are deduced by assuming,        for
 the quadric in question, particular forms.             For instance, when it
 coincides with the primitive surface itself, we learn that the sum of
 the volumes      of the three ellipsoid-pedals whose origins are at the
 extremities of any three conjugate diameters of the primitive sur
face is constant, and equal to six times the volume of the central or
 least pedal.
     In this  theorem is included, of course, the special case where the
 origins of the three pedals coincide with the vertices of the primitive
 ellipsoid.
     If, for convenience of enunciation, we define the pedal-altitude at
 any point to be the altitude          of a parallelopiped   whose base is the
  square on the line joining that point to the centre of the ellipsoid,
  and whose volume is equal to that of the pedal having the point in
 question for origin,      it is found that the algebraical   sum   of  the three
 pedal-altitudes at the extremities of any three orthogonal diameters
 of a quadric, concentric and co-axal with the primitive ellipsoid, is
 constant, and equal to three times the pedal-altitude               at any one
 of    the eight points on this quadric         which    are  equidistant from
 its axes.      It follows, consequently, that this sum is not only inva
 riable    for   one   and the same quadric,       but for all  concentric    and
  co-axal quadrics which pass through          one   and the  same   point equi
 distant from the principal diametral planes of the primitive ellip
 soid.

 means of ordinary elliptic functions,        and the consideration     of the
 special cases when the primitive is an ellipsoid      of rotation.    The ex
 pression in question may be readily obtained on observing that the
 integral   V is reducible to the form
                                v=22M=,
 where the amplitude 6 and modulus           & of the elliptic function   F  of
 the first kind are determined by the relations

 By the introduction of elliptic functions, however, the great advan
 tages   of symmetry are necessarily lost ; and in investigating the pro
 perties of pedal-volumes, the above symmetrical expressions will in
 general be preferred.       An opportunity thus presents itself, however,
 of verifying    an expression    for the volume of the central pedal, the
 only one hitherto     calculated, which was first given in 1844 by Prof.
 Tortolini in vol. xxxi. of Crelle's Journal.

          Adhesion, as exhibited in Solid Bodies, Films, Vesicles,

          Sharpey, Sec. R.S.                    Received August 28, 1862.
     It   has long been observed that solid bodies floating                              on liquids
possess        the property of modifying the figure of the surface of the
liquid     ;   thus pieces of tinfoil or greased bodies depress the liquid
around them, while many others by the exercise of an attraction for
its particles        elevate    it,   giving rise to small mounds of liquid bounded
by concave lines.               It    has also been observed that likes attract likes
and are repelled by unlikes,               i.   e.   bodies having like or unlike powers of
altering the figure of the surface.                         These phenomena are generally
admitted to depend for their existence on the combined forces con
cerned         in capillary          attraction.         The following experiments              are
arranged to show that these effects of attraction are not peculiar to
floating bodies or to bodies partially immersed, and that the only re
quirement           is   that liquid should be associated with the bodies in which
the movement occurs.

specific gravity than water, be suspended by hairs in such                               a   manner
that they will both be partially immersed in water to an equal extent,
the points of suspension being at      little distance apart, and the
                                                         a
suspending           hairs consequently parallel.                When brought within the
proper range, they will attract each other in the same manner as the
floating       bodies.        In   doing so they necessarily describe                a   small arc
of   a    circle, of which the suspending                     hair   is   the radius,    and have
therefore not simply moved towards each other in                              a   horizontal line,

of water.   On depressing the disk till the two drops of water touch
each other, the paper or plate will be instantly drawn up to it ; or if
the plate at the bottom be heavier than the disk, the latter will be
drawn down.
  Exp. 4.        If a
                 film of wetted collodion be partially stripped from a
glass plate, on being loosed it immediately flies back to its original

and spread on a smooth sheet of glass, or be laid on the surface                        of
water.
   Exp. 5. Take two wine-glasses and dip their mouths into a strong
solution of albumen ; by a little dexterity two delicate convex films
will be obtained.  On applying the most elevated points of the con
vexities to each other, the films will be attracted and reduced to plane
surfaces strongly adherent to each other.        The permanency of the
films enables the experiment                to be repeated    several times in suc
cession.
   Exp. 6. When a soap-bubble is allowed to fall on an irregular
surface, such as a piece of lint or flannel, it maintains its spherical
shape    ;   but   if a   smooth surface, such as a sheet of glass, be brought
 into slight contact with        it,   the wall of the bubble will be immediately
 attracted and flattened out upon it.                  In like     manner, when        two
bubbles come into contact by their convex surfaces and cohere, the
 cohering surfaces become flattened             ;   and bubbles in    a   group cohere
by plane surfaces.
     Among other natural bodies, blood-corpuscles present certain pecu
 liarities of arrangement when withdrawn from their proper channels;
 thus when         a   minute drop of mammalian blood         is   placed upon   a    glass
 plate, the disks arrange themselves into rouleaux of well-known form.
 They become attached to each other in this                  case   by their biconcave
 surfaces.         They may also cohere by the           edge or circumference,        and
 give rise to      a   tessellated appearance. This latter arrangement           is   most
 easily obtained by placing            a   minute drop of blood on the under sur
 face of    thin piece of microscopic glass so
             a                                               as to be viewed     through
it;   the blood being in   dependent position.
                                a                            A     third mode of union
 occurs when gum, gelatine, mucilage of linseed, or very thick solution

1862.]                                 253
of starch is added to blood.        The corpuscles cohere more closely
and tenaciously than in either of the other conditions.              They may
be said to blend with each other, inasmuch as they form homo
geneous masses.      If the  solution of gum or gelatine be added to the
blood   subsequently to the occurrence of the modes           of arrangement
previously described, in such a manner as not to disturb them, the
already adherent corpuscles will cohere more closely, and the out
lines  of the corpuscles will    be  rendered less apparent,      till at length
homogeneity of appearance results.          The  same effect takes place      if a
drop of blood   be allowed spontaneously to thicken, but rarely to such
an extent as on the addition of gum, gelatine, &c.
   This last mode of arrangement includes both the former condi
tions,  inasmuch    as the    corpuscles cohere firmly not only by their
biconcave surfaces but by their edges also.
    The first   mode, or the formation        of rouleaux, may       be   closely
imitated   by preparing    a number     of small disks of cork     so poised as
to float in the vertical position    ;  however carelessly these disks may
be thrown into water, they will be found in a few moments to have
arranged themselves into rouleaux          after the manner of the blood-
disks.
    If a collection  of blood-corpuscles cohering in the second mode
be compared with the manner in which bubbles group themselves,
as already described, the similarity will be allowed to be very
striking.
    From the marked analogy existing in their modes of arrangement,
a suspicion naturally arises that the blood-globules are influenced by
the same laws as the bubbles and cork-disks.           A more  critical investi
gation, however, proves that the phenomena, although allied, possess
well-marked    distinctions.    The capillary action leading to adhesion,
as  exhibited in the cork-disks and bubbles, is not possible if these
bodies are completely submerged in liquid         ; but experiments carefully
performed with the blood-globules         demonstrate that both the forma
tion of rouleaux and the peripheral adhesion may take place under
circumstances in which it is absolutely certain that each individual
corpuscle is completely submerged.           Thus   if  we take two pieces      of
microscopic    glass, and, placing     them in contact, press them firmly
together and maintain them in opposition by a strong pair of pincers,
we shall still have a capillary space between them which will draw in

 a thin layer of blood, the corpuscles of which will form themselves
 into the most perfect and beautiful rouleaux.
      The plasticity of the blood-corpuscle            is unrivalled  by any other
 physical      body.      It  will   assume   all sorts of protean shapes under
 the slightest      influences.       Elongating to    a mere thread,     it will pass
 through      a narrow     chink ; it will wrap itself round an acute projecting
 angle, or protrude feelers and tails under the influence of currents.
 In its natural state it possesses sufficient elasticity to resume its
 original shape on the cessation of modifying influences                ;   but when
 gum or gelatine has been            added, or when the plasma has been per
 mitted to thicken spontaneously,              the corpuscle retains any form it
 may have assumed,           till again altered by   some fresh influence.
      The only artificial body capable of simulating            the visible modifi
 cations     of the blood-corpuscle         is an extremely delicate, moderately
 filled vesicle.
      The variations in its behaviour appear to           be due to the degree      of
 distention or flaccidity, which are doubtless under the influence of
diosmosis.
     When the corpuscles are apparently fused together, as after the
addition of gum, the mass runs about like a thick liquid.                   Parts not
previously       in contact      coalesce  intimately with each other.         Under
the influence of currents, these masses stretch at certain points into
fine threads, consisting of a single file of corpuscles, each corpuscle
being       elongated to       its  utmost,    and finally sever at the natural
junction of       a single corpuscle      with its fellow, the two stretched por
tions receding again into their respective masses.
      Familiarity with the various conditions which the blood-corpuscles
assume, and the analogous effects which take place in globules of
homogeneous liquids,             leads irresistibly  to the conclusion      that,  on
account of their great plasticity and the extreme tenuity and pliancy
of their enclosing membrane, the blood-corpuscles are, under certain
circumstances, subject to the law of cohesive attraction, in the same
manner as these          globules     ; and that, as with the latter so with the
blood-corpuscles,        changes in the character of the surrounding           liquid
determine the facility with which this law may come into operation.
     If,  as is well     known, we place on a non-metallic           surface small
portions of liquid mercury, they will retain their spheroidal shape                  ;
and     if any  two of them be made to touch, they will be attracted to

 1862.]                                    255
  each other, and one larger globule will result.               If  for the mercury
  we substitute water, using paper or metal as a support, we may get
  partial spheroids, which, being increased by repeated small additions
  till they touch       each   other, immediately      coalesce,    forming    a semi-
  ovoid    mass, instead    of  a sphere as in the case     of the mercury.       Mer
  cury containing other metals in solution           acts  like the water.
      Again,    if a small quantity of chloroform or bisulphuret            of carbon
  be poured into water, the greater portion will sink to the bottom of
  the water in globules of various            sizes.   The portion which floats
  may also be driven below the surface by striking                   it from above.
 These      globules, when in contact,          act precisely     as the    mercurial
 globules, i.     e. blend with each other.        They frequently adhere to the
 bottom      of the  vessel ; and on an attempt being made to move them,
 tail-like appendages         are  produced.      Creosote, castor oil,      and    the
 ethereal oil of male fern, all give permanent globular                 masses    when
 forced below the surface of water.               By agitation of the water, the
 latter globules may be           elongated into threads from half an inch to
 an inch in length, and again resume their spheroidal shape.                      If in
 the process of elongation the thread be broken through, two sphe
 roids result.        If, instead of water, we use in these experiments a
 solution of      soap, whatever form       is given by agitation to the masses
 of oil    is retained, and they possess no power whatever to blend with
 each other — the cohesive power is completely restrained.
      If a portion    of the  same   oil be shaken   with water,    we get a number
 of    minute     globules  ; and by placing      them in a cell
                                                                      un^"«JL[1'»J'   t

will   be seen to possess the power                 of adhering to         each other      in groups
and rows       ;     and on a closer examination                the cohering         parts     will be
observed to have undergone a mutual flattening, just as in the case
of the corpuscles and bubbles before mentioned.
   We find then that the blood-corpuscles, while beneath the surface
of the serum, adhere to                   each     other, sometimes by their biconcave
surfaces, so as to form rouleaux, sometimes by their peripheries, and
sometimes in both ways simultaneously.                          They adhere also to foreign
substances with which they come in contact, and on which they rest                                      ;
and then currents in the liquor sanguinis give rise to tail-like pro
cesses.       An adherent   of corpuscles is capable of being elon
                                    mass
gated, and frequently gives way in the centre, when the two parts
recede into          their respective       masses.
    These effects occur contemporaneously                        with changes in the liquor
sanguinis.           In   the normal state of this liquid, the corpuscles have
no tendency to cohere                ;    but the slightest           modification        of   it,   even
while within the               vessels, confers cohesive power                on the white cor
puscle    ;   and the further alteration which occurs in blood taken from
the body disposes the red disks to arrange themselves in rouleaux.
When the liquor sanguinis                  is   further altered by the addition            of colloid
substances, or allowed to modify itself spontaneously, the corpuscles
become        less    elastic, and evince          a   great tendency to float with their
surface upwards, and hence to cohere by their edges.

by currents in the serum.
                                                             is
from the circumstance                    that when the plane surface of                   a    cork- or
blood-disk         comes       in contact with the       side    of   a   rouleau,   it   becomes as
firmly fixed         as   ifapplied to the plane of its fellow.                 Every specimen
of blood offers numerous instances of this kind.
   These then being some of the peculiarities of blood-corpuscles, we
learn, on the other hand, that globules of homogeneous liquids
attract and become incorporated with each other when submerged

other liquids,            being, like the blood-corpuscles,                   influenced        in this

respect by variations in the surrounding       medium.       They may also,
by disturbances of this medium, become elongated ; and            if the  elon
gated mass severs, each portion falls back into itself and        becomes     an
independent globule.      They also  become   adherent to the solids which
they touch, and exhibit tail-like processes.         It  will  be universally
admitted that these latter phenomena depend on cohesive attraction.
Compared with the blood-corpuscles,        these bodies are rigid and un
yielding   ; how much more readily may we therefore ascribe the like
effects observed in the former to the same cause.
   It  has been urged that nothing approaching to the character of an
attractive influence has ever been observed with the blood-disks           ; but
it must    be remembered that the attraction      of cohesion could not be
indicated by motion between corpuscles at perceptible distances, but
could only take place when the particles of the bodies were so closely
applied    to each other as to be within the radius of the sphere              of
molecular    influence  ; and it is only under certain        special circum
stances that such an attraction could be even inferentially         visible.
    I have repeatedly observed such an attraction           exercised among
corpuscles under the only circumstance in which the observation is
possible.     After the addition of gum or gelatine to the blood, and
the cessation of the consequent disturbance, there will still be many
individual corpuscles and little circular masses floating sluggishly
and unattached in the serum.         After a time some of these will come
in contact with each other at     one point  in their circumference     ; and   if
 the disturbance in the liquor sanguinis is very slight, they will cohere
 at this point, and then will be seen to become gradually applied to
 each other for   half their circumference.    This is  an action   which can
 readily be understood as the successive     operation of molecular attrac
tion on the particles of the corpuscles immediately             contiguous     to
 those in absolute contact, but can receive no explanation              on the
 hypothesis of adhesiveness.       The best mode of observing this im
 portant   phenomenon      is to draw   the mixture     of gum and blood
 between two glasses in contact.

VII. "On           Stasis of the Blood, and Exudation."                      By Richard
          Norms, Esq.                 Communicated by Dr. Sharpey, Sec.                       R.S.
          Received August 28, 1862.
     Confusion has been introduced into the question of stasis, as related
to inflammation,             by neglecting to discriminate between the various
forms of stasis, of which there are four.
     1.   If the   frog's web be exposed to certain irritants {e.g. chloro
form),      the arteries are so constricted                that the heart-force         is tem
porarily shut off from the capillaries, which become packed by the
reflux of blood from the veins. This form of stasis is dissipated
immediately on the cessation of the arterial constriction. The blue-
ness      of the extremities consequent upon exposure to cold is probably
dependent on the same mechanism.
  2. The second form of stasis depends upon such enfeeblement of
the heart's force as interferes with the due propulsion of blood into
the extreme vessels.    It also disappears upon the re-establishment
of   a sufficient propulsive            power.
     3. The third form is that described by                   H. Weber       as follows        :   —
" If a     limb [of a frog]           be strangulated, there arises      in its   web    within
four to eight hours, without any irritation being applied, a stasis
which is identical with inflammatory stasis, except that after sixty
hours' duration             it will   be dissipated as soon as the circulation               is set
free."    The removal of this stasis by the re-establishment of the
circulation distinguishes it from inflammatory stasis, and shows its
relation to the forms already described.
   4. The fourth form of stasis is producible                       (artificially) by the
                                                   characteristics                      —
application of irritants, and has for its specific
            a.    It   is readily induced when the heart-force is unimpaired
          and the blood-channels are free.
            fl.   It   requires hours or even days for its dissipation, or
                                                                                        it    may
          even be irresolvable.
            y.    It   presents under the microscope            a   homogeneous appear
          ance, as     if   the vessels    had been injected with        a   tinted size or
          gelatine.         The outlines of the corpuscles       are undistinguishable.
                         "                     "   or   " inflammatory "     stasis.

characteristic, which is an accepted dogma. The following experiment
refers to the mode of resolution.
    March 24th, 1861. — On examining the              web  of  a frog which had
been inflamed with tincture of iodine the day previously,              I  watched
 a vessel in which the homogeneous stasis existed, and observed the
stasis to resolve in a peculiar manner.           A  normal current, such as is
usually    seen  in capillaries,  was circulating    in the direction from   A  to
B   (fig. 1,) and impinging
                                            Fig. 1.                Kg. 2.
on the contents of the ob-
structedvessel C. Thestag-
nation in the vessel C ap
peared to thaw as       it were.
The corpuscles were not
pushed      onwards      in  the
mass, but seemed         to take
on the appearance of the
 impinging current, and the parts so reduced from the homogeneous
 to the heterogeneous condition did not appear to contain any great
 excess   of corpuscles.     This action soon extended through the whole
length of the vessel, and immediately this was consummated a perfect
 current set in as in fig. 2. At the extreme edge of another division
 of this web    I noticed two stagnated loops as in fig. 3.          The circula-

tion around them was in full activity.              These   I watched for more
than an hour, and observed them to become gradually much lighter
in colour, passing from        a deep  red to a pale orange.        The point of
junction C retained its depth of tint much the longest. All this time
the contents of the vessels maintained perfectly their homogeneous
character.      At length all at once the outlines of the corpuscles be
came visible as     in fig. 4, and the circulation      was re-established.    In
this   case, as in the previous one, there was no pushing on before           of a
 plug of adherent corpuscles, but        a gradual     permeation of the liquor

shows the progressive resolution of homogeneous stasis in a capillary
vessel.
    November     1 4th,   1861   . —I  took a vigorous frog, and having observed
that the circulation was healthy, placed a ligature                  around a limb.
On again observing        I found    the circulation arrested, but the corpuscles
were very     distinctly   seen    with  -^-inch power, and floated about        with
facility when the web            was   touched.     I   now applied to the web a
small drop of chloroform,           and, on again looking, found many of the
capillaries had assumed the homogeneous condition.                    These observa
tions strongly impressed me with the view that homogeneous stasis
depends upon a new condition of the corpuscles, and not upon their
crowding.       The   cause     of homogeneous stasis appears to         be the  with
 drawal of fluid from the capillaries, leading to a local modification              of
the liquor sanguinis, and consequently to the cohesion of the cor
puscles with each other and the walls of the vessels, in obedience to
 the principles     explained       in my paper     " On     the Causes of various
 Phenomena of Attraction and Adhesion, as exhibited in Solid Bodies,
 Films, Vesicles, Liquid Globules, and Blood-corpuscles,"                 in the pre
                            '
 sent Number of the Proceedings.'
    It  is true that homogeneous stasis may occur in vessels previously
 packed with corpuscles, and we then find that the homogeneously
 solidified   portion    is of a much redder          colour than when it occurs
 in   a part previously       free ;  in both   cases   irritation is essential to its
 production.
    Again, corpuscular packing may arise as a secondary effect in
 consequence of the obstruction of the current by homogeneous stasis,
 the heart-force being unimpaired.
    If the plug   be pressed out       of the cut extremity of    a vessel obstructed
 by homogeneous        stasis, we find the corpuscles adherent to each other ;
 some have burst       ; we find also free nuclei.
     In   homogeneous         stasis a certain quantity         of colouring    matter
 escapes from the corpuscles, and probably               contributes   to the appear
  ance  of homogeneity.
     Stasis generally occurs first at the venous radicles, because                here
 the via d tergo is weaker.
     Having attributed         inflammatory      stasis   to a modification     of the

1862.]                                  261
liquor sanguinis, it is incumbent on me to show how and why this
modification    occurs.
   Whilst it must    be admitted that the cellular elements         of the tissues
have the power of imbibing and utilizing fluid plasma when it is
brought into immediate apposition         to them, there is not convincing
evidence that these elements exercise any positive educing force upon
this fluid while it remains within the         vessels.     Still  less  is there
evidence that, of two cells situated the one nearer to, the other more
remote from the vessel, the latter has any attractive power superior
to that of the former, which, to secure its nutrition on the theory of
positive   attraction,  it must have, for the plasma attracted by the
nearer cell would remain in the possession of that cell till removed
from it by a superior force.
   The law of diosmosis suffices to explain the supply of fluid plasma
to the cellular elements without recurrence to the hypothesis of a
positive attractive force resident in the cells themselves.              It is im
possible to doubt that such structures       as capillaries are diosmotic.
   The more braced the condition of the minute           vessels the less dios
mosis, and vice versd.       It is not during contraction        of the minute
vessels  produced by irritants that stasis occurs, but during the relax
ation consequent on such contraction,        —a    relaxation    which must      be
attributed to exhaustion of their irritability by the stimulus            applied.
This relaxation permits the diosmotic       escape   of fluid from the     vessels,
 causing an inspissation of the plasma within them, and consequent
 adhesion of the corpuscles constituting         inflammatory       stasis.   This
 escape  of fluid may    be termed   primary exudation.
    The muscular paralysis in question is not necessarily connected
 with neural paralysis, since it is producible in parts which, though
 abounding in contractile elements, are without nervous tissue, as, for
 example, in the umbilical        cord.    In fact the more completely the
 nervous influence is removed and destroyed the more sensitive does
 the muscular tissue become to irritants.
    Neural paralysis     does undoubtedly     play a part in inflammation.
 Whilst the nerve-influence is exercised over         a part,   it affords   a pro
 tective influence which renders the contractile elements less sensitive
 to local irritants, and consequently less prone to that absolute mus
 cular paralysis which precedes primary         exudation.      But the neural
 paralysis   does   not necessarily involve absolute muscular            paralysis,

although it facilitates its production.           In  corroboration    of these views
I  may refer to the well-known results following the section of various
nerves, e. g. the pneumogastric and the fifth.
   This muscular paralysis           is probably producible     directly by muscle-
sedatives,     as   it is indirectly by muscle-irritants.          Since diminished
nerve-force produces             hyperemia, and since diminished           nerve-force
furnishes the conditions            under which homogeneous,          '. e. inflamma
tory, stasis is most prone to occur,               we   see  why hyperemia and
inflammation          are   so   frequently   conjoined.     The experiments         of
Claude Bernard           on the sympathetic,       while showing the connexion
between neural paralysis and hyperemia, also indicate that neither
neural paralysis          nor hyperemia are       convertible    terms with inflam
mation.
   A     distinction     is drawn     between that diosmotic        exudation which
leads to homogeneous stasis, and that subsequent copious transudation
of fluid which fills up the interstices of tissues or leaks into cavities.              \
    If in   a frog's web homogeneous stasis has occurred in the venous
radicles so as to completely prevent the passage of the blood into the
veins, the current          in the capillaries    and supplying       arteries might
naturally be expected to be brought to a stand, as it certainly would
be   if the walls of the capillaries removed from the immediate seat of
the obstruction were impervious             ; but so far from   this being the    case,
the blood brought to the part is seen to pass on in a perfectly regular
manner without the slightest rebound.                 This  absence    of rebound is
an evidence that the           liquor sanguinis is passing through the vascular
parietes at the same rate it is being propelled                into the obstructed
vessels.
    It  is not   till the capillaries   become packed      with corpuscles and the
circulation is confined to the arterial trunk that any rebound after
the ventricular contraction becomes             apparent.     This rebound is the
cause     of throbbing in inflamed parts.
   The views here briefly given               seem to    me to form      a consistent
theory, supported by experiment as far as the subject admits of ex
periment,       in accordance with the phenomena of inflammation                     as
observed in the warm-blooded animals.

        ceived October 3, 1862.
    The Lichens on which        I have recently been experimenting        are two
in number, namely, the South American variety of Roccella tinctoria,
which is imported in considerable quantities from the neighbourhood
of Lima and Valparaiso, and is known in commerce              as
                                                                  " Lima  weed   ;"
and the Roccella tinctoria var. faciformis,            the same which        I  had

                                                                                  "
 formerly designated Roccella Montagnei           ;
 of commerce.
     Soon after the publication in 1848 of my first paper on this subject,
 Dr. Schunck * threw out the hypothesis that the various compounds
 produced        by boiling lecanoric, erythric,     alpha-    and    beta-orsellic
 acids with alcohol were all one and the            same    ether — the    pseudo-
 erythrin of Heeren.         No further light  was  thrown upon this obscure
 subject     till the publication    of Hesse's able paper in the March
  Number of Liebig's ' Annalen' for 1861.             The Archil-lichen which
 Professor Hesse investigated was that from Angola.              He extracted its
 colour-yielding principle— to      which, from its feeble acid properties,
 he restores the name of erythrin originally given           it by Heeren — by
  treating it with milk of lime, and precipitating either with carbonic
  or hydrochloric acid.       On drying and boiling the erythrin with strong
  alcohol, he produced       the ether which he terms orsellinic ether, the
  composition and properties of which he found to correspond precisely
  with those which Schunck and        I had  previously ascertained.       Hesse's
  formula for this ether is
                               C„tH7(C4H,)08.
     By treating it with chlorine and bromine, he succeeded in replacing
  two    equivalents    of hydrogen by      these elements,      producing     what
  he termed the bichloro- and bibromo-orsellinic           ethers.     I  have re
  peated Hesse's experiments, so far as the preparation of the bibromi-
  nated ether is concerned, and find, as will be seen by the subjoined
  analyses, that his statements are perfectly correct.

   The circumstance that the ethers, whether obtained from erythrin
or from alpha-orsellic       acid, have not only the same properties and
percentage composition, but likewise the same atomic weights, affords
a very strong confirmation       of the correctness of Dr. Schunck's hypo
thesis.
                               Orsellinate of Amy I.
   On boiling dried erythrin with amylic alcohol for several hours,
and removing the excess of alcohol by distillation, the residue yielded
on standing a crystalline       mass, which,   however,  I  was unable to free
entirely from resinous matter.         Consequently it could not be analysed.
It  formed platy crystals of considerable lustre.       There   is every reason
to believe, therefore,      that it was the amyl-compound          in question.
The attempt to form          a bromine-derivative,   which it    was   expected
might   be more easily purified,        did not furnish satisfactory results,
though such    a body was apparently        produced.
                         Formation of Erythroglucine.
   I  have already shown * that when the ethyl-compound             of erythrin,
then known      as   erythric ether, is boiled       with potash or baryta,
alcoholic vapours are given off, while orcin and erythroglucine           remain
in the solution.       I  have recently found that though         alpha-orsellic
acid, as   I had already established, when boiled with alkalies yields
orcin but no erythroglucine whatever, yet when the ethyl-compound
obtained from it is boiled with lime or any of the alkalies for five or six
hours, erythroglucine      as well as orcin is produced.     In order   to verify
this very unexpected result, the erythroglucine,         which was obtained
with all its characteristic properties,     was subjected to analysis.

    As therefore       the   ether    produced     from   two   different      sources,
namely,     from     erythrin and alpha-orsellic acid, when boiled with
alkalies yields erythroglucine, I think there is every reason to expect
that the ethers derived from lecanoric and other lichen acids, when
similarly treated, will likewise yield orcin and erythroglucine, thus
affording still further confirmation of the correctness of Dr. Schunck's
hypothesis.       It  now naturally occurred to me to treat the methylic
ether obtained from alpha-orsellic acid with lime, in order either to
procure     a homologue         of erythroglucine, or     to attain results      which
might throw some light on the constitution                of erythroglucine       itself.
The result of this experiment           was somewhat unexpected         ;  for though
several trials were made on a considerable scale, and the               boiling with
lime was continued, as before,           till the ether was entirely decomposed,
much orcin but no erythroglucine              was produced.     The   same negative
results were obtained when the methylic ether prepared from erythrin
was    subjected     to a similar       treatment.     It  appears therefore that
 ethyl is necessary to the formation              of erythroglucine      from alpha-
 orsellic acid, and that it cannot be replaced by methyl.
     From the very great analogy which erythroglucine                         bears to
 ordinary mannite (being, in fact, the mannite of the lichen series), I
 was induced to submit          it to the action   of hydriodic acid, in precisely
 the same     way adopted by Wanklyn and Erlenmeyer with mannite.
 A considerable quantity of erythroglucine was introduced into                  a retort
 and distilled with a great excess of strong hydriodic acid, while a
 current     of carbonic       acid   gas   traversed the hot liquid.           A dark-
 coloured oil of an ethereal odour, and heavier than water, mingled
 with abundance of         free iodine, passed over into the receiver, while             a
 large quantity of a black humus-like body remained in the retort.                   The
 latter substance was evidently an organic compound containing much
  iodine  ; but as it was insoluble in all the usual solvents, such as

 1862.]                                     267
water, alcohol, and ether, it was impossible                     to purify it.      The oil
was    agitated with        metallic   mercury,        to  remove free iodine,          then
washed with water, dried over chloride                   of calcium, and redistilled.
The quantity obtained in this manner                     was     extremely small.        The
 specimen examined was almost colourless, and boiled at 90° C.                           The
 residue in the retort contained another oil, boiling, with rapid                         de
composition, at a much higher temperature.                       Analysis furnished the
 following results      :—
    0-3615 grm. substance gave 0-3630                    COa and 0-1870 Aq, corre
sponding to 2739 Carbon and 5-75 Hydrogen per cent.
    These numbers approximate                to   those which       iodide of propyl or
iodide of butyl should furnish           ;   but owing to the very small quantity
of substance at my disposal,           I   was unable to subject this curious oil
to a thorough examination.
                                 Tribrom- beta-orcin         .
     I have ascertained that when bromine                     is added      to an aqueous
solution     of beta-orcin,      a  brominated          derivative     is formed, which
crystallizes      in needles.      It  is but slightly soluble             in water, very
soluble in alcohol and ether.              It  is perfectly similar in its properties
to tribromorcin,        derived from ordinary orcin, and most probably re
sembles it in constitution.           Unfortunately the small amount of beta-
orcin in my possession prevented me obtaining the tribrom-beta-orcin
in sufficient abundance to submit it to analysis.
    In  the present state of our knowledge, the following equations will
serve to throw light upon the constitution                 of   a few   of the more im
portant lichen-derived compounds                : —

carbonic acid, and the orsellinic acid into carbonic acid and orcin                   : —

IX. " On        the Theory of Parallels."            By Lieut.-General T. Per-
        ronet Thompson, F.R.S.                  Received August 4, 1862.
   More than thirty published efforts, from Ptolemy downwards,
attest the satisfaction with which the Theory of Parallels would be
seen established without          merging the difficulty into an axiom.
   As many of        these    are certainly not elementary,     it amounts to     an
admission that any knowledge              on the subject would      be acceptable,
even    though it left the necessity of beginning from the axiom with
freshmen.
   Believing that the generation of the straight line with the impos
sibility of two enclosing a space, and of the plane with the straight
line joining any two points lying wholly in the surface, may be rigidly
demonstrated from the property of the sphere, which Plato calls its
"perfection," or the faculty of turning about its centre without
change of place, — I am induced to submit whether some light may
not be offered by the following           : —
   Place two equal circles in the same plane, and let a straight line
rest upon them (spheres and a superincumbent plane might be taken,
but it is conceived the other is easier).              The centres remaining at
rest, let the circles dilate as by inflation, preserving always the
equality of the diameters to one another.
   It   would appear to be deducible            from the Platonic property,    that
the motion       of any point in the circumference during the inflation
must be perpendicular           to the circumference, and consequently at any
instant to the straight line which touches the circumference.                Also
 the touching       point in that straight line is at any instant impelled in
 a direction perpendicular         to the circumference and to the touching
line  ;   out of which     it  seems   impossible that the points of contact in
 the circumference and in the touching line should ever separate             ;   for
 that would imply a motion other than perpendicular               in one or both.
    If   this was supposed allowed, it would follow            from   making    the

1862.]                                      269
circles grow less         till they vanish, that the distance of the points of
contact in the incumbent line was always equal to the distance of the
centres.          We should therefore       be presented with          rectilinear quadri
lateral plane figures, of which, from the equality of opposite sides, and
the angles at the two extremities being right angles, all the angles
must be right angles.             From which it would           be an easy step to the
proof that the angles of every rectilinear triangle are together equal
to two right angles ; and so the Theory of Parallels be entered by
another door, and the twelfth               axiom     be a deduction          instead of a
groundwork.
  It would          be interesting   if the Theory    of Parallels should        be proved
traceable to Plato's property of the sphere.

                     to Professor
        tions made at Malta on a Planetary Nebula." By William
        Lassell,         Esq.,    F.R.S.
                                                                Malta, 26th Sept. 1862.
  My dear Sir, — In directing my large equatoreal upon the well-
known planetary nebula situated in M 20h 56m N.P.D. 101° 56'
(1862),      it   has revealed     so marvellous      a conformation          of this object
that   I   cannot forbear to send you a drawing of               it,   with   some descrip
tion of its appearance.              With comparatively low powers,               e.   g. 231
and 285,       it   appears at first sight as   a   vividly light-blue elliptic nebula,
with   a  slight prolongation of the nebula, or very faint star, at or near
                                                          a
the    ends of the transverse axis.   In this aspect the nebula resembles
in    form     the planet Saturn when the ring             is   seen nearly       edgewise.
Attentively viewing          it   with higher powers, magnifying respectively
760, 1060, and 1480              times, and under the most favourable circum
stanceswhich have presented themselves, have discovered within the
                                                       I
nebula  brilliant elliptic ring, extremely well defined, and apparently
           a
having no connexion with the surrounding                   nebula, which indeed has
the appearance of           a    gaseous   or gauze-like      envelope, scarcely inter
fering with the sharpness of the ring, and only diminishing                       somewhat
its brightness.          This nebulous envelope extends           a    little further from

 the ends of the conjugate than from the ends of the transverse axis                                                ;
indeed, it is but very faintly prolonged,                                 and only just              traceable
towards the preceding and following stars.                                     There is       a star near      its
border, northwards, in the projection of the conjugate axis.
     The breadth or thickness of the ring                                is,   unlike that          of Saturn,
nearly uniform, or equal in every part, so that its form most probably
is   either really elliptic, and seen                   by   us in   a   line nearly perpendicular
to its plane     ;   or,    if   really circular, and seen foreshortened,                            a   section
throughout       any part of               it,   limited     by the internal and external dia
meters, must be            a   circle.           In other words,         it    will    be    like   a   circular
cylinder bent round.                  It   could scarcely fail to bring to my mind the
annular nebula in Lyra, especially as there                               is    a   conspicuous central
star (proportionally,             however, much brighter than that which                              is   in the
centre of that nebula),                and yet the resemblance                        is    only rudely in
form, for this ring            is   much more symmetrical and more sharply de
fined, suggesting the idea of                    a   solid galaxy of brilliant stars.
     The ring    is   not perfectly uniform                    in brightness,               the south-pre
ceding part being slightly the most vivid.                                     The transverse axis             is
inclined to the parallel of declination about                            1   3°.      A    series   of micro-
metrical measures              of the length and breadth of the ellipse gives                                  a
mean    of 26"-2 for the transverse, and                      1   6"-6 for the conjugate axis.
  The accompanying drawing has not been at all corrected by these
measures, but the result of several sketches made during different
                     is
observations, and            is     a faithful transcript of the appearance                              of the
nebula to my eye, when most favourably seen.
   The object         is,
                  as may be supposed, one of extreme difficulty, re
quiring in the highest degree the combination of light and definition
in the telescope, and favourable state of atmosphere, — which will
                                  a
further appear when            I     state that       it   was not   until     I      was favoured         with
an unusually fine night, and had applied                             a   power of 1480, that the
whole of the details were brought out.
I      confess   I    have been greatly impressed                         by    the revelation          of this
most wonderful object, situated on what perhaps we may consider as
the very confines of the accessible or recognizable part of the universe,
affording   ground for the inference that more gorgeous systems exist
beyond our view than any we have become acquainted with.

       By Prof. Richard Owen, F.R.S.                 Received November G,
        1862.
                                 (Abstract.)
    The author details the circumstances connected with the discovery
of the fossil remains, with the impressions of feathers, in the Litho
graphic slates of Solenhofen, of the Oxfordian or Corallian              stage  of
the Oolitic period, and of the acquisition for the British Museum               of
the specimen which forms the subject of his paper.
    The exposed parts of the skeleton are, — the lower portion of the
furculum ; part of the left os innominatum ; nineteen caudal vertebrae in
a consecutive series ; several ribs, or portions    of ribs  ; the two scapulae,
humeri, and antibrachial bones     ;  parts   of the carpus and metacarpus,
with two unguiculate       phalanges,     probably    belonging     to the right
wing   ; both femora and tibiae, and the bones of the right foot.             Im
pressions of the quill-feathers     radiating    fan-wise from each carpus,
 and diverging    in pairs from    each side    of the long and slender tail.
The    above parts indicate the size  of the winged and feathered creature
to have been about that of a rook. The several bones, with their
impressions and those of the feathers, are described, and the bones are
compared with their homologues in different Birds and in Pterodac-
tyles.    Whence    it appears that, with the exception of the caudal
region of the vertebral     column, and apparently          of  a bi-unguiculate
 m anus,  with less confluent condition of the metacarpus, the preserved
 parts of the skeleton of the feathered animal accord with the ornithic
modifications of the vertebrate skeleton.          The main departure there
from is in a part of that skeleton most subject to variety.              Twenty
 caudal vertebrae extend from the sacrum in a consecutive and naturally
 articulated series, resembling in structure and proportions those of a
squirrel.    The tail-feathers  are in pairs corresponding       in number with
the vertebrae,   diverging therefrom at an angle of 45° backward, be
coming more acute near the end, and the last pair extending                nearly

parallel     with and    3|  inches beyond the last caudal vertebra.         This
feathered tail is     1 1 inches long and 3£ inches broad, with an obtusely
rounded end.        This novel and unexpected character of the tail is
owing to the constancy with which all known                existing and tertiary
birds have presented the short bony tail with the terminal modification
in most of them of the ploughshare bone.
      Professor  Owen next gives the results of investigations into the
 osteogeny of embryo-birds,          showing the number of vertebrae corre
 sponding to the anterior caudals in Archeopteryx which coalesce with
 the pelvis in the course of growth,            and the degree to which the
 posterior caudals retain a resemblance to those of Archeopteryx in
 the Birds with rudimental          wings.    From eighteen to twenty caudal
 vertebrae     may be counted in the young Ostrich.             In Archeopteryx
 the embryonal        separation persists with such continued         growth     of
 the individual caudal vertebrae         as is commonly      seen  in long-tailed
 Vertebrates,     whether Reptilian or Mammalian.            The author remarks
 that the modification         and specialization of the terminal bones of the
 spinal column in modern birds is closely analogous to that which
  converts the long, slender, many-jointed         tail of the modern embryo-
  fish into that short and deep symmetrical             shape, with coalescence
  of terminal     vertebrae into a compressed lamelliform bone, like the
  ' os en charrue ' of birds, to which the term ' homocercal '
                                                                         applies ;
  such extreme development and transformation usually passing through
  the heterocercal stage, at which,          in palaeozoic   and many mesozoic
   fishes,  it was arrested.      Thus he discerns in the main differential
  character of the mesozoic bird a retention of structure which is em
  bryonal and transitory in the modern representatives of the class,
  and consequently a closer adhesion to the general vertebrate type.
       The least equivocal parts of the present fossil declare it to be a
   Bird, with rare peculiarities indicative of a distinct order in that class.
   Although the head        is absent, the author predicts, by the law      of cor
   relation, a beak-shaped mouth for the preening of the plumage              ; and
   he also infers a broad and keeled sternum in correlation              with the
   remains of feathered organs of flight.
       The paper is accompanied by drawings of the fossil and its parts,
   and of homologous parts in Birds and Pterodactyles.             The author as
    signs to the fossil animal the name of Archeopteryx           macruru*.

                                      (Abstract.)
     The investigations of the Astronomer Royal and of other mathe
 maticians on the question of straight-crested parallel waves in a liquid,
 are based on the supposition that the displacements of the particles
 are small compared with the length            of a wave.     Hence   it has been
 very generally inferred         that the results of those investigations      are
  approximate only, when applied to waves in which the displacements,
 as compared       with the length of     a wave, are considerable.
     In  the present paper, the author proves that one of those results,
 viz.,  that in very deep water the particles move with a uniform
 velocity in vertical      circles whose radii diminish      in geometrical pro
 gression    with increased depth, and consequently that surfaces of
 equal pressure, including the upper surface, are trochoidal,
                                                                        — is exact
 for all displacements, how great soever.
    The trochoidal form of         waves was first  explicitly described by Mr.
 Scott Russell     ;  but no demonstration of its exactly fulfilling the cine*
 matical and dynamical conditions of the question has yet been pub
lished.
     In 'A Manual of Applied Mechanics' (first             published    in 1858),
 the author stated that the theory of rolling waves might be deduced
from that of the positions assumed by the surface of a mass of water
revolving     in a vertical plane about a horizontal           axis; but   as the
theory     of such waves was foreign to the subject of the book, he
deferred until now the publication          of the investigation on which that
statement was founded.

     Having communicated      of the leading principles of that in
                                   some
vestigation to Mr. William Froude in April 1862, the author was
informed by that gentleman that he had arrived independently                                  at
similar results by a similar process, although he had not published
them.
     The following is    a summary          of the leading results demonstrated in
the paper.
     Proposition    I. — In   of gravitating liquid whose particles
                               a mass
revolve uniformly in vertical circles, a wavy surface of trochoidal
profile fulfils the conditions of uniformity of pressure ; such trochoidal
profile being generated by rolling, on the under side of a horizontal
straight line, a circle whose radius is equal to the height of a conical
pendulum         that revolves in the same period with the particles                          of
liquid.
     Proposition    II. — Let     another surface of uniform pressure be con
ceived to exist indefinitely near to the first surface                 ;   then,   if the   first
surface is a surface of continuity                     is,
                                                        surface always traversing
                                               (that     a
identical particles),    so also       is   the second surface.   (Those surfaces
contain between them          a   continuous layer           of liquid.)
     Corollary. — The        surfaces   of uniform pressure are identical with
surfaces of continuity        throughout          the whole mass of liquid.
     Proposition III. —The         profile       of the lower surface of the layer           re
ferred to in Proposition        II.,   is   a   trochoid generated by       a   rolling circle
of the             with that which generates the upper surface and
          same radius                                                                   ;
the tracing-arm of the second trochoid     shorter than that of the
                                                        is
first trochoid      by   a   quantity       bearing    the same proportion              to the
depth of the centre of the second rolling circle below the centre                             of
the first      rolling circle, which the tracing-arm                  of the first rolling
circle bears to the radius of that circle.
     Corollaries. — The profiles of the surfaces of uniform pressure and
of continuity form an indefinite series of trochoids, described by equal
rolling circles, rolling with equal speed below an indefinite series of
horizontal straight lines.
   The tracing-arms of those circles (each of which        the radius of   is
the circular orbits of the particles contained in the trochoidal surface
which     it   traces) diminish in geometrical progression with                    a   uniform
increase of the vertical depth at which the centre of the rolling circle
is   situated.

   The preceding propositions agree with the existing theory, except
that they are more comprehensive, being applicable to large as well
as small displacements.   The following proposition is entirely new.
   Proposition          IV. — The       centres of the orbits of the particles                 in a
given surface of equal pressure stand at a higher level than the same
particles do when the liquid is still, by a height which is a third pro
portional to the diameter of the rolling circle and the length of the
tracing-arm,        or radius of the orbits of the particles, and which is
equal to the height due to the velocity of revolution of the particles.
   Corollaries. — The mechanical energy of                     a wave is       half actual and
half potential   half being due to motion, and half to elevation. The
                    ;
crests of the waves rise higher above the level of still water than their
hollows fall below it         ;   and the difference between the elevation of the
crests and the depression of the hollows is double of the quantity
mentioned in Proposition                IV.
   The hydrostatic            pressure         at each individual particle during               the
wave-motion is the same as                if   the liquid were still.
            Friction      between       a Wave and a Wave-shaped Solid.
   In     an Appendix is given the investigation                   of the problem, to find
approximately           the amount of the pressure required to overcome the
friction between a trochoidal wave-surface and a wave-shaped solid in
contact with it.  The application of the result of this investigation to
the resistance      of ships was explained in a paper read to the British
Association in 1861, and published                      in various Engineering            Journals
in October of that year.      The following is the most useful of the
formulae arrived at.     Let w be the heaviness of the liquid ; f, the
coefficient of friction ; g, gravity ; v, the velocity of advance of the
solid ;    L,   its length,       being that of a wave         ;    z, the breadth   of the
surface of contact of the solid and liquid ;                    /3,   the greatest angle of
obliquity of that surface to the direction of advance                          ;     P,   the force
required to overcome the friction then           :
                        P=^
                          ig

                                        L«(l +4      Bin' /3+sin4/3).
In ordinary       cases the value        of/ for water      sliding over painted iron            is
about •0036.        The quantity          Lr(l +4 sin2 /3+sin4          /3)   is   what has been
called the "augmented surface."                      In practice,     sin4/3 may      in general
be neglected on account of its smallness.

     The first part of the author's researches on the Tides of the Arctic
 Seas   was forwarded     to the Royal Society in November             1861, and
 contained the discussion of the Diurnal Tides of Port Leopold.                In
 the present communication       the Semidiurnal Tides of the same port
 are discussed, and the following      results obtained.       The eccentricity
of the moon's orbit is calculated from the parallactic inequality, and
found to be 0-5303.
   The solitidal interval is  56m.
   The lunitidal interval   4h 54m.

these, which follow from other considerations             of the tidal theory    ;
 and the author is unable to explain why theory should give results
so different.     The preceding, however, he believes to            be most    in
accordance with facts.

       Simpson,     M.B., F.R.S.      Received      October 23, 1862.
    In my last communication to the Society*               I announced that a
body having      the composition    expressed by the formula          C4 H4  I CI
 was formed when iodide of ethylene was subjected to the action                of
 chloride of iodine.    I have  since ascertained that the same body may
be obtained by the direct action of ethylene gas on the latter reagent.
By this process it   can be prepared in large quantity       with great facility.

It   is only necessary to pass the gas into a watery solution of the
chloride of iodine, wash the reddish oil which collects                   at the bottom
of the solution with dilute potash, and distil.             The portion which
passes over at about 145°          Cent. is pure chloriodide of ethylene.
  The specific gravity of the chloriodide at zero is 2*151. Heated
with an alcoholic solution of potash, it suffers decomposition, iodide
of potassium being formed, and             a gas given       off which burns with a
green flame.          This is no doubt chloride of aldehydene                (CiHiCl).
This reaction         goes far to prove that the true constitution                  of this
body is represented by the formula C4H3C1, HI, and not by the
formula Q, H3 I, H CI, proposed in my former paper.
     Propylene   gas derived from glycerine also yields an               oil when   passed
into     a solution    of chloride of iodine,      as   I   have already stated.         In
order to purify this,       I found   it necessary to distil it in         vacuo,   reject
ing what     came      over at the beginning        and towards the end             of the
process.      The numbers      I   obtained on analysing this body prove its
composition to be C6 H6 IC1.
     Chloriodide of propylene,        as   I   may call this compound, is when
freshly prepared       a colourless oil, having an ethereal odour and a sweet
taste.   Its specific gravity at zero is 1-932. When an effort is made
to distil it under atmospheric pressure, it suffers decomposition, hy-
driodic acid being evolved in large quantity.    Mixed with an alcoholic
solution of potash and distilled, it yields iodide of potassium and an
oily liquid (contained in the distillate and separable from it by water)
which is very volatile and burns with a green flame. This is doubt
less chloride of allyle (C3 H3 CI).
   The oil formed by the action of chloride of iodine on propylene
gas obtained from amylic alcohol,              I have   not been able to obtain in
a fit state for analysis.
                   of the foregoing process to other hydrocarbons
     The application
would no doubt place in our hands many similar compounds.

     If U=0 be the equation of a developable surface, or say a develop

of the equation        U=0 of      the surface;     that      is,   HU   contains   U   as   a

the developable replaces, as it were,                                     the hessian       HU,    is termed the
prohessian          ;   and since,       if r     be the order               of U, the order of                 HU is
4i — 8, we have 3r— 8 for the order of the prohessian.                                              If r=4,            the
order of the prohessian is also                            4 ;         and in fact, as is known, the pro
hessian is in this case                 =U.            The prohessian is considered, but not

almost all that is known on the subject.                                          I    call to mind that the
tangent plane along a generating line of the developable meets the
developable in this line taken two times, and in a curve of the order
r— 2      ; the line touches the curve at the point                                    of contact, or        say       the
ineunt, on the edge of regression, and besides meets it in r — 4 points.
The ineunt, taken three times, and the r— 4 points form a linear
system of the order r— 1, and the hessian of this system (considered
as a curve          of      one dimension,             or a binary quantic) is a linear system
of 2r—      6   points       ;   viz. it is composed of the ineunt taken four times, and
of 2r—         10 other points.                   This being               so, the theorem           is,   that the
generating line meets the prohessian in the ineunt taken six times,                                                     in
the   r—    4   points, and            in   the 2r— 10 points
                                    (6+r-4             +       2r-10=3r-8);
it   is   assumed that            r=5       at least.
   The developables which first present themselves                                              are those         which
are the envelopes of plane          a
                                            (a,   b,   .   .   .£*, 1)"=0,
where      t   is   an arbitrary parameter, and the coefficients (a,                                  b,    . .   .)   are
linear functions of the coordinates                                ;    the equation of the developable                 is
                                        disct(a,           b..         Jr, 1)"=0,
the discriminant                 being taken in regard to the parameter                                    t.      Such
developable             is   in general of the order 2n—                      2   ;   but   if    the second co
efficient       b   is       =0, or, more generally,                         if   it   is   a   mere numerical
multiple of a, then   will divide out from the equation, and we have
                                   a
a developable of the order 2n—       the like property, of course, exists
                                                               3

in regard to the last but one, and the last, of the coefficients of the
function.    We thus obtain developables of the orders             and                               4,     5,          6
sufficiently simple to allow of the actual calculation of their prohes-
sians.   And the chief object of the present memoir     to exhibit these                     is
prohessians             ;   but the memoir contains some other researches in rela
tion to the developables                    in    question.

     The  President       then addressed the Society as follows     : —
        Gentlemen,
  In  addressing you for the first time from this Chair as the President
 whom you have honoured by your choice, my first duty must be the
 mournful    one   of expressing our    deep regret at the loss we have sus
 tained of the eminent person who preceded me.                To the highest
 professional    distinction   and the scientific   attainments   appertaining
 thereto,   and to the indispensable        moral qualities  of truth, justice,
 and candour, Sir Benjamin           Brodie united other qualifications also
 highly befitting the office in which you placed him : — remarkable
 firmness and decision, accompanied by kindliness           and urbanity, and
 an unusually extensive acquaintance with the sentiments and opinions
 of different    classes   of society, particularly of those who cultivate
 Literature and the Arts.         The failure of his health and of his sight
 deprived us latterly of that habitual        attendance at the Meetings     of
 the Society, which he regarded as a duty and valued as a privilege.
Whilst    we mourn the loss       which  we have sustained by his      decease,
 we have the gratification of knowing that he          deemed the Presidency
of the Royal Society the crowning distinction of his most honourable
life.

 J862.]                                  283
     In adverting in the briefest terms which it is possible for            me to
employ to the choice which you have been pleased to make of a suc
cessor to this most eminent man,             I can    only say that you have
honoured me far beyond any pretensions which              I could have ventured
to claim for myself, and that it will be my earnest endeavour to
justify your choice by emulating the example of Sir Benjamin Brodie
in attention to the business and devotion to the interests of the
 Society.
     Since the last Anniversary       our country and our Queen have had to
 mourn the loss of the illustrious Prince, the active and enlightened
 friend and promoter of measures for advancing either the welfare and
 comfort of the great body of our people, or the interests of Science,
 Literature, and the Arts.         In this  great general loss the cultivators
 of Science have their own particular share. Qualified in             an eminent
 degree to estimate the importance of Science as one of the elements
 of the strength and prosperity of          a nation,  his sound and extensive
 knowledge      enabled him to appreciate the value of researches in the
 various    branches of natural        knowledge,   and to give them on all
 suitable occasions the advantage of his countenance and support.
     The Anniversary Meeting may be considered a fitting opportunity
 for apprising the Fellows generally of subjects out of the ordinary
 routine which may have occupied the attention of the Council in the
 past year.      Without too much trespass on your time,           I may permit
 myself to notice very briefly       one or two such subjects,    in the interest
 of which     I may hope the Society will warmly participate.
     The first of  these relates to a desire    which has manifested itself in
 the Colony of Victoria to      possess a telescope     of much greater optical
 power than any previously used in the Southern Hemisphere,                  to be
 employed chiefly in observations of the southern nebulae.                A   con
 venient     and suitable   site    has recently been      appropriated    for an
  observatory at Melbourne       ;   and a grant of £4500        has been voted
  by the Colonial Legislature       for the completion of the requisite build
  ings.    In July  of the present year the Board of Visitors of the Mel
  bourne Observatory      presented the following         address to Sir Henry
  Barkly, K.C.B., Governor of Victoria : —
      " The attention of the Board having been drawn to the following
  circumstances   : —
      " I.  That, as long   since as 1849, the facts brought         to light by

                                       284                              [Dec. 1,
Lord Rosse's Telescope       were  judged by the Royal Society of London
and the British Association for the Advancement of Science to be so
important as to justify them in making an urgent appeal to the           British
Government for the erection, at some suitable place in south latitude,
of   a telescope   for the examination      of the multiple stars and the
nebula; of the Southern Hemisphere,           having    greater optical   power
than that used by Sir        John Herschel      at the Cape     of Good Hope     ;
which appeal there is little doubt would have been successful but             for
the Russian war and the consequent expenditure             ;
     " II. That,   since that time,    Lord Rosse reports that he has dis
 covered systematic changes in some of the most important northern
 nebulae   ;
     " III.   That the interest and scientific importance of the solution
 of the problem of their physical structure, as well as the probability
 of its accomplishment, are thus greatly increased ;
     " IV. That some of the most important nebulae, and those pre
 senting the greatest variety of physical         features in close proximity,
 can be observed only in places having a considerable southern lati
 tude   ;
     " V.    That the geographical position and clear atmosphere of
 Melbourne render it peculiarly suitable for this work, and that the
 arrangements already made for the establishment of an Astronomical
 Observatory on a permanent footing offer great facilities for carrying
 it on   ;
     " VI. That,     independently    of the   especial  object to which such
  telescope would      be applied,  an Astronomical     Observatory cannot be
 considered     complete without an equatorially-mounted            telescope   of
  large optical powers    :
      " It was Resolved, —
      " 1st. That, in the opinion       of the Board, the establishment of
  such a telescope    in Melbourne would materially promote the advance
  ment of science.
      " 2nd. That, before applying to the Colonial Government for any
  pecuniary grant in aid of this object,     His Excellency the Governor       be
  requested to obtain, through the Secretary of State for the Colonies,
  an expression of opinion from        scientific men in England as to the
  importance of the results to be expected from it           ; the most suitable
  construction of telescope     for the purpose, both     as to the optical part

1862.]                                  285
and the mounting        ; its probable cost, and the time requisite for its
completion."
    In   October the President     and Council received from the Duke of
Newcastle, Her Majesty's principal Secretary of State for the Colonies,
a communication        in which their attention is requested to the copy of
a  despatch from Sir Henry Barkly, enclosing the address of the Board
of Visitors which has just been read, and soliciting the cooperation
of the Royal Society by a report on the several points on which an
opinion is desired.         The Duke further     expressed   his confidence in
the readiness of the Royal Society to do whatever may be in their
power for the encouragement of science in the Colony of Victoria.
    No time was lost in bringing this communication before the Coun
cil, who requested the President and Officers to prepare the draft of
a reply, to be approved at a subsequent meeting.
     Upon the general question, viz. the importance of the results to be
obtained by such a telescope at Melbourne in latitude 38° S., and on
the honour which the establishment and maintenance of the proposed
observatory would reflect on the Colony of Victoria, the reply might
well have been immediate         ; but there are other points on which the
opinion of the Royal Society is requested, viz. " the most suitable
 construction of telescope for the purpose, both as to the optical part
 and the mounting, its probable cost, and the time requisite for its
 completion,"       for replies to which more time and consultation are
 requisite.     It   happens fortunately that all these points were well
 discussed in the correspondence which passed between the members
 of the Committee          of the Royal Society       appointed    in 1852 to
 consider the steps most desirable to be taken towards the establish
 ment of a telescope of very great optical power for the observation
 of Nebulae in the southern hemisphere. This correspondence was
 printed, and some copies of it yet remain ; but since that epoch,
 a great step       in advance has been made, by the construction           by
 Mr. Lassell, at his own        expense,  of a 4-feet reflector, exceeding in
 dimension      the telescope contemplated      in 1852, by its conveyance
 from Liverpool to Malta, and by its employment for a twelvemonth
 past    at  Malta under the personal superintendence of Mr. Lassell
 himself.      It  is possible that the opinions      previously formed may
 be   in some respects modified by the additional experience         which has
 thus     been    acquired; the President      and   Officers   have therefore

                                         286                            [Dec.  I,
   placed themselves in communication            with Mr. Lassell,      and  with
   other gentlemen who took the most active part in the previous cor
  respondence, with a view of conveying in their reply the best infor
  mation which it is in their power to procure            ; and they hope that
  they may be able to submit the draft of the reply to the new Council
  at its first meeting.
      I cannot close this brief notice without congratulating         the Society
  on the prospect thus opened of accomplishing               an object    of such
  manifest importance         as to have induced the     Royal Society and the
  British Association to solicit jointly the aid of Her Majesty's Govern
  ment in effecting it     ; — and  however great their disappointment       may
  have been at the refusal which they received on that occasion, they
  will,  if the present hopes are realized, have no reason to regret that
  it has   been left to the Colony of Victoria       to carry into execution an
  undertaking    which may well be expected to hold a high place in the
  annals of science in all future time ; and thus to set a noble example to
  the other Colonies of the British Crown.             With such extensive    do
  minion, embracing almost every variety of natural circumstance,            it is
  only by the active cooperation of her colonies, according to the varying
  measure of their ability,        that our country     can hope to fulfil her
  scientific responsibilities.
     Another subject on which information may be interesting to the
 Fellows, is that of the progress and approaching completion of the
 Manuscript Catalogue of the Titles of Scientific Memoirs contained
 in the Scientific Periodicals in all languages from the commencement
 of the present century to the year 1860.          The formation of this Cata
logue was commenced under the sanction of the Council in 1858, and
has proceeded uninterruptedly          to the present time.      The titles are
written in quadruplicate, and are designed        toform — 1st,  a Serial Index;
2nd, an Index arranged alphabetically according to Authors' names                ;
and 3rd, a Classified Index, classified according            to subjects in all
branches of science     ;   the 4th set of titles remaining available for pur
poses not yet decided on.           The first of these, t. e. the Serial  Index,
already forms sixty-two        MS. volumes, and includes the most important
series   of Transactions and Journals      ; the titles in each series being ar
ranged in chronological order.        These volumes have been placed in the
Library, where they       are now available for reference; and fresh volumes

 1862.]                                 287
are added from time to time as they are completed.           The preparation of
the second, or Alphabetical Index, is considerably advanced. For the
third, or Classified Index, the greater part of the titles are prepared,
but the arrangement of the classification has not yet been finally
decided upon.
    The number of Titles       at present entered   in the Catalogue amounts
to about 150,000; and there yet remain to be added from our own
library about 10,000 more        ; besides  such as may be added from other
sources.    As was anticipated, numerous deficiencies in this department
of our Library were discovered in the course of the work.           The Library
Committee       has taken measures to have these made good.             In  some
instances imperfect series have been completed, and exchanges for new
series  effected,   on the application     of the Foreign Secretary to the
several Societies by whom they are published          ;  considerable purchases
have also been made        ; and by all these means the Library has been
largely increased in      a department     of essential importance to the in
terests  of all the    sciences.    The expense incurred in preparing the
 Catalogue thus far has amounted to .36980.             When the Manuscripts
of the three Indexes, Serial, Alphabetical, and Classified, are completed,
it is proposed to place them in the Library for the use of the Fellows
 generally.      In the course of the present Session it will be proper to
 consider the question of extending the sphere of their utility more
 widely by printing. It is scarcely possible to estimate too highly
 the advantage of rendering such indexes easily and generally acces
 sible to persons engaged in scientific pursuits.
    I will  now proceed with your permission             to the duty especially
 appropriate to the day, that of announcing the decision of the Council
 in awardingfour Medals in the present year, and of stating the grounds
on which those awards have been made.
    The Council have awarded the Copley Medal to Thomas Graham,
Esq., Master of the Mint, F.R.S., for three Memoirs on the Diffusion
of Liquids, published in the 'Philosophical             Transactions' for 1850
and 1851     ;  for  a Memoir on Osmotic        Force     in the 'Philosophical

    It  is well  known that when        a bladder nearly         full of alcohol is
immersed in a vessel        of water, the water will            pass    through      the
bladder and become       mixed with the alcohol,            though     little or none
of the alcohol will    pass  out to become mixed with the water.                   This
result constitutes a particular       case    of the phenomena described by
Dutrochet under the terms Endosmosis and Exosmosis.                        Ever since
the attention of men of science was called to these phenomena by the
French philosopher, they have attracted             a large share      of attention     ;
and many chemists and physiologists               have at different         times en
deavoured to define the laws that regulate these actions, which                    were
regarded     by many as proceeding from a force that had                      not pre
viously been recognized.
    It was  not, however,   till Mr. Graham adopted the simple expedient
of placing the two liquids under experiment in contact with each
other without the intervention of any septum, that a distinct idea of
the steps of the operation was obtained.              Mr. Graham proved that
these movements were due partly to the action               of the liquids on each
other, and partly to their action on the septum.                    In three papers
                     '                                  '
published in the Philosophical Transactions                 for 1850 and 1851, he
 traced the laws     of " Liquid Diffusion," and             was   thus enabled to
 show that the process in liquids          is regulated by principles          closely
 analogous to those which in earlier researches              he had demonstrated
 to prevail  in the diffusion of    gases.
    In these  experiments a number of small jars of about 4 oz. capacity
 were prepared with necks ground            to a uniform      aperture of      1
                                                                                 J  inch
 in diameter.     Into  these   jars the trial solutions       were   poured     : each
 jar  was then closed by a glass plate, and placed           in a  cylindrical vessel
 containing     about 20 oz. of distilled       water ;    the mouth being sub
  merged at least one inch below the level of the water.                     The glass
 plate was then cautiously removed.             Each solution having         been thus
 treated, the jars were left for several days undisturbed                 at a steady
  temperature.     After  a sufficient length      of time the mouth of each
 jar   was again closed    with   a plate    of glass, and the jars were with
  drawn.    The water contained in the outer vessel was then in each
  case evaporated, and the salt that had passed into               it determined by
 weight.     Saline substances were thus found           to be divisible into cer
 tain groups of bodies of equal diffusibility         ;   the rates of diffusion       of
  the different groups being connected by simple numerical relations.

    Amongst other important            points determined, it was found that           if
two substances which do not combine chemically and which possess
different      rates   of diffusibility,  be mixed, and be then placed            in a
diffusion cell, they may be partially separated by the process of diffu
sion ; and in some cases even chemical decomposition may be effected by
this   means.       Thus   if ordinary   potash alum be subjected to diffusion,
the sulphate of potash will diffuse out rapidly, and leave the sulphate
of alumina in        large proportion.
    In  1854      Mr. Graham communicated            to the  Royal Society a paper
on Osmotic Force, in which he examined the influence of a septum
upon the process of diffusion ; investigating particularly the class of
phenomena specially studied by Dutrochet.                    By   a simple modifica
tion of the apparatus employed, he was enabled                  to make his experi
ments quantitative, and thus to give them numerical precision.                      He
found that the nature of the solution             and its chemical       operation on
the material of the septum             were very important.            When animal
membranes were employed, dilute alkaline solutions                    absorbed water
rapidly, while weak acid solutions          gave out water instead       of absorbing
it; neutral salts having little            effect   in promoting       these  osmotic
movements.
    But   these investigations, important          as they are, constitute but the
introduction to the inquiry published in               1861,   upon the application
of Liquid Diffusion to Analysis.               In this remarkable memoir Mr.
Graham has shown that chemical compounds generally may be sub
divided into two great classes, which             are characterized by their rela
tion   to the process       of liquid diffusion   :  one  of these  classes he terms
Crystalloids, and the other Colloids as being typified by animal
gelatine.        The crystalloids form a solution generally free from vis
cosity, and always sapid.            They   are especially endowed        with  a ten
dency to diffusion through           a membranous septum.            The colloids, on
the contrary, such as gum, starch, dextrine, caramel, tannin, gelatine,
and albumen, are characterized              by a remarkable        sluggishness, and
indisposition        to diffusion   or crystallization.      When pure, they        are
nearly     tasteless.     Colloid bodies      do not necessarily belong to the
organic kingdom, though they are frequently met with among its con
stituents    ;  and owing to their tendency to undergo slow but perpetual
molecular        change, together with their          peculiar relations to water,
they seem to be especially suited to form the plastic materials                     re
                                                                        y2

quired for building up the tissues of the living organism.             Although
the two classes     are widely separated     in their properties, a complete
parallelism appears to hold between them. Their existence in nature
seems to call for a corresponding division of Chemistry into a Cry
stalloid and a Colloid department.           In  many cases the same body
may be obtained either in the crystalloid          or in the colloid modifica
tion.    The chemistry of the two       classes is distinct, and the reactions
of the  same body are different according as        it is in the crystalloid or
the colloid form.      Chemists have been enabled to apprehend properly
a number     of anomalous facts and discrepancies in the reactions of
various substances which were supposed to be identical until Mr.
Graham had called attention to this important             molecular    difference
in their structure.     He has shown that the crystalloid is the static,
as the colloid is the dynamic condition of a body : the usual tendency
of the colloid   is a gradual approach towards the crystalloid          form.
   The method by which Mr. Graham has obtained these important
results is characterized     by that simplicity      which    so  eminently di
stinguishes the mode in which he has proceeded during the whole                 of
this lengthened      and important      inquiry.    The memoir contains a
description of the process, which he names Dialysis, for separating
 a crystalloid   from   a colloid  ;  and it is scarcely necessary to insist
upon the practical importance which this method possesses.                 In the
examination of organic mixtures for poisons which, like the vegetable
bases, are crystallizable,  it will afford most valuable aid,    as it separates
the poison without adding anything except a little pure water. Many
organic colloids, such as gum, albumen, or caramel, may by its means
be readily freed from saline impurities, which can scarcely be removed
by any other known means.            Its application to the recondite pro
cesses  of secretion, and to many of the chemical changes taking place
in the living organism, need not be insisted on. The door thus
opened to further inquiry will no doubt be eagerly entered by the
physiological   chemist, who can hardly fail of obtaining new insight
into the obscure but deeply important           operations of the nutrition,
reparation, and removal of tissue.

     The Council have awarded the Rumford              Medal to Professor
  Kirchhoff, of Heidelberg, for his     researches  on the Fixed Lines     of
 the Solar Spectrum, and on the Inversion of the Bright Lines in the
 Spectra   of Artificial Light.
     The existence of definite rays in the light of     flames  coloured by
 various salts has long been known, and attracted the attention of Sir
 John Herschel as long ago as 1822 ; and in papers published a few
 years later, Mr. Fox Talbot called attention to the value and deli
 cacy of this character in qualitative chemical analysis     ; showing, for
 example, how the red produced by lithia,          and that produced      by
 strontia, might thus be instantly distinguished by the difference in
 the system of bright lines seen in their respective spectra.        He re
 marked    at the same time what an exceedingly minute quantity         of a
 metallic substance could thus be detected in a flame.         But chemists
 generally were not aware of the precious means of qualitative analysis
 thus lying at their command ; and, in fact, the elaboration of this
 mode of qualitative chemical analysis required a combination of
 chemical   and physical observations for which the same individual
 was seldom properly qualified and equipped.          It  was necessary, on
 the one hand, to prepare a variety of substances in the highest state
 of chemical purity, and, on the other, to take        a number   of careful
 angular   measures    of the positions of bright lines in the spectra of
 various flames.
    This labour has now      been  in great measure accomplished by the
joint exertions of Professors Kirchhoff and Bunsen, to whom indeed
is due the merit of having made this mode of chemical research
available to the scientific world, and of having caused spectroscopes
to be now in the hands of chemists generally, by whom              they are
employed with the greatest advantage in the qualitative examination
of inorganic substances. Already the method has led to the discovery
of   three new elements,      Caesium and Rubidium in the         hands of
Professor    Bunsen,     Thallium   in those of our own countryman,
Mr. Crookes.

                                                 292                                          [Dec.   I,
    In   the course of these            researches Professor                 Kirchhoff made the
remarkable discovery that flames which of themselves copiously emit
rays of definite refrangibility,                          bright lines
                                            and consequently exhibit
in their spectra, act at the same time as absorbing media of such a
character as to stop rays of those precise degrees of refrangibility,
when light containing rays of all kinds is transmitted through them.
Accordingly when        bright source of light, which of itself gives a
                            a
continuous spectrum, is viewed through such a flame, and the mixed
light, consisting partly of the light emitted by the flame, and partly
of the light transmitted through                  it,   is   analysed        bya   prism, instead     of
a   bright line on      a   dark ground, there               is   seen   a   dark line on     a   bright
ground, occupying exactly the same place.                                In order, however, that
this inversion should be observed,                      it   was found to be essential              that
the temperature of the bright source should exceed that of the flame                                  ;
otherwise, in comparing                the illumination of the place of the line in
the spectrum with that of its neighbourhood,                                 the loss by absorption
would not overbalance the gain                   by     emission.
     These results Professor              Kirchhoff           showed to be         a   necessary con
sequence       of Prevost's         theory of exchanges, taken in an extended
sense    ;   so that, from the appearance                  of   bright line in the spectrum
                                                                a
of   an incandescent vapour               (for   it   is   only in the state of vapour that
incandescent matter emits rays of definite refrangibility),                              itmight be
inferred      that the chemical            substance in the vapour to                     which the
 bright line was known to                be due, would also in the state                   of vapour,
 at the same        temperature,          act as an absorbing medium capable                           of
 exhibiting     a   corresponding dark line in the spectrum of light trans
 mitted through          it,— an       effect which          the vapour would still continue
 to exhibit at      a   lower temperature, unless the mode of absorption were
 changed by so reducing the temperature.
     This doctrine finds   striking application in the explanation which
                                   a
it   affords of the existence of dark lines in the solar spectrum.  The
 exact coincidence of the double line                        D      of Fraunhofer with         a   corre
 sponding bright line seen in many flames was pointed out by Fraun
 hofer himself;          and    a   similar coincidence was observed by Sir David
 Brewster       between        a   system of bright lines shown by deflagrating
 nitre, and     a   corresponding group of dark lines in the solar spectrum.
 The theory of Professor Kirchhoff leads us to expect such coin
 cidences      beforehand, and from the presence or absence in the solar

1802.]                                  293
spectrum     of dark lines answering to the bright lines observed in                  a
flame, and referable to a known element, to infer with a high degree
of probability    the presence or absence, in a state of vapour, of that
element in the atmosphere of the sun.                  Thus the presence of the
elements      sodium, potassium,      iron,    and some others in the sun's
atmosphere       has been    rendered     in    the    highest    degree    probable.
And the       same   reasoning that applies to the sun              applies also to
the fixed stars, which       are   known    to exhibit in their spectra fixed
lines   of their    own, while     many     of their lines are identical with
those of the sun       ; so that   the enormous         distance of these bodies
does    not prevent us from         drawing      some    conclusions     as to their
chemical constitution.
    It  is not, however, to be expected that            all the fixed lines of the
solar    spectrum     should thus be traced home to particular elements.
 It is well known that when the sun is near the horizon dark                     lines
 make their appearance in the spectrum which are not seen when the
 sun is high, and which plainly owe their origin to absorption by the
 earth's    atmosphere    ; though     what     the    particular   compounds       are
 which absorb light in this manner           is  still unknown.       It is very pos
 sible that gases, having a similar property of absorbing definite rays,
 may exist in the outer portions of the solar atmosphere, which, at the
 very high temperature         necessary for incandescence, would either be
 decomposed, or would have their mode of absorption so changed that
 there would no longer be a perfect correspondence between the bright
 lines which might        be exhibited by the        light emitted    at a  high tem
 perature, and the dark lines produced by absorption at a low tempe
 rature.
     In  mentioning these striking results due to Professor Kirchhoff,                it
 seems    right to refer to   some earlier researches        bearing closely on the
  subject.     In 1848   M. Foucault made the remarkable discovery that
  the voltaic arc was at the same time          a  source of light, giving out the
  double bright line D, and a medium                capable of absorbing light of
  that precise refrangibility    ;  but he did not extend the result to ordi
  nary flames, nor connect the absorption and emission by the theory
  of exchanges ; and indeed his observation, which was only published
  in ' I'lnstitut,' seems to have attracted little attention, and was not
  known     to Professor Kirchhoff when he discovered the general in
  version of bright lines.       In two remarkable papers published in the

                                             294                                   [Dec. 1,
' Transactionsof the Royal Society of Edinburgh,' Mr. Balfour
Stewart has made the requisite extension of Prevost's theory in the
case  of radiant heat, deducing important consequences which he has
verified by experiment.    The transition was natural from radiant
heat to light, and was made by                Mr. Stewart himself.              The paper
containing        this extension of the theory, and the experiments by
which he        had verified     it,
                                was published in the Proceedings of the

Royal Society' for March 15, 1860, and accordingly only          very               a
short time after Professor Kirchhoff announced to the Berlin Academy
his discovery of inversion.             Mr. Stewart, however, did not occupy
himself with the emission of rays of definite refrangibility, his expe
riments having been chiefly made on heated coloured glasses.
  The great number of the dark lines in the solar spectrum renders
necessary very exact determination of the places of dark and bright
                a
lines, lest an accidental juxtaposition               should be mistaken for coin
cidence.        To prosecute his       researches    with   success,   Professor    Kirch
hoff found       it   necessary to prepare    a     map of the solar spectrum com
bining largeness of scale with exactness to an extent not to be found
in any published map and to this laborious undertaking he vigor

Professor       Kirchhoff prosecuted his observations threw                     an obstacle
in the way of his progress. The constant strain brought on weak                    a
ness of the eyes, which obliged him to suspend his observations for
a   time.   It   is   understood, however, that the work               is   progressing, as
other observers are engaged in taking the observations which he
himself could not prudently continue.

 Construction of Astronomical Instruments, in the ' Memoirs of the
Astronomical Society ;' and his paper on Electro-magnets,                  in the
 'Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy.'
    In various                              '
                 papers published in the Transactions of the Royal Irish
Academy,' and in the ' Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical Society,'
Dr. Robinson long since showed that he had profoundly studied the
use    as  well as the mechanical      construction   of astronomical instru
ments, the various errors to which            they are   liable, and    the best
methods      of discovering and eliminating them       ;  and he proved him
self to    be fertile  in ingenious   suggestions for the improvement           of
instruments.
    It  is not, however, necessary to dwell         further on    these   papers,
as the      Medal   is more   especially awarded for the Armagh Cata
logue     of the places of 5345         Stars,   deduced    from    observations
made at the Armagh Observatory             between 1828 and 1854.            This
work has recently        been  published    on the recommendation         of the
Royal Society by the aid of the annual Government Grant.                 Most of
the stars have been observed five times, both in Right Ascension and
North Polar Distance, with the Transit Instrument and Mural Circle
respectively.       No  one who has not gone through         some work     of the
same kind can imagine the vast amount of labour which the reduction
of such    a mass   of observations requires.     The individual results from
each observation are given, so that we can form an accurate idea of
the precision finally attained.      Dr. Robinson has spared no pains to
study the errors of all kinds of the individual instruments employed,
either to correct them or to make the due allowance for them. Thus
he examines the divisions of the mural circle by help of twelve micro
scopes,   though only four are used in taking the actual observations.
The effect of the variation of atmospheric density on the rate of the
transit clock    is compensated by a suitably adjusted barometer form
ing part of the pendulum.         The true cylindricity of the pivots, both
of the transit and the mural circle, is ensured by the method, intro
duced by him, of using a diamond point in the turning.
   The materials which have       been accumulated so laboriously         and so

skilfully in this catalogue are of the highest value.               The stars ob
served are almost entirely those observed by Bradley,               and the com
parison of the observed places gives a great addition to our knowledge
of the proper motions of the fixed stars, and thus forms an enlarged
basis for our deductions respecting the proper motion of our system
in  space.
    Dr. Robinson       gives   a separate  catalogue of the proper          motions
which he considers to be established by the comparison above men
tioned.
    The duties of the observatory and the preparation of the above-
mentioned catalogue have not prevented Dr. Robinson from devoting a
large amount of attention to physical research        ;  as will  be seen  from his
papers on the Lifting Power of an Electro-magnet, published in the
 ' Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy,' which contain the results
 of careful quantitative experiments extending, as far as other avoca
 tions permitted, over a period of about ten years ; those on the curious
 subject of the Stratification of the Electric Discharge, published in the
 'Proceedings' of the same Academy ; and more recently an elaborate
 paper
           " On Spectra of Electric Light, as modified by the Nature of
 the Electrodes and the Media of Discharge,"             presented to the Royal
 Society on the      1 9th  of last June, and since ordered       to be printed in
 the ' Philosophical Transactions.'       This last paper contains the results
 of careful measures of the angular position of the bright lines observed
 in no     less than   1 73 spectra.    The results would        seem   to indicate
 that in this branch of physics, which           has recently excited a great
  deal of attention, overhasty generalizations       have    in some cases been
 made    ;  but however that may        be, the data collected in        this paper
  can hardly fail to be      of high importance in the      event    of any theory
  being propounded         to account   for the positions and variations           of
 brightness of the lines.

     In   presenting     you with this    Medal to      be  transmitted      to Dr.
  Robinson,     I  may express the regret of the Royal Society that he
  should have been prevented by indisposition           from attending person
  ally to    receive our congratulations     on the accomplishment            of the
  great work on which he has expended so vast an amount of labour                    ;
  and our assurance of the warm welcome with which                 the Society will

greet his future contributions,     whether on astronomical or physical
subjects.
    The Council have awarded      one   of the Royal Medals to Dr. Alex
ander William Williamson, Professor of Chemistry and of Practical
Chemistry in University College, London, for his researches on the
Compound Ethers, and his subsequent communications in Organic
Chemistry.
     One of the most important discussions entered upon by chemists
in the last few years has     been the true molecular arrangement        of or
dinary vinic alcohol and ether.        The interest shown in the subject,
both    at home and abroad, may be ascribed to the opinion           generally
prevailing    amongst chemists, that upon the correct appreciation of
the phenomena involved in the process of etherification must depend
 the successful unlocking of many secrets connected with organic
 chemistry.
     Gay-Lussac and the French school regarded ether as defiant             gas
 combined with one molecule of water, and alcohol as olefiant               gas
 combined      with two molecules of water.         Berzelius   thought   ether
 and alcohol were oxides of different        hydrocarbons   ;  and, seeing the
 difficulty of explaining      the process of etherification      by the then
 current hypothesis,       supposed   that  a peculiar  force was exerted, to
 which was given the name of Catalysis.           Lastly, the German school,
  with Liebig   at their head, regarded ether as the oxide    of the unisolated
  radical ethyl, and alcohol as its hydrated oxide.
      Dr. Williamson here took up the question, and showed that when
  sulphuric acid and alcohol are brought together, a change of place
  is effected between the ethyl of the sulphovinic acid produced and
  an atom of hydrogen of the alcohol, and consequently that the ether
  which results from the action      is compounded      of a double molecule
  of ethyl and    a single molecule  of oxygen.
      These views were put beyond the range of mere hypothesis by a hap
  pily conceived    series of experiments, which resulted in the discovery
   of the important substances known as the "compound" or "mixed
   ethers." Dr. Williamson showed that these bodies are formed upon
   the type of water, the two hydrogen atoms of which are capable             of
   replacement by different hydrocarbon       radicals.
      These considerations were embodied in two papers which have had

                                      298                           [Dec.   1,
 a marked influence upon the development of organic chemistry            ; an
 early fruit of which was the discovery by Gerhardt of the organic
 anhydrous     acids, which    may be regarded as the application     of Dr.
 Williamson's    processes  to negative instead of positive radicals.
     A  large field of inquiry having been thus opened, a suggestive
 paper on the Constitution       of Salts and Acids speedily followed, in
 which Dr. Williamson showed that acetic acid is formed by the sub
 stitution of one atom of oxygen for two atoms of hydrogen in alcohol.
 Acetic acid, thus regarded, encloses the new radical othyl or acetyl.
    The question of types and the doctrine of substitution      are  further
 elaborated in six memoirs read before the Royal Society in 1854.
     In these researches    are exemplified  the rarely associated powers
 of discovering new facts, and of evolving from them truths of     a  higher
 order.    They also show that the scientific importance of substances
 must not be estimated by the bare knowledge gained from their ulti
 mate analysis, but that valuable generalizations may follow from the
 establishment of correct ideas of their molecular grouping     ;  generali
 zations, indeed, which effect a new insight into nature, and to a great
 extent anticipate a rich field of subsequent research.
       Professor Williamson,
    In  presenting you with this Medal, testifying the value which the
Royal Society attaches       to the researches on which     you have been
engaged,    I would venture to express on their behalf the hope that,
in the many years which        we trust  are yet before you, science    may
continue    to profit,  and    may profit largely,  by your exertions in
researches    for which you have shown yourself          to  be so   highly
qualified.

     " Observations    on several  Mineral Substances, including their
       Analysis, &c."       By Dr. T. L. Phipson, F.C.S.           Commu

                                 (Abstract.)
    In this   paper the author gives an account of a series of mineral
 substances more or less recently discovered, and several    of which have
 been lately imported into England to be utilized in various arts and
 manufactures.      Fourteen of these substances have been submitted to
 careful analysis by the author, and their chemical composition and
 properties determined.      The minerals described include —
    1. Sombrerite, a phosphate of alumina and lime from the Antilles.
2.   A  fossil phosphate    from   the Isle of Wight,     a  most    perfect
description of wood fossilized by apatite and fluorine.         3.  A phos
phate from the West Indies, derived from the decomposition of guano.
4. Bicarbonate of ammonia from the Chinca Isles, off the coast            of
Peru, for specimens of which the author is indebted to Capt. Marcus
Lowther, R.N., and which appears never to have been completely
analysed before.      5. Tinkalzite, a hydrous borate of lime and soda
from   Peru, already utilized    in the arts   as a substitute   for borax.
6. Stibiconise,   from Borneo,     a hydrated   antimonious    acid,  which

has been lately imported into England              in notable quantities.       7.  A
modern limestone rock, forming on the coast of Flanders.                     8. The
Limon     de la Hesboye, a loam which covers a large portion            of Belgium
and part       of France,      and which       is extremely   remarkable     for   its
fertility  :  although    it contains upwards of 90 per cent. of sand, its
analysis shows that it possesses all the chemical ingredients necessary
to form      a fertile   soil.    9. Vitriolite, or natural      sulphate of iron,
recently     discovered in Turkey, and which              has been    analysed by
M. Pisani and the author         ;   it is remarkable from the fact that part of
the iron is replaced by copper, without changing the crystalline form
or the percentage of water.               10.  An oolitic hematite from Namur
(Belgium), remarkable for its peculiar structure, which may have been
caused by the incrustation of insects' eggs (Notonecta), as we see is
the case with the oolitic limestone of the Mexican lakes.                  1 1.  The
argentiferous quartz or gossan of Cornwall, in which the author finds
that the silver is contained as Fahlerz (grey copper)             : when the grey
copper is freely disseminated through the rock, the percentage of
silver (metallic) averages about 0-2 per cent.; but in the ordinary
yellow and brown gossan, where the grey copper is not visible, the
silver averages about 0*04 per cent., or           14^ oz. to  the ton.    12.   The
i serine sands of Australia and Bourbon Isle.                   13.  A bituminous
conglomerate from Australia,             remarkable as containing nearly 40 per
cent*   of petroleum and bitumen, with carbonate of lime, sand, and
mica, &c. ; it exudes from a tertiary limestone on the river Murray.
 14.  The arseniferous sulphur of Naples, which, according to the
author's analysis, contains, besides 11 *162 per cent. of arsenic, about
0-264 of selenium, which can be easily extracted from it in a pure
state.
    Of   each   of  these substances the author gives       in the present paper
a detailed      description and a complete analysis, believing that such
researches      are   not devoid of utility.        As most of the substances
alluded to are applicable in some way or other to the wants of man,
the author is continuing           these investigations    as opportunity     offers,
by submitting        to careful analysis the different new or little-known
minerals which happen to come under his notice.

II. "On         the Strains in the                   Interior of Beams."                 By George
        Biddell Airy, F.R.S.,                       Astronomer Royal.                  Received       No
        vember 6, 1862.
                                                  (Abstract.)
   The author states that he had long desired to                                   possess a theory
which      should         enable him          to compute            numerically        the strains       on
every point in the interior of a beam or girder, but that no memoirs
or treatises had given him the least assistance.                                 He had therefore
constructed         a theory,          which solves completely                   the    problems         for
which he wanted              it,   and which appears to admit of application                               at
least to all ordinary cases.
   The theory contemplates forces acting in                                one   plane.      A       beam,
therefore,     is   considered as            a     lamina      in   a   vertical plane, — the same
considerations            applying to every vertical lamina of which                             a   beam
may be conceived to be composed.
  The author              remarks          that    it   is   unnecessary to recognize                every
possible strain in         a     beam.        Metallic        masses are usually in          a   state   of
strain from circumstances                    occurring         in their formation        ;   but such
strains are not the subject                       of the present investigation, which                    is
intended to ascertain only those strains which are created by the
weight of the beam and its loads.                            The algebraical interpretation of
this remark         is,   that   it   is   not necessary to retain general solutions                       of
the equations which will result from the investigation,                                 but only such
solutions as will satisfy the equations.
   After defining the unit of force as the weight of square unit of               a
the lamina, and the measure of compression-thrust or extension-pull
as the length        of the ribbon of lamina whose breadth                         is   the length         of
the line which        is    subject to the transverse action of the compression
or tension, and whose weight                   is   equal to that compression or tension,
the author considers the effect of tension, &c., estimated in                              a   direction
inclined      to the real direction                 of the tension, and shows that                    it   is
proportional        to the square             of the cosine of inclination.                    He then
considers      the        effect of compounding                     any number          of strains       of
compression or tension which may act simultaneously                                     on the same
part of   a   lamina, and shows that their compound effect may, in every
case, be replaced            by the compound                   effect of two forces at right
angles to each other, the two forces being both                                  compressions,           or

 1862.]                                  305
both tensions, or         one  compression    and one     tension.    Succeeding
investigations are therefore limited to two such forces.
   Proceeding       then to the general theory of beams, it is remarked
that  if a curve be imagined,        dividing a beam into any two parts, the
further part of the      beam (as estimated from the      origin of coordinates)
may be considered to be          sustained by the forces which act in various
directions across that curve, taken in combination with the weight of
the further part of the beam, the load upon that part, the reaction
of supports, &c.          Expressing the forces in conformity with the
principles   already explained, the three equations of equilibrium are
formed,    in which      are involved    several integrals    depending on the
form of the curve and on the forces.             As the   same equations must
apply to any adjacent curve, the author remarks that this is a proper
case for application of the Calculus of Variations ; and on making that
application,     a remarkable relation is found to exist among the three
functions depending on the forces acting at one point, from which it
is immediately       inferred    that their  algebraical    expressions are    the
partial differential coefficients (of the second order) of a single
function of the coordinates of the point of action.              On substituting
the partial differential coefficients, the integrations can be immediately
performed    ;   and the three equations assume a form of great simplicity,
from which the sign of integration has entirely disappeared.
   A   form     is then assumed for the principal           function, with inde
terminate    coefficients, and it is shown that some of the constants
may be eliminated          by means of the three equations.          But in the
actual   applications      it is necessary    to   determine    some    remaining
constants by considerations peculiar to each case.              Now there is  one
modification of the strains whose value can be ascertained by ordinary
mechanics, namely, the horizontal           part of compressive force in the
part  of the beam       above   the neutral line, and the horizontal      part of
tension force in the part of the beam below the neutral line.              (These
words apply to a beam supported at both ends            ;  in the case of a beam
projecting     from a wall, the words "compression"              and   "tension"
must    be reversed.)        By determining     the corresponding      expression
on the theory of this memoir, and comparing the two, the remaining
constants and the form of the function             are completely determined.
From its partial differential coefficients       are found the three functions
depending      on   the forces acting at any one point (as already men
                                                                   z  2

tioned), and from these three functions are found the magnitudes                  of
the two principal        forces of compression or tension, and the angle
which one of them makes with y, in a form admitting of numerical
calculation.
   The author then applies the theory to six          cases, namely,    (1) a beam
projecting from a wall      ; (2) a  beam supported at its ends      ;  (3)  a beam
supported at its ends and carrying a load on its center;               (4)  a beam
supported at its ends and carrying            an excentric    load ;   (5)  a beam
strained at both ends by the connexion of other beams, in the manner
of the tubes of the Britannia Bridge        ;  (6) a beam strained      at one end
only.     Cases   (3) and (4) require the use of discontinuous functions.
Tables are    given, exhibiting the numerical magnitudes of the two
principal   forces and the angle made           by   one  of them with y, for
 121 points    in case (1), and       for 231 points in each of the other
cases.    By  means     of these numbers, diagrams       are formed,    exhibiting
in  each case the directions        of the lines of compression-thrust          and
tension-pull    in every part of the beam.

       ment of the Chemical Action of Direct and Diffuse Sun
       light." By R.W. Bunsen, For.M.R.S., and H. E. Roscoe,
       B.A. Received November 11, 1862.

   In   one of the four communications which the authors             have already
had the honour of presenting to the Royal Society on the subject
of the measurement of the chemical action of light, the attempt was
made to determine experimentally the laws regulating the distribu
tion of the chemical action of the sunlight            and diffuse daylight on
the surface of the earth when the sky is perfectly               unclouded      and
the atmosphere clear.         The methods of measurement there employed
do not, unfortunately,         apply to the much more usually occurring
case  of cloudy skies and hazy atmosphere.             The aim of the present
communication       is to describe an entirely different mode of measuring
the chemical action effected         at any point on the earth's surface by
the total sunlight and diffuse daylight, under the most widely vary
ing conditions of situation, climate, and        state  of the atmosphere.

    In spite of the various futile attempts which have              been made to
register and measure the chemical action of light by means of photo
graphic    tints, it still appeared possible in this way to attain the
desired end.       No instruments founded        on such a mode       of measure
ment can yield reliable results unless we know the conditions under
which photographic          surfaces of a constant degree        of sensitiveness
can be obtained, and unless the relations be determined which                 exist
between the degree of tint produced,            and the time and intensity of
the light acting to effect such a tint.
   The first point which the authors examine, is whether the photo
graphic tints produced vary in shade in the direct ratio of the
intensities of the acting light.         Several experiments      proved that no
direct ratio between the degree          of blackening and the intensities of
the light exists.        Hence it is necessary to relinquish the idea of
employing any mode of measurement founded on the comparison of
photographic      tints of different shades.       The next point examined is
whether equal shades of blackness always correspond to equal pro
ducts of the intensities of the acting light into the times of insolation.
For the purpose of testing the truth of this proposition,               an  instru
ment is employed by which             photographic    sensitized   paper can be
exposed for times which           can  be exactly measured       to within small
fractions    of  a second.       This instrument      consists essentially     of  a
pendulum vibrating about £ seconds, by whose oscillation a sheet of
darkened mica is withdrawn from, and brought back over, a horizontal
strip of paper prepared with chloride of silver, and fixed in a con
stant position relative to the pendulum and sheet of mica. The time
during which        each   point in the length of the strip is exposed is
different, and the time of insolation         for each point can be calculated
when the length         and position     of the strip, and the duration and
amplitude of the pendulum's           vibration are given.     A Table exhibits
for each millimetre       in length of the strip, as measured by a scale
attached, the time of exposure in seconds which               the corresponding
point of the strip        undergoes     in one vibration     of the pendulum.
These numbers        require to be multiplied by n        if the  paper has been
insolated for n vibrations.
   The paper insolated whilst the pendulum              is oscillating,    exhibits
throughout its length         a regularly    diminishing shade from dark          to

 to the Table.        If   we   wish to determine     which     of these shades
 corresponds to another tint produced by a separate insolation, we
 cannot make the comparison by daylight or ordinary lamp-light, as
 these lights produce considerable changes of tint in the sensitive paper.
 The two shades may, however, be perfectly and safely compared by
 the light of a bright soda-flame ; this light possesses the great
 advantage of being chemically inactive, and likewise of rendering
 imperceptible    those     slight  differences  of colour which         make the
 comparison of two shades by the ordinary light so difficult.
    In order to compare any other photographic tint with the point                of
 equal shade on a strip, the latter, together with its millimetre scale,
 is attached to a board, in a darkened room.               The board slides in
 a groove, so that    it can    be moved    horizontally; and in front of the
paper strip a small block holds in a fixed position             a small piece     of
the tinted paper which it is desired to compare.               On throwing      the
light of  a bright soda-flame upon both surfaces it is          easy, by moving
the board from side to side, to find the exact point at which the
shade of the strip is identical to that of the other tinted paper.                It
is then only necessary to consult the Table in order to find the time
in  seconds   during which the paper must have          been exposed in order
that it should attain the tint in question.       A  series   of lights of known
intensities was obtained, by allowing the sun to shine through holes of
known size.      The images thus formed fell on        to a piece     of prepared
 paper  ; and the tints produced were compared with a strip darkened
in the pendulum-apparatus,          and thus the time   of exposure necessary
to effect the shade determined.           Experiments    made with intensities
varying from     1  to 50, show that within these limits equal shades of
blackness correspond to equal products of the intensities of the acting
 light into the times of exposure         ; so that the   light   1 acting for the
time 50, produced        the same degree of blackening           as the   light 50
acting for the time      1.
    A  method for measuring the chemical action of light by simple
 observations is then founded upon this proposition.                 Thus,   if  we
 assume as the     unit of photochemical action that intensity of light
which produces in the unit of time a given degree of shade, we have
only to determine, on a strip of paper tinted                in the pendulum-
apparatus, the point where the shade of the strip coincides with the
given tint  ;  the reciprocals of the times which correspond to these

 1862.]                               309
points of equal shade give the intensities of the light expressed in
terms of the above unit.
   This method of measurement         is available only —
    1.  If the  phenomena of photochemical induction do not interfere
with the blackening of the paper.
    2. If a photographic surface of      a constant degree   of sensitiveness
can be prepared.
   3.   If  an unchangeable    tint can  be obtained which can be exactly
compared with the photographic          paper.
   The result of    a series of experiments    made by varying    the number
of the vibrations and calculating the intensity from       each observation,
showed that photochemical        induction does not exert any prejudicial
effect upon the measurements.
    The question into which the authors enter at greatest length as
being the most important for determining the exactitude of the
measurements,      relates to the mode      of preparing   a standard    paper
possessing a constant degree of sensitiveness.         The relative  degree  of
sensitiveness is determined by exposing the papers to one and the
same    light for the same length of time, and then comparing their
tints with the shades of a strip prepared in the pendulum-apparatus,
fixed in a solution of hyposulphite        of  soda, and furnished     with an
arbitrary scale.     The influence of the strength of the nitrate-of-silver
solution upon the sensitiveness is first examined ; a series of experi
ments shows that with the same homogeneously salted paper, the
sensitiveness of the film does not alter when the strength of the silver
solution varies from 8 to 10 or 12 parts of nitrate of silver to 100 of
water.      Further examination showed that the time during which the
paper lies upon the surface of the silver bath may vary from        15 seconds
to  8 minutes,    without any difference in the sensitiveness of the paper
being noticed ; and no difference is found by the employment of
silver solutions which had been long in use and those freshly pre
pared.      The papers thus silvered may be preserved for from            12 to
 15  hours in the dark without undergoing any change in their            sensi
tiveness.
    If the   paper be allowed to float on the surface of the solution of
chloride of sodium as on that of the silver bath, the sheet after silver
ing exhibits, on drying,     a very unequal degree     of sensitiveness in its
various parts.      If, on the contrary,     the sheet be well soaked in the

                                       310                                [Dec. 11,
 salt-bath no such irregularity appears, and the sheet is of an equal
 degree  of sensitiveness throughout          its whole surface.      This fact is
 determined by several extended series of experiments.               The effect     of
 change of concentration of the salt-bath upon the sensitiveness                    of
 the film is very great   ; and, as far as the observations extend, no           limit
 exists beyond which an increase or a diminution of the percentage
of salt in solution      ceases   to affect the sensitiveness of the film.
 Hence, in order to obtain constant results it is necessary to employ
a solution    of chloride of sodium of constant strength.                By using
solutions of the same strength, papers of a constant degree of sensi
tiveness are obtained.
    The influence of the thickness of the paper employed is next
examined.       Experiment shows that differences in the thickness of
white paper, such as is usually employed for photographic                purposes,
is without influence upon the sensitiveness of the film of chloride of
silver.
   The changes in atmospheric            temperature, from 3° C. to 50°            C,
and in atmospheric      moisture    are likewise found not to influence the
sensitiveness of the prepared paper.
    From the experimental results detailed in the communication, it
appears that by adhering to a certain mode of preparation, a standard
paper can be obtained, which at all times possesses a degree of sensi
tiveness   sufficiently  constant    for    the purposes      of exact measure
ment.     In the following extract from         a larger Table, the readings are
given which were made from papers prepared in three different salt
solutions of the strengths mentioned, and silvered in a solution con
taining   12   of nitrate of silver    to    100   of water.      Equality in the
numbers in each of the columns          III. and     IV. denotes equality in the
readings and in the tint, and therefore equality in the sensitiveness
of the prepared surfaces.        Three    sheets    of paper    were  dipped into
each solution.      These numbers likewise           show the great degree          of
accuracy with which tints can thus be compared.

     The next subject considered is the preparation of an unvarying
 tint which can be easily obtained and used as the standard of com
 parison.     This  is effected    by grinding together 1000 parts of pure
 oxide of zinc with     1  part of pure lamp-black.           A  series of experi
 ments showed that a colour can thus be prepared which possesses a
 constant and unalterable shade         ;   and this can be used as a measure
 of the standard tint.
     Having proved that       a standard       photographic    paper of constant
 sensitiveness, and a standard tint of unvarying shade can be prepared,
 it is only  necessary  to apply the proposition          that equal products  of
 the intensities of the light into the times of insolation effect equal
 shades of blackness, in order to found a method of comparative
measurement of the chemical action of the total daylight.                  As the
unit of measurement, the authors propose to adopt that intensity of
the light which in one second produces the standard tint of blackness
upon the standard paper.
    When the standard paper is insolated in the pendulum-apparatus,
a strip   is obtained which       is tinted with every gradation of shade
from dark to white.         If  the point on this strip is determined which
coincides in shade with        a  paper covered with the standard tint, we
have only to look into the Table to obtain the time of insolation (*),
in seconds, which is necessary to produce the shade corresponding to
the reading on the millimetre scale.             If this time of insolation were
found to be one second, the intensity of the light then acting would
be    I=1;    for any other      time     the intensity    of the chemical rays
would be —*
    As  an example     of such measurement, the authors append three
series  of observations, giving the total amount of chemically active
rays falling on a horizontal         surface at Manchester        in summer and
winter, made at intervals of 1 0 minutes throughout three separate days.
These observations are likewise graphically              represented as curves,
which show maxima and minima exactly corresponding to the appear
ance and disappearance       of the sun      ;  and from them some idea may
be formed    of the vast differences which occur in the intensity of the
chemical rays falling on the earth's surface during the longest and the
shortest days.
   In  conclusion    the authors state that it is possible, by using the

                                        312                                  [Dec. 11,

inches of paper.     They reserve the description               of their instrument
for a future occasion.

       On Paraniline."          By A. W. Hofmann,                   LL.D., F.R.S.
       Received December 2, 1862.
    In a short paper submitted to the        Royal Society about         a year ago  *,
 I called attention to some of the by-products               which are obtained in
the manufacture of aniline upon a large scale, and more especially to
toluylene-diamine,    the primary diamine of the toluyl-series.
   MM. Collin    and Coblenz, aniline manufacturers at Labriche,                  near
St. Denis, Paris, to whose kindness        I  had been indebted for the mate
rial used in these researches, immediately after their publication trans
mitted to me with the utmost liberality a large quantity of basic oils
boiling at temperatures higher than the boiling-point of aniline, which
are separated from the pure aniline by rectification, and are known
in the language of the laboratory          as queue*      <T aniline.    The investi
gation of this complex mixture            has been interrupted          by numerous
engagements arising        from the International Exhibition             ;  and it was
only within the last two months that              I  was enabled to resume the
inquiry.
   This inquiry is far from being finished              ;  but some of the results
already obtained are sufficiently       definite for publication.
   Submitted to distillation, the queues lT aniline begin to boil at about
 182°, considerable quantities      of pure aniline passing over; the tem
perature gradually      rises without any indication of a fixed boiling-
point, until it becomes necessary to remove the thermometer                   ; in fact
the last bases are volatilized only at temperatures not very far short
of   a red heat.    By collecting     separately what distils between 200°
and 220°, and again what comes            over between 270° and 290°, basic
oils are obtained from which, by appropriate                  treatment,    very con
siderable   quantities,     respectively,    of toluylamine (toluidine) and
toluylene-diamine may be       separated.       The former of these bases more

 especially is obtained in so large a quantity from this source, that
 M. Eugen       Sell, a young        chemist working in my laboratory,            was
  enabled to engage in a more minute investigation of this substance.
     The   bases  which accompany the monamine and diamine of the
 toluyl-series   being liquids, their separation is by no means             easily ac
 complished.       Theory suggests that this mixture consists chiefly of
 the higher homologues of the toluyl-bases.               These substances being
 far more easily prepared from their pure hydrocarbons *,             I have for   the
 present refrained from entering very minutely into the examination
 of  these oils.   The following remarks are therefore exclusively devoted
 to the fraction of the bases which boils at the highest temperature.
     On collecting separately what        comes over above 330°, a brown, vis
 cid, scarcely mobile liquid is obtained, which at the^first glance appears
 to present scarcely sufficient interest for a more minute examination.
 This liquid proved to        be a mixture     of several compounds.         Treated
 with dilute sulphuric acid it solidified into            a semisolid     crystalline
 mass, which by      filtration separated into     a crystalline  sulphate almost
 insoluble in water, and a sulphate easily soluble, the base of which
forms the subject of this communication.
     Decomposed by means of caustic soda, this sulphate yielded a viscid
 basic oil, which after some days solidified into a semisolid crystalline
 mass.     This was purified from adhering oil by pressure between
 folds of bibulous paper, and crystallized first from water, and subse
quently once or twice from boiling alcohol.              Long white silky     needles
were thus obtained easily soluble in alcohol                and ether, difficultly
soluble in water, fusible at 192°, and boiling beyond the range of
the mercurial thermometer, but distilling without decomposition.
     When submitted to combustion, this substance            was found to contain
and thus to have exactly the same composition as aniline, from which
    *  I may mention in passing,  that dinitrocumol, C„ H10 (N02)2 obtained by sub
mitting   cumol  to  the  action of a mixture of nitric and sulphuric acids, when di
stilled with iron and acetic acid, yields cumylene-diamine, a beautiful crystalline

it differs in all its properties.      I  propose for this new compound the
name    of par aniline.
    Paraniline  forms a series of splendidly crystallized        salts, the study
of which proved that the        above expression must be doubled, and         that
the true molecular value of this compound is represented by the for
mula
                                    C,a  Hu N,.
   The molecule of paraniline is capable of fixing either one or two
equivalents of acid.        The salts with one equivalent of acid are most
readily obtained    ;  they are of a light yellow colour, and their solution
exhibits in an unusual degree the phenomenon of green fluorescence.
    From a solution in concentrated hydrochloric acid a beautiful hydro-
chlorate crystallizes in transparent yellow six-sided plates, containing
at 100°
                           C1,HuN2,2HCl+H20.
which on treatment with water are immediately converted into yellow
needles sparingly soluble in water, more soluble in alcohol, insoluble
in ether, containing
                            CIIHI1N,HC1          + H,0
 at 100°, and
                                 CiaHHN2, HC1
at 115°.
    The platinum-salt crystallizes in yellow difficultly soluble needles,

    I have  analysed only one nitrate, which crystallizes in short, yellow
 ish, starlike-grouped     needles,   containing
                               C„HMN„ HNOs,
 but two sulphates.        One of them is readily obtained by dissolving
 paraniline in dilute sulphuric acid, when spherical aggregates of small
 needles are separated, easily soluble        in water,  less soluble  in alcohol,
 which have the composition
                               CUHMN„H,804.
    Digested in aqueous        solution    for some    time with an excess       of
 paraniline,   the sulphate just described assimilates            a second equi
 valent of the base, a salt being formed very similar            to the previous
 one, but containing      after crystallization   from alcohol
                             2(C12HuNa),IlJS04.

    What is the constitution       of this diamine   1   For the decision of
 this question     I   must  wait   till  MM. Collin     and   Coblenz     have
 kindly supplied     me  with  a fresh quantity   of their  queues <Taniline.
 As yet   I have only ascertained that iodide of ethyl gives rise to the
 formation of two ethylated bases, viz.,
                       CuH1SN,= CUHU(C,H,)N„
 the composition of which      I have  fixed by the analysis of the chloride,
 iodide, and platinum-salt,     and
                      C1,HaaN2=CiaH1,(CaH,)aN„
 of which   I have only examined the platinum-salt.         The saline solu
tions of the ethylated bases are likewise remarkable for their fluores
cent properties.
    Chloride of benzoyl furnishes with paraniline small         needles,  inso
luble in water but soluble in alcohol, of the formula
                     C1,H1,N30=C12H„(C7HsO)N,.
    Paraniline,  it cannot  be doubted, is the product      of the action of
heat upon aniline    ; and its formation suggests the existence of a series
of similar bodies, similarly related to the other ammonias, which the
progress of science cannot fail to reveal.
    Experiments    made in search     of these bodies have hitherto       been
rewarded only by partial success.          Nevertheless  I have already suc
ceeded in converting several ammonias into higher bases, and          I intend
to pursue     the direction   of research which      is indicated   by these
results.

    " Description of     a new Specimen     of Glyptodon, recently ac

      of Comparative Anatomy at the College.               Received   No

   In the present brief preliminary notice   I propose to give an account
of the more remarkable features of the skeleton of      a specimen  of the
extiuct genus Glyptodon, recently added to the Museum of the Royal
College of Surgeons.
   The specimen was obtained in 1860, by Signor Maximo Terrero, on
the banks of the River Salado, and was presented to the College by
that gentleman, through the instrumentality of the late President of
the College,  J.  F. South, Esq.
   It arrived in England in an extremely broken and mutilated con
dition; but, by the exercise of great care and patience, Mr. Waterhouse
Hawkins, to whom the President and Council of the Royal College
of Surgeons entrusted the task of adjusting the scattered fragments,
has succeeded    in restoring to their natural condition the greater part
of the vertebral column, the limbs, and much of the head.          In  the
execution of this laborious undertaking     Mr. Hawkins has had, from
time to time, all the anatomical aid that Mr. Flower, the Conservator
of the College Museum, and      I could afford him  ; and the authorities
of the College have finally entrusted me, as one of the Professors of
the College, with the duty of describing the specimen.
   This duty   I   propose to discharge by preparing a full description
of the skeleton in     a memoir    to be presented (accompanied      by a
draught of the requisite illustrations) to the Royal Society.      But as
the preparation of such a memoir will require some time,        I wish, at
present, to lay before the Royal Society a preliminary         account   of
those particulars in the structure of this animal which must interest
anatomists in general as much as the special student of the fossil
Edentata, in the hope that the notice may appear in the ' Proceed
ings' of the Society.

    The   mass    of bony fragments which arrived from South America
has afforded material for the reconstruction of the carapace, and of
the following parts of the skeleton           : — the anterior moiety of the skull
with the entire palate ; the mandible ; some of the cervical, and the
greater part of the dorsal, lumbar, sacral and coccygeal vertebrae, with
vertebral and sternal ribs       ; the pelvis and the hind limbs     ; part of the
scapula, and an entire fore limb.               And there can   be no doubt that
all  these remains belong to one and the same animal, as no duplicate
bones have been discovered, nor any which there is the least reason
to believe belong to a different individual. This circumstance gives
a particular value to the present specimen, apart from the fact that,
notwithstanding the researches of Professor Owen, of D'Alton, of
Lund, and of Nodot, our knowledge of the structure of the anterior
part of the skull, of the vertebral column and pelvis, and of the fore
limb of Glyptodon and its immediate allies, is either nil or extremely
imperfect.       I  now proceed to note the more important and the novel
anatomical peculiarities which          it reveals.
    Of the skull      the new specimen exhibits        the anterior moiety, from
the anterior boundary of the cranial cavity to the anterior end of the
nasal bones, together with the almost entire bones of the face and
the lower jaw       ; it thus furnishes    a nearly complete supplement to the
fragmentary cranium, consisting of the brain-case and the nasal bones,
with the zygomatic         processes,  formerly described by Professor Owen
as a part of Glyptodon clavipes, and now set up in the College                Mu
seum, together with a carapace, a tail, and a hind foot, as the typical
example of that species*.             In   the form of the frontal bone, of the
orbits, of the nasal bones, and of the zygomatic process, the skull of
the new specimen agrees very closely with that of Glyptodon clavipes.
From the slighter rugosity of the supraorbital region, the less deve
lopment of the temporal ridges, and the fact that the nasal suture
persists in the new specimen,            I  conceive it to have been a younger
animal.
    The anterior nasal aperture is trapezoidal, and narrower below
   * The   parts   thus combined together were not found so associated,    and the
question may arise whether the skull, hind foot, and tail are really parts of the
animal to which the carapace (on whose characters the species is founded) be
longed. Provisionally I assume that they are. But so many difficulties are in
volved in the precise determination of the species of these extinct Armadillo-like
 Edentata, that for the present I leave the question open.

than above.            The vomer is very thick and strong, and the turbinal
bones        are    well developed. The premaxilloe, though small slender
bones, enter largely into the lateral boundary of the nasal aperture.
Inferiorly they              are separated in the middle line by a narrow fissure,
which runs back into the crescentic anterior palatine foramen.
     The maxillary             bones are extremely elongated           ;   while the palatine
bones are small in proportion                     to them, and,    like the premaxillae, are
separated by a very narrow median fissure.  The extreme length of
the roof of the palate, formed by these three pair of bones, is 10
inches ; while its width (between the inner edges of the teeth),
though rather greater in front than behind, nowhere exceeds                              1-J   inch.
From before backwards the palate has                          a   double    curvature,     being
concave        downwards            from the anterior end of the premaxilla               to the
level of the third tooth, and convex thence to the end of the palate-
bones    ;    so that the posterior part                 of the palate has    a   very marked
inclination         upwards and backwards.
     There were eight teeth in                   each    maxilla, all trilobed, the longitu
dinal grooves separating the lobes being less marked in the anterior
teeth.
     The mandible             is   represented      by   the two horizontal rami, with the
symphysis, the greater part of the right coronoid process,                            and the
entire right condyle, together with many of the sixteen teeth.                                    It
very closely resembles the mandibles of Schistopleuron                        gemmatum, de
scribed       by   Nodot, but
                         wholly unlike the restored jaw of Glyptodon

clavipes given (on the authority of   drawing)      Professor Owen*.
                                                         a            by
   The articular surface   situated almost wholly upon the anterior
                                          is
surface of the condyle of the mandible, looking                             but very slightly
upwards       ;    it   is   transversely elongated, slightly concave from side to
side, and convex from above downwards.                             In all   these respects        it
furnishes      a    counterpart        to the glenoid articular        surface of the tem
poral      bone of Glyptodon                   clavipes, already described by Professor
Owen.
     The length of the              head   of the present specimen, when entire, was
probably           not less than           13 inches.   The greatest depth of the
cranium, from the centre of the frontal                        bone to the middle        of the

   palate is about      6 inches     ; the length of the mandible can hardly have
   been less than       12   inches.
      Of the vertebral column, the greater part of the sacral and dorsal
   region, and some fragments of the cervical region, are preserved.                  The
  latter show that the atlas was distinct, but that the axis was anchy-
  losed with one or two succeeding vertebrae,                   as in the    Armadillos.
  The fifth and sixth cervical           vertebrae were probably free, but no traces
  of them have         been     found.     The anterior part of what remains of
  the rest of the vertebral column consists of a very broad flat bone,
  composed of three vertebrae              firmly anchylosed together, and having
  their spinous processes represented by a short but very stout osseous
  knob, which projects upwards and backwards.                          Anteriorly, these
  anchylosed vertebrae exhibit on each side of the neural canal an arti
  cular facet with      a convex surface, resembling a segment           of a horizontal
  cylinder    ;  posteriorly,      articular    surfaces of a similar character, but
  concave, are situated in corresponding positions.
      Each    side   of this ' trivertebral bone' presents two large and deep
  articular cavities for the heads of ribs, fragments of which are still
  preserved.        The anterior rib, remarkable for its stout and massive
  proportions,     was undoubtedly the first         ; and this circumstance    I believe
  gives a clue to the precise character of the vertebrae which are anchy
 losed together to form the trivertebral bone                 ; for in the Armadillos
 the head of the first rib is fitted into a deep fossa, formed partly by
 the last cervical, and partly by the first dorsal vertebra.               Furthermore,
 the body and transverse processes of the last cervical vertebra in the
 Armadillos present articular            facets  of an essentially similar character to
 those observable on the anterior face of the bone under description *                   ;
 and, finally, the last cervical vertebra is practically              immoveable upon
 the first dorsal in many Armadillos, while the two vertebrae are com
 pletely anchylosed together in the priodont Armadillo.                      I conceive,
 then, that this remarkable bone of the Glyptodon is formed by the
anchylosis of the last cervical and first and second dorsal vertebrae.
     Of   the remainder of the spinal column thirteen consecutive ver
tebrae are preserved ; and             all of these were immoveably united into
    *  I may remark in passing, that all the cervical vertebrae of the Armadillos,
from the third backwards, are articulated together by joints similar in principle
of construction to those which connected          together the trivertebral bone of Glyp
todon    with the  vertebra;   in front of and behind it.

one long continuous               tunnel or arched tubular bridge of bone, a struc
ture which          is without a parallel among the Mammalian                                  Vertebrata.
Of    these       thirteen      vertebrae,      the four 'anterior                  are so completely an-
chylosed together,               that the       original     lines of demarcation                     between
them are hardly discernible.                     Persistent sutures separate                       the fourth
from the fifth, and the latter from the sixth                                   ;    but all trace      of the
primitive distinction              of the sixth and seventh is lost.                               The other
vertebrae are separated by sutures which become                                     coarser and less close
posteriorly.           In all but the first, second, third, eleventh, and thir
teenth vertebrae, the parts representing the vertebral centra are broken
away    but where they persist, they
         ;                                                   are so similar               that they were
doubtless of similar form throughout.                                Each centrum              is,   in fact,   a
comparatively thin bony plate, so curved as to form                                       a   segment      of   a
hollow cylinder of much larger diameter in the front than in the
hinder vertebrae, the sides of which pass superiorly into the arches of
the vertebrae.
     The foremost vertebra of the thirteen                           is   as broad as the posterior
part of the            trivertebral bone,' and presents                             couple of convex arti
                   '                                                       a
cular        facets which         articulate         with the lateral articular                    concavities
described above in that bone.                          The   vertebrae              rapidly narrow, how
ever,    until the fourth               is   not more than three-fifths                   as wide as the
first, while        it   is   proportionately          deeper    ;   and this increase               of depth
relatively to width goes on until in the thirteenth vertebra the spinal
canal        is   deeper than     it    is   wide.
  The spinous processes of these vertebrae are all broken short off                                             ;
but sufficient remains of their bases to make the following points
clear.
      The spinous             process    of the first       is   almost obsolete, being                a   mere
ridge sloping back towards the second, with which                                        it   is   continuous.
This appears to have                been necessary to afford the requisite                            play for
the knob of the trivertebral bone in its movements of flexion and ex
tension on the rest of the spinal column.
      The spinous process of the second vertebra                                     was long and        thick,
and probably somewhat high.                           It   appears to have been completely
distinct from the third, which was thinner, and was anchylosed with
its           (as far as that of the twelfth vertebra inclusive) into
      successors                                                                                                a
long continuous crest.    The apices of the spinous processes may,
however, have been distinct.                         So much as           is   left of the base         of this

1862.]                                  321
crest, shows that    it was thickest   at the sixth and seventh vertebrae      (of
the thirteen), and that it became          thinner   both anteriorly and pos
teriorly.
    The spinous process of the twelfth vertebra, forming the termina
tion of the crest, appears to have ended in a free, thin, but rounded
edge.     What remains of the spinous process of the thirteenth ver
tebra, on the other hand, thins off anteriorly to a natural edge, which
is inclined upwards and backwards.             Posteriorly the spinous process
 becomes very    thick and stout, and appears to have had         a considerable
height. It      ends in a fractured hinder margin.
    The broad wing-like plates which represent the coalesced trans
verse processes of the first, second, and third vertebrae of the thirteen,
exhibit distinct articular surfaces for the capitula and tubercula of
ribs.     Further back, the natural edges of the apophysial ridges
 are broken away, up to the eighth vertebra.            Here they  are entire on
 the left side and broken on the right           ; but, curiously   enough, the
 broken processes are higher than the entire ones, so that the transverse
 processes in this region of the body must have been asymmetrically
 developed.      The thirteenth       vertebra   presents peculiarities     which
 could only be made intelligible        by a lengthened description, and by
 figures.    The contours of the articular          processes  become    first di
 stinctly traceable   at the posterior part    of the eleventh vertebra.     They
 are better marked at the posterior part of the twelfth, and at the an
 terior part of the thirteenth vertebra.
     The nervous foramina are not intervertebral, but pierce the arches
 of the vertebrae throughout the         series.   In the thirteenth the outlet
 of the foramen is separated, by         a longitudinal   bar of bone, into an
 upper and a lower division.
     The posterior part of the thirteenth vertebra is much injured, and
 does not adjust itself naturally to the anterior end of that part of the
 lumbar region of the vertebral column (consisting of two vertebrae)
 which remains continuously anchylosed with the sacrum. One or
 two   vertebrae may possibly be wanting, or even three         ;  but I conceive
 the last to   be the extreme    limit of the deficiency*.
     The great Priodont Armadillo has twenty dorso-lumbar              vertebrae.
  If the Glyptodon had the same       number, there would be three missing         ;
    * Unless I greatly err in   my interpretation of the photographs, these three
 missing  vertebra art preserved in the Turin Glyptodon.

for there are two dorsal vertebrae                in the trivertebral         plate, thirteen
follow      it,   and two lumbar      are anchylosed           with the sacral, making
altogether seventeen.
      The '
              sacrum,' composed of anchylosed lumbar, proper sacral, and
coccygeal vertebrae,         contains at fewest twelve, and perhaps thirteen
vertebrae.         The centra of the two lumbar                vertebrae     and   of the two
proper sacral vertebrae which follow                 them are preserved.             They are
thin and broad plates, flat above and slightly concave below, exhibit
ing   a   most marked contrast with the half-cylinder of the hindermost
of the thirteen dorsal         vertebrae     above    described.       It    would     seem to
require       the interposition      of   at least    two,   if   not three, vertebrae         to
effect the transition of the one form of centrum into the other.
      The last coccygeal      is   the only vertebra among all those preserved
the centrum of which           exhibits characters at all like those                 of an or
dinary mammal, its terminal                face   being    a   very broad oval, slightly
concave,      disk.    The centrum of the penultimate coccygeal                       is   much
flatter and narrower      ;   and this flattening and narrowing predominates
still more in the antepenultimate and that vertebra which lies before
it, or the fourth from the end.   From this point to the two anterior
sacrals the floor of the vertebral canal             is   completely broken away, but
there can be no doubt that the centra were represented by a thin
bony plate.
      The line of the centra of the coccygeal                    vertebrae    forms    a     very
marked arch behind the two sacral vertebrae,                       whose centra form           a
nearly horizontal floor       ;    while the dorso-lumbar           vertebrae       (including
the trivertebral bone) form           a   second arch, flatter than the first.
  The spinous processes of all these lumbo-sacro-coccygeal vertebrae,
up to the fourth from the end inclusively, are anchylosed together
in long and strong osseous crest, broad and extremely rugose above,
  a
eight inches high in front, but slowly diminishing as                         it   follows    the
curve of the centra posteriorly             to five inches.
   The spinous process of the penultimate coccygeal vertebra   very                    is
thick, but   broken short off. It was probably not less than
                  is                                         inches                  4
high, and afforded       a   middle point of support for the carapace between
the ischial protuberances.            The    sides   of the median crest, and of the
two vertebrae which appear to constitute the true sacrum, are anchy
losed firmly with nearly the whole of the inner edge of the vast
ilium.        Behind these the        vertebrae      seem      to have been         devoid of

1862.]                                     323
transverse processes, as far as the fourth            from the end.           But the
antepenultimate          had a long and slender transverse process on each
side    ;   the penultimate has an equally long but much stouter process,
while the last coccygeal vertebra has transverse               processes    of no   less
length, and extremely stout.
  The expanded distal ends of these processes unite with one another,
and with the inner surfaces of the greatly expanded ischia.
   The ilia         are immense quadrate bones,     slightly concave anteriorly
and posteriorly, with their planes so directed as to form rather less
than a right angle forwards with the vertebral column.     The crest
of each iliac bone is thick, expanded, and rugose, and so arched as
evidently to have afforded attachment and support to the carapace                        ;
which therefore rested directly,            partly on the three transversely
disposed          pillars afforded by the coccygeal     vertebrae     and the two
ischia, partly on the longitudinally arched crests of the sacrum and
of the thirteen dorsal or dorso-lumbar            vertebrae,    and partly on the
second great transverse support yielded by the arched crests of the
ilia.Apart from their anchylosis, the whole of the parts named
must have been practically fixtures in consequence of this arrange
ment of the carapace          ;   and the only moveable parts of the vertebral
column must have           been the tail   (of which unfortunately no portion
has been found    in the present specimen), posteriorly moveable on
the last coccygeal vertebra, — the trivertebral bone with its two pair of
ribs, capable of        an up-and-down     motion on the foremost of the thir
teen vertebrae,       — and   then the cervicals, more or less moveable upon
the anterior part of the trivertebral bone and upon one another.
    Iam not aware of the existence of any mammal in which the ver
tebral column presents characters of a similar singularity.
   The mobility of the rib-bearing trivertebral bone, by              a    hinge-joint
upon the rest of the vertebral column, is peculiarly anomalous.                   How
ever,       if,   as appears to have been     the case, the heads of the ribs
attached to this bone were incapable of movement, and the first rib
was furthermore           directly anchylosed with the sternum,            respiration
must have been carried on entirely by the diaphragm,                if    the anterior
dorsal vertebrae        had been immoveable on the posterior              ones.     The
hinge-like movement of the trivertebral bone, on the other hand, by
permitting the ribs and sternum to describe           a   longitudinal arc alter
nately downwards and forwards, and upwards and backwards, would

principle to that effected by the ordinary movements of the ribs.
     The trivertebral bone is about                                   6 inches        long.

     Judging by the analogy of the Armadillos with which the Glyp-
todon presents such close resemblance, and from the shortness                                  of
such cervical vertebrae          of Glyptodon     as can   be      reconstructed,         the
neck did not exceed            in length   ^th of    the length of the vertebral
column from the first dorsal to the last coccygeal.                    That would give
8 inches     for the neck, and would give a grand total for the spinal
column, exclusive of the tail, of 88 inches, or 7 feet 4 inches.                          The
length of the carapace of Glyptodon clavipes in the Museum of the
Royal College of Surgeons is 5 feet 7 inches.
   The carpus of Glyptodon is in some respects very like that of
Dasypus sexcinctus, but it consists of eight bones instead of seven,
the trapezium and trapezoid being perfectly distinct, instead of form
ing   a single bone, as in Dasypus.The scaphoid articulates with the
os magnum, and the cuneiform with a metacarpal, as in Dasypus.
But it is not a little remarkable that, whereas in Dasypus it is the
fifth metacarpal whose proximal              end partially articulates with the
cuneiform,      in Glyptodon      the corresponding      bone articulated wholly
with the cuneiform, and not with any of the distal row of carpal
bones. The metacarpal articular end of that bone  in fact, divided    is,
into two    facets   — an inner, larger, which articulates with part of                   the
proximal end of the fourth metacarpal, and an outer, smaller, which
is   appropriated     by   the proximal end      of the fifth metacarpal.
     That the cuneiform should articulate with two metacarpal                          bones,
and that the unciform should not articulate with the fifth metacarpal
at all, are very remarkable peculiarities of the wrist of Glyptodon.
     The pisiform     is   a   large curved bone, the proximal end of which
articulates by    a   large facet with the ulna, and by           a   small one with           a
facet on the palmar aspect of the cuneiform.                  It      closely resembles
the same bone in Armadillos.
     The trapezium and trapezoid, taken together,                 have      a   form closely

   1862.]                               325
  resembling that of the single trapezio-trapezoid          of Dasypus.      The
  trapezium     possesses only a very small double       articular facet on its
  palmar face.      If this gives support to    a metacarpal,    it must    have
  been very small ; and as at present neither       it nor any of the hallucal
 phalanges     have been discovered,     it is possible the pollex may have
  been altogether rudimentary.        In   any case the pollex        must have
 been so much smaller and more slender in proportion               than that of
  Dasypus, that the animal must have had a practically              tetradactyle
  fore foot.
     The second metacarpal is the longest of all which have been disco
 vered, but is not quite so thick as the third.         Its proximal end arti
 culates with the trapezium, trapezoid, and magnum.
     The third metacarpal, an almost cuboidal bone, but broader than
 long, articulates with the magnum, the cuneiform, and the adjacent
  metacarpals.
     The fourth metacarpal, still shorter and broader in proportion,
 articulates with the unciform and cuneiform, and with the adjacent
metacarpals.
     The fifth metacarpal has not     been    found.     The two proximal or
 first and   second   phalanges are very short, broad, discoidal        bones in
 the second and in the third digits    ; and the second, which alone exists
in the fourth digit, has the same character.         The proximal phalanges
 of the fifth digit have not been found.
     The distal or third phalanx   is a broad bone, squarely truncated at
the extremity, and longer than the rest of the digit,           in the second,
third, and fourth, and presumably in the fifth digit. Each of these
phalanges is thicker on one side than on the other, so that the upper
surface, which      is convex from side to side, and also from            before
backwards, slopes from the thick towards the thin edge.
    The distal phalanx of the second digit has its thick edge on its
ulnar side, but all the others have their thick edges radial.               The
distal phalanx of the fifth digit is more pointed, smaller, and thicker
in proportion than the others.
    The hind foot is quite normal in structure, possessing five toes
and the regular number and disposition of tarsal, metatarsal, and
phalangeal bones.        The third or middle digit is the longest, and its
distal phalanx is the longest of all. It is nearly square, and its outer
and inner edges are almost equally thick.            The distal phalanges of

                                     326                         [Dec.   18,
the other toes are all thicker on the side turned towards the middle
toe.   That of the second   toe is almost as square as that  of the third    ;
but the distal angles of that of the third and fourth are bevelled off
on the fibular     side, while the terminal    phalanx   of the hallux     is
similarly bevelled off upon the tibial side. The metatarsal bones
have the same thick prismatic form, and the proximal phalanges the
same discoidal character as in the fore foot.
    The calcaneal process is directed outwards at     an angle of 45° from
the axis of the foot, and must have been much raised in the natural
position.
    While the work of restoration, whose results have just been briefly
detailed, was going on, we learned from Dr. Falconer that a nearly
entire   specimen of a Glyptodon was       exhibited   in the Museum at
Turin.     An application   was at once   made to the authorities    of the
 Museum     for information,   and, if possible, for photographs of this
 skeleton, and was responded to with the most obliging readiness.
    These photographs of a skeleton in some respects more, in others
less perfect than that   of the College,  have confirmed the conclusions
already   arrived   at in the most satisfactory manner;        and  I  trust
before long to be in possession of descriptive details of parts     of this
specimen which      are wanting   in our own, and which will enable me
 to complete the anatomy of the         skeleton of the gigantic    extinct
 Armadillo.

     The object of this paper is to prove to meteorologists that       they
 may apply, without misgiving, the results which the author has already
 announced, regarding the relation of aqueous vapour to radiant heat.
 The author describes new experiments made with dry and humid air,
 first, with an experimental tube stopped by plates of rock-salt ;
  secondly, with an open experimental        tube ;  and thirdly, with    an
  arrangement in which both the plates and the tube were abandoned,

dry air being   caused to displace moist, and moist air dry, in the open
atmosphere.       He considers and removes objections, and points out
the bearing of his experiments on various questions in meteorology.
The formation of cumuli and the cause of the tropical rains are con
sidered  ;  the effect which the absence      of aqueous vapour must have
upon climate    is pointed out   ; and the  & priori conclusions   to be drawn
from the experiments      are shown to agree    with observation.     Reference
is made to anomalies of observation which have been hitherto unex
plained, but which admit of easy solution by reference to the radiant
and absorbent power of aqueous vapour.             The author endeavours to
supplement     the views    hitherto   entertained regarding     the action of
mountain     masses    as condensers    of the atmospheric moisture.         He
 accounts for the enormous radiation observed at great elevations, and
 concludes by showing the possible bearing of his results on the theory
 of "Serene" and of hail.

    The theory of the      27 lines on a surface    of the third order is due
 to Mr. Cayley and Dr. Salmon        ; and the effect as regards the 27 lines
 of  a singular    point or points on the surface, was first considered
 by Dr. Salmon in the paper " On the triple tangent planes of a surface
 of the third order," Camb. and Dub. Math. Journ. t. iv. pp. 252-
 260 (1849). The theory as regards the reality or non-reality of the
 lines on a general surface of the third order, is discussed in Dr. Schlaffle's
 paper,  "An    attempt to determine the 27 lines, &c.," Quart. Math.
 Journ. t. ii. pp. 56-65, and 110-120.            This theory is reproduced
 and developed in the present memoir under the heading,              I. General
 cubic surface of the third order and twelfth          class  ; but the larger
 part  of the memoir relates to the singular forms which          are here first

     1.   In the ' Proceedings of the Royal Society,' May 26, 1859, I             have
stated that, " on attaching the terminals of my water-battery                    (Phil.
Trans. 1844, p. 39) to the wires of                a carbonic      acid vacuum-tube,
inserted      about 2 inches       apart,     I  obtained     a   stratified discharge
 similar to that of an induction coil."
     2. The battery remained as           it was originally constructed, consist
 ing of 3520 pairs of copper and zinc cylinders inserted in glass cells.
 As the rain-water with which each cell had been from time to time
 filled evaporated, they were again charged: this process of evaporation
 and recharging continuing for several years, during this lengthened
 period the battery was three or four times cleaned by dusting                      and
 wiping the cells, boards, and slips of glass on which the cells rested ;
 but the constant deposition of dust and moisture had so far reduced
 the static effects of the battery, that this year it would scarcely elicit
 a spark     of about   s^jVij-th of   an inch in air between         the plates of niv

                                         330                              [Dec. 18,
micrometer      electrometer     (Phil. Trans. 1839), and          I had therefore
 determined on taking the entire battery asunder, as well as in order
to attach fresh zincs to the copper cylinders.
   3.   Previous to undertaking this somewhat tedious and troublesome
process, it occurred        to  me to    try what effect would be obtained
from the discharge of the battery in carbonic acid vacua, by merely
recharging it with brine in lieu of rain-water : the result of this
experiment was such as to induce me for the present to forego my
intention   of having new zincs, particularly            as a very large number
of them    were found to be much          less   oxidized    than  I had expected,
and rather to turn my attention to some improved mode of insulation.
   4. To accomplish this, the zincs were cleaned, and the old pieces
of string with which they         were   kept from metallic contact with the
copper cylinders were removed and replaced with new.                     The wood
trays, on which       the battery is placed, were          cleaned, and carefully
covered with a thick coating of shell-lac             varnish, as were also the
glass cells, the latter       having   been     first heated in a sandbath       in
order to withdraw         all trace   of moisture       before    the varnish  was
applied.
   5. On each tray slips of window-glass,             also coated with shell-lac,
were   fixed edgeways,      forming a kind of rail on which the cells were
placed   : the glass vessels being conical at the base, the strips of narrow
glass presented little more than four points of shell-lac on which each
cell rested.     Those     zincs which were found           to be much oxidized
were   placed aside    ;  and ultimately      three batteries were completed,
each   of 1120 pairs of plates, forming, when connected with each
other, one battery of 3360 cells : each cell was carefully charged
with   a saturated solution      of common salt and water, and the trays,
when placed on the racks, were             separately insulated      by resting on
pieces  of ebonite.
   6.  It  will be observed that     I  have reduced my battery from 3520
to 3360 pairs of elements          ; the tension, as shown           by the spark
discharge, was nearly the same as when it was originally charged                   ;
but  I have observed, after the battery has rested               for a short time,
the first discharge between the wire terminals in air appears to be
more dense, presenting         the same appearance as the discharge of            a
weakly-charged      Leyden      jar.   The purport of this communication
is not, however,       to   describe the general        effects   obtained  by the

1862.]                                         331
battery,     many of which require more time for verification than                     I at
present have at my disposal, but to lay before the Royal Society
certain novel results which              I have obtained, and which         I  hope may
tend to elucidate, and possibly assist in explaining, the phenomena of
what is termed the stratified electrical discharge.
    7.  I continue     the practice         I originally adopted of numbering my
vacuum-tubes *       :   during the progress of my experiments, I found that
the discharge of the battery was much more sensible to the slightest
variation of the state of tension in each of these tubes, than that of
the induction       coil  ;  the sudden disruption            in the discharge of the
latter   presents greater obstacles to the more careful study of the
phenomena than is offered by the direct discharge of the battery.
    8.  I   soon ascertained           that in some        of my vacuum-tubes        I  was
enabled      to study the          action     of the discharges       under    peculiarly
favourable       conditions.        I   anticipate that these conditions          may be
still further improved          ;  but, from the results       I have  already obtained,
 I  venture the opinion            that it may be doubtful whether               the true
theory     of electricity       as developed        by the voltaic      battery will     be
correctly explained, unless by carefully experimenting with batteries
satisfactorily insulated.            The battery      I  have described,    with the im
proved method of obtaining                  vacua, first     suggested to me by Dr.
 Frankland, offered         me the opportunity            of examining the discharge
 under conditions heretofore unknown.
    9.  The vacuum-tubes              in which the experiments were made, and
which relate to the subject of this communication, were Nos. 70,
 248, 315, 319, 320, 324.                These    I shall refer to in the order of the
 experiments.
    No. 248 (fig.         2   in woodcut)         is about     2\ inches long,     1   inch
 diameter:      to the platinum          wires small balls of coke are attached,
 about    1^  inch apart, the wires being protected inside the vacuum,
 as far as the balls, by glass tubing.
    No.    70 (described        Phil. Trans. 1859, p. 151) is            14 inches long,
with platinum wires 1 2 inches apart : a small glass bulb containing
 crystals of iodine was placed in this tube before it was charged
with     carbonic     acid   ;    and after      the vacuum        had   been    obtained,
   * Phil.   Trans. 1859, p. 137      : the tubes were   marked with consecutive  numbers,
 a note being taken of each as        it was finally sealed.

the glass bulb was broken.      This tube consequently contains vapour
of iodine.
   No. 319 (Plate I.) is 20 inches long, 4 inches diameter: one ter
minal consists of aluminium, cup-shaped, about 3 inches diameter ; the
other a wire of the same metal.       There is about  14£ inches between
the cup and the wire.
   No. 320 is     3 inches long,   1 inch diameter  : very thin platinum
wires, -|ths of an inch in length from the part protected by glass
tube, are placed 1 1 inch apart from point to point in the tube.
   No. 315 and No. 324 (Plates I. and II.) are about 5 inches long,
with two balls of aluminium      f ths of an inch diameter, and 3 inches
apart  : the balls are attached to platinum wires, these wires being also,
as in No. 248, hermetically sealed and protected with glass tubing.
   The vacuum in each of the tubes was obtained by the carbonic
acid process.
   10. Fig.   1 represents the general arrangement of the apparatus:
A, B, C, the three batteries (§ 5) ; z and     c the zinc and copper ter
minals of each battery; the discharge of 1120 pairs, of 2240, or of
3360 can be thus separately examined.          My general practice is to
place the experimental tube between either one or the other        of the
batteries (fig. 2), the negative or zinc terminal of C being attached
to one wire, and the copper or positive of B to the other.       A and B
are then connected, and the circuit is completed either by a resistance
arrangement being attached to the zinc terminal of      A and the copper
terminal of C, or the circuit is closed by a wire.       It was with the
view of being enabled to vary the resistance at pleasure, that I

 1862.]                                   333
 introduced the two tubes a and b, containing the distilled water, in the
 circuit.      I  ascertained that, by varying the depth to which the wires
 attached to the terminals of the battery are plunged in one or both
 of the tubes containing         the water, the resistance could be regulated
 with great precision, and that it was immaterial in what part of the
 circuit the vacuum-tube          or the resistance was introduced, provided
 the   circuit is completed.
     11.   In    proceeding    to describe the experiments,           I  may premise
 that, in using the terms intermittent and continuous as applied to the
 discharge of the battery,          I  desire only to denote that when the
 discharge is examined by a vibrating                or revolving      mirror, in the
former the appearance of a series of distinct discharges is plainly
 perceptible ; in the latter this separation is not seen, but the
 discharge appears as a continuous light.
     12.   No. 248.       In this  tube, with 2240 series, luminous glows are
 observed on both balls, that on the negative being larger and more
 brilliant   ;   in the dark discharge between the balls no trace of striae
 can be seen ;        but at intervals   a flash discharge        takes place.     The
 luminous glow on each ball appears as a continuous discharge                   ; both
 glows at times flitter, attaching          themselves sometimes on one, and
 then on the opposite sides of the balls           ;  but even then they are not
 resolvable by the mirror.
     13.   When       a resistance  of about     3 inches    in length, of distilled
 water placed in the glass tubes a or          b  (§ 10) (fig. 1),    is introduced  in
 the circuit, the discharge         assumes    the narrow stratified appearance
 which      I   described in a similar vacuum-tube*,           fig. 2  : the discharge
  is now intermittent,         being separated by the revolving             mirror : as
  the wire is depressed and the resistance thus reduced, the discharges
  when examined by the mirror are found to be quicker in succession,
  being less and less separated until we arrive at a point at which the
  discharge suddenly changes its character,              appearing now as a con
  tinuous light.         Gradually raising the wire, and thus increasing the
  resistance, the discharge becomes           again stratified      and intermittent,
  more or less as the resistance is increased or reduced.
      14.   No. 70. This tube contains vapour of iodine (§ 9) : with the
  induction coil a luminous discharge is obtained, which exhibits very
  narrow striae     ;  with the battery of 3360 cells      striae are not observable,

but luminous discharges are obtained, which are distinctly separated
by the revolving mirror, and are consequently intermittent.
    15.   No. 319, with 2240 cells of the battery and           a resistance      intro
duced in the circuit     : the discharge can, by careful manipulations,               be
modified so as to assume        the appearance of a positive and negative
discharge, impinging on and intermingling with each other without any
dark space intervening (Plate I. fig. 3).            Around the negative ter
minal the luminosity extends to the sides          of   the tube ; from thence to
the positive wire the discharge, as represented in the figures, takes
place in a line of about 2 inches diameter, emitting a very faint light.
The slightest variation in the resistance obtained by raising or depress
ing the connecting wire in the columns of distilled water (fig. 1)
alters the appearance of the discharge to that represented in fig. 4,
where the dark portion is clearly defined.         As the resistance is reduced,
the dark space increases by the positive discharge receding towards the
wire, the negative becomes        brighter and more clearly defined, at its
termination      an approach to stratifications        is observed, until, as the
resistance is further reduced, the discharge will suddenly assume the
form (as in fig. 5) of two bright clouds, — the outer edges presenting
a greenish hlue colour, crescent-shaped, clearly and sharply defined,
of about /.tli of an inch diameter. The other portion of the clouds
remains of a bright reddish purple, gradually deepening in colour
in approaching the other edge, where it becomes less defined, leaving
towards the next cloud a dark space.            The   same gradations         of colour
are observable in the inner cloud next the positive wire                ;   but not   so
clearly or distinctly defined.      The discharge is at this time continuous
at intervals   ; but, without altering or apparently interfering with these
striae, sudden discharges take place        :  two or three similar cloud-like
striae   will be observed at the positive wire       ;   and at the same instant
brilliant stratifications   are visible, overlapping      the negative (fig.       6)*.
    With the 2240       series  distinct   sounds were heard in the tube                ;
with the whole battery of 3360           series, the overlapping          striae would
remain for several seconds, but the sounds were not appreciable until
a magnet was presented near to, and in a line              with, the overlapping
striae  ; the action of the magnet causes these striae to spread along the
surface of the glass tube, and in this state of the discharge the sounds
were again audible.

    When sounds       are heard,        either with the lesser       number of cells
(2240) or when the overlapping                 striae   of the greater number         are
spread by the magnet, the discharge is resolved by the mirror, and
as such is intermittent        ;   but otherwise it is continuous.
    Mr. Stewart, Director of Kew Observatory,                   was present when        I
made this experiment        ;    he examined the separation of the discharge
by the revolving mirror, and heard the sounds, under the conditions
of the discharge which I have described.
    16.   No. 320. The discharge in this tube did not                   pass   until the
potash was heated, when              a faint    luminosity     appeared, and imme
diately afterwards one, and then two, cloud-like                striae came from the
positive wire, while       round the negative a large brilliant glow was
produced     ; as the discharge continued, the negative wire became red-
hot.    I have repeated this       experiment many times with the same tube              ;
platinum     from the negative wire is deposited in a lateral direction,
on the sides of the tube, as it would have been from the discharge of
an induction coil.
    17.   No. 315 (Plates I. & II. fig. 7, &c). With 3360 cells, the
discharge in this tube is of a dazzling brilliancy, exhibiting 12 or 14
striae  (Dr. Faraday and Dr. Tyndall, who witnessed this experiment,
counted 13) ; that nearest the negative ball, being truncated and of a
pale-green colour, impinged on the luminous glow which surrounded
that terminal (fig. 13).
    With a resistance of the two columns of distilled water (fig. 1),               each
 18 inches in length, introduced           in the circuit    (§ 10), certain changes
in the form and number of the               striae take place.       Some of these      I
have endeavoured to represent by figs.                7, 8, 9, 10, 1 1, 19,  and 13.
    The wires attached           to the terminals        of the battery     are  placed
inside the two tubes containing             distilled water, connected with each
other from the bottom         ;   as soon as the wires touch the surface         of the
water, a faint luminous             discharge is observed at each ball of the
vacuum-tube.         As  one wire attached to the negative is slowly de
pressed, the two luminous discharges appear to travel towards or to
attract    each   other ;  and at times         I  have noticed a portion        of the
positive luminosity      to pass over and intermingle with the negative.
    I tried the effect of a magnet on the discharge while in this state                  ;
but it   was always extinguished          *, and    I  could not obtain any satis
factory result.

    Depressing the wire very gradually, the discharge assumes the form
of fig.   7, the positive being sharply       defined, the negative retaining
much of its irregular termination, but each separated from the other
by a dark interval of about one inch in length             .
     As the wire  was further depressed in the water, the brilliancy of the
positive    and negative luminous        glows increased        ;    and when about
3 inches    of one wire had been immersed          in the water,        a single clearly
defined luminous disk burst forth from the positive, remaining steady
and apparently fixed as in fig. 8.
     As the wire   was again    further   depressed,     the luminous           discharge
at the positive slowly progressed along the tube              until another bright
disk appeared, remaining (as long as              the wire was not further de
pressed)     stationary   as  in fig. 9.     At this time         13 inches        of wire
were in the water.
     The resistance   was   again reduced       by depressing the wire to                16
inches, when a third luminous disk was developed as in fig. 10                        ; and
at 18 inches depression, or the entire length of one column of water,
a fourth disk was observed as         in fig.  1 1.
     In this state, while the four luminous disks were stationary, the
wire attached to the positive        terminal of the battery was depressed
 4  inches; the luminous disks gradually           closing on each other became
 more compressed, when a fifth was developed, fig.               1 2.
     The luminous glow on the negative ball had gradually assumed                          a
 flattened surface towards the positive, appearing as a ring of light                       ;
 depressing the wire to     7 inches in the water, the luminous disks closed
 but remained separate, and a 6th was observed; with                       11  inches de
 pression another, or the 7th, appeared, the negative glow increasing in
 brilliancy, retaining its flattened appearance.             At this time, probably
 from the long- continued action, the power of the battery was re
 duced, and the 7th disk disappeared, retreating to and apparently
 absorbed by the luminosity          on the positive         ball  ;    but on further
 depressing the wire, it was immediately reproduced                ;  and on     15  inches
 insertion     an  8th was     obtained,    the    negative     glow increasing           in
 brilliancy, and the part nearest the positive presenting                    a  still more
 flattened appearance.
      Another clearly defined and separated disk of light                   was elicited,
  and then three or lour came out in quick succession                  ;  the whole dis
  charge now became        unsteady and flittering,         the luminous          disks no
  longer remaining fixed or stationary.

    18. From the first appearance of the luminous discharge in No. 3 1 5,
until when thirteen or fourteen bright disks or separate                striae were
observed, the discharge was not resolvable by a vibrating or a rotating
mirror     ; with the full power of the battery, the disk nearest the
negative was truncated and impinged on the glow which surrounds
that ball (fig. 13) : this truncated disk was also distinguishable by
its pale green colour ; those in its nearest contiguity had more or less
a reddish tinge      ;  the round negative glow was brilliant and of a bluish-
white colour     ;  minute bright scintillations emanated from the negative
ball, while distinct luminous           flash  discharges    took place through
the striae.        On examining       these intermittent      discharges     by two
revolving      mirrors,    kindly lent    me  by   Professor    Wheatstone,      they
appeared stratified       ; but whether this did not arise from the passing
of these discharges through the bright and dark portions of the
 continuous      discharge, might have been considered doubtful,               had    I
 not in another        tube observed a similar       stratified   discharge     under
 more favourable circumstances.             This tube, No. 324, is of the        same
 form and dimensions as 315          ;  on heating it with a spirit-lamp        when
 it was in the circuit of the battery, the luminous discharge showed
 four clearly defined separated striae, which remained fixed and steady
 in their relative positions       ;  in this state momentary        stratified    dis
 charges were observed at intervals of from five to ten seconds,                 these
 striae assuming a conical form, as         in Plate  II. fig. 14.
     I  have observed somewhat similar intermittent            discharges with the
 nitric-acid battery, possibly under more favourable conditions ; and
 with a more extended series than I then used*, the true nature of
  this discharge may be ascertained.
      1 9. The discharge from an electrical machine when passing through
  air in the dark, presents the well-known form of a brush at the
  end of the wire attached to the prime conductor, and of a star at the
  point of another wire attached to the rubber, or in connexion with
  the earth.       I have shownf that if this discharge is allowed to pass
  through a vacuum-tube, stratifications will be obtained similar to
  those from an induction coil, and that the discharge of a Leyden jar,
  if passed through      a wet string and a vacuum tube, is stratified      % ;  these

 discharges are consequently identical, and only differ in their appear
 ance according to the media through             which they are passed.
     20.    In  a former     communication      to the     Royal Society*,     I   have
 also shown that the stratified discharge can be obtained by a single
 disruption of the primary current of an inductive coil, however long
 may be the vacuum-tube through which the discharge is passed.                        If
 no addition       is made to the battery with which the primary wire                 of
 the apparatus is connected, or no alteration is made in the arrange
 ment      of the coil,   so as to increase or diminish         the intensity of the
 discharge, the stratifications will always present the same appearance
 and form, occupying the same spaces and positions in the vacuum-
 tube   ;  but  if  any change is made so as to alter the intensity, then a
 corresponding        alteration    will  appear   in the discharge, the slruc
 assuming a different          shape, and the bright and dark divisions
 occupying different positions.
    21. When a galvanometer,               a vacuum-tube,        and a   solution     of
iodide of potassium are arranged so as to form a continuous circuit
with the secondary coil of           an inductive coil, not only is a luminous
stratified     discharge produced,        but the needle of the galvanometer
will   be deflected, and iodine        will be evolved by the induced momen
tary action      ; we thus obtain     in this discharge all the indications and
conditions of a true voltaic circuit.
   In     the continuous      discharge of the battery          we  have the same
indications as that of the momentary current of the closed circuit of
an induction       coil, and neither is resolvable by the rotating mirror.
   The stratified discharge from            a single  disruption of the primary
wire of the induction coil, and the continuous discharge of the voltaic
battery, are therefore identical in their character.
   22.     With these preliminary         observations,     I now propose to        ex
amine the results obtained from the discharge of an extended series
of the voltaic battery in vacua described in this communication.
    1st. No. 248. The discharge under certain conditions is continuous,
and under other conditions it becomes intermittent.                These conditions
are, that     without any resistance introduced in the circuit, except that
inherent      in the battery, the discharge cannot              be resolved    by the
rotating      mirror, and so far may be considered as continuous                 ;  but

  circuit, the discharge          becomes      intermittent  ;  with  an increased re
  sistance the number of discharges in any given time is reduced, the
  duration of such intermittent             discharges being distinctly resolvable
  by the rotation or vibration            of the plane of     a mirror in which they
  can be reflected.
      2nd. No. 70.        In this   very imperfect vacuum, containing vapour of
  iodine,     the battery does not elicit any striae,           but by the revolving
  mirror the discharge is found to be intermittent.                With the induction
  coil the discharge in this tube elicits clearly defined but very narrow
  striae  ;  from the coil we have a discharge of high intensity which
 elicits stratifications,       although they are not attainable by the lower
 intensity of the battery.
      3rd. No. 319. We obtain evidence of two distinct                  states of a dis
 charge,       of colour in the        striae,    and, under certain conditions, of
 sound.
     4th.     In No.   320 we have experimental              proof that in the more
 perfect vacuum the discharge will not pass, confirming                     my former
 result     obtained with the coil         (Phil. Trans. 1859, p. 156), that the
 presence       of  a certain    amount of matter is indispensable, and that
 during the discharge heat is developed.
      5th. In No. 315, under all conditions of resistance described, the
 discharge of the battery is stratified, but cannot be resolved by the
revolving        mirror  :  in this tube        we are enabled     to determine and
 regulate the number of striae, to some                  extent alter their colour, to
fix and determine their position, separating or closing up the dark
space      between the luminous disks, these changes being entirely due
to the amount of resistance introduced in the circuit.
     The form, or figuration of the            striae, and the positions they occupy
in the vacuum-tube, appear by these experiments to depend upon two
separate and distinct conditions             : —
     1st.   The power or energy of the battery.
     2nd. The state of tension of the highly attenuated matter through
which the discharge           is visible.
     The    striae can be controlled, their number increased or reduced, and
their places or positions in the tubes altered by the introduction of
measurable amount of resistance in the circuit ; and thus they appear
to indicate        the amount of force of tension which exists in a closed
circuit of the battery,           as the divergence        of the gold   leaves  of  an

electroscope denotes the evidence of tension before the circuit is
completed.
    In my former communications to the Royal Society              I have alluded
to the direction of a force in the induction discharge from the positive
towards the negative       (Phil. Trans. 1858, p.      16, sections 57,  58).
    In 1859   I observed that there was also a tendency or indication
of   a force emanating        from the negative wire        (Phil. Trans. 1859,
pp. 140, 142, 153, sections 68, 72,          99); the actual disruption of the
particles from the negative terminal also indicates a force            ; and this
disruption    is as freely obtained by the continuous discharge            of the
battery   (§ 16)  as  it is by the intermittent discharge of the induction
coil.
    I have always observed that with the lowest state               of intensity
with which the discharge          can be   obtained from an induction coil, the
striae are wider apart and the dark           space  between the positive and
the negative is much extended            ;  under some conditions of the dis
charge it is the negative, and not the positive, that assumes the domi
nant character.
    The form of the        striae   in the battery    discharge, as observed in
No. 315, figs.    7, 8, and 9, presents an appearance somewhat analo
gous with the stationary undulations            which   exist in a column   of air
when isochronous progressive undulations             meet each other from     op
posite directions, and on the surface of water by mechanical impulses
similarly interfering with each other.
    May not the dark bands be the nodes of undulations arising from
similar impulses proceeding from positive and negative discharges?
     Or can the luminous stratifications which we obtain in a closed
circuit of the secondary coil of an induction apparatus, and in the
circuit  of the voltaic  battery, be the representation      ofpulsations which
pass along the wire of the former and through the battery of the
 latter, impulses possibly generated by the action of the discharge
 along the wires ?

       ration and Registration of Results." By the Rev. Thomas
           P. Kirkman, M.A., F.R.S.,               and Honorary Member of the
           Literary and Philosophical              Societies          of Manchester and
          Liverpool.         Received November 29, 1862.
     The following              of my Tables of polyedra. They com
                          are a portion
prise all the 6-edra, 7-edra, and 8-edra, with their reciprocals, and
all 9-edra of less than 1 7 edges.   It is desirable that examples of
results should be before the reader of my work on this theory,                                  if it
is so fortunate as to be read at all.              More results            can easily be added,
if it     is thought necessary, when the entire treatise is before the world.
   The method of computation of these Tables turns to advantage a
division of summits and reticulations not mentioned in the theory, as
it would have abbreviated nothing,                and would have added one more
to complications already too numerous, and all inevitable.
     Perfect summits and reticulations,            that      is,   such as have no effaced
effaceables,       are   pyramidal, propyramidal, or metapyramidal.
     A pyramidal         perfect summit or reticulation               is   one   of which every
effaceable, primary or secondary,             is   a   base        edge     of   a   pyramid,     by
which the A-gonal base of pyramid can be cut away in the process
                                     a
of reduction of the reticulation. Such construction made either
                                                       a                         is
by glueing together by their              edges    A-gonal, B-gonal, C-gonal, &c.
pyramidal bases, the vertices being supposed to hang downwards, or
by loading marginal triangles of plane reticulations with such bases
so posited.
     If   a   reticulation   has no effaceables,   it   is    merely       a   plane partitioned
polygon,        and the summit or edge which crowns                    it   completes     a   poly-
edron without the employment of any solid charges.                               I    call such   a
summit or         edge   propyramidal.

about a pyramidal summit or edge, we substitute an A-gonal, B-gonal,
&c. face of any polyedron which is not a pyramidal                             base,   we have a
perfect summit or edge of a solid of a greater number of edges, which
may or may not have another symmetry.                        Such a summit or edge is
metapyramidal.
  The most expeditious method of computing the polyedra of                                   N   or
fewer edges, is first to form and to crown all possible propyramidal
and pyramidal perfect reticulations which can be reduced by efface-
ment of effaceables        to   N or to fewer   edges    :    these are to be registered
in tables of perfect       edges and summits,      which show at                 a glance what
pyramidal     bases    enter into the constructions                     registered.       Having
determined,       by inspection of these tables and by effacements, the
lower polyedra,                   of metapyramidal edges and sum
                      we form tables
mits, by merely conceiving the substitution of other A-gons, B-gons,
&c. of solids thus far determined, for the A-gonal, B-gonal, &c. py
ramidal bases.        The       (MN),
                                edge        or the^-ace, considered, is at once
entered as an edge          (MN), or as      a p-a.ce,        of    a polyedron          of more
edges,    in the metapyramidal tables.
   Rules are easily laid down for the result of this conceived substi
tution,   as to symmetry,      signatures, and the tabular value (of enu
meration) .       We thus escape the enormous toil of separately construct
ing and crowning           the metapyramidal        reticulations.                   These   rules
will   be given   in the supplement       of applications, of             which this abstract
exhibits a few results.
   I    observe that a case is unprovided               for in art.             XLVII.       of my
second section, namely, the case of a zone which exhibits in some of
its forms the symbol 0P of an epizonal polar edge. Such a zone will of
course occur about an amphigrammic, about an cdrogrammic, or gono-
grammic zoned axis.               This polar epizonal        is to be included, as part
of the number       Aaa>    in the sinister of the equation first read,                      since
this    edge 0P is generally the epizonal          edge            of    a monozone A-gon,
never of two different A-gons.
   This   XLVIIth      article is sufficiently corrected by the effacement of
the word non-polar        in the 2nd, 9th, and 13th lines, and by writing
when for because       in the 7th line. So read, all cases are covered.

most the Tables       A, B, and C, would comprise a sufficient solution of

   This 3-zoned secondary pole of the regular octaedron is regis
tered as the termination of a homozone axis ; for all janal construc
tions upon it will be homozones.         The six poles registered in the
zonoid signature are here zoned amphigrammic         poles of 2-ple repeti

triace above on 135, and with a triace below on 246         :  the axis this
constructed is the reciprocal of the one here recorded.

    I may be permitted to remark           here that these results were in my
 possession early in 1858, when the prize             question of the French
 Academy was published for the competition          of 1861 : -" Perfeetionner
 en quelque   point important la theorie giomitrique           des polyedres."
 My work on this theory         was first completely composed    in the French
 language, in its present form, with the intention of presenting           it to
 the Academy in 1861.           Any person, who     cares to know the reasons
 why   I altered its destination, may read them at page 352              of the

   When studying,       many years ago,       the action of iodide of methyl
upon ammonia,      I pointed out the existence of dimethylamine          among
the products of the reaction.         The amount of iodide of dimethylam

monium      is very small when            compared with the quantities of the
iodides   of methyl, trimethyl, and more especially of tetramethylam-
 monium,     not to speak of iodide of ammonium              itself, so that    I was
compelled to be satisfied with approximative                platinum     determina
tions in order to establish the formation               of dimethylamine       under
these circumstances.          Having lately had to prepare           a specimen    of
the   dimethylated      ammonia,       and remembering        the small quantity
which    is formed     by means       of iodide of methyl, I resolved to avail
myself of an observation made in the mean time, according to which
dimethylamine is formed by the action of soda-lime upon the sulphite
of aldehyde ammonia,
              Ca H4,   H, N, S03+ Ca, 0=C„ H7 N + Caa SO4.
According to M. Gossmann*, this reaction furnishes ethylamine,
and indeed in such quantities as to render this process a convenient
mode of preparing         the substance.         Re-examined      subsequently     by
 M. Petersent,       the ethylamine         of M. Gossmann proved to           be  di
methylamine,      which is isomeric with the former,
                       CaH7N=           H Ln=CH3In.

Nor   does    M. Petersen appear            to share the enthusiasm       of his pre
decessor for the facility and elegance of this reaction.           Indeed, a glance
at the analysis published by this chemist is sufficient to show how
small a quantity of the base produced by this process must have been
obtained.
   In   repeating this experiment,            I have indeed obtained a minute
quantity of    an inflammable        ammonia     ; but, though varying the pro
cess, and   working on      a tolerably large scale,     I was unable to procure
a sufficient amount for a single analysis.
   Under these circumstances            I  was  compelled to return to the reac
tion by which      I  had originally obtained         dimethylamine,      viz. by the
action of iodide of methyl upon ammonia.
   By availing myself of the method of separating the ethyl-bases,
which some time ago         I  submitted to the Royal Society         J, I succeeded

 without difficulty in separating the dimethylamine from the mixture
 of ammonias which this reaction produces. An alcoholic solution of
 ammonia, gently heated with iodide of methyl in a flask provided
 with  a condenser,   rapidly solidifies into    a crystalline   mixture   of the
 iodides   of ammonium,       methyl-,   dimethyl-,     trimethyl-, and tetra-
 methylammonium.         The more soluble iodides          separated from     the
 difficultly soluble   iodide  of tetramethylammonium            are evaporated
 and distilled with potash, and the bases evolved carefully dried by pass
ing over hydrate of potassium, and conveyed through a powerfully re
frigerated serpentine in which dimethylamine and trimethylamine,
 together with a portion of methylamine,          are condensed, the ammonia
 and the remainder of the methylamine             being carried off as gas and
 condensed in water. The mixture of the three methylated bases is then
 brought in contact with oxalate of ethyl, when the methylamine imme
 diately solidifies into a crystalline mass of dimethyloxamide,
                         C4H8N2Oa=(C H3), LN„

 a liquid boiling between 250° and 260°, while the trimethylamine
 remaining unchanged may be expelled from the mixture                  by gently
 heating in the water-bath.         Dimethyloxamate       of ethyl being easily
 soluble in water, is separated from the dimethyloxamide            by treatment
 of the mixture with cold water.         Distilled with hydrate of potash,
 dimethyloxamate of ethyl yields a mixture of alcohol and dimethyl
 amine, oxalate of potassium remaining behind.                 Evaporated with
 hydrochloric acid, the distillate furnishes a crystallized residue of
 chloride of dimethylammonium, from which, on addition of an alkali,
the pure dimethylamine is liberated.
    Dimethylamine is a powerfully alkaline liquid of a strongly ammo-
niacal odour, easily soluble in water, and possessing the general cha
racters of this class of compounds.         Its boiling-point,    strange to say,
very nearly coincides with     that  of trimethylamine,     —  the boiling-point
of the former being between         8°  and   9°,  that  of  the latter 9°.   To
eliminate the influence of changes of pressure, the boiling-points of
the two substances were determined at the same time.

    I  have fixed the composition of dimethylamine          by the analysis of
the platinum-salt and gold-salt.         The former is one of the finest salts
which    I  have ever examined, crystallizing in long splendid needles,
shooting through the liquid from one side of the vessel to the other.
It   contains
                 C2 H8   N Pt Cl,= [(C H3)a H, N] CI, Pt CL..
     The gold-salt, which likewise crystallizes very well, has      an analo
gous composition, viz.
                  C, H8 N Au Cl4= [(CH„)a Ha N] CI, Au Cls.
If    the products     obtained by distilling the sulphite of aldehyde-
ammonia      with   lime had contained the minutest trace of dimethyl
amine, the formation of the beautiful characteristic platinum-salt
would have revealed it.         In  none of the experiments did     I observe
the formation of this compound.

        By A. W. Hofmann, LL.D., F.R.S.                 Received December
        3, 1862.
    In a Note   recently addressed to the Royal Society,     I have described
a new organic base which is formed            of a secondary product in the
manufacture of aniline upon a large scale.        This substance, paraniline,
                                    C„HuN2,
ia isomeric    with aniline, and   owes its origin evidently to the action of
heat, under circumstances         not yet precisely determined, upon that
body.      I have not yet succeeded     in producing    this compound from
aniline, but the experiments made with the view of accomplishing
this transformation have led me to an observation which I beg leave
to mention      briefly  to the Royal Society.       The vapour of aniline,
when passed through a red-hot glass tube, undergoes decomposition             ;
the tube becomes coated with a film of carbon, a brown liquid collects
in the receiver, and      a colourless  gas  burning with   a luminous  flame
is evolved   ; if this be allowed to pass through water, the latter becomes
 charged with a considerable amount of cyanide of ammonium.

    The brown distillate contains        a large proportion    of aniline which
has escaped     decomposition,      and which may be readily separated by
treatment of the distillate with an acid.        On rectifying the portion of
the oil which is insoluble in acid, the thermometer becomes stationary
at 80°, when a colourless transparent liquid distils, possessing all the
properties   of benzol   ;  it was identified,   moreover, by transformation
into nitrobenzol and aniline.         The thermometer then rapidly rises,
becoming stationary again at between 190° and 195°; a limpid oil
lighter than water passes over, which by its odour is at once recog
nized as benzonitrile*.        To remove every doubt, this oil         was  boiled
with an alcoholic solution of potash, when torrents of ammonia were
evolved, benzoate of potassium remaining as a residue.                The benzoic
acid was separated from the salt by addition             of hydrochloric acid,
and converted into the silver-salt, which was identified by analysis.
    The formation, under        these  circumstances, of benzonitrile is pro
bably due to a reaction at a higher temperature between aniline and
the hydrocyanic       acid generated during the destruction            of another
portion of this substance,
                    C,H7N+HCN=C7H,N+H,N.
 The action of heat upon aniline gives rise, in addition, to the forma
tion of small quantities of a crystalline indifferent substance, and an
oily  base   boiling at    a very   high temperature;      the nature      of both
 these substances    I have not yet determined.
    The transformation of aniline into benzonitrile          is thus seen to be
far from elegant     ; and   if it have   any claims to notice,      it is merely
 because there are at present comparatively few reactions known              which
permit a passage from a hydrocarbon,            CmH,h— 6, to an acid,
                               Cn+lH,n-6 0a.
 This transformation       may possibly      be  used for the production          of
 several of the higher terms of the series of aromatic acids which have
not yet been obtained.
   * I have lately had an opportunity of observing that benzonitrile solidifies in a
mixture of solid carbonic acid ,aml ether.   The beautifully crystalline mass fuses
again at —17°.

 IV. "A     Development of the Theory of Cyclones."              By Francis
             Galton, F.R.S.          Received December 25, 1862.
    Most meteorologists     are agreed    that a circumscribed   area  of baro
 metric depression is usually a locus of light ascending currents, and
 therefore of an indraught of surface winds which create a retrograde
 whirl (in our hemisphere),      because they    bring to their  destination a
 lateral impulse, partly due to the greater easterly speed of the earth's
 surface whence the southern portion          of the indraught    took its  de
 parture, and partly due to the less easterly, or we may say greater
 westerly, speed of its northern portion      .
    Conversely, we ought to admit that a similar area of barometric
elevation is usually a locus of dense descending currents, and there
 fore of a dispersion of a cold dry atmosphere, plunging from the
 higher regions upon the surface of the earth, which, flowing away
 radially on all sides, becomes at length imbued with a lateral motion
 due to the above-mentioned cause, though acting in a different manner
 and in opposite directions.         The currents necessarily travel      with
 diminished radial speed as they widen out from their central area           of
dispersion, and the eastward tendency of the northern portion of the
system and the westward tendency             of the southern    become    more
overpowering.      It  may be presumed, on consideration of the extreme
mobility of the air, that a continuous dispersion of currents would
result in the yielding of the east and west winds, which had no
tangential   movement of their own, to the curvature of the others,
and that we should witness a disposition of currents like those in the
annexed diagram, which is copied from an actual
occurrence on December 2,        1 86 1 . The appearance
is that of  a centre   of calms whence currents flow
in radial lines, rapidly curving to the right and
                     "
forming a sort of anticyclone."
    Dove's law of gyration is so fertile in result, that
it accounts for the    same   direct rotation    of a cold
wind by a wholly different process.           As an antithesis to his theory
of cyclones    being    due   to   an equatorial    current pressing against
quiescent air, he adds (Law of Storms),             with  a view  of illustra
ting his position,    and not of meeting cases that practically occur,
polar   cyclones,   "if   they   exist," would      have   a direct  rotation.

 It  is not necessary to allude further to his well-known                     theory— it is
sufficient to show that two separate causes                 cooperate in producing a
rotation or curvature of currents such as                 I  have described.             I have
not the slightest doubt that a strong curvature of atmospheric cur
rents to the right does frequently exist, owing to the descent of cold
air from     above    ;  for in lately charting the weather of Europe thrice
daily during a        month, I found it more or less present on from fifty
to sixty occasions.           Its existence is consonant to what                  we     should
expect.       It is   hardly possible     to conceive masses           of air rotating in a
retrograde sense in close proximity, as              cyclonogists suppose, without
an intermediate area of direct rotation, which would, to use a mechani
cal simile, be in gear with both of them, and make the movements of
the entire system correlative and harmonious.
     The result     I   have thus far arrived at, and         which      I should     look for
hereafter, is that whenever the barometer shows circumscribed areas
of marked elevation and depression at distances not exceeding 1500
miles apart, a line drawn from                                      p.    2

     The author referred to the communication by John Hunter

sophical Transactions' for 1772. In this communication Hunter
notices that in occasional instances, especially in persons who have
died of sudden and violent deaths, the stomach is found on inspection
to have undergone                  solution, to the extent of perforation, from the
action    of its own secretion upon it.                         Hunter considered that this
could only have taken place after death ; and to account for why the
same occurrence did not ensue during life, he adduced the living prin
ciple    as constituting            the protecting      The fact that parts of
                                                           agent.
living animals,           as    shown by Claude Bernard of Paris, are susceptible
of digestion when introduced                        through      a fistulous         opening into     a
digesting stomach, proved that Hunter's explanation does not stand
the test of experiment.                   The author corroborated Bernard's results
upon frogs, and referred                   to an experiment in which he had also
obtained the digestion of the extremity of the ear of a living rabbit.
  The view at present most generally entertained     that the epi                   is,
thelial lining or mucus protects the   stomach   from  undergoing
digestion during life.                 This    it   is   supposed        is   acted upon and dis
solved, but being as constantly renewed, the stomach escapes injury.
There being no longer the power of producing epithelium after
death, accounts for the occurrence of the solution that may then be
observed.
   To test this view, the author removed                        a   patch of mucous membrane
about the size of              a   crown piece from the stomach of the dog.                      Food
was afterwards                 digested    without,        however, the denuded stomach
showing      the slightest             sign of attack.           It      thus appearing       that the
stomach resisted digestion notwithstanding                               the assumed protecting
layer had        been       removed,      it   became       evident that something besides
the epithelial lining was required to account for the security enjoyed.
   Seeing that the question was still open for explanation, the fol
lowing was the view propounded by the author.          The existence of
 acidity,   it   was first remarked,            is    an absolutely essential condition             for
 the accomplishment of the act of digestion.                               During life the walls of
 the stomach              are      most freely permeated by                   a   current   of alkaline
 blood.      Under such circumstances                      it   would appear impossible that
 any digestive action could be effected.                         There would         be one condition
 that would neutralize the other.                        Acidity    is   needful for digestion, and
 alkalinity      is   a   constant character of the blood.                        As long therefore   as
 so free    a   circulation of this alkaline                fluid should be maintained (and

                                        388                                [Jan.  8,
 this happens to be one of the necessary conditions of life), the stomach
 will  be supplied    with   a source   of protection competent to afford it
 the security from attack by its own secretion that it enjoys.
    Digestion of the stomach may be effected after death, because the
 blood, being then stagnant, is incapable of offering            the barrier pro
  duced by a circulating current.
    Experiments      were mentioned     in which the circulation through the
 stomach had been arrested during life so as to imitate the condition,
 as   far as    the   stomach    was concerned,       that  exists   after   death.
 Although this was effected whilst the process of digestion was
 actively proceeding, yet it was only in some cases that the mucous
 membrane of the stomach was attacked.                On repeating the experi
 ment, however, having previously introduced             a dilute   non-corrosive
 acid (the phosphoric and citric were the acids employed) into the
 stomach, the result was solution and perforation in a short space of
 time.
    The author had       expected,   when he commenced his experiments, to
 have obtained the same result upon arresting the circulation              through
 the stomach as occurs after death        ;  but it  became   evident to him on
 reflection that although the circulation        through the stomach may be
 stopped by ligatures       during life, yet the conditions are not thereby
 rendered completely         identical  with those prevailing        after   death.
 There is still     a circulation   all around the stomach, and from the
 facility with which the permeation of fluids takes place,               a certain
 amount of counteractive influence would still be exerted.                  By the
 artificial  introduction,    however, of an acid into        the cavity of the
 stomach before its vessels were ligatured, the surrounding            circulation
became      inadequate to afford the required neutralizing            power,   and
 perforation therefore quickly resulted.
    It  did not appear to the author that the digestion of the living
tissues of animals referred to in the first part of his paper formed any
valid objection to his view.         In the case of the frog's legs, he con
sidered it might be fairly taken that the amount of blood possessed
by the animal would        be inadequate to    furnish the required      means   of
resistance.      In  the case of the rabbit's      ear, the vascularity     of the
part being so much less than that of the walls of the stomach, he
thought there       was nothing     unreasonable in conceiving that, whilst
the one might receive protection            through the circulating alkaline

    1863.]
  current, the other might           be unable     to resist attack.      There   was
   no comparison        between the position        of the stomach and that of
  the rabbit's      ear, and the    question, according      to his view, resolved
  itself into   degree   of power   possessed    by the acidity of the contents      of
  the stomach on the one hand, and the alkalinity of the circulating
  current on the other.
      The author concluded by adducing experimental evidence to show
  that pepsine was contained in the walls of the stomachs of persons
  who had died from         severe diseases,   as well as   in the normal fasting
  and digesting stomach.

      In  a short paper submitted to the         Royal Society    some weeks ago,
  I   have recorded       some    experiments     on the basic compounds          di
 stilling at very high temperatures, which are formed as secondary
 products in the manufacture of aniline, and which are known in the
 ateliers    of MM.      Collin and Coblenz       as queues    cTaniline.    I  have
 mentioned that the bases which distil above 330°, when treated with
 dilute sulphuric acid, furnish         a soluble     sulphate,   the sulphate     of
 paraniline,     the history of which      I  have already traced, and a sul
 phate     remarkable     for its insolubility in water.       It is this insoluble
 sulphate, and the base from which          it is derived, that form the subject
of the following notice.
     The insoluble sulphate which          is formed     on  treating   the queues
cTaniline boiling       above 330°   with cold dilute sulphuric acid,          sepa
rates as a yellowish         semisolid  crystalline    mass,   contaminated with
considerable quantities of the oily sulphates of other bases.               Ebulli

phate becomes more crystalline and nearly white.                 A further purifi-

cation is effected by dissolving this mass in a large quantity of boiling
water, and filtering from insoluble oily substances      ;  on cooling, the
sulphate separates in white needles,      which, on boiling with alcohol,
become perfectly pure.
   In   order to liberate the base, the sulphate is suspended in weak
alcohol, and submitted       to the action of caustic soda   :   a solution is
thus obtained, which,      on the addition   of water, deposits the new
base in scaly crystals.      They require only to be washed with water,
to be redissolved in alcohol, and to be reprecipitated       by addition     of
water.
   Thus obtained, this substance presents itself in small white needles
or scales, which are apt to assume a greyish tint on drying, very
slightly soluble in boiling water, easily in alcohol and ether. This
base fuses at 45°, and boils at 322°, distilling without the slightest
alteration.

translated into the formula

surrounded    by phenylic associations      ;  and nothing,    in fact, could
have been more natural        than to consider the new base as diphenyl-

this view, moreover, appeared to       be countenanced by the deportment
of the compound under the influence of iodide of ethyl.             To  secure
at once the last term       of ethylation, the     base was   repeatedly sub
mitted in alcoholic solution to the alternate action of iodide of ethyl
and oxide    of silver.    The product     of the reaction was by appro
priate treatment converted into a platinum-salt,         which   was found to
be   but slightly crystalline,   insoluble in water, but readily soluble in
alcohol.    Both combustion and platinum-determination            proved this
salt to contain
           C„ H,, N Pt Cl,= [C„      H10 (Ca Hs)2   N]  C1, Pt CI,.
This salt  was decomposed by sulphuretted hydrogen, and successively
treated with oxide of silver and iodide of ethyl, chloride of silver and
dichloride of platinum,     so as to produce     in succession the chloride
and oxide    and, lastly, the iodide, chloride,      and platinum-salt    of  a
higher ethylated body.         But the platinum-salt      thus obtained was
found to have still the same composition, which          was, moreover, con
firmed   by the analysis of a fine bromide, crystallizing          in prisms,
difficultly soluble in water and ether, but easily soluble in alcohol,
and a well-defined iodide, crystallizing in plates and having properties
similar to those of the bromide.        These salts contained respectively,
         Bromide   C„ HM NBr= [CUH10 (Ca H3)a N] Br,             and

 base     is    attacked     by   this compound,                the product being an iodide
 which, when treated with oxide of silver, yielded   powerfully alka             a

 bases.         Converted        into   a    chloride and precipitated                by dichloride of
 platinum,        this substance furnished                 a   difficultly soluble platinum-salt

    The new base, for which I propose the name Martylamine, is
remarkable for the disinclination with which it                  goes  through the
series    of   performances       which are generally expected from well-
defined monamines.             Chlorine, bromine, and oxidizing agents in
 general, give rise       to the formation        of dark-coloured      compounds,
which appear to       possess but    little tendency to crystallize.      An excep
 tion is formed by its behaviour with nitrous acid.                On passing this
 gas   through an alcoholic solution, the liquid becomes warm, and soon
 solidifies into a mass of red crystals, which are insoluble in water,
 difficultly soluble in alcohol, easily soluble in ether, which contain
                         CMHl3N3=(CiaH0)aN'»H,N3,
 showing that this substance is formed by simple nitrogen                  substitu

 Treated with acids, this substance            is easily reconverted   into martyl
 amine with simultaneous formation of an aromatic compound, which
  I intend to examine more minutely by-and-by.
     I  cannot at present offer any observation on the reaction which in
  the manufacture       of aniline gives rise to the formation of the new
  base,    although     MM. Collin        and Coblenz      have most kindly fur
  nished me with a detailed account of the several phases of their
  operations.      It might, in fact, at the first glance appear to be waste
  of time to examine        a compound which,          however well defined, may
  owe   its formation to    a  combination of conditions which are not easily
  realized again.      My   friends    Mr. Nicholson and Mr. Perkin, of well-
  known experience in matters connected with the manufacture of ani
 line, have never observed this compound in their operations.                   Mar-
 tvlamine,      nevertheless,     is endowed with        an interest    of its own.
 Though of obscure origin, this body, from the place it occupies on
 the ladder of carbon, and from             its very composition,     establishes at
 once ties of parentage with some of the most distinguished                  families
 in the domain of organic chemistry.                 A  glance at the formula       of
 martylamine       suffices to point out the close connexion of this com
 pound with benzidine, the remarkable               base  obtained by Zinin from
 azobenzol, and the true constitution            of which was lately    made out    in

 of placing them        side    by side  ;   but   I  may be allowed to point more
 particularly    to the remarkable similarity            of the deportment of benzi
 dine under the influence of iodide of ethyl, this base exhibiting the
 same reluctance to pass from the state               of tertiary substitution to the
 state  of ammonium         base — a passage        which, in the case of benzidine,

       Frank land, F.R.S.                 Received          December 26, 1862.
   When oxalic ether is mixed with more than its own weight of
zincethyl,      the temperature         of the mixture             slowly    rises,   and soon
considerable quantities of gas begin to be evolved, unless the heat
be moderated        by plunging the vessel,                in which the reaction takes
place, into cold water.           The    gas consists of equal volumes of ethylene
and hydride of ethyl ; and as             it is the product of a secondary decom
position, its evolution       should        be avoided as much as possible in the
manner just indicated.             The final application of              a gentle heat com
pletes the reaction.
  The mixture generally continues fluid, but it becomes of alight straw-
colour, and of an oily consistency.   On being heated to 130° C. in a
retort, no distillate passes over.                If,   after cooling, its own volume         of
water be very gradually             added to         it,   torrents    of hydride of ethyl,

adding     water    to the        residue        in the retort,        and    continuing    the
distillation    upon    a   sand-bath.            The ethereal oil was precipitated
from the alcoholic distillate by the addition of water, and was added
to that which floated upon the surface of the aqueous distillate.   It
was then dried over chloride of calcium, and rectified.                          A    very large

treated with an aqueous solution of caustic potash.              It separates as

be boiled   with water without decomposition,        and traces only       of the
acid distil off with the water.

IV. " On        the Artificial Production of Fibrin from Albumen."
        By   Alfred Hutchison            Smee, Junior, Student of St. Bar
        tholomew's Hospital.            Communicated by W. S. Savory,
         Esq.     Received January 15, 1863.
     The condition in which fibrin exists in the blood and other fluids,
and the deviation in quantity and quality in certain cases of disease
from that of normal          blood, has been to physiologists        a subject  of
great interest.       From the close resemblance of fibrin to albumen,           I
 was induced       to undertake a series of experiments, which appear to
 me to have some value           in determining     the conditions under which
 fibrin is derived from albumen, and which             have resulted   in the dis
 covery of the general principle by which the direct conversion                 of
 albumen into fibrin may be effected.              On referring to Lehmann's
 '
    Chemistry,' in which the analyses of albumen and fibrin are quoted, it
 will be observed, on comparing them, that the difference appears to
 be    the substitution     of   1*5  part of oxygen per 100 for a similar
 amount      of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulphur, phosphorus               con
 joined.

       The analyses made by            Scherer   give   comparatively     the same
   results.
       From these analyses       I was induced to make some       experiments     to
   endeavour to convert         albumen into fibrin by the direct addition of
   oxygen gas, by which        I  anticipated   that not only might the oxygen
   be imparted      to the albumen, but also that the other elements might
   be oxidized and carried off.
       In my first    experiments     I  used blood from which the fibrin had
    been carefully whipped during          the period of its coagulation, so that
    the serum might contain as many blood-cells             as possible, upon the

                                      400                             [Jan.   15,
  supposition that the cells would afford a large amount of surface to
  the action of the gas.
    The serum, after being whipped, was permitted to stand for
 twenty-four hours, that any fibrin which it might contain, and which
 had not coagulated during the process of whipping,           might  do so.
    The apparatus used in all      cases   will be easily understood      by re
ferring to the annexed diagram.          It consists, first, of a copper flask
 containing    black oxide of manganese, from which the oxygen was
slowly given off by the action of heat.
    The  gas was conveyed thence by tubes        into a wash-bottle,    B (con
taining a dilute solution    of potass),  for the absorption of impurities.
    From the bottle B the gas passed into the flask C, which con
tained the defibrinated blood.       This flask   was placed    in a vessel (D)
containing    water at a temperature varying between 95° and 100°
Fahr.  ;  and   I had no difficulty in preserving that heat continuously
by a small gas-flame placed under a sand-bath.             After the   gas  had
escaped   from the blood,    I generally passed    it through    a second   por
tion of defibrinated blood contained in another        vessel  (E) .
    For all  these experiments pig's      blood was invariably chosen, on
account of its richness in blood-cells.
    My apparatus being ready, and oxygen being slowly given off, the
whipped     blood, from which     every particle    of fibrin had been pre
viously removed, was     introduced into the flask C.

    The blood employed                was   arterial, and not venous.          At first the
bright scarlet colour of the blood increased somewhat, but after twelve
hours the bright scarlet began to                     assume   more the colour of venous
blood    :    the cells at the same time began to shrivel.                       From        this
time the blood began rapidly to grow darker and darker, when, after
thirty-six hours, it was almost black*.
   Virchow has shown that, by acting on the haematin contained in
the blood- cells by acetic acid, and subsequently                      boiling    it,   a   sub
stance       is   formed to which he gives the name of haemine,                   which he
considers to be           a   product in an intermediate stage between haematin
and pigment.             The black substance formed by oxidation may pro
bably    be       found to be analogous to,  not identical with, Virchow's

haemin.       I     found in this blood, at the end of thirty-six hours, small
masses, which had, under the microscope, the appearance of fibrin.
A small       portion of the same blood as that used in the experiment was
set aside     till the completion of the experiment, when               it   was examined,
but no fibrin           was found.
  Likewise in the glass                E,
                            although the gas was passed through                                it
without heat, no fibrin was found, proving that temperature had also
an effect on the production of fibrin.                      This experiment   was repeated
many times          :   in all   cases the blood assumed the black colour,              but   I
did not invariably find fibrin.
  The appearance of fibrin in                   some cases, and the non-appearance             in
many others, seemed at first sight to be inexplicable,                       thoughI        shall
be able to          demonstrate, in         a   later portion of this paper, that the
result may be explained upon the hypothesis that the alkaline salts
were in relative excess in those cases where the fibrin did not appear.
    In   my next series of experiments, the white of an egg was added to
about    4    oz.   of the defibrinated blood.      The egg-albumen at first had
a   tendency            to separate    and float at the top of the blood-serum,
although well agitated together.                       In   these cases the blood assumed
the same dark colour as when                    it   was subjected   to experiment alone,
though    did not appear until after the serum and egg-albumen had
             it
completely coalesced, which took place about ten hours after the
subjection          to temperatures         between 95° and 100° Fahr.,               and the
action of oxygen gas.                 At the end of thirty-six hours, the time when
the experiment was stopped, masses of substances were found float-

ing, and also adhering to the hottom and sides of the vessel.            These
clots were in sufficient quantity to be collected and washed in the
filter to free them from blood-cells           and  other   impurities.     The
washed portion, under the microscope, had the distinct              appearance
of fibrin.
     In  cases where the albumen had not sufficient time to be mingled
with the blood, little or no fibrin     was formed.   The time occupied for
its absorption varied from about ten to twenty hours.
                                    I
     In the experiments which conducted with albumen alone,                I ex
perienced at first some difficulty in obtaining       the albumen perfectly
 pure, on account of the presence of chalazae and other foreign matter.
 To obviate this difficulty, I found that, by adding one drop of glacial
 acetic acid to every white of egg employed, and then by well beating
 up the albumen, I obtained, on subsequent filtration, a clear solution
 which gave to litmus-paper a slightly acid reaction.          On placing this
 transparent     albumen in the ordinary       apparatus,  I  found, after the
 passage    of oxygen   gas for four hours at the temperature before stated,
 that fibrin began to be formed.           I found that, by placing coils of
 platinum      wire in the albumen       whilst  undergoing     oxidation,   the
 formation     of fibrin  was   not only greatly facilitated,     but its sub
 sequent separation from the rest of the albumen was accomplished
 with greater ease, as the fibrin hung in threads upon the platinum
 wire.      When platinized platinum was used, the formation of fibrin, as
  might have been expected, was slightly improved.
      Fibrin produced artificially in these experiments, and especially
 that formed on platinum wire, had a beautiful and regular arrange
  ment, mostly being deposited in parallel lines.          The fibrin likewise
  was whiter, and had a more delicate consistence than the common
  fibrin in blood.
      I next tried the effect of adding    a small quantity of a strong solu
  tion of ammonia to the albumen, which had naturally a slightly alka
  line reaction   ; and then it was subjected to the influence of a current
  of oxygen in the     same manner as in the preceding         experiments.      I
  found that fibrin was formed to a much smaller extent than when acid
  albumen was employed.          The ammonia in all       cases appears to be
  driven off to some extent by the oxygen, but was never entirely re
  moved.      The fibrin in this   case formed on the surface     of the liquid,
  and did not appear to be dissolved as the experiment was progressing.

It   is worthy of particular observation,    that fibrin was formed in the
liquid which still contained ammonia in appreciable quantity.
     My father suggested to me that it would be desirable to try the
effect   of the decomposition of water by electricity on albumen,       as by
that process the effect of hydrogen and oxygen in a nascent state is
presented to different parts of the same fluid.         For the purposes of
this experiment      I   employed four cells (of the test-tube form) of
Smee's battery, in which the negative pole consisted of a platinized
platinum wire.        This battery generated    a continuous,     but feeble,
current     of electricity ; and the smallest perceptible      bubbles   were
evolved from the platinized platinum wire when in operation for the
experiment.
     The albumen was placed in the decomposition            trough,  where a
very large positive pole was       employed, but a smaller negative one,
and the temperature was maintained as in former experiments.             After
 the passage of the electric current for some time, the positive pole of
 the decomposition cell was coated with a hard gelatinous mass, which,
 being    immersed in water at 90° Fahr. for a few hours, unravelled
 itself into long fibres, which had, under the microscope, the appear
 ance of fibrin.
     On the negative pole, however,   a  frothy deposit alone    was formed ;
 but great care must be taken to stop the experiment before the pro
 ducts of the two poles grow together, to which           they have a great
 tendency.      The moment this takes place the albumen begins to
 coagulate, and in a very short time the whole becomes converted into
 an almost semisolid mass.        The fibrin is not   so perfect when made
  by this method, and is much more difficult to form than when made
  from   neutral or slightly acid albumen by the ordinary           process of
  oxidation.
      In  my experiments      with egg-albumen to which a solution of
  potass had been   added before it was subjected to the action of oxygen,
  the temperature ranging between 95° and 110° Fahr., no fibrin was
  found when the experiment was stopped.
      In  one  case oxygen was passed     through   a solution  of potass and
  albumen for three days and nights, and yet not the slightest trace of
  fibrin  was found.     The albumen  became    of a dark red hue, but two
  days after the experiment ceased      it resumed its normal colour.        A
  few transparent hard substances were found, insoluble          in water and

weak acids which had separated from the albumen.                        A few other
small white substances were noticed, which had all the appearance
                                                                                      of
carbonate of lime, and which were              soluble in acid.        Albumen was
then mixed with gastric juice, and kept at the normal temperature of
the body for the space of twelve hours, to produce artificial digestion,
when     it  was  subjected to experiment.           I should here state that the
gastric juice was procured from a dog, which had a fistulous opening
made into its stomach by Professor Savory.               All symptoms of inflam
mation and irritation had fully ceased          ;  the dog, in fact, was in perfect
health, and beginning to get fat, when the gastric juice was procured                  ;
 so that the latter must be considered as healthy gastric juice.                  From
 the dog large quantities of gastric juice were obtainable ; and                 I have
 to tender my best thanks to Professor Savory for his great kindness
 in placing whatever        I required at my disposal.          After the albumen
 had been digested for twelve hours               and filtered, that the solution
 might    be perfectly clear,     it  was subjected to the action      of oxygen for
 a few hours, when fibrin was formed, though                    not in so large an
 amount as in albumen            to which one drop of the glacial acetic acid
 had been added.           The filaments of the fibrin, however, were of               a
 more delicate constitution.
     From     a consideration     of the   above    results,  I thought     that fibrin
 might     be formed from the albumen which,              after digestion with gas
 tric juice, had passed through a membrane made of the parchment
 paper of Messrs. De la Rue and Gaines.                 In some experiments* to
 which     I had   been   led from a study of Professor           Graham's      elegant
 researches on dialysis, and which          I had formerly been conducting,           on
 the passage      of various fluids through          membranes,     it was observed
 that albumen, after digestion with gastric juice, dialysed to a certain
 extent.      Three ounces of albumen were digested for the space of
 twelve hours, at the temperature of the body.                  It was then placed
 on the dialyser       : it should    be remarked that gastric        juice   does   not
  coagulate the albumen during its conversion into albuminose.
      The digested albumen was kept for ten hours on the dialyser at
 the temperature of 98° to          1 10° Fahr.
     * These experiments, although carried      on   upon an extensive    scale, are not
 quite in order for publication in detail ; nevertheless I may state that, after arti
 ficial digestion, pure albumen, coagulated albumen, cheese, and, most remarkable
 of all, cod-liver oil were capable of passing through the dialyser into water to a
  large extent. I trust on a future occasion to elucidate this curious action.

    The water (one and a half pint) into which the digested albumen
had passed was concentrated at a temperature of not more than
80°    Fahr.  ;  and the concentrated        solution    being   afterwards oxi
dized,  I  found that fibrin was formed, notwithstanding             the changes
it had undergone by digestion, which had rendered it capable of
dialysis. During the process of passing oxygen into albumen, I found
that carbonic acid was evolved. This was ascertained by passing
the oxygen, after it had escaped from the albumen, through lime-
water.     I also found   that phosphoric acid was evolved, by subjecting
the effluent oxygen to the molybdate-of-ammonia                 test.   Carbonic
acid and phosphoric         acid were also found when blood-serum was
used, by the same tests as those employed when egg-albumen was
the material used for experiment.           In    some   cases common     air was
driven through albumen in the place of oxygen, at a temperature be
tween 95° and 110° Fahr., and then           I  found the formation of fibrin
differed but little from the quantity produced when oxygen alone was
used.    To ascertain whether the formation of fibrin          was due really to
oxygen alone,     I tried hydrogen gas in the place of oxygen or common
air, and at the same temperature.          When hydrogen was passed into
blood-cells    sulphur   was evolved.     This was detected by passing the
hydrogen, after it had traversed the serum, into a solution of lead-
salt, and also by suspending over the serum strips               of lead paper,
when they soon became blackened by the sulphur.
    When egg-albumen          was   employed instead of the blood-serum,
sulphur    was again detected.
    Fibrin was not formed by the action of hydrogen on blood-serum
or egg-albumen, although         in some    cases    the hydrogen was passed
continuously    for forty-eight   hours through the fluids.        The action of
carbonic acid gas on egg-albumen under the same condition of tem
perature produces no fibrin, but sulphur was again detected by sus
pending strips of lead paper over the albumen, which in a few hours
became tinged.
   The   same result was obtained when          defibrinated   blood was used    ;
but in this   case,  in addition   to the sulphur,     a minute trace of phos
phoric acid was found.            Not   the    slightest   trace of fibrin    was
detected.
   I  conceived, from the result of my experiments on the oxidation
of albumen, that, if oxygen was passed into milk, fibrin might                 be

formed, from the fact that the analyses of albumen of egg, and the
casein which the milk contains, differ little from each other, and be
cause   the analysis of the milk of an animal, a few days before and
after parturition,   shows that albumen is found in the place of casein.
On subjecting, however, milk to experiment, no fibrin was found
after the lapse of twenty-four hours.
   This may be due to either of two causes : first, the casein in the
milk may not be in a fit state for undergoing the change before it
has   been   acted on by the various digestive secretions, or, secondly,
because    in the dilute and fluid state in which       it occurs in milk it
does   not offer sufficient resistance to the passage of the bubbles of
oxygen to retain the gas sufficiently long for each bubble to have
time to produce an effect.      In all my experiments   I have  found (other
conditions being equal) the slower the bubbles passed           through     the
liquid material, and the more viscid the fluid was, the greater was
the amount of fibrin produced.          This may possibly in    some degree
account for the non-formation         of fibrin when oxygen      was passed
through     milk.    I tried the effect of oxygen upon fresh grape-juice,
but was unable to form any fibrin from it.         Further experiments are
required upon various vegetable juices.
   I  next experimented upon the oxidation of gluten, which was ob
tained from wheat-flour by the ordinary method.           This  was digested
in gastric juice for twelve hours, and then filtered.        After the clear
liquid had    been subjected to oxidation for some hours, small threads
of  a substance were formed.          When    a portion of this   was    placed
under the microscope, no difference could be detected between it and
ordinary fibrin.
   From these      experiments, it seems to me that the following con
clusions may be drawn       : —
   First, that fibrin is produced by the direct action of oxygen             on
albumen.
   Secondly, that the alkalies and alkaline salts prevent the appear
ance   of fibrin when albumen     is acted upon by oxygen.
   Thirdly,     that the formation     of fibrin from albumen is accom
panied     by    the evolution   of sulphur,    phosphorus,    and    carbonic
acid.
   Fourthly, That      a temperature ranging between     98° and   1 10°  Fahr.
promotes the artificial formation of fibrin.

1863.]                                   407
     Fifthly, that the greatest amount of fibrin appears when the albu
men is neutral or slightly acid.
     Sixthly, that the viscidity of the material employed promotes the
formation of fibrin.
     Seventhly,     that albumen,   artificially digested in gastric juice, pro
duces fibrin by its subsequent oxidation, even after dialysis.
     Eighthly,     that gluten   dissolved     in gastric juice,    and then oxi
dized at the ordinary temperature, yields fibrin.
     The formation of fibrin in the human body, and its relation to
albumen, has long been a vexed question.                I venture to put forward
 these experiments       in connexion with this important         and interesting
 inquiry.
 V. "Note on the Spectrum of Thallium."                      By Professor     Wil
          liam Allen      Miller, M.D.,LL.D.,           Treasurer and     V.P.R.S.
          Received    January 15, 1863.
      My friend Mr. Crookes, the discoverer of the new metal thallium*,
 having kindly put into my hands a small quantity of the metal, which
 he believes to be chemically pure, I have been enabled to make some
 experiments upon its spectrum, the results of which may not be with
 out interest to the members of the Royal Society.
     Thallium, as is well known, when examined in the usual way by
 the spectroscope, yields a spectrum of remarkable simplicity, furnish
  ing a single intense green line, the occurrence of which, as is familiar
  to chemists, led     Mr. Crookes to the discovery of the metal, and sug
  gested    to him the name      by which it is known.         In order to try the
  effect of a progressively increasing        temperature     upon the spectrum
  furnished by the metal and its compounds, the following experiments
  were made.
     * It  has been made the subject of question  abroad, whether Mr. Crookes or M.
   Lam y was the first to recognize   the metallic nature of thallium, and thus to
  dispute the claim of Mr. Crookes to the full credit due to him for his investigation
  (with only about twenty grains of the element) of its leading characters where no
  previous clue existed to guide him. It may be sufficient to state in answer to this
  suggestion, that Mr. Crookes had exhibited it at the International Exhibition, and
  marked as metallic his scanty store, though in the form of a precipitate, in the
  beginning of May, unquestionably before      M. Lamy had published anything re
  lating to thallium.
                                                                   2g2

                                       408                            [Jan. T5,
    Portions of metallic thallium,      as well as   of an alloy formed by
fusing a bead of thallium upon the end of a platinum wire, and por
tions of the sulphate       of the metal were introduced          successively,
first, into the flame of burning      hydrogen, and then into the oxyhy-
drogen jet, and were in each case viewed by the spectroscope.                As
the temperature increased in intensity, the brilliancy of the thallium
green line increased also, but no new lines made their appearance.
    Two pieces of stout thallium wire were then arranged as electrodes
to the secondary wire of an induction coil.         A continuous torrent of
sparks was maintained without melting the wires or producing very
rapid oxidation, or volatilization     of the metal     ;  the light, however,
was much whiter than its ordinary monochromatic                character would
have led us to expect.        Mr. Crookes, who     was    with  me  during  the
 experiments, projected the image of the points by means of a lens
 upon    a  distant   white  screen,   when it was at once obvious that
 the extremities of the spark were of a fine green colour, whilst the
flickering luminous      arc, which filled up the interval,      due chiefly to
ignited air, was much whiter.
    On viewing the sparks from the induction-coil by the spectroscope,
 several new lines, independently of well-marked air-lines, made their
 appearance.       These lines were    distinguished    from air-lines   by the
peculiar    character which distinguishes most metallic lines, viz. the
 much greater intensity of their extremities than of their central por
tions.     Besides the usual intense line in the green, five others were
particularly observable : first, a very faint one in the orange ; next,
two of nearly equal intensity in the green, more refrangible than Tla,
with   a  third much fainter, these three lines in the green being nearly
equidistant    ; whilst, 5th, in the blue was a bright well-defined line :
all these were strong at each extremity and evanescent           in the central
portions.
    The induction-spark of thallium      was then observed when produced
in  a current    of hydrogen   gas.   The air-lines disappeared, the pecu
liar lines of hydrogen      were   very manifest, particularly the line in
the red and one of the lines in the blue         ; whilst the new thallium
lines were preserved, with the exception of the feeblest, though             all
were reduced in intensity.
    Finally,  a photographic    impression of the thallium spectrum upon
collodion was obtained by the method which            I   have described in a

   IS63.]                                 499
   paper communicated        to the Royal Society in June last.          An impres
  sion extending to about division 154 of the scale then adopted was
  obtained.      This spectrum contains       several  very characteristic    groups
  of lines  ; it recalls the features of the spectra of cadmium and zinc,
  and less strongly that of lead.
     Measuring by the        scale already adopted      in my former paper, it is
  found that there      are two strong      groups    of lines at about 103 and
   106.   At   116,  121, and     126  are   three groups — the first two less
  intense than the third, which is of about the same strength as the
  earliest two.     Several feebler pairs of dots follow, and the spectrum
  terminates rather abruptly       with four nearly equidistant groups, com
  mencing respectively at       136, 141, 145, and 151.           The first of these
 groups is very strongly marked, the others are fainter, but of nearly
 equal intensity.
     The remarkable way in which           a spectrum at       low temperatures so
  simple   becomes    increased in complexity,        both in the visible and in
 the extra-visible     portions, is of high interest considered in relation
 to the physical      cause   of these phenomena        ;   and it is not without
 interest in a chemical sense, from its bearing upon the view sup
 ported    by Dumas,       that thallium belongs          to the alkaline    group.
 Potassium and sodium exhibit no new lines in the induction-spark,
 merely a diffuse light filling up the air-lines,              and lithium    but a
 single strong group at about 124.             This physical character, added
 to the more purely chemical ones          of the insolubility of the sulphide,
 the chromate, the iodide, the sparing solubility of the chloride, the
 phosphate, the oxalate, the ferrocyanide,           the occurrence     of a power
 fully basic oxide, and of        a higher   feebly acid oxide, may therefore
 assist in showing      the resemblance of thallium to silver or to lead,
 which latter metal in density, colour, softness, and external appear
ance it so closely simulates.
    It would    be easy to  point out other particulars in which the proper
ties  of thallium   are in strong contrast     with those of the alkali metals.
The chemical energy of these metals, lithium, sodium, potassium,
rubidium, and caesium, increases in the order mentioned, which is
that of their equivalents.          Thallium, with     a higher    equivalent than
any of these, shows     a greatly diminished chemical activity.          The metal
is readily reduced by zinc from its solutions.                Its oxide, instead of
being like that of all the alkalies, excessively deliquescent, is perma

nent   in air, and forms a closely adhering        coat like that which is
produced     upon the surface of zinc or lead, protecting          the metal
beneath from further change.
    In many points the chemical reactions of thallium resemble those
of silver, to which metal it is also further approximated by the cir
cumstance that the atomic heat of the metal, like that of silver, is
double that of the series     to which lead belongs.        Although there
fore in other physical properties thallium differs greatly from silver,
it  seems to be more closely allied to that metal than to any other.

 forget the magnificent collection of products displayed in the French
 court by    M. Menier of Paris.      Among      these   compounds,    equally
 remarkable for their variety and beauty, the large crystals of cyanine,
 rivalling in    splendour    and   purity Mr.       Nicholson's   acetate   of
 rosaniline,   have attracted general attention.         M. Menier, who has
 produced this new dye on a very large scale, has most liberally placed
 at my disposal some    of the finest of    these   crystals for examination,
 hoping that their more minute investigation might perhaps lead to a
 method of giving solidity to this new colour, which in brilliancy and
 purity of tint is second to none of the several blues lately derived
 from coal-tar.     The composition of cyanine and its mode of forma
 tion having hitherto remained unknown,         I  have gladly availed  myself
 of this opportunity of performing      some   experiments with this inter
 esting compound.       I  am   sorry to say that, in     a practical  point of
 view, these    experiments   have failed entirely     ; but my studies have
 led me to some observations on this substance which, as a contribu
 tion to the history   of cyanine,  deserve   to be recorded, and which        I

     The discovery of the blue compounds from chinoline and its homo
  logies dates as far back as 1856. In that year Mr. G. Williams
  engaged in a renewed examination          of the  base extracted   by Runge
  from coal-tar    and obtained by Gerhardt from the alkaloids            of the
  cinchona bark, the identity in composition of which         I had established
  in one of my earlier researches.        Among the numerous compounds
  of these  bases most carefully     examined by Mr. G. Williams on this
  occasion, were also their methylated and ethylated derivatives, one of
  which, the iodide of methyl-leucolylammonium,             I had discovered
  when studying the action of iodide of methyl upon ammonia and its
  analogues.    It was in preparing      this compound    from the chinoline
  obtained by the distillation    of cinchonine, and in separating the am
  monium-base corresponding to the iodide by means of oxide of silver,
  that Mr. Williams first observed the splendid coloration which has led
  him to the discovery of the new dye now commercially known under
  the name of cyanine.         Precisely   similar phenomena       were subse
  quently (in 1857) observed by M. von Babo, who produced them by
  treating chinoline with the sulphates of methyl and ethyl, and
  described the coloured substances thus obtained as methylirisine          and
 ethylirisine.    Mr. Williams      was inclined to attribute    the formation
 of the blue compounds, in which he recognized distinctly basic pro
 perties, to a process of oxidation ; M. von Babo represents his methyl-
 and ethylirisine,   although with very great reserve,      by the formulae
                    CnHuNaOa           and    C13H13NaO,.
     No attempt has     since been   made to establish the composition of
 these singular compounds by a more minute examination.                 In fact
 several years elapsed without any further notice being taken of them,
until the development of the aniline industry revived the memory of
these remarkable colour phenomena, which             have since attracted the
general attention of dyers and printers.           Mr. G. Williams showed
that, among the several coloured compounds produced by the action
of iodides of alcohol radicals upon chinoline bases, the one obtained
by means of iodide of amyl is particularly rich in tinctorial power ;
he has given a very interesting        account of this new dye, and accu
rately described the mode of manufacture of this body, which, under
the name of cyanine, soon became an article of commerce.
    Unfortunately the tint produced by cyanine is less fast than beau
tiful, and the hopes entertained of the industrial future of the new

compound       has not been realized       ;  nevertheless  the importance       at
tached by dyers to       Mr. Williams's discovery is well marked by the
fact   of a gold medal, together with a prize of 10,000 francs, having
been proposed for the discovery of a means of rendering stable the
beautiful colours dyed by cyanine.
    The crystals submitted      to me for examination       by   M. Menier were
distinct prisms, sufficiently well formed for crystallographical              deter
minations.      They are at present in the hands of Quintino Sella.
Their substance possesses a beautiful green metallic lustre with a
golden tint, by which, as well as by crystalline form, they are readily
distinguished from acetate of rosaniline, which they in other respects
much resemble.        The crystals      are insoluble in anhydrous ether, diffi
cultly soluble in water, but dissolve readily in alcohol.            The solution
has a magnificent blue colour, with a coppery iridescence on its sur
face.     Addition of acids destroys this colour.        Ammonia and the fixed
caustic alkalies leave the colour apparently untouched             ; but  it is now
produced by a finely divided deep-blue precipitate              suspended in the
liquid, which may      be filtered off, the filtrate     separated from it being
colourless.
    The green crystals were found to be the iodide of a peculiar basic
compound. The iodine is rather firmly held in this compound ; but it
may be precipitated from the alcoholic solution by oxide of silver, and
exchanged for bromine or chlorine by treatment of this solution with
 bromide or chloride of silver, when the bromide               or chloride    corre
 sponding to the iodide are produced.              The analysis of the crystals
 gave results   indicating unequivocally the formula
                                    C>o   Hi0 N2 1,
 which received      a close confirmation        by the examination of a fine
 platinum-salt    crystallizing   in rhombic tablets, which is obtained by
 precipitating the chloride corresponding to the iodide, strongly acidu
 lated with hydrochloric acid, by dichloride           of platinum.      Neverthe
 less  slight discrepancies between the theoretical values of the formula
 and the results obtained led me to assume the existence in the crystals
 of   a compound      containing     less   carbon and hydrogen, indeed of a
 homologous iodide,
                                    CMHMN,I.
 This hypothesis, not countenanced at first by the remarkable con
 stancy which the composition of the iodide presented even after three

1863.]                                            413
or four crystallizations,            was      fully confirmed when the chloride was
submitted      to    a    systematic          partial    precipitation      by   dichloride     of
platinum.        After several repetitions                   of the process, the partially
precipitated        platinum-salt        being decomposed by sulphuretted                 hydro
gen and the chlorides again partially precipitated, two platinum-salts
were obtained, one            of which, the        less soluble one,        proved to be the
pure platinum-salt            corresponding         to the iodide with 30 equivalents
of carbon, whilst the other                  one was sufficiently      pure to show       that it
belonged in reality to the homologous                         iodide with 2 equivalents         of
carbon less.
      The amount of the iodide
                                              CMH,3NaI,
which contaminated              (if     the term may be applied to so beautiful                   a
substance) the iodide
                                              C30 H33   N3    I,
is,   however,      so small that its presence   did not materially influence
the analytical           results obtained in the further examination of the
compound.
      The explanation of the formation of the iodide presents no diffi
culty   ;   this substance obviously derives from lepidine,
                                                C10H,N,
whilst only the slight admixture                        is   due to the presence,         in the
original    bases submitted             to the action of iodide of amyl, of              a   small
quantity of chinoline,
                          C3H7N.
In fact Mr. Williams, in describing the preparation of his dye,
distinctly states that the chinoline                    by
                                      no means requires to be pure
for the purpose.    M. Menier has moreover kindly furnished me with
a considerable quantity of the crude material from which the green
crystals are obtained. This proved to be mixture of several bases, a
in which the presence of lepidine and chinoline was traced without
the slightest difficulty,               by   the analyses of platinum-salts.
      In the genesis of the new iodide two different phases have to                             be
distinguished,        viz.,    1,   the transformation             of lepidine into iodide of
amyllepidyl-ammonium,
            C10H,N                  +          C,HnI               =       C„HMNI;
            Lepidine.                    Iodide of amyl.       Iodide of aniyl-lepidyl-amraoniuro.

                                          414                           [Jan. 22,
 2, the condensation under         the influence of potash of two molecules
 of the compound into        one molecule    of a higher order,
         2(C„H„NI)            +     KHO=C20HaN2I            + KI+H,O.
 Iodide of amyl-lepidyl-ammonium.               New iodide.
 It  became indispensable to verify        these reactions by the analysis of
 additional compounds.
    The green crystals dissolve with facility in boiling dilute hydriodic
 acid ; the colourless solution deposits on cooling yellow needles of
 remarkable beauty, the analysis of which has furnished the values of
 the formula
                         C,0H„NaI2=CaoH,3N,I,HI.
 These crystals are isomeric with iodide of amyl-lepidyl-ammoniumi
 from which, however, they are distinguished            by all their properties
 They dissolve in cold water without decomposition, but              on addition
 of alcohol they immediately         assume    a blue coloration,   the original
 monacid compound being reproduced.               The  same change takes place
 at 100°   ;  so that  in preparing the compound for analysis it was neces
 sary to dry it in vacuo.        In the facility with which the diacid com
 pounds are converted into the monacid salts, this substance resembles
 rosaniline,    which,    as I  have pointed out in a recent paper, forms
 likewise colourless acid salts of little stability.
    The green iodide dissolves with equal facility in hydrochloric and
 hydrobromic       acid, yielding perfectly colourless solutions, and giving
 rise to the formation of well- crystallized compounds, which contain, in
addition to iodine, respectively bromine and chlorine.
    On submitting the green iodide in alcoholic           solution to the action
of chloride of silver, the whole of the iodine is separated in the form
of iodide of silver, a blue solution being obtained from which the
monacid chloride crystallizes,         on slow evaporation,     in green metal-
lustrous     sharply- defined prisms      of surpassing     beauty.    This  salt
was found to contain
                                   C,0H„N CI.
Dissolved in hydrochloric acid, this salt furnished a diacid compound
which,    on evaporation       in  vacuo,  separates   in long straw-coloured
needles.      The highly deliquescent character of this substance            has

1863.]                                 415
hitherto prevented me from analysing it        ; but if   there was the slightest
doubt of this compound having the composition
                     C20H10N2C1,=C30H„N2C1,HC1,
it would be dispelled by the analysis of a fine-yellow             difficultly solu
ble platinum-salt crystallizing in small well-defined rhombic                plates,
which falls directly on addition of dichloride         of platinum to the alco
holic solution of the diacid chloride, containing a considerable amount
of hydrochloric acid, and which, by analysis, was found to                 be repre
sented by the formula
                          C,0 H10 Na Cl2, 2    Pt CI2.
The gold-salt is obtained by precipitating the solution of the acid
 chloride with trichloride of gold, when a yellow, scarcely crystalline
 precipitate is formed, which, dried in vacuo, contains
                           C„   H10 N8  Cl„ 2Au    Cla.
 I  have, moreover, prepared the monacid bromide, which forms beau
 tiful metal-lustrous    prisms easily crystallizable     ;  the diacid nitrate as
 a crystalline  network, on evaporating a solution of the base in nitric
 acid in vacuo    ;   and, lastly,  the acid sulphate, which crystallizes in
 white, well-formed rhombic tables, very soluble in water, but insoluble
 in alcohol, by which it is not decomposed like the other diacid com
 pounds.
     I  have refrained from multiplying the analytical evidences              by the
 minute     examination of these      salts, because    I   was   happy enough to
 observe a reaction which supported the interpretation               of the results
 of analysis in       an unequivocal    manner.      Remembering          the simple
 scission which     I  had formerly accomplished         by exposing the iodide
 of tetrethylammonium         to the action of heat,         when the compound
  splits into iodide of ethyl and triethyl amine, I was induced to submit
  the green iodide to distillation.       The green crystals rapidly fuse into
  a blue liquid, the surface of which presents a peculiar coppery lustre.
  On raising the temperature, decomposition takes place, and in the
  receiver is condensed a mixture of lepidine and iodide of amyl, the
  reunion   of which to iodide of amyl-lepidyl-ammonium                  may be pre
   vented by collecting     them in hydrochloric acid         ; at the same time a
  gas is evolved, burning with a brilliant flame and readily absorbed by
  bromine, and which could easily be condensed by passing it through
   a serpentine   surrounded      with ice.    I  was thus       enabled to collect

                                        416                                  [Jan. 22,
enough of the volatile        hydrocarbon       to determine       its boiling-point,
which proved it to       be pure amylene.         If  the heat be carefully regu
lated, the amount of charcoal remaining in the retort is comparatively
small.     The interpretation      of the phenomena observed is given                in
the following equation       :—
                 C30H33N2I=2C10H3N + C8H11I+C3H10
                Green iodide.        Lepidine.     Iodide of    Amylene.
                                                     amyl.
   Here,    again,   I  have had an opportunity of proving             the presence
in the crystals of     a small quantity     of the homologous chinoline com
pound ; for on submitting, after separating the iodide of amyl, the
hydrochlorate of the volatilized base to distillation with potassa,
and collecting apart the first quantity of the basic liquid which came
over with the vapour of water, this substance proved by the plati
num determination         to be chiefly chinoline,      while the portion of the
base  distilling last proved by the         same mode       of analysis to be pure
lepidine.
   The results obtained in       these experiments       furnish new illustrations
of the tendency to molecular accumulation by which the ammonias
and their derivatives are distinguished.                Only a few weeks ago          I
had the honour of submitting to the Royal Society a short ac
count of this class, which is obtained as a secondary product in the
manufacture      of aniline.   The coloured derivatives of the          bases   of the
chinoline    series  present in their composition            considerable     analogy

   I have written      the formulae of the coloured           compounds so as to
bring out their analogy with the paraniline                salts — in fact, so as to

1863.]                                  417
characterize    them as para-compounds of the amyl-lepidyl-ammonium
salts, but   I   am far from attributing to these           formulae any other
value.     In    fact   the molecular     construction    of this new   class  of
compounds      remains to be established by further experiments.
    The theory which (in 1852) satisfactorily represented the consti
tution of the nitrogen       bases then examined, requires an expansion to
include the tinctorial      ammonias added to our knowledge during            the
last decade.        The time for the enunciation of this amplified theory
has not yet arrived.
    Here only      a few experiments     may still be mentioned, which were
made with the oxide corresponding with the salts described.
    The action of oxide of silver upon the iodide dissolved in alcohol
liberates the base, which, on evaporation of the alcohol, separates as
an  indistinctly crystalline deep-blue mass, moderately soluble in water,
less soluble in anhydrous ether, easily soluble in alcohol.                Ether
 precipitates     the base from its alcoholic       solution  ;  I have not exa
mined it.
    Submitted to distillation, the free oxide gives rise to an oily base,
 which I naturally expected to be lepidine ; but the experiments which
 I  have hitherto made with this substance appear to negative this
 assumption.         I have undertaken a more minute examination of the
 compound,     because,    if it be different, its study    will probably throw
 some light upon the still uncertain constitution of the tertiary bases
 of the chinoline series, which I have frequently attempted to decipher.
 It  remained      now only for me      to examine the mode of formation
 of the remarkable compound the nature of which I have endeavoured
 to clear up.       With this view I have studied the action of iodide of
 methyl and amyl upon chinoline              and lepidine, large quantities of
 which were kindly placed at my disposal by my friend Mr. David
 Howard. The products obtained in this reaction I have not sub
 mitted to a minute       examination, having     satisfied myself that their
 principal phases are well illustrated by the equations which I have
 given for the formation of the substances produced by the action of
 iodide of amyl upon lepidine.         Nor have   I  followed out in detail the
 complicated      secondary changes, and more especially the generation
 of the red colouring matter which is abundantly                 formed in these
 reactions.     I   have nothing to add to the perfect description of these
 phenomena by the distinguished          discoverer of this pigment.

Menier      :   without the magnificent crystals furnished by his ateliers,                 I
could not have even attempted to clear up this question.

ledges without blushing that there are territories on which she cannot
advance without leaning on the strong arm                   of her powerful companion.
Joint labours of this kind cannot fail to seal the pledge of alliance
between        industry and science.

          tion, and new Alcohols                derived therefrom."             By Peter

          December 18, 1862.
      In the beginning of this year (1862)                  I  pointed out* that diazo-
 amidobenzol, when submitted to the action of nitric acid containing
 nitrous acid in solution, is transformed into a new compound accord
 ing to the equation

  I  have now found that this remarkable compound, the nitrate of dia-
 zobenzol, can be much more easily produced by the action of nitrous
 acid upon nitrate of aniline,

  This process has furnished              me a considerable number         of similarly con-
 constituted          nitrogen-substituted        derivatives,      not  only of monacid
  monamines, but also of diamines                 ;   and it is to some of the bodies
 generated by means of the latter that                    I   beg  leave to call the atten
  tion of the Royal Society.
       If a current      of nitrous acid       be passed into a cold solution          of the
  nitrate of benzidine, a base              which, by the researches of P. W. Hof
  mann, has been characterized as a well-defined diacid diamine, a new
  compound          is produced,        crystallizing from water in white            needles,

it as a compound          standing,      like phenol, upon the boundary line

     Jacobi in       a   posthumous         memoir*, which has only this year ap
peared, has developed two remarkable                            methods (agreeing in                their
general character, but differing in details) of solving non-linear partial
differential equations of the first order, and has applied them in con
nexion with that theory of the differential                            equations of dynamics
which        was established by          Sir W. R. Hamilton in the
                                                     Philosophical

Transactions' for 1834-35.  The  knowledge, indeed, that the solu

covery of        a   single central function, defined by                a       single partial differ
ential equation of the first order, does not appear to have been
hitherto (perhaps   will never be) very fruitful in practical results.

But in the order of those speculative truths which enable us to per
ceive       unity where    it   was unperceived before, its place                     isa    high   and
enduring one.
     Given      a    system of dynamical equations,                it   is       possible, as Jacobi
had shown, to construct            a     partial differential equation such that from
any complete primitive of that equation, i.                       e.   from any solution of           it
involving        a   number of constants equal to the number of the inde
pendent variables, all the integrals of the dynamical equation can be
deduced          by processes      of differentiation.                Hitherto, however,             the
discovery of the complete primitive of                      a   partial differential equation
has been supposed to require                   a   previous knowledge of the integrals
of   a     certain auxiliary system of ordinary differential equations                         ;    and

in the      case under consideration           that auxiliary system consisted of the
dynamical              equations    themselves.        Jacobi's    new     methods        do   not
require the preliminary integration of the auxiliary system.                           They re
quire, instead of this, the solution of certain systems of simultaneous
linear       partial     differential   equations.       To this object, therefore, the
method developed in my recent paper on                         " Simultaneous       Differential
                   "
Equations  (Philosophical Transactions for 1862) might be applied.
But the systems of equations in question are of a peculiar form.
They admit, in consequence of this, of a peculiar analysis. And
Jacobi's methods of solving them are in fact different from mine,
though connected with it by remarkable relations.     He does indeed
refer to the general problem of the solution of simultaneous partial
differential equations, and this in language which does not even sup
pose the condition of linearity.                  He   says,
                                                                " Non    ego hie immorabor

discuss any systems of equations more general than                              those which
arise in the immediate problem before him.
      It   is only very lately that       I   have come to understand the nature of
the relation            between the general method               of solving simultaneous
partial differential equations, published in my recent memoir, and the
particular methods of Jacobi.       But in arriving at this knowledge I
have been led to perceive how, by a combination of my own method
with       one   of those of Jacobi, the problem may               be solved   in     a new and
perhaps          better, certainly      a remarkable        way.    This new way forms
the subject of the present paper*.                     Before proceeding to explain            it,
it   will   be necessary      Jacobi's methods, to refer to my own
                               to describe
already published, and to point out the nature of the connexion
between them.
     The system of linear partial differential equations being given, and
it   being required to find     simultaneous solution of them, Jacobi,
                                        a
according to his first method, transforms these equations                         by  a   change
of variables       ;    he directs that an integral of the first equation be found              ;

Association in Cambridge in October of the present year (1862).

he shows that, in virtue   of the form of the equations and the relation
which connects the first and second of them, other integrals of the
first equation may be derived by mere processes                  of differentiation
from the integral already found      ;  and he shows how, by means of such
integrals of the first equation, a common             integral    of the first and
second equations of the system may be found.                  This common inte
gral is a function of the known integral            and certain variables, and
its form is obtained by the solution of a differential equation between
two variables — a differential equation which is in general non-linear,
and of an order equal to the total number of integrals previously found.
    An integral of the first two equations of the given system having
been obtained,    Jacobi shows that by         a second process      of derivation,
followed    by the solution of a second differential            equation, an inte
gral which will satisfy simultaneously          the first three equations of the
system may be found      ;  and thus he proceeds by alternate processes
of derivation and integration      till  an integral      satisfying all the equa
tions of the given system together is obtained.             In  these alternations,
it is the function of the   processes      of derivation    to give new integrals
of the equations already satisfied       ;  it is the function of the      processes
of integration to determine the functional forms by which the remain
ing equations may in their turn be satisfied.
    Jacobi's second method        does     not require a preliminary           trans
formation of the equations     ;  but the process of derivation, by which
 from an integral of the first equation other integrals             are derived by
 virtue of the relation    connecting the first and second equations, is
 carried further than in his first method.               It  is indeed carried on
 until no new integrals arise. The difference of result is, that the
 common integral of the first and second partial differential equations
 is determined as a function solely of the integrals known, and not as a
 mixed function of integrals and variables.          But its form    is determined,
 as before,  by the solution   of  a differential equation.          All the subse
 quent processes of derivation and integration            are  of a similar nature.
     On the other hand, the method of my former paper applied to the
 same problem leads, by a certain process of derivation, to a system of
 ordinary   differential equations equal in number to the number                   of
 possible integrals, and, without being individually exact, susceptible
 of combination into exact differential equations. The integration of
 these would give all the common integrals of the given system.

1863.]                                          423
  All    these methods possess, with reference to the requirements of
the actual case, a superfluous generality.                         A single common integral
of the system is all that is required.
   Now the chief result to be established in this paper is the following.
   If, with Jacobi, according to his second method, we suppose one
integral of the untransformed                  first partial differential equation to be
found,   if   by means of this we construct according to a certain type a
new partial         differential   equation,      if   to the system thus increased we
apply the process of my former paper, continually deriving new par
tial differential equations until, no more arising, the system is com
plete, then, under          a certain      condition            hereafter       to be explained,               a
common integral       of all the equations of the complete system, and
therefore      of the original system which is contained in     may be                            it,
found by the integration of           a    single differential              equation susceptible
of being      made integrable by means                 of   a   factor.
  But    if   the condition referred to           is   not satisfied,       a   new integral of the
first partial differential equation must be found and the process re
peated, with the certainty that sooner or later                           it   will succeed.
  As soon, then,          as the condition          is      satisfied,    a     solution not, as              by
Jacobi's methods, first of two of the partial differential equations of
the given system, then of three, and so on, but of all at once,     ob                                  is
tained   ;   and this solution       is   obtained, not as in my former process,
by the solution of        a   system of equations reducible to the exact differ
ential   form, but by that of         a    single differential equation reducible to
that form.
  The condition in question               is   grounded on the theoretical connexion
which exists between the process of derivation                             of partial differential
equations involved in my former method, and the process of deriva
tion of integrals involved in Jacobi's methods.       In the actual pro
blem, and in virtue of the peculiar form of the partial differential equa
tion given, these two processes                are coordinate.              If each           be carried to
its utmost extent, then to          each new partial differential equation arising
from the one will correspond              a     new integral (of the first partial                           dif
ferential equation)         arising from the other.                   The theory now to                       be
developed      is   founded upon the inquiry whether                      it   is   possible to satisfy
the completed system of partial differential equations                                   by   a   function of
the completed system of the Jacobian integrals,                                i.   e.   to determine          a
common integral of the completed series of equations as a function of

the completed series of integrals of the first equation.           The reader
is reminded that by the completed series of integrals is meant, not all
the integrals of the first partial    differential   equations that exist, but
all that arise from a certain root integral by a certain process of deriva
tion, together with the root integral itself.         Now the answer here to
be established to this    inquiry is the following.       The first of the par
tial differential equations necessarily will, and others may, be satisfied
by the proposed function irrespectively        of its form.     If the number
of equations of the completed system which is not thus satisfied is
odd (this is the condition in question), the form of the function which
will satisfy all is determinable by the solution of a single differential
equation of the first order, capable of being made integrable by means
 of  a factor.
    Although the direct subject of this paper is the solution of partial
 differential equations of the first order, I wish it rather to be received as
 a  slight contribution  to that theory   of the dynamical equations which
 was first published in the Philosophical Transactions, and which sug,
 gested to Jacobi the line of investigation which I here only seek to
 pursue a little further.

 " On    the Absorption     of Gases by Charcoal. — No.        I."   By Dr. R.
        Angus Smith, F.R.S.           Received     December 27, 1862.
                                  (Abstract.)
     The following   is a summary    of the author's observations     : —
     1.  Charcoal absorbs oxygen to as to separate it from common air,
 or from its mixtures with hydrogen and nitrogen, at common tempe
 ratures.
     2.  Charcoal continues the absorption     of oxygen for  at least a month,
 although the chief amount is absorbed in a few hours, sometimes in
 a few seconds, according to the quality of the charcoal.

 1863.]                                425
    3.  It does not absorb hydrogen,        nitrogen, or carbonic acid for the
same period.
    4. Although the amount absorbed is somewhat in the relation of
the condensibility       of the gases by pressure,    this is not the only qua
lity regulating the absorption, of oxygen         at least.
    5.  When it is sought         to remove the oxygen        from charcoal      by
warmth, carbonic acid is formed,         even at the temperature        of boiling
water, and slowly even at lower temperatures.
    6. Charcoals differ extremely in absorbing power, and in the capa
city of uniting with oxygen, animal charcoal possessing the latter
property in     a greater degree than wood-charcoal.
    7.   Nitrogen and hydrogen, when absorbed by charcoal, diffuse
into the atmosphere of another gas with such force as to depress the
mercury three-quarters of an inch.
    8. Water expels mercury from the pores of charcoal by an instan
taneous action.
    9. The action of porous bodies is not indiscriminate            but elective.
                           Theoretical Considerations.
    1.  The elective nature of porous bodies may             be closely allied to
 three properties     :—
       a. The condensibility of the gases.
       b. The attraction and perhaps inclination to combine.
       c.  The capacity of combination.
    2.  In   either case the attraction which results in condensation of
 the gas is exercised at distances greater than the distances of atoms
 or molecules in combination.
    3. The gases in porous bodies lie in strata, the outside and more
 distant being less attracted than the atoms nearer the solid body.
    4. We cannot separate          chemical   from physical      attraction ;   but
 attraction may exist without its ultimate result         (combination),    which
 is distinctly chemical.
    5.  It  is exceedingly      probable that as physical       attraction  moves
 onwards to chemical combination,         it produces the phenomena which
 have been attributed to so-called masses.
    Chemical      affinity  is supposed to involve an attraction          which   is
 purely chemical       ; we have   no proof of any such attraction as a sepa
 rate power, we         have only a proof of the combination.           Attraction

may exist without the capacity of combining chemically, or, in other
words, without chemical affinity.            Chemical     affinity  (a very inap
propriate term) is only known by combination ;               the previous attrac
tion has never yet been shown to be of two kinds              ; and it seems more
in accordance with Nature          to diminish    than to increase the number

                                     (Abstract.)
    After briefly abstracting Dr. W. Busch's description of the early
 stages in the growth of the young of Comatula, the author details
 his own observations, carried on during the last four years, on the
 development and subsequent changes of the larva.                  After complete
 segmentation of the yelk, a more consistent nucleus appears within
 the mulberry        mass   still contained within the vitelline membrane.
 The external more transparent flocculent portion of the yelk liquefies
 and is absorbed into this nucleus, which gradually assumes the form
 of the embryo larva, a granular cylinder contracted at either end and
 girded with four transverse bands of cilia.             This cylinder increases
 in size    till it nearly fills the vitelline     sac, gradually     increasing in
 transparency, and ultimately         consisting of delicately vacuolated sar-
 code,    the external     surface transparent     and studded with pyriform
 oil-cells, the inner portion semifluid and slightly granular.
     The vitelline membrane now gives way, and, usually shortly after
 the escape of the larva into the water, the third ciliated band from the
 anterior extremity arches forwards at one point          ;  and in the space thus
 left between     it and the fourth band,     a large   pyriform depression indi

1863.]                                     427
cates the position     of the larval mouth.           At the       same   time a small
round aperture, merely separated from the posterior margin of the
mouth by the last ciliated band, becomes               connected with the mouth
by a short loop-like canal passing under the band, and fulfils the
function of    an excreting-orifice.         A tuft of      long cilia, which have a
peculiar undulatory motion, is developed at the posterior extremity of
the body.   The larva now increases rapidly in size, assuming some
what the form of a kidney bean, the mouth answering in position to
the hilum.     It   swims freely in the water, with a swinging semirota-
tory motion, by     means      of its ciliated bands and posterior tuft of cilia.
  Shortly after the larva has attained its definite independent form,
ten minute     calcareous spicula          make     their    appearance, imbedded
within the external sarcode-layer of the expanded anterior portion of
the larva.  The ten spicula are arranged in two transverse rings of
five, the spicula of the anterior row symmetrically superposed on those
of the posterior.      By the extension of calcareous network,                these spi
cula rapidly expand into ten plates, which at length                      form a trellis
enclosing a dodecahedral          space,    open above       and below, within the
anterior portion of the zooid.             Simultaneously      with the appearance
of these plates,    a series    of from    seven to ten calcareous rings form a
chain passing from the base of the posterior row of plates backwards,
curving slightly to the left of the larval mouth, and ending by abut
ting against the centre of a large cribriform plate, which is rapidly
developed close to the posterior             extremity      of the larva.      Delicate
sheaves  of anastomosing calcareous trabeculoe shortly arise within
these rings, and the series declares itself as the jointed stem of the
pentacrinoid    stage, the basal and first interradial             plates of the calyx
being represented by the already formed casket of calcareous network.
The skeleton of the Crinoid is thus completely mapped out within
the body of the larva, while the latter still retains its independent
form and special organs.
   Within the plates of the calyx of the nascent Crinoid two hemi
spherical or reniform masses may now be detected, — one superior, of a
yellowish,    subsequently       of   a chocolate    colour    ;   the other inferior,
colourless and transparent.             The lower      hemisphere         indicates     the
permanent alimentary canal of the Crinoid, with its glandular follicle                       ;
the upper mass originates the central ring               of the ambnlacral system,
with its caeca passing to the arms.              The body of the Crinoid         is,   how

   ever, at this stage       entirely closed in by a dome of sarcode, forming
   the anterior extremity of the larva.              After swimming about freely for
   a time, averaging from eight hours to a week, and increasing                   rapidly in
   size till it has attained    a lengh  of from    1 to 2 millims., the larva becomes
   sluggish,      and its form is distorted         by the growing Crinoid.             The
  mouth and alimentary canal of the larva disappear, and the external
  sarcode-layer subsides round the calcareous framework of the included
  embryo, forming for it a transparent perisom               .   The   stem now lengthens
  by additions of trabeculae         to the ends of the joints.              The posterior
  extremity dilates into a disk of attachment.                    The anterior extremity
  becomes      expanded, then slightly cupped           ;   the lip of the cup is divided
  into five crescentic lobes corresponding                 to the plates of the upper
  ring; and finally five delicate tubes,                 caeca     from    the ambulacral
  circular     canal, are protruded       from the centre of the cup, the rudi
  ments of the arms of the Pentacrinoid.                   At    some    stage  during  the
  progress of these later changes the embryo adheres, and at length
  becomes      firmly cemented to      some permanent point             of attachment.
      The author       states   his views as to the morphological              and physio
 logical relations of the larval zooid.             He    believes    that all the peculiar
 independently organized zooids developed from the whole or from a
 part of the segmented          yelk in the Echinoderms,             and which form no
 stage in the development           of the perfect form of the species, must
 be regarded as        assimilative extensions of sarcode, analogous in func
 tion to the embryonic          absorbent appendages in the higher                animals.
 For such       an organism      the term     " pseudembryo "           is proposed.     In
 the Echinoderm          subkingdom,     although      constructed apparently upon
 a common plan,           these  pseudembryos         present considerable range         of
 organization, from a somewhat complex zooid provided with elaborate
 natatory fringes, with a system of vessels which are ultimately con
 nected with the ambulacral vascular system of the embryo, with a
 well-developed        digestive tract, and in some instances with special
 nervous ganglia, to a simple layer of absorbent and irritable sarcode
 which invests the nascent embryo.                 The pseudembryo of Comatula
holds an intermediate position.             It  resembles very closely in external
form and in subsequent metamorphosis                      the    "pupa stage" of the
Holothuridae,       the great distinction        between       them being that in the
Holothuridae        the pupa has already passed             through      the more active
"Auricularian
                     "           while the analogous form in Comatula
                        stage,                                                         has
been developed directly from the egg.

    Glyoxylic acid contains      one atom    of oxygen    less than oxalic acid,
and may be considered as glycolic          acid minus two atoms of hydro

oil of bitter almonds does to benzoic acid and benzylic alcohol.              On

common with hydride          of benzoyl.     Dilute nitric acid, for instance,
oxidizes glyoxylic acid to oxalic acid, and hydrate of potash converts
it into glycolic acid and oxalic acid.            The   same    reagents produce
with oil of bitter almonds benzoic acid, benzoate of potash, and
benzylic alcohol.

glyoxylic acid     are described  which still more intimately connect this
body with the class of the aldehydes, so as to leave no doubt as to
its position in the system of organic substances.
     Glyoxylates    and sulphites   have a strong      tendency to combine.
Glyoxylic acid expels one-half only of the sulphurous acid from a
given quantity of sulphite of soda, and forms the substance repre
 sented    by the formula     Na  H S 03 + C2 H Na 03 ; an excess of sul
 phurous     acid,   on the other   hand, expels one-half of the acid in
 glyoxylate of lime, producing       CaHS03 + CaH CaOs.           These salts
 crystallize well and are very stable.
      Sulphuretted    hydrogen   and glyoxylate of lime exchange sulphur
 and oxygen, water and a new compound,

 being the result.       The sulphur acid in the latter salt seems to bear
  to glyoxylic acid a relation similar to that in which triacetic acid
  stands to acetic acid.      Glyoxylic acid itself is decomposed by sul
 phuretted hydrogen, a new crystallizable acid being produced.
      Ammonia forms definite compounds with glyoxylates.          The follow
  ing of them were investigated:     —  two bodies formed from NH3 and
  glyoxylate    of lime,

   stable, but the products of their decomposition could not be obtained
   in a pure state.

       This transformation   was brought about by dissolving zinc     in dilute
   glyoxylic acid.
       Glycolic acid, glyoxylic acid, and oxalic acid therefore        possess,
    as regards composition    and some other essential properties, the same
    connexion as ethylic alcohol, acetic aldehyde, and acetic acid.        The
    differences between the two series arise from the greater number of
    oxygen-atoms in the molecules of the first three bodies.

II. "On       the Telescopic Appearance of the Planet Mars."                  By
       John Phillips, M.A., LL.D., F.R.S, F.G.S., Professor of
       Geology in the University of Oxford.               Received February
       5, 1863.
    Notwithstanding the descriptions and drawings of Mars, for which
we are indebted to eminent observers*,           there remains much uncer
tainty as to the permanent boundaries of the bright and shady parts
of the planet, to which respectively, on a first view, we attach, per
haps too readily, the idea of land and seas.           The extremely variable
aspects under which this planet appears in its excentric orbit, the axis
being inclined more than 30° to the ecliptic, the different regions very
unequally presented to incident light, and very unequally influenced
by vicissitudes of heat and cold, may account for much of the uncer
tainty.     Other difficulties    arise when the work of different instru
ments is compared       ;  for it is established that reflectors will on the
whole     give the best results       for colour, while achromatics of fine
quality discover more of detail than instruments               of  less   perfect
 definition.
    The author having devoted        some evenings between the 27th       of Sep
tember and 13th of December 1862 to the examination of Mars with
 a 6-inch    achromatic by Cooke, equatorially mounted, and moved by
 clockwork,    at  Oxford, presented to the Society some results of these
observations combined with others, also made with achromatics, by
 Mr. Grove, Mr. Main, and Mr. Lockyer.
    These various     observations, made entirely without concert, were
rendered comparable by a calculated reduction of each to the longi
tude on Mars corresponding          to the epoch of each, according to one
standard.       [Tables    of these reductions    were   given in the paper.]
The sketches were then arranged           on sheets  in the order of the    com
 puted longitudes     ;   and, in addition,   two globes were exhibited,       on
one   of which the main results of the author's observations were
drawn,     the data for the other being supplied           by Mr.     Lockyer's
 sketches.
    He was also aided in the explanations by large drawings                 made
with reflectors by Mr. De la Rue and Mr. Nasmyth.

   From the author's sketches, three, representing opposite hemi
spheres, and one intermediate           quadrature,     have been selected        for
engraving,   — one   central to the assumed meridian of 0° or 360°, the
others to the meridians of 90° and 180° nearly.               See figs. 1, 2,    3.

   On considering       the surface of the planet, either as seen in the
telescope, or delineated on paper, we feel in some doubt as to the
meaning of what we see.          Are the bright parts (often seen of a red
tint) land, the darker parts (often appearing of a greenish grey)
water? or, as in the moon, are the reflecting powers of different
parts of a dry surface very unequal?                Is there any considerable
change in the aspect of the masses or boundaries between one epoch
and another, so as to indicate atmospheric               vicissitudes   like those
on   Jupiter and our own planet       ?
    Taking the latter question first, the author found, on the experience
of his observations during 74 days, that no material change took
place in the main and prominent features about the longitude which
he marks 0°.       Not that after this considerable interval the appear
ances remained exactly as at first         : that was not, and could not be

expected to be the case, after the planet had increased his distance
from the earth to nearly double that when the observations began.
Adding to his own the experience of Mr. Lockyer, whose observa
tions began 35 days earlier, this inference, of permanence in the
main boundaries of lights and shades,                         is extended to above        100
revolutions of Mars            ;    and on comparison           of these with the earlier
sketches of Madler, Herschel,                      Jacobs,    and De la Rue,          the con
clusion appears to embrace the whole series                         of more than thirty
years.
  The author              regards      as one      of the main features very firmly
defined in the late opposition,                    the broad white or rather reddish
band which from about 65° of north latitude (the north pole being
invisible in these observations) spreads up into large bright cloud
like prominences toward and beyond the equator, and retires into
one principal and several smaller bays toward the pole. From this
bright space, which in many parts is sharply defined, a broad dusky
tint spreads toward the south, partially relieved by half-lighted
expansions with shades of various depths between.                            The south pole
itself is surrounded               (excentrically    as    it appears) by a bright white
mass,        obviously glittering in the telescope.                This is believed to         be
snow     ;   and the effect of its whiteness is increased in most parts of its
circumference             by the contrast of a dark ring round                 it,   which ex
pands here and there into broader spaces.                        Thus   a   great part of the
northern           area   appeared in the late opposition               bright,      and often
reddish, as        if it   were land, while         a   great part of the southern area
was   of the grey hue which         considered to indicate water, but
                                              is
relieved by various tracts of a tint more or less approaching to that
of the brighter spaces of the northern hemisphere. The principal
boundary of light and shade, for the most part very well defined,
ran obliquely across the equator of Mars, so as to reach latitudes
from 20° to 30° north and south of that line.                           This may perhaps
be understood by the drawings selected for illustration,                          especially   if

  Allowing the white          spaces to be land,       which reflects light     as the
moon in opposition,          it   seems a natural supposition       that the shady
spaces    should     be called sea     ;   and this may be supported            by the
obvious    requirement of water somewhere on Mars, to agree with the
alternate gathering and melting of the snow round the poles.                      Still,
every observer remarks no small resemblance of some of these shady
tracts with particular parts of the unequally tinted grey surfaces of
the moon.       A    positive proof of ocean on the disk of Mars would be
afforded by the star-like          image of the sun reflected from the quiet
surface*, or the more diffused light thrown back from the waves;
but nothing of this sort has been placed on record, nor is there such
a variation   in the appearance of these          spaces from the centre toward
the edges as to give any special reason for thinking them occupied
by water.
  Atmospheric vicissitudes, however, appear to be recognized in the
somewhat variable aspect of many portions of the grey spaces ; for
these, though        not much changed in the situation of the masses of
light or shade, are sufficiently inconstant in their shapes and details
to suggest the idea of a vaporous envelope, brooding over and
about some parts more than others, and variable from one epoch to
another.   The drawings of Mr. Lockyer supply the best evidence of
these variations ; for Professor Phillips, except on a few occasions,
confined his attention chiefly to the stronger and apparently more
settled boundaries       of light and shade.
  The tints on the body of Mars were observed by each of the
gentlemen named, but with different results. To Mr. Nasmyth,
                                       '
with     a large reflector, the ' land   appeared         of   a decidedly red tint,
the 'water'        green.    The 'land' appeared red in            some      parts, but
  * The quiet   image here alluded to would not exceed      ^th of   a second   of   angle
at the opposition,   if no
                         allowance be made for irradiation.    But much allowance
must be made for this. A thermometer-bulb, with diameter half an inch, reflects
the sun as a star visible by the eye at 25 yards' distance, the reflecting surface in
this case being about j^th of an inch in diameter, and therefore (if no irradia
tion were allowed for) the angle subtended at the eye would be only about 1".
By employing on Mars a power of 300, the fa" becomes relatively magnified
to 15".

   Mr. Nasmyth      saw the snow-patch on the south pole so             distinctly
bordered,    as  to give him         the   impression  of its having a cliff-
boundary.      The south snow-patch did not appear to him to agree
with the south pole of the planet, but, on the contrary, to be con
siderably excentric to it        ; and he supposed this to be due to the
relative distribution of land and water, influencing             the position   of
the centre of greatest cold.           Only a faint glimmering of the snowy
surfaces round the north pole was seen by any observer.
   On the whole, the author of this paper concluded that, over a per
manent basis of bright and dusky tracts on the surface of Mars, a
variable envelope       gathers and fluctuates,       partially modifying      the
aspect of the fundamental features, and even in some cases disguising
them under new lights and shades, which present no constancy, — a
thin vaporous atmosphere probably              resting on a surface of land,
snow, and water.
                                     Addendum.
   Since the reading of the paper the author has been enabled, by the
kindness of the Earl of Rosse, to examine a series                of sketches of
Mars during the late opposition, from the great              telescopes   at Birr.
These drawings, six in number, were made on                 July   22, Sept. 14,
Sept. 16, Oct. 6, Oct. 29, and Nov. 6.             They confirm in     a remark
able   manner the conclusions already presented by the author,                and
suggest some interesting questions for further observation and study.
On the 22nd of      July    the southern snow was a large patch, meeting
the limb by its diametral line.           It must then have had a radius of
 500 miles at least   :  in the later observations it was reduced to less
than   half this measure.
   One of the drawings            nearly  corresponds  to longitude      180° on
the   author's   scale,   and represents      the specially   dark short     band
which distinguishes that aspect of the planet (fig. 3).              Two corre
spond nearly to fig.     1,  and contain the remarkable deep angular bay
which extends     so far towards       the north pole.    In  these and the re

maining three drawings, general resemblances and special differences
appear on comparison with the sketches of Prof. Phillips and Mr.
Lockyer.     The differences affect principally the grey southern parts,
and are remarkable enough to justify serious doubts whether any of
our drawings of those parts     are much to be trusted as representing
permanent physical boundaries.        Nor should this    be   thought sur
prising  ; owing to the high inclination of the axis of Mars to the plane
of his orbit, the regions round    each pole are presented alternately to
the sun through periods somewhat less than our whole year.             The
effect is seen in the vast outspread of snows round the cold pole, and
the contraction    of those white    sheets to a small   glittering ellipse
round the warm pole.      The enormous transfer of moisture from        one
hemisphere to the other while the snows are melting round one pole
and growing round the other must generate over a great part of the
planet heavy storms and great breadths of fluctuating clouds, which
would not,    as on the quickly rotating mass of Jupiter, gather into
equatorial bands, but be more under the influence of prominent land
and irregular tracts of ocean.

"  On    Thallium."         By William Crookes, Esq. Communi
       cated by Professor Stokes, Sec. R.S.                  Received February
        5, 1863.
                                   (Abstract.)
    After discussing the occurrence and distribution            of the new metal
in different parts\of the globe, the author proceeds to describe the
method     adopted by him for extracting               it from its ore.       Thalli-
ferous pyrites is distilled at a bright red heat, in quantities of about
 1 cwt. at a time, in cast-iron retorts.          The resulting sulphur,        vary
ing from 13 to        17 per cent. of the pyrites        taken, is then dissolved
in aqueous caustic        soda, which     leaves   the sulphide     of thallium    as
an insoluble black precipitate       ;   this is filtered off, dissolved in acids,
and the thallium precipitated           in the form of iodide.         This is then
 converted into sulphate, and the metal reduced from the solution by
electrolysis.      It  is obtained in the coherent form by fusion under
cyanide of potassium.
    The physical characteristics of thallium are then described.                   In
 appearance    it   most   resembles tin and cadmium, but has a distinct
 colour of its own ; it has a brilliant metallic lustre, and is susceptible
 of taking a very high polish ; it oxidizes in the air with almost the
 rapidity of an alkaline metal, but when coated with oxide, the metal
 may be freely handled          and exposed to the air with scarcely any
 further change.         An oxidized surface applied to the tongue is very
 biting and caustic, and has          a sweetish       metallic  taste.    It  is the
 softest known metal admitting            of free exposure to the atmosphere,
 being scratched by soft lead with             the greatest ease.       It  makes a
 dark blue mark         upon paper, rapidly turning yellow, which              in the
 course of a few hours         nearly fades out, but can be restored with
 sulphide   of ammonium.          It   has little    tenacity, is very malleable,
 and may be readily pressed into wire.
    The specific gravity of thallium varies from 11-81 to 1191, and
 it is probably capable of still greater condensation.
    When freshly prepared, thallium wire is perfectly amorphous,
 but when kept in water it gradually assumes a superficial crystalline
 appearance   :   this effect is immediately produced when thallium                 in
 wire, ingot, or plate, tarnished or clean, is boiled in water.
     Its melting-point      is 550°  F., being between bismuth and lead,

1863.]                                     439
and the metal does not become pasty before undergoing                       complete
fusion.        Two pieces of clean metal weld together by pressure in the
cold.        It begins to volatilize at a red heat, and boils below a white
heat   ;   it may     be distilled   in a current of hydrogen.
    It   is a pretty good conductor          of heat and electricity, and stands
electro-chemically          very near cadmium.          It  is strongly diamaguetic,
ranking in this respect near bismuth.                  The alloys which thallium
forms with different metals are next described.
    Further details         are   given respecting     the spectrum     of thallium   :
the characteristic         green line is perfectly       single under a very high
magnifying         power     and    after refraction     through    nine heavy glass
prisms      ;  and no new lines make their appearance at the temperature
of the oxy hydrogen             blowpipe, — although,       with the electric spark,
Dr. Miller has shown that several new lines come into existence.
    The delicacy of the optical test for thallium is roughly estimated,
the      0 -a 0^000*°
                         of a grain being easily perceptible.
    The atomic weight of thallium is given as 203, being the mean of
five experiments.            The author states, however, that this is not to
be regarded as a final result.
    The chemical properties of thallium               are next described.     It does
not decompose water even at the boiling-point,                   but remains bright
under        this liquid. The superficial tarnish is a powerful base so
luble in water, and reacting like an alkaline solution.                    Melted in
the air, thallium forms a readily               fusible     oxide, its behaviour    re
sembling that of lead.
    The formation of thallic acid and the properties of                  some  of the
thallates are described.             Sulphate,  nitrate, the chlorides,     sulphide,
 iodide,      and other salts of thallium are described in detail.                The
 metal may be quantitatively              determined by precipitation,      either as
 protochloride,        iodide, or platinochloride.
    The position of thallium amongst elementary bodies is then dis
 cussed.        Although one or two of its properties show a resemblance
 to the alkaline          metals, the author does not agree with continental
 chemists       in classing it with this group, — numerous facts proving
 that its true position is by the side of mercury, lead, or silver. The
 ready dehydration of its basic oxide; the insolubility of its sulphide,
iodide, chloride, bromide,             chromate, phosphate, sulphocyanide,         and
 ferrocyanide       ;  its great atomic weight      ;  its ready reduction by zinc

  to the metallic state ; its power of forming a strongly acid oxide ;
  and, according   to Dr. Miller, the complexity   of its photographic
  spectrum, — all prove that thallium cannot consistently     be classed
 anywhere but amongst the heavy metals, mercury, silver, lead, &c.
 No weight is attached to M. Dumas's argument in favour of thallium
 being related to potassium and sodium because its equivalent is
 rather near a figure obtained by adding      twice the atomic weight
 of  one metal to four times the atomic weight     of the other.    The
 author shows that, by similar processes of addition, multiplication,
 or subtraction, it is not difficult to prove that thallium is related
 to any desired group of elements.
    The author gives full analytical notes on thallium, showing where
 it would occur in the ordinary course of analysis, and detailing
 accurate methods of separating it from every metal with which it
 can be accompanied.

    With  a view to extend our knowledge    of the physiological effects
of temperature, with especial regard to the influence of tropical
heat on the healthy system, Dr. Becher, with the liberal assistance
of the Director-General,    Army Medical Department, took advantage
of a voyage to China (round the Cape of Good Hope) in 1857, and
a short residence at Hong Kong, in order to determine on himself
the influence of the extreme variations of temperature incidental to
that voyage, on the quantity of urine, urea, and chloride of sodium
excreted during each twenty-four    hours.

    During   a period  of  163 days (100 days at sea, 63 days at     Hong
Kong during the change of monsoon), Dr. Becher collected the
daily quantity of urine, and determined the amount of urea and
NaCl by the volumetric method (solutions of nitrate of mercury),
and registered meteorological      observations as accurately as circum
stances would permit, observing      all the time as constant a mode of
living (with regard    to food, exercise, &c.)  as was practicable without
undue restriction.
    The whole of the observations, divided into the two periods indi
cated, are fully detailed in Tables,      and graphically   represented in
Diagrams.
    The results show   a most remarkable relation between air-tempera
ture and daily quantity     of urea and NaCl, viz.     a constant increase
with the rising of temperature from 50°-70°, and an equally constant
falling off with the further rise of temperature from 70°-90°.
    The physiological limit of the tropical zone, as marked by the
sudden decrease in the quantity of urinary water, is constantly fixed
at 76°.
    Appended is an extract from a manuscript of Dr. Forbes Watson,
containing a series   of observations on the daily quantity of urine and
the amount of solids therein excreted by a number of healthy soldiers
in various temperatures during a voyage to India in 1850.
    These observations were made       by Dr. Forbes Watson, who most
kindly consented to their being added here,        as far as they serve to
illustrate  the influence    of temperature    under   otherwise  constant
conditions.    They are tabulated and graphically represented as much
as  possible on the same plan as those of Dr. Becher, and in their
results show the most satisfactory harmony with the latter.

   The serious difficulties       presented by      "imaginaries"     in plane
                                    the  " principle of          "
geometry arise from treating                               signs   as a matter
of convention, and not        as a particular    case of  a general operation,
here termed a clinant, which consists in altering the length of a line
in  a given ratio, and rotating       it through     a given   angle.   As the
calculus of clinants furnishes a geometrical representation for every
algebraical result, imaginaries      disappear, and there is no longer any
apparent disagreement between analysis and geometry.               Many theo
ries, as, for example, those of anharmonic              ratios, hitherto only
established for points on a straight          line, are also easily extended
by means of clinants to embrace any points upon a plane.                   The
object of the present paper is to establish and illustrate         these facts.
For this purpose it is divided into three distinct but closely connected
parts.
   Part   I.  shows that clinants obey the same laws of calculation as
ordinary     algebraical   expressions, and explains their notation        and
geometrical construction.        This is illustrated by the solution of the
problem of the determinate section generalized, and by a geometrical
explanation     of " imaginary " trigonometrical functions, applied to the
discovery of the
                     " imaginary "   double rays in an homography.
   Part   II.   establishes the theory of stigmatics.         An index point,
supposed to move from any origin into every point on a plane, is
accompanied by one or more satellite points, termed stigmata, the
relative   position    of the stigmata      and index     at  any time   being
dependent on the relative position of the index and origin, according
to some assigned law.         The locus of the stigmata, corresponding to
each  path of the index, forms a stigmatic curve. The aggregate of
these curves constitutes a stigmatic,     which therefore consists of points
conjugated with each        other according to a characteristic law, ulti

1863.]                                   443
mately expressible by an equation between the clinant                     of the line
connecting      the index with the origin           and the clinant      of the line
connecting the stigma and the index.               By elimination       between two
such equations, the common stigmata (systigmata) of two stigmatics,
and by the condition of equal roots their coalescent systigmata, or
homostigmata,         may be determined.         These     systigmata     and homo-
stigmata      include,   as particular     cases,    the points     of "  real
                                                                               "   and
"imaginary"         intersection and contact of algebraical curves.
    These generalities are illustrated        by  a  consideration of the general
 stigmatic straight line and the central stigmatic circle.             The stigmatic
 straight line consists of stigmatic curves similar to the paths of the
index,    and their      systigmata are the "double points" of similar
figures.      The   stigmata of a stigmatic circle are always harmonically
 conjugated with the extremities of its axis (with which they always

 III. " Note   on the    Lines in the Spectra of some of the Fixed
      Stars."     By William Huggins, Esq., F.R.A.S., and
      William Allen Miller, M.D., LL.D.,                 Treasurer and
      V.P.R.S.      Received February 19, 1863.
   The recent detailed examination of the solar spectrum, and the
remarkable observations of Kirchhoff upon the connexion of the
dark lines of Fraunhofer     with the bright lines of artificial flames,
having imparted     new interest to the investigation of spectra, it has
appeared to the authors of the present note that the Royal Society
may not consider a brief account of their recent inquiry upon the
spectra of some of the self-luminous    bodies of the heavens unworthy
of attention, although the investigation is  as yet far from complete.
   After devoting considerable time to the construction of apparatus
suitable to this delicate    branch   of inquiry, they have at length
succeeded in contriving     an arrangement which has enabled them
to view the lines in the stellar spectra in much greater detail than
has been    figured   or  described  by any previous    observer.    The
           nmt                                        I
                                   i                  n
       i
apparatus also permits of the immediate comparison         of the stellar
spectra with those of terrestrial flames.   The accompanying drawing

1863.]                                      445
shows with considerable                       principal lines which the
                                       accuracy         the
authors hare seen in Sirius, Betelgeux, and Aldebaran, and their
position relatively to the chief solar lines.
     Without at present describing in detail,                    as they propose to do when
the experiments are completed, the arrangements of the special appa
ratus employed,         it may   be sufficient to state that                 it is attached to an
achromatic telescope of 10 feet focal length, mounted in the observa
tory of Mr. Huggins at Upper Tulse Hill. The object-glass, which
has an aperture of 8 inches, is a very fine one by Alvan Clark of
Cambridge, U.S. ; the equatorial mounting is by Cooke of York, and
the telescope is carried very smoothly by a clock motion.
     It   may further be stated that the position in the stellar spectra
corresponding         to that of Fraunhofer's line D, from which the others
are measured, has been obtained by coincidence                             with   a sodium line,
the position of which in the apparatus was compared directly with the
line D in the solar spectrum.
     The lines in the drawings against which                           a mark     is placed have
been measured.
     Addendum.       — Since     the    foregoing            Note      was    presented      to the
Royal Society, the authors have learned that a paper on the same
subject, accompanied by diagrams of the spectra of the Moon,
Jupiter, Mars, and several of the fixed stars, by Mr. L. M. Ruther-
furd, has appeared in the January Number of the ' American Journal
           '
of Science for the current year. The method of observing finally
employed by          Mr. Rutherfurd much resembles that adopted by the
authors     of this Note.
  They therefore desire to add that, during the past twelvemonth,
they have examined the spectra of the Moon, Jupiter, and Mars, as
well as of between thirty and forty stars, including those                          of Arcturus,
Castor, a Lyrae, Capella, and Procyon,                        some       of the principal lines
of which they           have     measured approximatively.                     They have also

  I. "On           Skew Surfaces, otherwise             Scrolls."     By A. Cayley,
                         F.R.S.     Received February 3, 1863.
                                        (Abstract.)
      It may be convenient to mention               at the outset that in the paper
  " On the Theory of Skew Surfaces,"                Camb. and Dubl. Math. Journ.
  vol. vi. pp. 171-173 (1852),          I pointed    out that upon any skew surface
  of the order n there is a singular (or nodal) curve meeting                      each
  generating line in (n         —
                                   2) points, and that the class of the circum
  scribed cone, or what is the same thing, the class of the surface, is
  equal to the order n of the surface.                In  the paper    " On a Class  of
  Ruled Surfaces,"            Camb. and Dubl. Math. Journ. vol. viii. pp. 45, 46
  (1853), Dr. Salmon considered the surface generated by a line which
  meets three curves of the orders m, n, p respectively : such surface
  is there shown to be of the order =2mnp                    ;  and it is noticed that
  there are upon           it  a certain   number of double right lines (nodal
  generators) ; to determine the number of these, it is necessary to
  consider the skew surface generated by a line meeting a given right
 line and a given curve of the order m twice                 ;  and the order of such
 surface is found to be            =\m(m— l) + h, where h is the number of
 apparent double points of the curve.                     The theory is somewhat
 further developed in Dr. Salmon's                 memoir      "On   the Degree of a
 Surface reciprocal to a given one,"              Trans. R.     Irish Acad. vol. xxiii.
 pp. 461-488 (read 1855), where certain minor limits are given for
 the orders of the nodal curves on the skew surface generated by a
 line meeting           a given   right line and two curves of the orders            m
 and n respectively, and on that generated by a line meeting a given
 right line and           a curve   of the order      m twice.      And in the    same
 memoir the author considers the skew surface generated by a line,
 the equations whereof are (a,           . *X'>   l)m=0 (a1, . .Y*, 1)B=0, where
 a,  . .  a' , . .  are  any linear functions of the coordinates, and t is an
arbitrary parameter.             And the    same theories are reproduced        in the
 " Treatise         on the Analytic     Geometry       of three Dimensions,"    Dubl.
 1862.         I   will also, though it is   less closely connected     with the sub
ject of the present memoir, refer to a paper by                     M. Chasles, " De

  The present memoir (in the composition of which I have been
assisted by a correspondence with Dr. Salmon) contains a further
development of the theory of the skew surfaces generated by a line
which    meets a given curve or curves                    :   viz.   I   consider, — 1st, the sur
face   generated by a line which meets each of three given curves                                      of
the orders m, n,          p respectively         ;       2nd, the surface generated by a
line which meets a given curve of the order                                 m   twice, and a given
curve of the order n once              ;   3rd, the surface which                      meets    a given
curve of the order         m   three times           ;    or, as it is very convenient                 to
express   it,
            I       consider     the       skew surfaces,                or say       the   "   scrolls,"
S(m, n,p), S(«a, w), S(w3).  The chief results are embodied in the
Table given after this introduction, at the commencement of the
memoir.    It   is   to be noticed that       I          attend throughout             to the general
theory, not considering otherwise than incidentally                                 the effect of any
singularity in the system of the given curves, or in the given curves
separately : the memoir contains, however, some remarks as to what
are the singularities       material to       a      complete theory            ;   and in particular
as regards the surfaceS(w').     am thus led to mention an entirely

 constant at different                   temperatures.         Now every refractive index
 contains at least two coefficients                 :   the one of refraction, which is repre
 sented       by the          theoretical         limit of the spectrum              ;    the     other   of
 dispersion, for which the difference                         between the refractive                 indices
of    H     and   A
            may be taken as the exponent.    The refractive index,

divided by the density,   termed the " specific refractive energy."

It    was not found as             a    rule that the theoretical limit of the spectrum
gave more          truly      a    constant than the line           A    ;   but the difference           is
within experimental                  errors.       The empirical          law was therefore ex
pressed as         follows — The refractive energy of
                              :                 liquid varies directly    a
with its density under the influence of change of temperature, or, in
other words, the specific refractive energy of   liquid      constant     a              is   a
not affected by temperature.                       Yet the influence of dispersion renders
this not absolutely accurate in the observed numbers, for the change
of dispersion          does not follow the,eame law, the spectrum contracting
in some cases much more, and in other cases much less rapidly than
the volume increases                ;   indeed no relation          is   as yet discoverable be
tween the change of dispersion and that of density.
     II.    The refraction and dispersion                     of   mixtures     of liquids. — This
question has engaged the attention of several experimenters, only one
of whom, however, M. Hoek, has offered                              a    solution.        His formula
depends on              —
                      /ia     1.    Yet most of the results recorded were equally
well explained on the supposition that the specific refractive energy
of   a     mixture      is    the mean         of the specific refractive energies of its
components.             It    was       clearly    desirable     to test      this in      some       cases
where the refractive indices of the liquids mixed were very wide
apart.  Fortunately, bisulphide of carbon and ether, substances
almost at the opposite limits of the scale, were found to mix without
condensation        ;       and another good experiment was obtained with aniline
and alcohol, on mixing which, however, some diminution                                        of volume
occurs.       In both         these cases the experimental numbers were                           slightly
below those deduced from the mean of the specific refractive energies,
the discrepancy being beyond the limits of probable                                      error   ;   yet no
other formula               could be devised which would give                  a   nearer approxi
mation to the indices actually observed.

  members         of homologous series. — Many such                                 series were examined,
  and the results            are       tabulated,          the refractive index of                       A    and the
  length      of the spectrum or dispersion being reduced, if necessary,
  to 20°     C,   and the sensitiveness being taken for the 10 degrees rising
  above 20° C.         ;   the specific refractive energy, dispersion, and sensitive
  ness     also form part of the Tables.                            Methylic, ethylic, amylic, and
  caprylic alcohols          are the first series                 examined, and it is found that on
  ascending the series the refraction increases                                 ;   the dispersion does so
  still more rapidly, while the sensitiveness remains nearly the same.
  Other homologous series of the same group, such as the iodides,
  compound            ethers, or mercury compounds, were also examined, and
  they all agree in exhibiting                       a progressive           change in refraction                       and
  dispersion with the advancing members of the series                                              ;   but in which
  direction       and to what extent depend on the other substances with
  which the compound radical is combined.                                           Yet,      if   we regard             not
  the actual indices, but these, minus unity, divided by the density, a
  pretty regular increase is found to take place as the series                                                advance.

     Other groups of homologous bodies          were also examined.         Benzole,
 toluole, xylole, cumole, and cymole gave nearly the same numbers,
  and no regular progression.         Pyridine, picoline, lutidine, and collidine
  showed an augmentation            of the specific refractive energy, but a
 diminution of the specific dispersion with the advancing series.
  Chinoline and lepidine (which proved to be the most refractive
 organic liquid known) showed an increase of each of the optical
 properties by the addition of Ca H2.              Thus the influence of the
  added increment on the rays of light differs in different groups,
 just  as  it  does in respect to the    boiling-point.
     IV.   The     refraction, dispersion, and sensitiveness of isomeric
  liquids. — Several of the liquids, isomeric with the different members
 of the benzole      series, were examined ;     some proved to be identical       in
 all optical properties      ; others sensibly the same in actual refraction
 and dispersion,        though    slightly different in density     ;   some    again
 identical in density, but differing in optical properties         ;    while other
 isomeric bodies differed slightly in each of these respects.                 Several
 hydrocarbons        of the type    Cao H16> from essential oils, seemed to be
 identical     in actual refraction, notwithstanding        slight differences of
 their density.        In  dispersion, too, there were some variations         ;  but
 not in sensitiveness.         Other hydrocarbons,       however, of the same
 ultimate      composition,    but differing    considerably    in physical      pro
 perties,     differed   also optically.     Compound      ethers,    as   valerianic
 ether and acetate         of amyl, which contain        the   same      number    of
 carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen elements, though differently arranged,
 are optically     identical, as was partially shown by Delffs some years
 ago.    Aniline and picoline, each empirically Cla H7 N, are totally
 different.      The conclusion arrived at is that isomeric bodies are
 sometimes widely different in these           optical properties    ;  but that in
 many cases, especially where there is close chemical                  relationship,
 there is identity also in this respect.
     V. The     effect  of chemical substitution. — By observing the amount
of change in the optical properties which results from a replacement
of one element by another, the chemical type remaining the same, it
seemed      possible    to arrive at a knowledge       of the influence of the
individual elements         on the rays   of light transmitted     by them.       Of
the immense number of data required for the perfecting of such an
inquiry, the following are afforded by the experiments already made.

1863.]                                   453
The replacement of hydrogen by            a compound radical, aniline     — amyl-
aniline  ;  and water, alcohol, ether (according to Williamson's theory).
Of hydrogen by oxygen — alcohol, acetic acid ; ether, acetic ether ;
and carvene, car vole, eugenic acid.             Of hydrogen by peroxide of
nitrogen   — benzole,     nitrobenzole,    dinitrobeuzole    (in solution) ; gly
cerine,    nitroglycerine    ;  and   amylic    alcohol, nitrate of amyl.       Of
hydrogen       by   chlorine   —benzole,     chlorobenzole,    terchlorobenzole   ;
and the substitution         of chlorine by bromine — terchloride of phos
phorus,     terbromide     of phosphorus ; chloroform, bromoform ; and
bichloride of chlor-ethylene,        bibromide of chlor-ethylene,       bibromide
of brom-ethylene.         When hydrogen is replaced by some other body,
there is generally an increase of the actual refraction and dispersion ;
but this is due to the increased weight, hydrogen having a very low
actual, but a very high specific influence on the rays of light.                In
each    of the five instances of two substitution-products,                as, for
instance, chlorobenzole         and trichlorobenzole,     the lower one always
retains    in its optical      properties an intermediate       position  between
the original substance and the higher product.
   These experiments on substitution             sufficed to show, as the exa
mination      of isomeric bodies had done, that the special influence
exerted on the rays of light by the elements of a compound is
greatly dependent on the manner of their combination.
   The following       is given as a generalization        approximately,   if not
absolutely true : — Every liquid has          a specific refractive energy com
posed of the specific refractive energies of its component elements,
modified by the manner of combination, and which is unaffected by
change of temperature,           and this refractive     energy accompanies it
when mixed with other liquids.
III. " On       the Change of Form assumed by Wrought Iron and
       other Metals        when Heated and            then Cooled by partial
       immersion in Water."               By Lieut.-Col. H. Clerk, R.A.,
       F.R.S.       Received      February 9, 1863.
    Origin    of  the Experiments.      —A     short time ago, when about to
shoe a wheel      with   a hoop-tire,    to which    it was necessary    to give a
bevel   of about fths of an inch,        one  of the workmen employed sug
gested that the bevel could be given by heating the tire red-hot and

                                      454                          [March   5,
  then immersing it one-half its depth in cold water.        This was tried,
  and found to answer perfectly,      that portion   of the tire which was
  out of the water being reduced in diameter.         The tire  was 3 inches
  wide,  | inch thick, and 4' 2" in diameter.
      As this result was curious and not generally known, I considered
  it desirable to institute some further experiments in order to try how
  far, by successive heatings and coolings, this change of form could be
  augmented, and also whether the same effect could be produced on
  other metals than wrought iron.
      Mode of carrying out the Experiments. —The experiments were
  made on cylinders of wrought iron of different dimensions, both
  hollow and solid    ; immersed, some to one-half of their depth, others
  to two-thirds  ;  also on similar cylinders of cast iron, steel, zinc, tin,
  and gun-metal.
     The specimens experimented on were all accurately turned in a
 lathe to the required dimensions, which were carefully noted ; they
 were then heated to a red heat in a wood-furnace          used for heating
 the tires of wheels.     As  soon as they had acquired the proper heat,
 they were taken out and immersed in water to one-half or two-thirds
 of their depth    (as stated in the experiment).      The temperature of
 the water ranged from 60° to 70° Fahr.
     The specimens were allowed to remain in the water about two
 minutes, in which time the portion in the air had lost all redness,
 and that in the water had become sufficiently cool to handle.         These
 alternate heatings and coolings were repeated       till the metal showed
signs   of cracking or giving way.
     The dimensions were noted after every five heatings.           The cir
cumferences were measured in preference to the diameters, as the true
circular form was liable to alter.
     General Results.   — It will be seen by an inspection    of the figures
that the general effect is a maximum       contraction   of the metal about
one inch above the water-line ; and that     this is the  same whether   the
metal be immersed one-half or two-thirds of its depth, or whether          it
be nine, six, or three inches deep.      With wrought iron the heatings
and coolings could be repeated from fifteen to twenty times before
the metal showed any signs of separation       ; but with cast iron after
the fifth heating the metal was cracked, and the hollow             cylinder
separated all round just below the water-line after the second heating.

 Cast steel stood twenty heatings, but was very much cracked all over
 its surface.    As respects the change of form of cast iron and steel, the
 result was similar to that in wrought iron, but not nearly so large in
 amount.      The  cast iron   did not return to its original dimensions, but
 the smallest diameter was about one inch above the water-line.
    Tin showed no change of form, there being apparently no inter
 mediate state between the melting-point and absolute solidity.          Brass,
 gun-metal, and zinc showed the effect slightly        ;  but instead of a con
 traction just above the water-line, there was an expansion or bulging.
    The   effect  on wrought      iron is best   seen    in the solid cylinder
 (figs. 9 and 10), where the displacement of particles just above the
water-line    appears to be compensated by the bulgings             at the two
extremities.
    The specimens of wrought iron were submitted by Mr. Abel (Che
 mist to the War Department) to chemical analysis, and he informs
me that he found        nothing     noteworthy   in the composition      of the
metal   ;  nor was    there any appreciable       difference in the     specific
gravity of the metal taken from different parts of the specimen. It
appears therefore to be simply a movement of the particles whilst
the metal is in a soft or semifluid state.
    The following     is an account      of the experiments, which were
carried out under the superintendence of Mr. Butter, Draughtsman
of the Royal Carriage Department, to whom also I am indebted for
the accompanying diagrams.           The exact dimensions of each specimen
 before and after heating are given in a tabulated form at the end of
the paper, to facilitate comparison.
    In figs. 22 and 23 the changes in form of the 9" cylinders (one
immersed one-half,       the other two-thirds its depth)         are shown in
section after every five heatings (half the full size).
    Experiment.    1 —A 4   ft. 2 in. hoop-tire of 3 inches breadth and j|ths
inch in thickness (fig. 1) was heated and cooled by being immersed
to half its depth in cold water five times, by which the effect shown
in fig. 2 was produced.

ference between the two circumferences                 of 8-875 inches.   The breadth
remained unaltered          (3   inches), and kept perfectly straight.

was brought   being regulated by the melting of a piece of tin which
was conveyed at the same            time with it into the furnace.              Several
experiments with pieces    of tin and zinc had               been previously        made,
by means of which it was ascertained that in the same temperature
tin melted in two-sevenths          of the time requisite to melt zinc          ;    hence
when the zinc cylinder and piece             of tin   were placed in the furnace
together, the time occupied by the tin in reaching its melting-point
was carefully noted, and the         cylinder   was     left in the furnace as long
again as the time thus observed         ;    by this means it was brought very
nearly to its melting-point without incurring any danger of its actually
melting.    The last five times, however, it                was allowed to remain a
little longer in the flame      ;   and the melting          upon the top was re
tarded the last four times by placing a piece of iron upon                   it,    which
conducted heat from that part, allowing               it   to remain half   a       minute

    [The   cause  of the curious phenomenon described by Colonel Clerk
in the preceding paper seems to be indicated by some of the figures,
especially those relating to hollow cylinders of wrought iron, which
are very instructive.
    Imagine    such a cylinder         divided into two parts by a horizontal
plane at the water-line,         and in this state immersed after heating.
The under part, being in contact with water, would rapidly cool and
contract, while the upper part would cool but slowly.                  Consequently
by the time the under part had pretty well cooled, the upper part
would    be left  jutting out      ;  but when both parts had cooled, their
diameters would again agree.                Now in the actual experiment this
independent motion of the two parts is impossible, on account of the
continuity of the metal        ;    the under part tends to pull in the upper,
and the upper to pull out the under.                    In this contest the cooler
metal, being the stronger, prevails, and so the upper part gets pulled
in, a little above the water-line, while still hot.               But it has still to
contract on cooling      ; and this it will do to the full extent due to its
temperature, except in so far as it may be prevented by its connexion
with the rest.       Hence, on the whole, the effect of this cause is to
leave a permanent contraction             a little above the water-line ; and   it is
easy to see that the contraction must be so much nearer to the water-
line as the thickness of the metal is less, the other dimensions of the
hollow cylinder and the nature of the metal being given.                  When the
hollow cylinder is very short, so as to be reduced to a mere hoop,
the same cause operates          ;   but there is not room for more than            a
general inclination of the surface, leaving the hoop bevelled.
    But there is another cause of deformation at work, the opera
tion of which is well         seen      in figs. 2 and 3.      Imagine    a mass   of
metal heated so as to be slightly plastic, and then rapidly cooled
over a large part of its surface.               In cooling, the skin    at the same
time contracts and becomes              stronger, and thereby tends to squeeze
out its contents.       This accounts for the bulging of the ends of the
solid cylinders of wrought iron and the rents seen in their cylindrical
surface.     The skin at the bottom is of course                as strong as at the
sides   in the part below the water-line             ; but a surface which resists
 extension far more than bending has far less power to resist pressure
 of the nature of   a  fluid pressure when plane than when convex.              The
 effect of the  cause   first explained is also manifest in these cylinders,

                                                                       [March
although    it is less marked      than in the case of the hollow cylinders,
as might have been expected.
   The tendency of the cooled skin of               a heated    metallic   mass    to
squeeze out its contents appears to be what             gives rise to the bulging
seen near the water-line      in the hollow cylinder of brass.            Wrought
iron, being highly tenacious even at a comparatively high tempera
ture, resists with great force the sliding motion of the particles which
must take place in order that the tendency of the cooled skin to
squeeze   out its contents may take effect         ;  but brass, approaching in
its hotter parts more nearly to the          state   of  a molten mass,    exhibits
the effect more strongly.        It  seems probable that even        in the  case  of
brass a very thin hollow         cylinder would exhibit        a contraction    just
above the water-line.       Should there be a metal or alloy which about
the temperatures with which we have to deal was stronger hot than
cold, the effect of the cause first referred to would be to produce an
expansion a little below the water-line.       — G. G. S.]

   Iron.  — The     specimens of iron experimented were, with two excep
tions, lent us by Dr. Percy.        In the following Table we give the results
obtained with them        : —
(1.) Electrotype iron, deposited from solution of pure sulphate of
       iron. The strips were very thin and porous ; we could not
       therefore obtain concordant         values for the conducting       power,
       but we were able to determine the percentage decrement in the
       conducting power between 0° and 100°.             We have, for the    above
       reason,   taken the first observed conducting power equal 100.

    From the results obtained, it is obvious that the higher the         con
ducting power the higher the percentage decrement in the conducting
power between 0° and      1 00°.   This has  been proved to be the case with
about 100 alloys with which we have experimented.              We have   also
found that we may deduce the conducting power of a pure metal from
an impure     one when the      impurity  does not reduce the conducting

1863.]                                 475
power more than, say, 10 to 20 per cent.             According    to our experi
ments,      the percentage decrement in the conducting             power of an
impure metal between 0° and 100° varies in the same ratio as the
conducting power of the impure metal at 100°, compared with that
 of the pure metal at 100°.
    Thus, from specimens Nos. 5,         6, 7, 9, 13, and 15, the conducting
 power of pure iron was found to be at 0°= 16- 725.
    In  conclusion, we give the values found for specimens of cobalt
 and    nickel wire lent to us by Professor          Wohler.     They were     as
follows   : —

       corresponding to a percentage decrement of 27-573 per cent.
    Although     these metals were said to be chemically pure, the results
obtained seem to indicate that they are not so, having probably taken
up some impurities       in the process of fusion.

shows the place which the metals treated of in this paper take in the

 II. "On       the  Amyloid Substance of the Liver, and its ultimate
         destination in the Animal Economy."                       By Bobert
         M'Donnell, M.D. Communicated by William Bowman,
         Esq.      Received February 13, 1863.
                                     (Abstract.)
    After briefly referring    to the discovery    of the amyloid substance of
 the liver, and the earlier history of the subject, the author examines
 the facts which have induced           Dr. Pavy to conclude that this sub
 stance   is not normally transformed into sugar during life.             The au
 thor being led, after a careful repetition of Dr. Pavy's experiments,
to concur in his views, asks, If then the amyloid substance of the
liver be not converted into sugar, what becomes of it              ?   what is its
 normal destination in the animal economy            ?   It is the object of the
memoir       to attempt    to answer this question, which, it must be ad
 mitted, is one of the greatest delicacy       ; nevertheless there appears on
the whole to be evidence that the amyloid substance met with in
the liver is on its way upwards towards the more exalted or complex
immediate animal principles        ;  that, in fact, the process of healthy as
 similation     tends, if the expression may be used, to promote it from
the rank of ternary (hydrocarbonous)          to that of quaternary (azotized)
compounds        ; and that its conversion into sugar is to be looked upon
as a deviation      from this progressive course — a dissimilative         instead
of an assimilative process.        In  order to establish this view it became
necessary —
     1st.  To investigate the chemical and physiological relations of the
amyloid      substance, not only of the liver, but of other organs and
tissues, and to test the very interesting results, which are         for the most
part due to      M. Charles Rouget.
    2ndly.    To compare the portal and hepatic blood with            each other,
and with arterial and venous blood derived from other sources                ; and
    3rdly. To consider the relations to           each    other of the different
functions performed by the liver.            For   if it  be true, as   Lehmann,
Brown- Sequard, and others have asserted, that the fibrine and much
of the albumen of the portal blood vanishes in the liver, and that
at the same time that it destroys these azotized compounds it forms
its non-azotized amyloid        substance, and excretes bile containing         so
little nitrogen that it      need  hardly    be taken     into account, are we

    1863.]                                   477
    not, from the consideration of these functions, led to infer that the
    nitrogen which leaves the liver by no other outlet may go forth in
   the hepatic blood in union with the amyloid substance thus changed
   into  a new azotized principle ; — that thus the liver is a great blood-
   making organ, in which there is constantly going on a reconstruction
   of certain ingredients of the blood        ;  that in it the fibrine,    &c, which
   has done its work,         is disintegrated,    the hydrocarbons        of the bile
  abstracted, and the nitrogen combined with the amyloid                    substance,
   which, instead of being normally changed into sugar, emerges from
   the liver a constituent principle of the protoplasma, from the bosom
  of which (to         use the words    of Bernard     with reference to the       foetal
  tissues) organic evolution is to be accomplished             ?
        Of the    existence   of the Amyloid Substance of Bernard in the
                      Placenta and other Organs and Tissues.
      The cells of the placenta contain, during the earlier                  stages    of
  embryonic        life, animal    dextrine,  having     characters identical       with
  those of the amyloid substance of the liver               ; its presence may        be
  readily demonstrated under the microscope.                Bernard has discovered
 it in the      placentae    of rabbits, guinea-pigs, &c.        He also made the
  very interesting        observation    that   the multiple     placentulae of the
 ruminants do not contain any amyloid                substance, but that in this
 class of animals          this substance is found        in certain cells of the
 amnion.         The    presence,   however, in the amnion or the placenta,
 of epithelial cells containing amyloid substance, is               a fact quite se
 condary to the general fact that this substance enters largely                     into
 the constitution of most of the tissues of the embryo.                 Its existence
 does    not indicate a new function           of   an  organ    doing temporarily
 the duty of the liver, but           it indicates    a new fact     with regard to
 the development of certain structures and a              new property of tissue.
 During embryonic life a great part of the foetal tissues are found
to be so impregnated with amyloid substance, that it appears to be
the formative material from which these tissues are evolved                     ;  and,
in fact, it would seem to be related to their growth and development,
as starch is to the growth and development                of the tissues of       vege
tables.       In   the skin of the chick in ovo, and of the foetuses of
rabbits,     cats,    guinea-pigs,   sheep, oxen, pigs, it is readily         demon
strated    ;  it  is seen by the addition      of acidulated tincture of iodine,

and is most        abundant     at the points      where   the  aggregation     of
epithelial cells shows that the feathers and hairs are about being de
veloped.       The horny structures contain it plentifully ; in the bill,
the hoof, and the claws it exists in large proportion.            From the hoof
of   a foetal  calf of about four months enough may be obtained, by the
 alcoholic solution of potash, for chemical examination and fermenta
 tion.    The muscular tissues of the          foetus are  full of it   ; from 20
 to 50 per cent. can be extracted from the muscles of foetal calves
 of from three to     seven months by the aid       of the alcoholic solution    of
 potash.
      Having arrived, by       a repetition   of Dr. Pavy's ingenious experi
  ments, at the conclusion that the amyloid substance of the liver is
  not normally changed into glucose, and finding on examination the
  accuracy of the facts concerning the physiological             relations of the
  amyloid substance to the foetal and other tissues, discovered by              M.
  Charles Rouget,        and investigated by Bernard himself, the question
  presents itself, May it not be that the liver does for the adult what
  divers tissues do during the development of the foetus              ?    May not
  this great organ form, with the help of the amyloid substance se
  creted in its cells, a nitrogenous compound, just as the muscles of
  the foetus convert the amyloid substance contained in them into the
  highly nitrogenous material of muscular tissue ?
      May not, in fact, the amyloid substance of the liver            be the basis
   of  an azotized protoplasma forming a constituent          of the blood of the
   adult animal, as the amyloid substance of muscle is the basis of the
   material    from which      the  evolution    of muscular     tissue is accom
   plished   ?
       Even a superficial consideration of the functions performed by the
   liver leads one to answer these questions in the affirmative.              For   if
   it  be true that the blood      which enters the liver is rich in fibrine and
   albumen, and that these materials are so completely changed within
    this organ that little or none of them leave        it by the hepatic vessels,
    what becomes of them         ?   It is true their hydrocarbonous        constitu
    ents may be thrown out as bile.          But what of the nitrogen contained
    in them    ?   If  it does   not escape by the bile-ducts, it has no other
    mode of exit save by the hepatic vessels.         The author conceives it to
    be reunited   with the hydrocarbonous        amyloid substance, and to leave

in   some respects, in others albuminose, and which is                                 fully described
in the memoir.                These considerations lead to the necessity                        of inves
tigating the several distinct functions of the liver                           :   —

elements are concerned).
   3rd. As to the relative composition                              and characters of the blood
which enters and of that which leaves the liver.
  The author adds his testimony to that of Lehmann and Brown-
Sequard as regards the fibrine-destroying function of the liver he                                     ;
attempts to show that, in proportion                           to the amount of fibrine which
disappears in the liver, the quantity of nitrogen eliminated in the
form of bile     very small indeed, but that the blood in passing
                        is
through the liver becomes greatly enriched in colourless corpuscles,
and that       it   contains           more abundantly              than other blood an azotized
compound, resembling what has been described by some authors as
blood-caseine       .        This material, although                  resembling,      is   not identical
with      caseine   ;    it   can be obtained from the serum                   of blood abstracted
by    a     peculiarly contrived instrument                      (a   drawing of which accom
panies the paper) from the vena cava, close to the mouths of the
hepatic veins.
     Whatever           may be its precise chemical                      composition        and charac
teristics, whether            it   is   to be regarded as           a   form of albumen, or albu
men-peptone (albuminose), or caseine,                          itis   enough to state, that during
active digestion the blood which leaves the liver contains                                      a    proteic
compound, that               it   is   richer in this compound than arterial blood, and
 that this latter             is   richer in       it    than ordinary venous blood, or than
that of the portal vein.                      At the       same time the blood          of the hepatic
 veins contains          a     far larger quantity              of colourless blood-corpuscles
 than the portal blood.
     A    microscopic examination of these kinds of blood shows that the
 colourless corpuscles are from five to ten times more numerous in
 the former than in the latter.                          Physiologists    are so familiar           with this
 fact, as well      as   with the chief peculiarities of the colourless corpuscles
 of hepatic blood, that     unnecessary to dwell upon the circum
                                         it   is
 stances which have induced some of the most distinguished among
 them to regard as the most important                                   function    of the liver, the
                                                                                       2    m   2

 formation,       or at least the rejuvenescence, of the blood-corpuscles.
 Dr. Carpenter conceives that the appearance of the colourless cor
puscles of the blood may be regarded as a phenomenon analogous to
 the development of cells in the albumen                         of      in the vegetable
                                                                      seeds
 kingdom.          He also supposes that         these       cells aid in the conversion
 of crude alimentary matters into proximate principles.                             Additional
 support is given to each supposition by the notion that these colour
 less cells stand in close relationship to the material formed                      in the liver,
 so closely resembling dextrine         of vegetable origin.
     It   is true that there is     nothing novel in the view that the liver is
 a great blood-forming          organ, or rather that it is an organ in which
 certain components of the blood are disintegrated, while from some
 of the matter       so disintegrated a constant reconstruction                   of the blood
is going forward       ;    yet it is certain that, not long since, physiologists
would have been unwilling to admit that materials constituted as the
colourless blood-cells or caseine could be formed within the liver from
a substance resembling            starch taking         to   itself nitrogen derived,               as
one may say, from the retrogressive metamorphosis                             of tissue.       It   is
very improbable            that, looking to the liver alone,                such a conclusion
would have been arrived             at.    The consideration,                 however, of the
physiological       relations of the amyloid substance                 (of Bernard),       as re
gards the development of the azotized tissues of the                          foetus, — the    fact
that it     is,   so far as they are concerned,              a   protoplasma, which,                by
taking to itself nitrogen, terminates in the evolution                         of fully-formed
nitrogenous tissues,        — prepares     one to consider the idea that the liver
evolves    its proteic compounds during adult life by                   a   somewhat similar
process.
     To M. Charles Rouget          we unquestionably              owe the observation               of
the fundamental facts which lead to the foregoing conclusions                              ;   yet
the author hopes that the recapitulation                 of facts in this communica
tion will be found worthy of the consideration of physiologists                            ;    for
he   conceives that not only          is   the view of the subject which he has
ventured to adopt in harmony with               a   great number of hitherto unex
plained circumstances, but that            it   gives   a    solution more satisfactory
than any yet given of certain pathological                   phenomena which          it   would
be out    of place to speak of here.

     It  is shown in the general paper that          if an integral    of any  one
  equation     of the peculiar system of (partial differential)         equations
  there discussed be found, then        if  a certain numerical result of sub
  sequent and always possible operations prove odd, an integral of the
 entire system can be found by the solution              of  a single differential
 equation of the first order.       It is shown in the paper now sent that,
 when the above numerical result is even*, we can reduce the original
 system of partial differential      equations into a new system, fewer in
 number       by unity at least, and of the same general character, so as
 to admit of a repetition of the same procedure.             Thus the common
 integral sought will finally be given either by the solution of a single
 differential equation of the first order, or by finding          one integral  of
 the single partial differential    equation, which, in the most unfavour
 able case conceivable, will remain at last.

    The object of the following paper is to give an account of certain
observations which seem to indicate that the cell-wall of the verte
brate blood-disk does not possess the simplicity            of structure usually
attributed to it.
    It  is well known that the blood-corpuscles,        when floating    in their
own serum, or after having         been    treated with acetic acid or water,

appear to be furnished with perfectly plain envelopes, composed of a
simple homogeneous membrane, without distinction of parts.                    But,
as  will appear from the observations here to be related, when the
blood is treated with a solution of magenta (nitrate of rosanilin) or
with    a dilute solution    of tannin, the corpuscles present changes which
seem     irreconcileable with such a supposition.
    Attention is first asked to the       effects of magenta.      When    a speck
of human blood          was    placed on a glass slide and mixed with a drop
of a watery solution of magenta*, the following changes were ob
served. The blood-disks speedily lost their natural opacity and
yellow colour      ; they became perfectly        transparent,    and assumed a
faint rose colour      ;  they also expanded sensibly, and lost their bicon
cave figure.       In    addition, a dark-red speck made its appearance on
some portion       of their periphery.     The pale corpuscles took the colour
much more strongly than the red              ; and their nuclei were displayed
with great clearness, dyed of a magnificent carbuncle-red.                   Many
of the nuclei were seen in the process of division, more or less ad
vanced ; and in some cells the partition had resulted in the produc
tion of two, three, or even four distinct secondary nuclei.
    These appearances were first observed in freshly-drawn              blood from
the finger.       Subsequently blood from the horse, pig, ox, sheep, deer,
camel, cat, rabbit, and kangaroo was examined in like manner.                  The
 effect on the red corpuscles (to which all the observations hereinafter
recorded are exclusively confined) was in each instance the same as
  n human blood.
    The nucleated blood- disks of the oviparous            classes, when treated
 similarly,    yielded     analogous results.     The coloured contents were
forthwith discharged         ;  the central nucleus came fully into view, and
 assumed a deep-red             colour;  the   corpuscles   expanded, they lost
 something of their oval form, and approached nearly, or sometimes
quite, to a circular outline.         Lastly, there appeared on the periphery
a dark-red macula, of a character and position resembling that seen
on the mammalian blood-disk.               Such a macula was detected in the
fowl, in the frog, and in the dace and minnow.
    * The solution I found to answer best in these experiments was a nearly satu
rated solution of nitrate of rosanilin, made by boiling the salt in water, and
filtering after it had stood twenty-four hours, then diluting slightly with water to
prevent precipitation.

    Owing, however, to the large quantity of molecular matter floating
in the serum, and which was coloured by the magenta, difficulties
were found in preparing specimens which carried conviction that the
 macula in question was not an adhering granule.               It  was also found
that    it required    a nice adjustment     of the relative quantities of the
solution    and of the blood to        bring it out. It was only when the
right proportions were hit, and especially when the disks were made
to roll over in the field of the microscope, that the existence of a
coloured      particle  organically connected with the cell-wall         could be
 satisfactorily    made out.      The best specimens were prepared from
 human blood drawn in the fasting condition, and from the blood of
 a  kitten two days old.
     From well-prepared specimens of human blood the following par
 ticulars were gathered (see fig. 1) : — Nearly every disk possessed the
 parietal macula ; it could be distinctly recognized in nine-tenths of
 them    ; and in several of those in which it was not at first visible,         it
 came into view as the corpuscles revolved           in the field.

     The macula       was  clearly situated in the cell-wall,       and not in the
  interior of the corpuscle.       Usually it appeared as if imbedded or set
  in the rim of the disk, like the jewel in a diamond ring ; but some
 times it occupied various positions on the flat surfaces, and when
  so placed, the spot was      difficult or impossible to detect.
     It  commonly      presented a thickly lenticular      shape ; sometimes it
  was   square, and occasionally       in appearance vesicular (fig. 1, A, a).
  In  some   instances, and especially in long-kept specimens, the particle
  was seen to stand out on the outline          of the disk like   an excrescence.

Still more rarely, instead of         a spot, a    thick red line ran round the
circumference for a quarter or a third of its extent (fig.              1,  A, 6).
   As   a rule  it was   extremely minute, covering generally               not more
than a twentieth or thirtieth of the circumference                ; but there was a
considerable variation in its magnitude and distinctness.                Very rarely
two specks could be seen         ;  but the occurrence of adhering granules
rendered the verification of this point extremely difficult.
    This description applies,       so far as the    inquiry has yet     been prose
cuted, to the mammalian            blood-disk generally,        making     allowances
for differences in size.        In  the camel the macula occupied indiffer
ently any part of the oval outline.
    Among the oviparous          classes,  the blood of the fowl, frog, dace,
and minnow has been most fully examined (see fig. 1, B) ; but the
blood of the sparrow, duck, goose, and turkey was also searched, as
well as that of the newt and carp.
    In all of  these a tinted particle appeared, more or less constantly,
in the cell-wall, when the corpuscles were treated with magenta*.
The presence of        a central nucleus       in these     classes  caused the ma
cula to be invisible     more frequently than in mammalia, inasmuch as
it suffered eclipse when situated over or under the central nucleus.
    In the fowl, dace, and minnow it was found easy to bring out the
parietal macula      ; in the fish two spots were not unfrequently               seen.
The macula was situated indifferently on any part of the periphery ;
and sometimes it projected from the surface. When happily pre
pared the specimens were even beautiful.                  The central nucleus was
 dyed of the finest red      ;   and on the delicate outline of the cell-wall
 hung the red parietal macula, offering a not altogether fanciful                   re
 semblance to the astronomical figures representing the moon coursing
 in its orbit round the earth.
    At   this stage of the inquiry it was conceived that an improved
 demonstration      might be obtained by fixing the dye with a mordant,
 and then subjecting the corpuscles to a lavatory process, so as to get
rid of the floating granules which so much interfered with the view.
For this purpose a solution of tannin (which is one of the mordants
   * In order to bring out     the best results, it was found requisite to modify the
strength and quantity of the solution for the         different kinds of blood.    This
doubtless   depended   upon the varying densities    of the liquor sanguinis and cell-
contents in different animals.

for magenta used in the arts) was employed ; and               some    advantage
was found therein.        When a solution of tannin, of         3 grains    to the
ounce of water, was added to blood that had already been dyed with
magenta, it was found that the parietal            maculae    had their colour
intensified, and that they became           more conspicuous      objects.    The
investigation   was, however, not pushed any         further in this direction,
for it was found that tannin alone produced          an even more remarkable
effect than magenta.        To this    effect I now desire to draw particular
attention.
   When a solution        of tannin,     of the strength of 3 grains to the
ounce, was applied to human blood, or to that of the horse, ox,
sheep, pig, or cat, the blood immediately became turbid ; and when
a drop was placed under         the microscope the corpuscles were found
greatly changed, as represented in fig. 2.

they were fixed ; but they varied considerably.                Some were only
minute bright specks in the cell- wall       ; others were half or even two-

    The projections   were  commonly round or dome-shaped, bordered

 nearly every blood-disk presented the hooded appearance after the
 addition of tannin.
    The blood of the fowl, turkey, duck, and             goose showed exactly
 analogous phenomena with the same reagent              (see fig. 3).

                      Blood of fowl after the action of tannin.
     The projection had sometimes the hooded character with a vesi
  cular body within ; sometimes the projection offered no such distinc
  tion of parts.    It was situated indifferently on any part of the peri
  phery.    In all the birds examined a second projection was as rare          as
  in mammalia.
     Of fish, the  dace, minnow, and carp were examined.              The tannin-
  solution produced a similar effect to that seen in the fowl— with this
  difference, that a large number of corpuscles had two projections

1863.]                                    487
 nstead of one.        In   the carp double and single projections occurred
in about equal proportions ; in the minnow double projections were
all but universal.        The second projection was situated sometimes at
the opposite       pole   of the disk, sometimes in near proximity to its
fellow, or at any point between.            Very rarely,   a   third projection     was
seen    in the  dace.
     In  the blood of the frog there was a strong tendency to the inde
finite multiplication of the projections ; two, three, four, and even
five would rise in succession on the surface of the disk. It appeared,
too, not unfrequently as          if the entire outer membrane of the cell was
 detached from the parts beneath and raised into eight or ten unequal
 elevations, giving      the outline of the disk an irregularly crenate ap
 pearance*.
     The formation of these singular projections, or pullulations, on the
 blood-disks could be watched without difficulty by placing a drop of
 the tannin-solution       beneath the covering glass, and permitting a little
 blood to insinuate itself into the solution under the microscope.                    As
 the blood flowed in and mingled with the tannin, the corpuscles were
 observed gradually        to enlarge, and then suddenly, without previous
 warning, to shoot out the projection.           As  a rule,   it  does not appear to
 grow afterwards.          The phenomenon was finely seen in the defibrin-
 ated blood of the fowl after it had been allowed to sink through
 a column of syrup (sp. gr. 1025) in a test-tube.                        Fowl's blood
  washed in this way was mixed, in a little glass, with about five times
 its volume of the tannin-solution,          and a drop immediately put under
  the microscope.         The disks first enlarge and         become rounded, and
  the central nucleus comes into view.            In thirty     or forty seconds the
  pullulation begins ; and each corpuscle, with instantaneous rapidity
  and without previous sign, throws out its bud.                  The disk itself suf
  fers not the least disturbance during this act            ;   it preserves its sym
  metry unchanged, as         if it  had no concern, beyond that of proximity,
  with the sudden apparition on its surface.
      No visible rupture of the cell-wall took place.               The circular out-
     * There is  a certain adjustment of the proportions between      the tannin-solution
  and blood required to bring out the effects described in this paper ; but the proper
  proportions are, practically, very easily found after a few trials for each kind of
  blood. In mammalian blood, one drop of blood mixed in a conical glass with
  four or five of the solution generally answered perfectly. Any considerable excess
   of blood or solution above these proportions caused destruction of the corpuscles.

line of the latter could sometimes be distinctly followed through the
projection (fig. 2, c) ; and as the altered corpuscles revolved in the
field of the microscope, the projection appeared to be organically con
nected with          it,   but to form no part of its cavity.                  In   the human
blood-disks         the application       of acetic acid, soon after the tannin,
caused,      on two occasions, the pullulations gradually to subside, and
finally to disappear, and then the disk resumed its original circular
outline.     failed to produce this " redux

did not always succeed                 with human blood, probably                because      the
change produced by the tannin had gone too far.
   The modification               noted under the term             "hooded" appearance
depends,     I     believe, upon secondary conditions                  of concentration and
quantity of the tannin-solution              in comparison to the blood.    When
the hooded condition has been                 watched in the act of occurrence,                 it
was noticed that the outer hood was shot out                    first, and instantly after
this the highly refractive vesicular body made its appearance within.
The contents of the hood (excluding the vesicular body) appeared
usually      to refract       the light like the body of the cell, or even less
strongly     ;     sometimes, however, more strongly.
   The effect of tannin did not             cease with the production                of the   ele
vations just described.                At first the cells and their projections pre
served their         elasticity   ;   but after   a   while   (a   few minutes, or several
hours, according            to the proportions used) the corpuscles and their
projections         became     solid, and they could be cracked      pressure       by
under the microscope like starch-granules.   More slowly the same
destruction overtook the corpuscles spontaneously   and this signifi     ;
cant fact was observed in the course of       —  sometimes the cell
                                                               it  :
ruptured         before the projection,           the latter persisting         as   a   bright
granule amid or near the débris   sometimes, on the other hand (in
                                              ;
the horse), the projection broke up before the disk to which  was                        it
attached.          In this latter     case, the hood      (if there     were   any) broke up
first into    a    scattered nebula of granular               appearance, and then the
nucleolus-like        body within burst into three or four bright fragments
(fig.   2,   d).     This train of       events    seemed to remove all doubt as to
the complete isolation of the projection from the cavity of the disk.
Last of all, the disk itself began            to crack    ;   in   a   few days all my spe
cimens were thus destroyed.
   In addition to magenta and tannin the following substances                              were

1863.]                                          489
tried, but they did not produce phenomena in the least analogous with
the foregoing: — gallic acid, ferrocyanide of potassium, santonine,
sulphate      of magnesia, alcohol and water, solutions of carbolic acid,
of atropine, morphia, iodine, sugar, gum, glycerine, and infusion of
coffee.
   A     solution    of picric acid produced the appearance of                      a parietal
particle     like that brought out by magenta, except that it was not
coloured.         An exactly similar appearance                 was   on one    occasion ob
served in blood-corpuscles in the urine of a patient with acute Bright's
disease.
   When magenta          was     applied after the process of pullulation had
taken place, the projections were found to take the dye strongly, and
especially     the vesicular body within the hood.                     By this proceeding
beautiful and remarkable objects for microscopical examination were
obtained.         In the fowl,       dace, and minnow the projection               was tinted
earlier than the central nucleus              — probably      from its more ready access
to the pigment.           The explanation
                                        of these appearances presents
great difficulties, and in the present state of the inquiry can only be
offered provisionally.
   The     effect    of the magenta-solution            is not merely to tint, and so
render visible a very minute body.                    In watching the          effect    of    ma
genta, the first thing observed is that the natural yellowish colour of
the disk is discharged, and that                  a faint     rose tint is assumed in its
stead.     The disks    at the same time lose their biconcave shape.                           The
            macula is rather              " brought   out
                                                            "    than revealed, and the
parietal
action of the solution         is,   to   a   very great extent, of     a   simply osmotic
character.
   The action of the tannin-solution                   is   likewise in the main of             a
similar nature, but modified in                some very peculiar manner.               Its first
operation    is   to cause the corpuscle to enlarge by imbibition,                      and this
goes on progressively until at length the cell                    is   destroyed.         If   the
solution be strong, this destruction supervenes at once.                         The tannin
also unites with the cell-contents and coagulates them, imparting                               to
the corpuscle, finally,     a        solid     consistence.      The conditions of the
imbibition     are   disturbed       by the previous application               of magenta;
for no pullulation, or at most only traces, occurs when the corpuscles
are treated first with magenta and then with tannin.

the    structure    of the vertebrate        blood-disk     is important.      They
seem    to warrant the inferences drawn in the two following                   para
graphs     :—
    1.  The exact identity of the appearances produced in the blood-
disks of the ovipara with those observed in the mammalian corpuscles
lends strong support to the view that these corpuscles are homolo
gous as wholes        ; and that the mammalian             blood-disk    is not the
homologue of the nucleus of the coloured                corpuscle of the ovipara,
as was conceived by        Mr. Wharton Jones.
    2. The observations likewise         lead to the belief that the envelope
of the vertebrate blood-disk is a duplicate membrane               ; in other words,
that within the outer covering there exists an interior vesicle which
encloses    the coloured contents, and, in the ovipara, the nucleus.
    Dr. Hensen* of Kiel had already in             1861 convinced himself, from
wholly different observations, that the blood-corpuscles of the frog
possess such a structure.              On this view the blood-corpuscle             is
anatomically      analogous to a vegetable cell, and the inner                vesicle
corresponds to the primordial          utricle.
    The present observations indicate, by direct proof, a duplication at
 only one or, at most, two points in the blood-disks of mammals and
 birds. Nevertheless certain appearances, occasionally observed, favour
 the notion of a complete duplication           (fig. 1,  6).
    The admission of this hypothesis, however, scarcely removes the
 difficulties   sufficiently to permit a tenable explanation to be offered
 of the appearances described in this paper. Yet, as it may prove
 suggestive to some other inquirer, I will not suppress what appears
 to me the explanation          least open to objections.         It  might  be con
 ceived that the cells enlarged by imbibition,             until at length the less
 distensible inner membrane gave way, and permitted an extravasation
 of a portion of the cell-contents between it and the outer membrane,
 its own continuity being in the meanwhile               instantaneously restored
 by cohesion of the ruptured borders t-                In this way     a microscopic

    t In the same manner as a soap-bubble when bisected, instead of collapsing,
 forms, in virtue of the adhesiveness and fluidity of its envelope, two new and per
 fect bubbles.    That the cell-wall of the blood-disk possesses some such endow
 ment seems highly probable.      I have on several occasions witnessed, after adding
 magenta,    the total extrusion of the nucleus, both in the frog and in the newt,
 without the least collapse of the corpuscles.

drop of the cell-contents would         be lodged between the outer and
inner membrane, and completely         severed from the general cell-cavity.
The peculiar modification        spoken of as the      "hooded" appearance
might     be due to imbibition     of fluid  between    this microscopic drop
 and the outer envelope.
     The chief difficulties in the way of this explanation arise out of
 the differences of nature which appear to exist between the projection
 and the general cell-contents of which it is supposed to be a detached
 portion.     The projection    refracts light much more highly than the
 cell-contents   ; it also is deeply dyed by magenta, whereas the cell-
 contents are only very feebly so.
     In  conclusion, it may be added that important advantages may be
  expected from the use of magenta in histological             researches.    Its
 inert chemical character, its prodigious tinting power, and its solu
  bility in water eminently fit it for such a purpose.         It will probably
  prove of especial use in bringing into sight objects which otherwise
  evade the visual organs from their absolute colourlessness and trans
  parency, and from the equality of their refraction with the medium
  in which they exist.
  II. " On     Quinidine, aud some Double Tartrates of the Organic
         Bases."     By John Stenhouse, LL.D., F.R.S.                   Received
         February 23, 1863.
      Quinidine,   as is well known,     was   first  observed by Henry and
   Delondre, and likewise by Sertuerner, in what is called the            " quini
   dine" of commerce, which consists chiefly of          a mixture  of quinidine,
   quinine, and resinous matters obtained from the mother-liquors of
   the sulphate-of-quinine      manufacture.       Van Heijningen, however,
   was the first person who succeeded       in separating quinidine, which he
   called /3-quinine, from this mixture and in obtaining it in a pure and
   crystalline  state.   He likewise ascertained that quinidine           was  iso
   meric with quinine.       Its action on polarized light       was  studied by
   Pasteur, who observed that its solution in absolute alcohol produces
   deviation to the right, while a similar        solution of quinine produces
   rotation to the left (Buchardat).
       As comparatively few of the salts of quinidine have hitherto been
    analysed, and those chiefly by Van Heijningen,            I  was   induced to

 prepare a few more of them, and likewise                           to examine the action            of
 iodide  of ethyl upon the alkaloid itself. I am indebted for the
 quinidine which       I
                    employed for this purpose to Mr. John Elliott
 Howard of Stratford.              It   was perfectly white, and consisted                  of large,
 well-defined     crystals.        Before using         it,   however,       I    recrystallized     it
 out of alcohol.        The quinidine           gave    a     green colour with chlorine-
 water and ammonia,            and the solutions of its salts all exhibited                             a
 fluorescent power almost equal to that of quinine.                              A    solution   of its
 sulphate likewise             Herapath's so-called sulphate of iodo-
                            yielded
 quinidine, crystallizing in long quadrilateral prisms possessing deep                       a
 garnet-red      colour and the other well-known                        characters of that salt.
 *343 gramme       of pure quinidine, dried at 100°C,                        gave -9315 gramme

 and concentrated      ;     but   if    dilute or hot solutions                 be employed,       it
only crystallizes      out after some           time.         It   is   very insoluble      both in
cold and in hot water, but crystallizes                     from boiling dilute hydro
chloric acid in brilliant but irregularly-formed                        crystals, which decom
posed when heated to about 200°                  C,     evolving            a   peculiar aromatic
odour somewhat resembling that of hawthorn.                                 7485 gramme of this

metallic platinum.   This corresponds to 26*66 per cent.

noidine for this purpose, Gerhardt                  supposes that he operated on
a   mixture of the three isomeric alkaloids, quinidine, quinicine, and
quinine.
    Quinidine Gold-salt,           C40D31N2O4, 2H CI                +   2   Au Cl3.— The gold-

 tion of the above       salt in the form of minute needles.           These were
 thrown on     a filter and thoroughly washed with cold water, in which
 they are   scarcely at all soluble. The compound was then recrystallized
 from hot water slightly acidulated with nitric acid ; after filtration it
 separates, on cooling, in beautiful silky needles, which, on being freed
 from the mother-liquor and dried between bibulous paper, have
 almost the lustre of metallic silver, such as is produced on igniting
 its organic     salts.    It   partially decomposes every time it is re-
 crystallized,   but much more       so when    spirit is substituted for water,

    •401'gramme of the salt, dried at 100°, gave -115 chloride            of silver,

—On mixing solutions of hydrochlorate of quinidine and chloride of
mercury, the above         salt is precipitated    as a white powder.         It  is
slightly soluble in cold water, much more so in hot, especially when
acidulated with hydrochloric acid; but it cannot be conveniently
crystallized from this menstruum, as it sometimes separates in resinous
masses.
    By far the best solvent from which to crystallize is boiling alcohol,
in which it is readily soluble, separating in nacreous scales as the
solution cools.       It fuses at 100° under water, but not when dry.

A    moderately strong solution of chloride of zinc, containing a slight
excess    of hydrochloric acid, is poured into          an alcoholic solution    of
quinidine, when the double salt precipitates              as a granular  powder.
It   is very  slightly soluble either in hot or in cold water, but dissolves
readily in dilute hydrochloric acid and in spirit of 50 per cent., from
which latter it crystallizes in a form very similar to that variety of
carbonate of lime known as "dog-tooth" spar.
    The specimen analysed          was  crystallized from dilute hydrochloric
acid and dried at 100°.         -447 gramme gave -4825 gramme chloride
of silver, equal to -1193 of chlorine.           This corresponds to 26-7 per
cent. of chlorine.        The formula C40H21NaO4, 2HCl+2ZnCl re
quires 26-65 per cent.
     Basic    Chloride-of-Zinc Salt, C40HMN2O4,              H Cl+ZnCl.— The
neutral salt described above          appears to lose a portion of its hydro
chloric acid and chloride of zinc after repeated crystallizations.               A
solution of the salt so treated deposits, upon slow evaporation,
crystals     of considerable      size, consisting    of hexagonal    plates   and
prisms.
     After drying at      100°,  these were submitted to analysis; the zinc
 and quinidine were precipitated         together by carbonate of soda,        and
 after washing well with water, the quinidine was removed by boiling
 alcohol   ;  the residuary oxide of zinc was then again washed with
 water, and ignited in the usual way.
       -7335 gramme of the salt yielded -0680 gramme of oxide              of zinc,
  equivalent to -05456 of metallic zinc, or 7-44 per cent.

  almost insoluble in cold, but comparatively soluble in hot water,
  from which it crystallizes again on cooling.            After being purified by
  two recrystallizations     and dried at   1 00°, it was submitted to analysis.
      :206 gramme gave -502 carbonic acid and -133 water;               this corre

     Pier ate of Quinidine. — Quinidine dissolves in          a boiling and not
 too concentrated solution of picric acid       ; but it  separates   on cooling,
 not in crystals,    but as a resinous mass.          When dissolved in hot
 alcohol,   it is deposited by evaporation of the solution in resinous
 nodules, thus     very closely    resembling     the   corresponding     salt of
 quinine.
    Action of Iodide of Ethyl      on   Quinidine. — Iodide of ethyl attacks
 quinidine    very readily,  so that    if the two substances (the former
being in excess) be heated together in a flask furnished with a per
forated cork and long tube to condense the iodide of ethyl, com
bination quickly ensues, and in half an hour the reaction is complete.
Water is then added and the        excess   of iodide distilled off, the residue
dissolved in dilute alcohol, filtered, and allowed to crystallize.            On
cooling,    the solution    becomes     semisolid,   from    separation   of the
iodide of ethyl-quinidine in the form of long silky needles.               These
are well washed     with cold water, in which they       are almost insoluble,
and then recrystallized      from boiling dilute spirit, washed, dried at

 On treating the foregoing iodide with chloride of silver the chlo

 solution   and iodide of silver.      The latter is separated by filtration,
 and the solution, now free from iodine, is precipitated by the addition
of bichloride     of platinum.     The platinum-salt      separates   as a pale-
yellow powder, almost insoluble         either in hot or in cold water, and
but sparingly soluble in boiling dilute hydrochloric acid, from which
it  separates   almost completely on cooling.

      The double tartrate of quinidine and antimony was very carefully
  examined for potassa by precipitating the antimony by means of
  sulphuretted hydrogen ; it then left no perceptible residue on igni

    In order to confirm this view of the composition of the salt, some
acid tartrate of quinidine was prepared by taking a solution of tartaric
acid, dividing it equally into two portions, neutralizing          the one with
quinidine,    and then    adding the     other.     This    solution   was then
boiled for some hours with excess of freshly-precipitated               oxide of
antimony, filtered, and allowed to cool, when the same beautiful salt
made its appearance, identical in all its properties with the compound
formed by boiling tartar-emetic with quinidine.
    It will  be  obvious from these       results  that tartar-emetic,      when
boiled with quinidine, undergoes a somewhat singular and unexpected
decomposition, neutral tartrate of potassa and the double tartrate of
quinidine and antimony being formed, while one-half of the antimony
of the original salt is precipitated    as oxide.     From this and the sub
sequently to be described double tartrates,          the tersulphide     of anti
mony which is precipitated has a light yellow or pale orange colour,
and, after being long washed with boiling water, still contains some
of the   base, probably    in the  state   of a salt.     This portion     of the
alkaloid    may, however, be abstracted from the tersulphide of anti
mony by digesting      it with hot alcohol.
    In order to confirm      the fact that the compound contained quini
dine and not an altered base, as it may be observed from the analyses
given above that the carbon in the double tartrates is somewhat too
high, the antimony was removed from a portion of the salt by means
of sulphuretted hydrogen, the base precipitated by ammonia, well
washed with water, and crystallized out of spirit       ;  it was then obtained
with the usual crystalline form assumed by quinidine, viz. 4-sided
 prisms, and gave the characteristic reaction with chlorine-water and

   The authors had previously stated that meconin, opianic acid, and
hemipinic acid were all decomposed by boiling concentrated hydriodic
acid, with evolution of iodide of methyl.          They now find that hydro
chloric acid acts similarly on  these   bodies, evolving with each of them
chloride of methyl.     They suggest the name hypogallic acid for the
acid C7  H6 0*, formed by the action of hydriodic acid on hemipinic
acid*, in order to recall the fact of its containing       one atom of oxygen
less than gallic acid,  C H3 G3.      They obtained the       same product   by
the prolonged action    of hydrochloric acid on hemipinic acid        ; but by
a shorter action an intermediate product           was obtained, which,      ac
cording to a single analysis, appears to contain C3 He ©'.

   This substance is an acid of much greater stability than hypogallic
acid; it crystallizes in long, thin, transparent prisms, which are
anhydrous,    and are almost insoluble in cold water, slightly soluble
in boiling water, but dissolve more readily in alcohol and ether.            At

to 245°     without melting or becoming coloured              ; it dissolves in strong
sulphuric acid, and is precipitated unaltered on addition of water. It
gives no coloration with sesquichloride of iron ; with nitrate of silver
it gives   a white     precipitate which slowly blackens on boiling.                  Its
formation from hemipinic            acid may be expressed by the equation

 of free hydrochloric acid.        Alkalies, or alkaline carbonates or sul
 phites,   throw down from the aqueous or acid solution an orange-
 coloured granular      precipitate   (cotarnamic acid?) free from hydro
 chloric acid  ; this precipitate    dissolves in excess of alkali, giving a
 solution which quickly becomes dark brown by exposure to air ; with
 hydrochloric acid, it regenerates the original crystalline compound ;
it dissolves slightly in water, with a bright orange colour that is visi
ble even in very dilute solutions.          The slightly acidulated solution
of the hydrochlorate       is pale yellow when pure, but acquires a deep-
green colour in the air.       A  few drops of nitric acid added to a hot
 solution cause it to appear of an opake crimson colour by reflected
 light, though the liquid is still transparent when examined by trans
mitted light.      Nitrate of silver added in quantity more than sufficient
to precipitate    the chlorine    is quickly reduced.         The compound ac
quires a fine crimson      colour when evaporated nearly to dryness on
the water-bath, with a slight excess of dilute sulphuric acid.
    Hydriodic and diluted sulphuric acids decompose cotarnine at a
high temperature in the same way as hydrochloric acid. The products
so formed have not been isolated, but were converted                  into hydro-
chlorate of cotarnamic acid.
    The authors conclude by offering some suggestions towards the
interpretation of the results they have obtained.                Only the most
important points discussed by them will            be  briefly indicated here.
    They suppose that when opianic acid is converted into meconin
by the action of nascent hydrogen, or into meconin and hemipinic
acid by the action of potash *, a substance containing            C10  H" GJ may
possibly    be the immediate      product of the reaction, and that this
body — bearing the same relation to meconin that glycol, C2 H6 Ga, does
to oxide of ethylene,       C H4 0,    or mannite,      C' Hu G°,   to mannitan,
Ci   H12 G5 — may    give rise to meconin         by subsequent loss of the
elements of water.        Making this supposition,          the two reactions in
question may be represented by the equations

     and may be regarded as supporting             the views of Berthelot,       who has
     suggested that opianic acid ought to be classed as an aldehyde rather
      than as a true acid.
         With regard to the constitution of hemipinic acid, the authors
      suppose that it may be a dimethylized derivative of a bibasic but
     tetratomic acid, C1 H3 O" (analogous to tartaric acid,               C H° G°),   the
      two atoms of methyl occupying              the places of the two atoms of hy
      drogen, which, though           outside the radical,    are incapable      of being
     replaced by metals          : hemipinic   acid would    thus be comparable to
     Wurtz's ethyllactic acid, the body at           one time described by      Butlerow
     as valerolactic acid.
         An analogy is further pointed out between the derivatives of malic
     acid and the substances obtained from cotarnine.                 This analogy    be

      II.  Postscript to a Paper read January 15, 1863,                  "On    the For
             mation of Fibrin from Albumen."                By Alfred Hutchison
             Smee,     Jun. Communicated           by Alfred Smee, Esq., F.R.S.
             Received March 2, 1863.
         Since the paper was read before the Royal Society the following
      additional     facts have been elicited.          Fibrin   was obtained       from

                                                 506                                 [March     26,~
serum when subjected to oxygen gas, when acetic acid was added to
it,   although        another    portion      of the        same    serum had refused             to
yield     it   without that addition.             In    this experiment         the acetic acid
should be added until the serum                        is   either neutral, or produces           a
slightly acid reaction on test-paper.                       Care must be taken in these
experiments to prevent the temperature rising too high, for                             a   coagu
lation then takes place.              If    blood-cells be present in the serum, the
addition of acetic acid attacks the cells in preference to the alkalies
of the serum         ;   and on subsequent exposure to              a    temperature of 100°
F. during the period            it   is   under the influence of oxygen, the whole
is   transformed into        a   semisolid mass.
     It   is   a   curious fact that serum which has been placed on                         a   dia-
lyser for the removal of the salts by Graham's                           method was not im
proved in its power of producing                   fibrin, over serum which had not
been      submitted        to that treatment previous                to its oxidation.          On
the other hand, albumen purified from salts by Graham's                                  method,
and then subjected to the influence of oxygen,                          j    ielded the largest
amount of fibrin.            By this method        it   is   most probable that        I    should
have been able to have transformed                      the whole of the albumen into
fibrin, had not          an accident unfortunately             brought the experiment to
a   termination.          Nevertheless, although the experiment was not con
tinued long,         half the albumen was changed into fibrin.
     When experimenting upon albumen nearly free from alkalies and
alkaline salts, great care must be taken to keep the temperature as
low as possible.         I   found that      a   temperature between 80° and 90°                 F.
was the best, for above 98° the albumen had                          a   very great tendency
to coagulate.
  When albumen was placed in    tube which contained about an
                                                  a
equal bulk of oxygen, and in which    platinized platinum wire
                                                             a
had been inserted extending the whole length of the tube, to facili
tate the action of the oxygen on the albumen, and which tube was
subsequently sealed and placed in                  a    water-bath of 98°            F., no fibrin
made its appearance even after the lapse of 36 hours,                                  but in its
place     a    small quantity of an amorphous                     material    subsided to the
bottom of the tube.               When, however,              a   tube of similar        size was
filled with albumen having                  free access to the air, and then placed
on the same water-bath                for    an equal length          of time, on the sur
face of the albumen which this tube contained                                small     masses     of

fibrin were formed, which had         an appearance identical   with that of
blood-fibrin under the microscope, giving a conclusive proof to my
mind that, during the formation of fibrin by the action of oxygen on
albumen,      a volatile  constituent   is formed and carried off by the
excess    of oxygen which    passes  into the albumen in solution.
    The following are the chief physical and chemical properties of
the fibrin artificially formed by the action of oxygen on albumen : —
    It has a lighter specific gravity than albumen, being always found
floating on the surface of the albumen, provided it is free and not en
tangled or attached to the side of the vessel or platinized        platinum
wire that has been inserted in the albuminous solution.
    It  has a fibrinated appearance under the microscope, and is ca
pable of being teased out into filaments in the same manner as blood-
fibrin.
    Acetic acid completely dissolves it after     some time.
    Soda and potash cause      it to swell up and dissolve.    Concentrated
solution of ammonia, after the lapse of some hours, causes the fibrin
to swell up in a gelatinous       mass, similar to that which occurs when
blood-fibrin     is submitted to the same reagent.
    A  hot or cold solution of nitrate of potash does not dissolve it
 when    it is digested in that menstruum for some hours.
     With Millon's test it becomes of a brick-red colour.
     With nitric acid a bright yellow colour became visible.
     Fibrin heated with hydrochloric acid gave a blue colour, and sub
 sequently dissolved, giving a blue tint to the liquid.
     An acid solution of acetate of lead caused both blood-fibrin and
  fibrin artificially prepared to swell up and     become   translucent after
 digestion for a certain period.
  III. " On      Diffusion of Vapours     : a means  of distinguishing be
         tween apparent and real Vapour-densities of Chemical
         Compounds."        By J. A. Wanklyn and J. Robinson, Esq.

 is heated is not necessarily the vapour-density of that chemical com

pound     ;    sometimes it is only the mean density of the products                              of
decomposition.              Some of the best-known substances, such as hydrated
sulphurous acid, ammoniacal salts, and pentachloride                             of phosphorus,
suffer decomposition                 when       they are vaporized,       and     thus have an
apparent vapour-density,                     which is in reality nothing more than the
mean density of the products of their decomposition.
   We recognize such                 cases — in      which the apparent is not the real
vapour-density— by making a diffusion-analysis of the vapours.
This method of solving questions of the kind was proposed by one
of us two years ago*. In carrying it out practically,                            it was resolved
from the first not to diffuse through a porous diaphragm,                                 but to
recur to Graham's                  original    method, namely, to let our vapours                dif
fuse through a simple aperture or through a short tube.
   Independently                of the experimental difficulties           attending     the use
of a porous diaphragm              high temperatures, there is a fatal objec
                                        at
tion to       it,   founded upon the inconclusiveness of the results obtained
in such       a     way.
  Our resolve to avoid porous substances was not by any means
shaken by Pebal's memoirf on the diffusion of chloride-of-ammo-
nium vapour through asbestos                     ;   for what    is   more likely than that       a
finely-divided silicate                 (a    salt of an acid of indefinite           capacity    of
saturation)          should decompose                ammoniacal       salts at elevated tem
peratures       ?

                                                                   is

given by Frankland in his research upon the isolation of ethyl (see Quart.
Journ. Chem. Soc. vol. ii. p. 285, 1850). After describing his diffusion-apparatus
and its use in the case of ethyl, Frankland proceeds,

almost every case be employed with advantage to determine whether or not any
specimen of gas be simple or mixed."

 sphere of dry air, or other suitable gas, is kept constantly renewed
 by the transmission of a slow stream of gas, which enters the upper
 flask by the narrow tube above, and passes out by the space between
 the two necks, which, as we have said, do not fit air-tight.           When
in   use, the whole apparatus     is kept at a temperature above the con-
 densing-point of the Tapour by means of an air-bath.
     After  a diffusion   has gone on for a sufficient length of time the
 apparatus is allowed to cool, and the contents of the lower flask are
analysed, by which means it is seen whether diffusion has effected
any alteration in the composition of the vapour.
    We have used a lower flask of about 500 cubic centimetres capa
city, with a mouth 10 millimetres        in diameter;   the capacity of the
upper flask was 100 cubic centimetres.
    The first substance taken for experiment     was sulphuric    acid, which
is converted at high temperatures into vapour of sulphuric anhydride
and vapour      of water.    Inasmuch   as vapour of water   is lighter than
vapour     of sulphuric anhydride,       the former   should   diffuse   more
rapidly than the latter.         Accordingly, the residue after diffusion
should be richer in sulphuric anhydride than the acid before diffusion.

    Laplace's formula gives the same result.
    As the British highlands do not      exceed 5000 feet   in altitude, and
lie near the parallel of 56° north latitude, the corrections will nearly
destroy each other.       The following   simple rule will therefore suffice
for calculating all British heights    :—
    "Multiply the difference of the barometers by 524, and divide
the product by the sum of the barometers, retaining three decimal
places.    Multiply this quotient by the sum of the temperatures of
the air increased by 836, and divide the product by 9, keeping one
decimal place.       For aneroid and corrected mercurial barometers, the
quotient is the height in English feet.       For uncorrected barometers,
subtract  2\  times the difference of the temperatures of the mercury."

   The height by Laplace's formula is 3110-8, by levelling 3115-8.
The accuracy of the present formula is only intended to be           tested by
Laplace's, and it will be wrong to at least the same extent.

        Communicated by Sir J. F. W. Herschel, Bart. Received
        March 16, 1863.
                                     (Abstract.)
    This paper consists of two parts, viz. : —
    1 . On the precautions necessary in ozone observations, and            on cer
tain corrections requisite before the actual amount can be determined.
    2. The discovery of dry ozone powders as a substitute for the ordi
nary tests    ;   an investigation   into the ozone paper tests of      M. Schon-
bein and Dr. Moffat, the determination of a proper formula for the
tests, with an account       of various observations and experiments         made
on the subject.
                                       Part I.
    At   the last Meeting      of the British Association      I  read a paper on
the precautions and corrections requisite in order that a more perfect
 knowledge of ozone might be obtained.             These precautions comprise
 uniformity of observation, each observer using the            same box and     the
 same tests, suspended at the same height, and as nearly as possible
 placed under         the same circumstances.       The corrections necessary
 are: — 1st, For the velocity of the air; 2nd, for the height of the
 barometer ; 3rd, for temperature ; 4th, for the hygrometrical state
 of the air     ;  5th, for elevation above the ground.
     1.   Velocity of the Air. — The greater the           speed the more ozone
 will   be apparent, and this seems to be owing more to the increased
 velocity of the air than to a greater proportion           of ozone.
     2. Height       of the Barometer. — It is found that during the last
  four years,
     With the barometer        at 28 5 inches the amount       of  ozone was 5*7
            It           tt        *"      It           II           II       3*5
             •>          a         "J%     n            tt           11       2*0

  A   law as regards ozone and pres sure is clearly apparent            ; but as the
  barometer       falls for wind, the excess     at low pressures is no doubt
  partly due to the increased velocity of the air. There is more ozone
   with the wind between W.S.W. and S.S.E. than when between

N.N.W. and E.N.E., and the barometer is half an inch lower with
S.W. winds than with N.E. winds.
   3. Temperature — Temperatures            between 30° and 40° will give
less ozone than when between 40° and 50°, and the latter less than
when between 50° and 60°.           The    same holds good when the ozone
box is artificially warmed.      This   does not extend to very       high tem
peratures,  because    the great dryness of hot weather is against the
action of ozone on the tests.
   4. Moisture. — Increase of moisture up to a certain point is
favourable to the colouring of the tests, beyond which it operates
unfavourably    ; for when the air   is completely saturated     with moisture,
the effect of ozone is at its minimum.
   5. Altitude.   — The higher    the test is hung the darker will be the
colour obtained.       The difference     is as 4 to 6 between 4 feet        and
35 feet above the ground.
   There  are yet several other circumstances to be mentioned            : —
    1. Hour of the Day. —The difference between the              ozone readings
at night and in the daytime      are —
              In   June and   July  an excess at night      of 0- 1
              In   August and September             „          0-4
              In   October and November             „          0*5
              In   December and January              „         0-8
              In   February and March                „         0*7
              In   April and May                     „         0-7
the average    excess   of the summer        months    being only one-half of
that which occurs in winter,
   2. Direction     of the Wind. — There is most ozone with the wind
between S. and S.W., and least when between               N. and N.E.
   3. Protection     of the test  from light. — It       is absolutely requisite
that the test should    be  in a dark box      ; and no box has been found
to answer so well as that constructed by myself, and known                     as
 " Lowe's Ozone box,"      an account    of which has     been furnished   to the
Royal Society* and to the British Association.               This box, if freely
exposed, and made to veer with the wind, so as always to present the
opening to the direct current, is everything that could be desired.
   The foregoing observations will be sufficient to show that precau
tions are requisite in these records, and that certain corrections are

necessary before we can declare whether ozone is present                         in   a certain
fixed amount, or whether it changes from hour to hour.                      These correc
tions have yet to be found out         ;   those for the height       of the barometer
and the force and direction of the wind will                  be considerable.
                                           Part II.
  The         ozone tests     heretofore used have appeared to me to be un
satisfactory, and, on close examination,              I   found them to          be   faulty in
many respects.              The paper used had        a glaze      upon    it,   which       pre
vented the solution from penetrating                it;   substances,      moreover, had
been used in its manufacture                which acted injuriously on the tests.
Again, the starch of commerce was found to be impure                        ;    it   is   manu
factured with lime, sulphuric acid, and chlorine, substances fatal to
these       tests.       The iodide of potassium      was       also impure   ;       and there
has been        a    want of uniformity in the proportions of starch and iodide
of potassium employed by different observers.
   Having found out that the starch of commerce                      was impure,        I    pro
cured   jar of wheat-starch in the wet state before any chemicals
            a
had been used.   This was steeped in distilled water, which was
changed every two days until quite sweet to the taste, and, although
 by   a   long process, a chemically pure starch was thus obtained.
      Sir John Herschel          suggested trying other vegetable starches                   ; I
therefore made starch from rice, potato, sago, and wheat.
 I      obtained chemically pure iodide of potassium from                        Mr. Squire
of Oxford Street, who forwarded                me two samples made expressly for
these        experiments, the one prepared with water, the other crystal
lized several times from alcohol.
      On the recommendation of Dr. R. D. Thomson,                        15 grains         of pre
pared chalk have been added to each ounce of air-dried starch to
prevent         it   from becoming sour from any moisture that might be con
tained in        it  ;   subsequent observations have proved that this                  is   abso
lutely requisite for uniformity of effect, as the intensity of action
depends upon the amount of water contained in the starch, which                                    is
 apparent from the following experiment               :   —
      Tests made with air-dried starch —
      a. Without further drying became coloured in                   5    minutes.

 in   7     minutes.

     y. After further drying by fire-heat for            3 minutes became coloured

     7j.  With chalk added became coloured in 20 minutes.
     With regard to the calico or paper used for the tests, both stained
 when impure.            However, Mr. Joseph Sidebotham of the Strine
 Works prepared for            me some chemically       pure calico, and     I  was also
 enabled to procure a very porous chemically                    pure paper, both of
 which answer perfectly.
     Having     succeeded       with the   ozone   slip tests,    I tried as a first ex
 periment a mixture of 10 parts of starch to                 1 of iodide of potassium
 as a
          " dry-powder      test ;" this, when well mixed in a mortar, was
 bottled ready for use.            A small portion was placed in the open air,
 and ten minutes'         exposure showed that powder tests were an un
 doubted success, being more sensitive than the test slips.                     My next
 determination was what strength would colour quickest, and accord
 ingly    a number      of strengths were prepared, varying in the propor
 tions from     1  of iodide of potassium and 1 of starch up to 1 of iodide
 of potassium and 30 of starch, the starch used being made from
 wheat.       From these experiments it was found that the proportion of
  1 of iodide of potassium          to 5  of starch    was invariably     the darkest,
the degree        of darkness diminishing in either direction when other
strengths were used          ;  thus  1  of iodide of potassium to 4£ of starch,
or    1  to 5£, were neither so       dark as with a strength of 1 to 5.
     On repeating        these experiments         with potato-starch,         the   pro
portion      that coloured       soonest  was   1 to  2\  ;   and this second series
of experiments proved that with                each   starch a special formula          is
requisite.
    My next experiments were with the view of ascertaining the                     effect
of various acids and chemical substances on the ozone powder tests.
For this purpose I procured a number of cups for solutions, and small
pill-boxes     to hold the powder tests, and these were placed together
under separate         bell-glasses.       The result       was   that the    following
coloured      the powder tests very         rapidly : — Hydrochloric       acid, nitric
acid, nitrous      acid, chloride      of lime, phosphorus, iodine (in scales),

                                     522                            [April 16,
iodine (dissolved in alcohol), carbonate of iron on which sulphuric
acid was poured, carbonate of iron on which glacial acetic acid was
poured, limestone on which sulphuric acid was poured, limestone on
which glacial acetic acid was       poured,    matches lighted under the
bell-glasses.   The following did not colour the          tests : — Sulphuric
acid, glacial acetic acid, carbonate of lime, carbonate of iron, am
monia, matches not lighted.
    The substances used in the manufacture of ordinary starch of com
merce gave the following     : —
    Chloride of lime coloured the    tests instantaneously.
    Sulphuric acid did not colour the tests.
    Lime did not colour the tests.
    Lime and sulphuric acid mixed coloured the        tests  rapidly.
    There are advantages in the powders over the ordinary tests.         They
 are more sensitive, and therefore more      rapidly acted upon     ; they re
 tain their maximum colour, not afterwards fading, as with the tests
 of Schonbein and Moffat.        (However,    my calico and porous-paper
 tests are not nearly so liable   to fade, owing to the solution penetra
 ting into the fabric used, instead of being merely a surface-covering.)
 There is also a more important advantage still to be mentioned from
 the use of powders.      By the aid of powder tests we shall ascertain
 what colours the tests   ; in the experiments it was found that a dif
 ferent colour was imparted to the powder, and that the colour pene
 trated deeper with some substances and acids than with others, so
 that differences of effect took place, from which the different mate
 rials used might be recognized.       Thus  : —
     1. Iodine, although coloured    a brown-black,    was merely a surface
  colouring, below the powder remained colourless.
     2. Phosphorus,   bluish black on the surface only, below almost
  colourless.
     3. Chloride of lime, deep brown on the surface only,          the powder
  below slightly yellow.
     4. Hydrochloric acid, grey-pink on the surface only, the powder
  beneath orange.
     5. Nitric acid, dark-red brown extending slightly into the powder,
  beneath that colourless.
     6.  Carbonate of iron with glacial acetic acid, yellowish brown to
  the thickness of cardboard, below that buff.

     7.   Limestone with sulphuric acid, pale brown to the thickness of
cardboard, beneath slightly coloured.
    8. Carbonate of iron with sulphuric acid, black to the depth of a
 quarter of an inch.
     9. Nitrous acid, dark brown          more than the eighth         of an inch
 deep, beneath yellowish brown.
     10.    Nitric acid mixed with exposed ozone powder, blue-black to
 the sixth of an inch deep, below that reddish brown.
     1 1.  Nitric acid mixed with unexposed ozone powder, blue-black
 to the sixth of an inch deep, below that reddish brown.
     These experiments may require some modification,              yet they point
 out the fact that striking differences         are apparent,   differences which
 must open up a new method of investigating ozone.
     Not only have the      tests  hitherto  used been made without due re
 gard to the pureness of the chemicals and fitness of the material
 used, but the paper box in which they have been kept is not sufficient
 for their perfect preservation      ; a dark, dry,    air-tight box is essential ;
 and this should not be opened in a room                  where there is iodine,
 chlorine,     nitric acid, phosphorus,     hydrochloric acid, or other che
 micals likely to be injurious to the tests.       I am now manufacturing      the
 tests, which     will be distributed by Messrs.      Negretti and Zambra, and
 I  have constructed a      proper box in which in future they will be sent.

    In treating the equations of rotation of          a solid body about a fixed
point, it is usual to employ the principal axes of the body as the
moving system of coordinates.             Cases,    however, occur in which it
is advisable to employ other systems          ;   and the object of the present
paper is to develope the fundamental formulae of transformation and
integration for any system.

remarquer      pendant son absence,          mais de le prévenir       sans  retard.
En effet, le 28 mars le terrassier Vasseur vint lui dire que quelque
chose ressemblant à un os paraissait dans le banc.
    " Rendu     sur les lieux,      M.  de Perthes     trouve le terrain     comme
l'avait dit Vasseur.        L'extrémité     de  l'os enfermé dans      sa gangue se
montrait d'environ deux centimètres.
     " Voulant l'avoir     entier,   M.  de Perthes fit, à l'aide d'une pioche,
 dégager les alentours et, à sa grande satisfaction,            il put le retirer du
 banc sans le rompre.

     The particulars        I  have now to communicate                  as the result         of my
 own personal examination               should,     I  think, most completely satisfy
 any unprejudiced person that, on the one hand, the specimen cannot
 have been a        "plant" contrived by the workman, and, on the other,
 that   it could not have found its way into the bed in which it                                  was
 discovered by any disturbing                  agency subsequent to the original
 deposition of that bed .
                                 *
     When M. Boucher de Perthes had the kindness to place in my
 hands this precious fragment — which consists of the right half of
 the lower jaw,          containing      three teeth —       I   was immediately             struck
 with its almost black colour, its solidity,                   and its weight         :  all these
 peculiarities (which are in marked contrast to the characters of the
 bones ordinarily found in these gravel-pits) being obviously due to
 one    and the same cause,              viz. metallic      (ferruginous?)           infiltration.
 The ordinary flints, and the flint implements obtained from the same
 deposit, several of which are in the museum of M. de Perthes, are
 all of them characterized by               a like depth of ferruginous tint, which
 is not seen      in any of those taken from any other part of the same
 pit, or from any other gravel-pit yet opened in the neighbourhood
 of Abbeville.
     As to the anatomical characters of this jaw,                         I  should not wish,
 without       a more careful        comparative         examination         of the specimen
 than    I had the opportunity           of making, to give any decided opinion                      ;
 but my impression is that they differ very decidedly from those of
 the same bone in any race at present inhabiting Western Europe.
    * I think it right to leave my original statement as the record of the impression
 which was made not only upon myself, but upon other more competent observers,
 by the first examination of the specimen iu question, which was limited to its ex
ternal characters.       Its colour has been subsequently proved to be due to the ad
hesion of a thin layer of the ferruginous matrix, which adhered closely to its sur
face, and yet could be readily washed          off, leaving the bone         but slightly stained.
The impression of solidity was produced by the density of the               bone itself ; the lower
jaw being the densest bone in the body next to the petrous                  portion of the tem
poral bone, and having in aged subjects an almost ivory-like                 hardness.     The im
pression    of  weight  was  not  really produced     by  metallic   infiltration,  as  was   at first
supposed,     but   was  partly  due  to  a want   of adequate    allowance     for the   density   of
the bone itself, and partly to the adhesion, on one side, of a good deal of the ma
trix, which has been found to contain as much as 12 per cent* of oxide of iron ;
and it may also have been in part subjective, arising from a preconception,                      sug
 gested   by the   general  appearance     of the  bone,  that  it had   undergone      infiltration.
The colour of the flint implements said to have been found in the same deposit,
 has proved to be removable by washing ; whilst some of the ordinary flints are
 stained by real ferruginous infiltration.      — June    15, W. B. C.

 I  was struck   with the thickness of the bone, the great breadth of
 the ascending ramus, but especially with the extraordinary breadth
and depth of the groove between the ramus and alveolar border, in
 which   I could almost lay my little finger.           The jaw would appear
 to be that    of  a person advanced      in life ;  and the tooth originally
found, which very probably belonged to the other half of the same
jaw,   seemed    to me to have been       " endommagee "       by caries during
life rather than by subsequent violence.

     M. Boucher     de Perthes had the kindness          to give me the accom
 panying sketch of the specimen        ;  and   I can testify to the accuracy
 of its representation of the general form of the bone.
     On Tuesday morning I repaired, in company with M. Boucher
  de  Perthes,    to the gravel-pit    of Moulin-Quignon ; in which he
  showed me, as nearly as he     could, the situation in which this most
 interesting relic had been found.        Unfortunately there had occurred,
  a few days previously to my visit, a slip of the overlying strata, by
  the debris of which the exact spot was covered ; but a part of the
  same deposit was visible at a horizontal          distance of a yard or two,
  so that   I  could indubitably verify its position and its general cha
  racters.    This deposit, distinguished from every other by the ex
  treme depth of its ferruginous tint (which corresponds exactly to
  that of the bone), lies at the very bottom of the pit, in immediate
  contact   with the subjacent chalk, as shown in the accompanying
  representation of the section (also kindly given to me by M.
  Boucher de Perthes), to the general accuracy of which I can bear
  the most explicit testimony.       I   myself took away from this deposit
  some specimens      of the small rounded flints which it contains, and
   which will   serve to show you   this peculiar tint.

of doubt    as   to the truly fossil character of this bone.  Its peculiar

long buried in the deposit from which its metallic impregnation                                            has
been derived      *.
   That   it     could not have found its way into that deposit                                   in    any
other mode than             by

superjacent strata, which are most regularly            superposed (as seen in
the accompanying section) to a depth of more than 1 5 feet.               This
complete regularity of superposition in the strata of the gravel-pits
of Moulin-Quignon has,         I  understand, been already verified by nu
merous experienced geologists, whose           testimony upon such a point
is of far higher value than mine        ; but it is so obvious that   I cannot
imagine the least doubt to remain in the mind of any intelligent
observer who may visit the locality and examine its condition               for
 himself,   of the jaw having been imbedded in the lowest stratum
 before the deposition of the superincumbent layers.
    I have further to point out, that as the gravel- bed of Moulin-
 Quignon is about        100 feet  above   the present level of the river, it
 corresponds     in position with the upper gravel of St. Acheul, not
 with the lower gravel of Menchecourt.            If, therefore, we accept the
 conclusions of     Mr. Prestwich    as to  the relative ages of these gravels,
 this human jaw was buried in the very oldest portion of the earliest
 of  these   fluviatile   deposits, and therefore dates      back to the very
 remotest period at which we have at present any evidence of the
 existence   of Man.

 printed in works specially devoted to these subjects.               It exhibits in
 curves the diurnal inequalities of terrestrial magnetism, as obtained
 by the use of instruments         essentially the same, through         the whole
 period of seventeen       years, during     the last ten years of which the
 magnetic indications have been automatically              recorded by photogra
 phic self-registration, on a system which has             been continued to the
 present time, and is still to be continued.
    From the last months of 1840        to the end     of 1847, the observations
 were made by eye, every two hours.              From the beginning of 1848,
 for the declination      and horizontal      force magnetometers, and from
 the beginning of 1849, for the vertical force magnetometer, the mag
 netic indications    are recorded by      Mr. Brooke's photographic appa
 ratus.
    In preparing the reductions of the magnetic records from 1848 to
 1857 (which are printed in the
                                       " Results of Magnetical and Meteoro
 logical Observations for 1859," bound in the volume of 'Greenwich
 Observations,'    1859, and also issued separately), the days of unusual
 magnetic disturbance had been separated from the rest, and the re
 ductions applied to the mass so diminished.                 For unity of plan, it
 appeared expedient to follow the same course for the reductions from
 1841 to 1847.       In  consequence     of this, the numbers which        are used
 here differ in some cases by small quantities from those printed in
 the 'Greenwich Magnetical Observations from 1841 to 1847.'                    The
 numbers in the reductions from            1848 to 1857 are adopted without
change.
    The author remarks that, taking the number of omitted days as a
 rough measure of the amount of magnetic disturbance, there is no
 appearance of decennial cycle in their recurrence, and no distinct re
lation to the magnitude of diurnal changes.
    The author then proceeds         to the description      of the curves.    The
first four sheets contain the curves in which the horizontal               abscissa
represents the declination       at each    hour    as compared    with the mean
for the twenty-four hours and the vertical ordinate represents the

vations at each nominal       hour through all the months January from
1841 to 1847 are       combined to form the January curve; all those
through the months February to form the February curve, and so
on.    On sheet IV. similar month-curves are formed from the period
1848 to 1857.       It  is remarked that the origin of coordinates neces
sarily represents the mean declination and          mean horizontal    force in
each month.
    The author then points out that the means for each month are
themselves subject to an annual inequality, which can be ascertained
with little difficulty.     The values of  these inequalities are exhibited,
for declination and horizontal force, separately for the period 1841 —
 1847 and for the period 1848-1857 ; those in the first period far
exceed    in magnitude those in the second        (as holds also  with regard
to all the diurnal inequalities).
    If we  wished to exhibit the hourly state of magnetism, as referred
to the mean state given by the supposition of uniform secular change
 of normal magnetism,        we ought to apply these quantities      with sign
 changed, to the origin of coordinates in each curve, in order to form
 a new origin    of coordinates.     For the year-curves, the numbers         de
 stroy each other, and no new origin of coordinates is produced            ;  for
 the month-curves,       however, they shift the origin     materially.      The
 author does not perceive that any facility for theoretical reference          or
 other advantage is gained by this step.
    On examining the year-curves, it is seen that from 1841 to 1848
 their magnitude very slowly increases, with a small change of form,
 but from    1 848 to 1857 their magnitude very rapidly diminishes, with
 a great change    of form.     Some great cosmical change seems to have
 come upon      the earth, particularly    affecting terrestrial   magnetism.
 On comparing these year-curves with the month-curves, especially
 with those for the period 1848-1857, it appears that the change of
 the year-curves     from    1848 to 1857 nearly resembles that of the
 month-curves     from summer to winter      ; and the author points out as
  a possible step to a physical    explanation of the change from 1848 to
  1857, that the magnetic action of the sun upon the earth's southern
  hemisphere may have remained nearly unaltered, while that on the
  northern hemisphere may have undergone a great diminution.
     The author then alludes        to the curves representing      the hourly

                                    532                             [April 23,
state  of vertical force,  as referred  to the mean on each day.             The
force is here represented by a simple         ordinate.     The grouping is
made by years and by months        in the  same   manner as for the curves
already mentioned.        The month-curves of the two periods (1841-
 1847 and 1848-1857) differ, in the magnitude and change of mag
nitude of the ordinates, and in the place and change of place of node.
The year-curves of the two periods have         some very remarkable          dif
ferences.    From 1847     to 1849 the magnitude       of the ordinates in
creases   sensibly;  from 1849    to 1850    still more; it then remains
nearly stationary.     In  1846 the descending node is at       1
                                                                  l-|h nearly ;
in 1847 it is at 9h nearly   ; in 1849  at 7h nearly    ; in 1850 at 5h ; in
1851 at 4h   ; and there it continues with little alteration.         It  is im
portant to observe that, though the instrument was changed in 1848,
the change in the place of the node did not then occur suddenly              ; it
had begun with the old instrument,        and continued      to advance gra
dually for several years with the new instrument.         The author states
that he had verified the correctness of the node in the first period
from other observations, but he had not succeeded in finding obser
vations corresponding in date with those of the latter period.

 II. "On        the direct Transformation           of Iodide of Allyle into
        Iodide of Propyle."       By Maxwell Simpson, M.B., F.R.S.
        Received    April 7, 1863.
    Iodide of allyle, as is well known, combines directly with two
 equivalents of metallic mercury, a well-defined crystalline compound
 being formed.      Would it be possible to make the same body com
bine with two equivalents of hydrogen,             and thus to open a direct
passage     from   the allylic to the       propylic     series     of compounds?
Indirectly this transformation has         been   already effected by M. Ber-
thelot through the intervention of propylene gas.
    In   order to determine     the above       point,   I  submitted      iodide  of
allyle to the action of hydriodic acid gas.            On passing this       gas into
the iodide, the latter became         strongly heated and black from the
liberation     of a large quantity of iodine.          As soon       as the gas was
observed to pass unabsorbed           through the liquid, the latter was
allowed to cool, and filtered through asbestos.                  It  was then deco
lorized by agitation     with   a dilute solution      of caustic potash, dried
over chloride of calcium, and distilled.            Almost the entire quantity
passed     over between 90° and 95° Cent.                 The portion distilling
 between 92° and 94° Cent.          I collected apart and analysed.              The
numbers obtained correspond           with the composition              of iodide of
propyle, as will be seen from the following table             : —

The specific gravity of the iodide is 1-73         at zero.
   In   order to satisfy myself that the body          I  had in my hands was
really an ether of propylic alcohol,          I  endeavoured to prepare that
alcohol    from it.    This  I succeeded     in doing in the following man
ner  : — About    60 grammes of the iodide were added to an equivalent
of oxalate of silver contained in       a flask surrounded         by water.     The
mixture     became   strongly heated from the violence of the reaction,
and the decomposition        was soon     complete.        It   was   then digested
with ether.       On submitting     the ethereal solution to distillation,          I
observed that, as soon as the ether had passed over, the thermometer

 rose rapidly to 186°, and that the entire liquid, previously dissolved
in the ether, distilled over between that temperature and 197° Cent.
 This was no doubt oxalate of propyle.             On heating this body in a
 retort with solid caustic potash,     I obtained a volatile distillate.     This
 I then dried over chloride         of calcium, and in order to        secure  its
 complete dehydration,      treated it with a small piece of sodium.          On
 re-distilling,  I  found that the entire liquid passed over between 83°
 and 88° Cent.        The portion distilling between 85° and 88° gave on
 analysis results corresponding with the formula of propylic alcohol,
 as will be seen on inspecting the following table : —

    By treating this body with iodine and phosphorus,             I succeeded in
 regenerating iodide of propyle.          This is a very ready method of
 preparing propylic alcohol when a large quantity is not required.

       Theory of Fractional          Distillation."       By  J. A. Wanklyn,
       Esq.        Communicated        by    Dr. Frankland.             Received
       April 17, 1863.
    There    are many points      in the boiling of mixtures which        are ob
 scure.    The tension of the vapours        at the temperature whereat the
mixture boils, and the proportions in which the constituents of the
mixture are present, are not the only factors which determine the
relative rates at which the constituents distil.             There have, for in
stance,   to be taken into account the adhesion of the liquids to one
another, and the vapour-densities of these liquids. On the present
occasion    I  have to call attention      to the influence of this latter ele
ment, which influence       seems    to have been lost sight of by most of
those who have applied themselves to this
                                                    subject.
   Leaving out of account for a moment the influence of adhesion,
and simplifying the influence of the proportion in which the
                                                                           ingre

1863.]                                 535
boiling-points,    we may set down the rates at which these ingredients
will distil as determined by the tensions         of the liquids and the den
sities of the vapours.        In the first instant of time the quantity of
each ingredient which distils will be found by multiplying its ten
sion at the boiling-point of the mixture           by its vapour-density.      It
thus appears that the liquid with the highest tension will not of
necessity distil the quickest, for what the other liquids want in ten
sion they may make up by the greater density of the vapours which
they give off.       And    so when we mix       a more volatile   with   a less
volatile liquid and proceed to distil the mixture, we shall now and
then find that the less volatile        liquid distils faster than the more
volatile one.      I will  here bring forward      an experiment   to illustrate
this point.
                                                          Vapour-density.
            Methyl-alcohol boils at 66° C                      1-107
            Iodide of ethyl boils at      72° C                5-397
I  took 18 grammes of methyl-alcohol            and 17 grammes of iodide       of
ethyl, mixed them, and distilled off rather more than one-third of the
mixture.      The distillate consisted of
                          6-0 grammes methyl-alcohol,
                          8-7 grammes iodide     of ethyl,
 which shows that in this        case the less volatile constituent had boiled
 the faster, the less       volatile iodide of ethyl     having  a very    much
 higher vapour-density than methyl-alcohol.
    It will be obvious that when the vapour-densities             and tensions
 are inversely proportional,       the mixture   must distil over unchanged.
 This influence of vapour-density goes a great way to explain why
 homologous bodies are so difficult of separation by means of frac
 tional distillation.     The more complex the formula the higher the
 boiling-point,   but also the higher the vapour-density, and therefore
 the greater the value of the vapour.          Why oils, &c. distil so readily
 in steam is also explained ; for aqueous vapour is one of the lightest,
 while oily vapours     are generally heavy.

        Received April 21, 1863.
                                  (Abstract.)
    The author,     after briefly   alluding   to   the    discoveries  of Fox
 Talbot, Wheatstone, Foucault, Kirchhoff, and Bunsen, and the im
 portance    of spectrum analysis, states that among the numerous
 spectroscopes which were exhibited in the International Exhibition
 of  1862,  there was one which had been           specially    constructed   by
 Messrs.   Spencer,   Browning,     and   Co.,    philosophical     instrument
makers in London, which at the time excited considerable attention.
This spectroscope had two prisms, with          a  magnifying power of 40,
its definition being remarkably clear.

 1863.]                                 537
    The skill evinced by Mr. Browning in the construction                  of this
 instrument    induced    the author     to have one made in which still
 better effects might be produced,           by multiplying the number          of
 prisms and increasing the magnifying             power, with the necessary
 precaution to avoid as much as possible loss of light.               After a few
 preliminary   trials, it was finally arranged to use nine prisms, which
is the number that can be applied with this instrument, although
 the arrangements are such as to allow the whole or any less number
 to be used with the utmost facility.
    Verniers   and micrometer       screws are attached to the knife-edges
 of the slit through which the light to           be observed is admitted       to
the collimator      and to the telescope,      also to the large circle of the
instrument   ;   these enable the observer to note the exact position           of
the lines observed in the spectrum from whatever source it is ob
tained, and thus enable him to repeat and verify previous                  results
with the utmost exactitude.
   When two small prisms,          one  refracting and the other reflecting,
are fixed outside the knife-edge          slit, spectra obtained from three
separate sources can be simultaneously examined            ; and an illuminated
micrometer     scale   enables  the observer to note the precise relative
position   of the lines in the three spectra without reference to or
reading off from the verniers.         By this arrangement a most interest
ing spectacle may be obtained, showing in the uppermost portion of
the field of view the spectrum of thallium, strontium,                or lithium,
ignited in the flame of a Bunsen's gas-burner            ;  in the centre of the
field  the   spectrum      of the    same    substance in the oxyhydrogen
blowpipe, and at the bottom one in the voltaic arc             ; each  successive
spectrum there exhibits an increased number of lines.
    With this spectroscope the author has ascertained that the green
line of thallium, so celebrated for its integrity, and hitherto believed
to coincide with one      of the lines in the spectrum of baryta,        does not
so coincide  ;  for by employing the nine prisms with a power of 80 on
the telescope, the thallium line is clearly seen to occupy a dark space
in the baryta spectrum, close by the side of the bright line with
which it was supposed to coincide.
    A range of prisms is adapted to the telescope, the highest of which,
when used in conjunction with the amplifying lens, gives a power of
 110  with good definition.

the time that has been devoted to, or the expense                     that has been

II.    The Bakerian Lecture. — " On the Direct Correlation of
        Mechanical and Chemical Forces."                     By Henry Clifton
        Sorby, F.R.S.            Received    April 29, 1863.
    Perhaps    it may   be   thought somewhat strange that a geologist should
undertake such a         subject as the correlation of forces ; but the very
fact of my being a geologist has led to the investigations                    of which
I   now purpose to give a short preliminary                 account.     In   studying
general chemical and physical            geology, and especially in examining
the microscopical         structure   of rocks,     I have    for a number of years
been greatly perplexed          with  a class  of facts which pointed both to         a
mechanical and to a chemical origin.              At first I attributed   them either
to a mechanical or a chemical action, or to the two combined                   ; but in
most cases no satisfactory explanation               could be given.        At length,
however, facts turned up which altogether precluded any supposition
not involving direct correlation         ;  for they most clearly indicated that
mechanical force had been resolved into chemical action in the same
way as, under other circumstances,                it may    be resolved into      heat,
electricity,   or  any other modification of force,          as so ably described by
                          '
Grove in his work            On the Correlation of Physical Forces.'
   The effect of pressure on the solubility of salts has already                  been
made the subject of speculation and experiment *, and a considerable
number of facts have been described, showing that pressure will more

 or less influence such chemical               actions as are accompanied by an
 evolution of gas, so that it may cause a compound to be permanent
 which otherwise would be^decomposed*; but the results were for the
 most part so indefinite and unconnected, or of such a character, that
 Mr. Grove         does not allude to the    direct production of chemical action
 from mechanical force.               That this      is,
                                                    however, extremely probable
 will   be evident to all who have considered the manner                           in which the
 various physical forces are correlated              ;     for   if   mechanical force can be
 produced by chemical action, why should not the converse be true                                ?
 In this    paper  I      shall endeavour to show that such                 is   really the fact,
 and that in some cases the mechanical equivalent of the chemical force
 may be determined.
     In   order to obtain the necessary great pressure,                  I   have made use of
a    modification        of the method employed by Bunsen                  ;     but instead of
filling the tubes         at the ordinary temperature              of the atmosphere and
then gently heating them for several hours,                  I    in the first instance filled
them      at   a   temperature       10° or 20°      C. lower,          so that   when finally
sealed up they contained considerably                    more liquid than they could
hold without pressure at the ordinary temperature of the atmosphere
at the time being   and thus, by its tendency to expand, this liquid
                           ;
and anything enclosed in the tube were subjected to                        a   very great pres
sure.     By keeping the tubes in various parts of the house, according
as    the weather varied,    have been able to maintain for several
                                 I
weeks or even months             a   pressure of, for instance, about 100 atmo
spheres, as measured by means                of   a      capillary- tube pressure-gauge
enclosed within the larger tube.               Since in all cases           I     had   a   second
tube which from first to last was treated precisely like the other,
pressure excepted,        I    have been able to determine the effect produced
by the pressure with very considerable accuracy — at all                           events so as
to leave no doubt whatever about the general facts.                               At    the same
time I    wish     it   to be understood that the results described below must
be looked upon only as approximations                    to the truth.

    I  will first call attention      to the well-known influence        of pressure on
the fusing-point        of various substances, since it is            a connecting   link
 between well-established            facts and those     I    am    about to describe.
Bunsen* and Hopkins              f  have shown that substances which expand
 when fused have their point of fusion raised by mechanical pressure                      ;
that is to say, since mechanical force must be overcome in melting,
 the tendency to melt must be increased by heat before that opposition
can be overcome         ;   and the pressure required to keep them solid at
any temperature above their natural point of fusion may be looked
upon as the mechanical representative of the force with which they
 tend to fuse at that temperature.                  Professor      W. Thomson     J   has
shown that, on the contrary, water, which expands in freezing, has
its point of fusion lowered by pressure             ; that is to say, since mecha
nical force must be overcome in crystallizing,                 crystallization  will not
take place under increased pressure unless the force of crystalline po
larity   be increased by reducing the temperature.                   Thus, calculating
from his experiments and from the known latent heat of ice, and
assuming that no heat is gained or lost by contact with external objects,
if we   had    1 part of ice and 100 of water at 0°               C,  and then applied
a pressure     of 103 atmospheres, the ice would, as            it were, dissolve in the
water, the whole would become liquid, and the temperature be reduced
to —-792°       C;    or, in other terms, at that temperature the tendency
to crystallize is exactly counterbalanced by that pressure.
    Now     I find that similar principles         hold true with respect to the
solubility of salts in water.           If, when they dissolve, the total bulk
increases, pressure reduces their             solubility   ;  whereas   if the bulk   de
creases, pressure makes them more soluble                ;   in other words, solution
or crystallization        is impeded       by pressure according         as mechanical
force must be overcome in dissolving or in crystallizing.

 class  of facts to  be taken into account,     I  shall base my conclusions on
 my own experiments.           The volume with which salts exist when in
 solution,   assuming that of the water to remain unchanged, varies
 greatly   in the    case  of different salts, and also according to the
 amount     in solution and the temperature.              Thus, taking sal-am
 moniac as an example, when there are 3 per cent. in solution the
 volume is as     if  it expanded 3*40 per cent. on dissolving; whereas
 when    25*55   per cent. are in solution, the expansion is 1 1 -36 per
 cent. ; and when nearly concentrated at about 13°               C,  an additional
 quantity expands on dissolving 15*78 per cent.             In  by far the greater
 number     of  cases,   however,   there is a contraction         on   dissolving,
and the amount gradually          diminishes    for each     additional   quantity
entering into solution,      so that the mean result is very different from
what occurs when the solution is dilute or nearly saturated.                  It  is
this contraction or expansion when         a small additional quantity is dis
solved in a nearly        concentrated solution      that must be taken into
account in the following calculations.
    In determining the influence of pressure on the solution of salts,             I
found it requisite to adopt somewhat different methods according to
the peculiarities of the salts.      In some   cases   I scaled  up in a saturated
solution portions      of the salt in clean, solid crystals, and determined
the effect   due to pressure from their loss in weight ; whereas in other
cases  I  sealed up solutions     containing   more salt than could be dis
solved at the temperature at which the experiments were made, and
determined the effect       of pressure from the difference in the weight
of the crystals deposited ; being of course careful to make allowance
for any difference in the amount of solution in the tube with pressure
and in that without,       and to avoid any error that might be produced
by   a different   temperature.      In   all cases   I  have had a tube with
pressure and another without,         treated from first to last in precisely
the same manner, and kept at exactly the same temperature, so that
pressure was the only difference       ;  and usually the effect was so well
marked that there was no doubt about the result.                   In  the case of
chloride of sodium, solution       goes   on so slowly, and the mechanical
equivalent of the force of crystallization        is so great, that    if pressure
had been applied for only a few hours one might have concluded,
with Bunsen, that pressure has no influence on solubility ; but, by
maintaining it for a week or more, there was no difficulty whatever

 in perceiving that       a solution   which    was quite saturated      without pres
 sure, dissolved more under a pressure of about 100 atmospheres.
    The solubility of      a salt in water appears to me to result from a kind
 of affinity which decreases in force as the amount of salt in solution
 increases. This affinity is opposed by the crystalline polarity of the
 salt ;  and when the two forces are equal, the solution is exactly satu
 rated.      As is well known,      a change     in temperature alters this equi
 librium   ;   and, according to my experiments, mechanical pressure rela
 tively increases     one or other   of these opposing forces,        according to the
 mechanical       relations of the salt in dissolving.           At all  events  in the
 case   of chloride of sodium the extra quantity dissolved under pres
 sure varies directly with it for such pressures as glass tubes will resist,
 in the    same     manner as, according         to Thomson's experiments,          the
 fusing-point      of ice is reduced.     Thus     I found that for a pressure of
 49£ atmospheres the extra solubility was *176 per cent., and for 121
 atmospheres -431, which are almost exactly in the same ratio.                  Hence,
if S  be the amount         soluble without       pressure, under a pressure       of p
 atmospheres the solubility at the same temperature would be S +p3,
where the values of S and s are independent,                 and vary for different
temperatures and different salts.             Future experiments may perhaps
 show that this conclusion should be modified ; but yet it will be well
to adopt     it provisionally, in order to compare together the mechanical
relations of different salts which otherwise would not be so intelligible.
    According to Michel and Krafft * and to Schifff, sal-ammoniac is
the only salt known for certain to occupy more space in solution than
when crystallized.          Hence under pressure mechanical force must be
overcome in dissolving, and experiment shows that, on this account,
the relative force of crystalline         polarity is increased and the solubi
lity  decreased.        This is the reverse of what results from an elevation
of the temperature,        so that the effect cannot be due to heat generated
by the pressure, but must be the direct consequent of pressure. Calcu
lating from an experiment where the pressure was                   1 64  atmospheres,
which    gave a decreased       solubility of    1*045 per cent.     of the whole salt
in solution,     a pressure   of  100 atmospheres would cause -637 per cent.
less to be dissolved than is soluble at 20° C. without pressure, and the
pressure requisite to reduce the solubility to the extent of               1 per cent.

would be 157 atmospheres.                        Expressing    this fact in other words, we
may say that a pressure of                   1   57 atmospheres is the mechanical force
with which the salt tends               to dissolve    in a solution containing            1   per cent.
less than can dissolve at the same temperature                             without pressure,           be
cause the two forces exactly counterbalance one another.                              In   a   still more
dilute solution the force would of course be still greater, in accordance
with the fact of           a greater pressure being necessary                   to prevent the salt
from being dissolved.                  Supposing then that we had a solution a trifle
more dilute           than that just named, and in such indefinitely                                 large
quantity that a cubic inch of the salt could dissolve in it and yet pro
duce no sensible change in its strength, so that from first to last it might
be considered to dissolve under a pressure                     of   1 57   atmospheres, and also
supposing that            it was rigidly enclosed         on   all sides but       one, so      that the
whole expansion must take place in one direction over an area of one
square inch, since on dissolving there is an increase in bulk from 100
to    1   15*78,    the solution         of this cubic inch would,               as   it were, raise
2355 lbs. through the space of '1578 inch.                    This is mechanically the
same as 3 71]- lbs. raised               1   foot, or, the specific gravity of the salt
being l-53, the same as 171 times the weight of the salt itself raised
1    metre.        Since   it involves no arbitrary unit but the metre,                          I   shall
adopt the last expression as the measure of the total                                      amount of
mechanical work done by the solution of salts which expand in dis
solving, and which may conversely be looked upon as the measure
of the mechanical force rendered latent and,                               as   it were, expended
in the      act    of crystallization        when crystals are deposited.                  The value
of this mechanical equivalent of course varies with the strength of the
solution, as already remarked.
     In    the case of salts which occupy less space when dissolved than
when solid, pressure, like the increased temperature, causes them to be
more soluble          ;   mechanical force is lost when they dissolve, and                           is,   as
it   were, expended           in giving rise to solution.             When water thus con
taining more of           a   salt than could otherwise be dissolved at the same
temperature    just saturated under any given pressure, the amount of
                     is
pressure represents the force of crystalline polarity tending to cause
the salt to be deposited in    crystalline form, but which
                                             a                 exactly                     is

by the     number      of times its own weight which any unit of the
various salts could raise to the height of 1 metre in the act of cry
stallization. Conversely, it is the amount of mechanical force which
becomes    latent in the act of solution     ; and in the case of a still more
supersaturated solution it would be greater, and wee versd, in accord
ance  with the fact of the increased solubility varying with the pressure.

   On comparing together the various salts, it will be                                   seen that their
properties vary very considerably. Thus, under the                                       same      pressure,
the extra            quantity         of sulphate of copper dissolved in nearly ten
times that of ferridcyanide of potassium.                              The mechanical equivalents
also vary even more, being (for chloride of sodium) about 22£ times
as great as for sulphate of copper.  On the contrary, the mechanical
equivalents of ferridcyanide of potassium and sulphate of potash are
the same         ;    but, under equal pressures, the extra quantity                                  of the
latter dissolved in nearly nine times as great, owing to the difference
in the amount of expansion in crystallizing.                                   This latter   is,   however,
nearly the same                    for water and ferrocyanide                    of potassium, whilst,
under the same pressure, the extra quantity of that salt dissolved                                            is
2   }j   times that of ice, in consequence of the much greater mecha
nical equivalent of the ice.                         It    appears to me that we may pro
visionally conclude that the increased solubility due to pressure varies
directly with the change of volume, and inversely with the mecha
nical equivalent of the force of crystalline                                 polarity,   so that,    if   S   be
the total amount of salt which dissolves without pressure,                                      c   be some
function of the change in volume in dissolving, and m some function
of the mechanical equivalent of the force of crystalline polarity, the
solubility,          at the same           temperature, under                a   pressure of      p   atmo
spheres would be S+-t—                     -.      Ifthe salt be       one that expands on dissolv-
                                           m
ing,     c   of course        is   negative, and therefore under pressure the solubility
becomes          S—   P-;           that   is   to say,    it   is   diminished, as proved by ex-
                          m
periments with sal-ammoniac.                              If   no change in volume took place,
we may,       I      think,        also   conclude that pressure would not in any way
increase or decrease the solubility of                          a    salt.    Moreover,      since,       when
a   solution         is   just saturated, the force with which the salt tends to
crystallize          is   equal to that with which       tends to dissolve, their
                                                                       it
mechanical equivalents must be equal and opposite.                                       Hence we may
perhaps          conclude that, other                 circumstances              being the same,           the
mechanical            equivalent of            a   salt like chloride            of sodium, which             so
readily       attracts moisture, would be greater than that                                  of     one    like
sulphate of copper, which so readily loses even its water of crystal
lization and thus also the relative influence of equal amounts of
             ;

pressure would be very different, as is confirmed by experiment in
the case of these and some other salts.
   The facts          I   have described, therefore, show that there is a direct
correlation between mechanical force and the forces of crystallization
and solution.              According to             some chemists, the latter is an instance
of real combination               ;   but, whatever views be entertained respecting
its nature, we cannot,                I
                                 think, deny that the force represents some
modification          of chemical affinity, or is at all events most closely
allied to it.             In    comparison           with      some   kinds of affinity, it may
indeed be, and probably                       is,   weak   ;   but yet, as    I    have shown,        it
sometimes has             a    very considerable mechanical equivalent, even when
nearly counterbalanced                    by an opposite force           ;    and since such pres
sures as glass tubes will resist have no very great influence on what
we may perhaps consider                    a   weak affinity, we cannot expect that any
pressure at our command would                               have much         influence    on strong
affinities.     I         have, however, succeeded in obtaining                      some        results
which apparently show that pressure influences undoubtedly chemical
changes taking place slowly, and therefore probably due to weak, or
nearly counterbalanced, affinities.
  The method adopted in this part of the inquiry was to seal up
some solid substance in solution which gives rise to
                                          a          slow double                     a
decomposition, taking great care to have in the tube with pressure,
and in that without, pieces cut so as to be of the same size and form,
and   a   solution of the same character, so that, with the exception of
pressure, all the conditions were the same.                               Possibly I      may be so
fortunate       as to discover              some       case where the affinity            is   so weak
that pressure may determine whether                             it   go forward or not,        of which
fact the structure of metamorphic                              rocks furnishes     examples      ;   but
hitherto   I         have only been able to prove that pressure modifies the
rate at which chemical action takes place. This branch of the
inquiry   however, beset with many difficulties, for the change in
               is,
volume produced by double decomposition                                  is   small, and its deter
mination involves several complicated questions.                                The volume of the
solids    is   easily determined           ;    but that of the salts in solution          is   not the
same when other salts are present as when they are dissolved                                    in pure
water, and varies much according to the strength of the solution and
the nature of the salts               ;    and many points are still so obscure, that                I
shall only give two cases                  by   way of example.

  Wheu         a portion      of Witherite is enclosed in a tube with                        a strong
solution of protochloride of iron, there is a slow decomposition into
chloride of barium, which is dissolved, and carbonate of iron, which
remains firmly attached to the Witherite, and would ultimately give
rise to an excellent pseudomorph.                        The best conclusion            at   which    I
have been able to arrive             is,   that there    is   in this change an increase in
volume equal to about               10*    7   per cent. of the Witherite altered, so
that, under         pressure, mechanical              force must be overcome.                  In   an
experiment where everything went on in                         a   very satisfactory manner,
the pressure was maintained for three months                                at from 80 to 100
atmospheres, and for one month was under 80 atmospheres, so that,
on an average,         it   was    about 80 atmospheres             ;   and  I     found that the
amount of chemical change was 21*7 per cent. less than when, all
other circumstances having been the same, there had been no pres
sure ;    thus clearly showing that pressure had, as                        it   were, diminished
the force of chemical affinity.                If then   one cubic      inch had       been altered
under this pressure,          it   would have overcome             a   mechanical force equal
to that required to raise 1200 lbs. through the space of -107 inch,
which     is   equivalent to raising twenty-one times its own weight to the
height of metre; and under the same circumstances 1*278 cubic
               1
inch would have been altered when no such mechanical force had
to be overcome.             Supposing then that in both cases the total energy
at work was the same, but in one was altogether expended in pro
ducing     a   chemical result, and in the other in producing                                partly   a
chemical and partly            a   mechanical          effect, we may say that the force
which gives rise to the purely chemical change, taking place at a
particular rate,   equal to that which gives rise to this chemical
                       is
effect,    taking place at *783                 of that rate, and to               a    mechanical
effect equal         to the       force     required       to raise      in the        same     space
of time 34*87 times the weight of the Witherite altered to the
height of   metre.
                1   Supposing also that the power of chemical
force varies as the rate at which                it   gives rise to     a   chemical change, in
the same manner as the power of                        a   mechanical force varies as the
velocity of motion imparted by                  it,   we may perhaps conclude that this
mechanical force         is   equal to '217 of the chemical force, and that the
whole energy of the chemical action under the conditions of the ex
periment was equal to the mechanical                       power required to raise in the
same period         of time    160 times the weight             of the Witherite altered              to

the height          of   1   metre.         If   these       principles      are correct, a    pressure
of more than 370 atmospheres would have entirely counterbalanced
the force of chemical affinity, since to produce any chemical change
it would then have had                 to overcome a greater force than                    it possessed.
This is       so great a pressure that                       I   fear it will be     difficult to prove
the deduction            by experiment                ;    and until some           such case can be
found, capable of being verified, these calculations must be considered
as   little more than suggestions, which future investigations may con
firm or disprove.
     When calcite is           sealed up         in   a mixed and rather strong solution                 of
chloride      of sodium and sulphate of copper, slow double decomposi
tion gives rise to malachite, sulphate of lime, aud carbonic acid ; and
though this case is extremely complicated, and it is very difficult to
determine what would                   be the change                in volume, yet,     so far as   I   am
able to make out, until the solution becomes saturated with sulphate
of lime, there is             a decrease         in volume equal to about               8 per cent.      of
that of the          calcite altered,                 so    that,    under    pressure, mechanical
force is the very reverse of being opposed to the chemical change.
Three experiments, all indicating the same fact, and in which, on an
average,      the pressure was about 90 atmospheres for two weeks, show
that, as a mean of the whole, the amount of chemical change was                                         17
per cent. more with the pressure than without                                  ;   thus proving     that
pressure had, as it were, increased the force of chemical affinity.                                 Cal
culating       according        to the principles                 described above, we may con
clude that a pressure of 530 atmospheres would                                       have caused        the
action to take place at double the rate, and that therefore the che
mical action is equivalent                       to the expenditure                of that amount of
mechanical          force, being thus generated by it.                             Arguing then in a
manner similar               to that already described, but modified to suit the
different conditions,            if    there be a contraction                equal to 8 per cent. of
the bulk of the calcite, there must be a loss of mechanical                                         force
capable       of raising 28 times the weight of the calcite altered to the
height of       1    metre, in the time required for the chemical change                                  ;
which amount of mechanical energy, as it were, becomes latent, and
is transformed into chemical action, and would again exhibit itself
as a mechanical force                 if,   by any means, the chemical affinities could
be inverted and everything restored to its original state.
     In   a   like manner, other experiments indicate that                              in   some cases

 1863.]                                  549
 pressure causes      a slower, and    in others     a   quicker chemical action,
 whilst in others it has scarcely any influence whatever ; and though,
for reasons already explained,           I  say it with some hesitation, yet,
bearing    in mind what is already known               respecting    the action of
pressure on hydrate       of chlorine, hydrated hydrosulphuric acid, and
other substances described by the various authors referred to in the
notes, I think the facts I have described make it very probable
that further research will show that pressure weakens or strengthens
chemical affinity according as it acts against or in favour of
the change in volume        ;  as  if  chemical      action    were directly   con
vertible   into mechanical      force, or mechanical          force into chemical
action, in definite equivalents, according to well-defined general laws,
without its being necessary that they should be connected by means
of heat or electricity.       On the present occasion I shall not attempt
to consider the various         geological      and   mineralogical    facts which
appear to me to admit of the application of the principles                   I have
 described, for many of them are peculiarities              in structure of which
 neither myself nor any one else has ever given a description, and would
 therefore demand a preliminary           notice.    However,     I may say that   it
 appears to me that a number of facts connected with metamorphic
 rocks   and the phenomena         of slaty      cleavage,   which, to me at all
 events,   have    hitherto   been   inexplicable,      are   readily explained    if
 mechanical    force be directly correlated to chemical action, and            if in
 some cases the direction in which crystals are formed be more or less
related to pressure, in some such way as there is a connexion between
 their structure and magnetic force, as shown by the experiments of
 Plucker, Faraday, Tyndall, and many other observers. We may
also,  I think, explain the origin of the impressions on the limestone
pebbles in the
                    " Nagelflue " in Switzerland, about which so much
has been     written    in Germany        and France, without        a satisfactory
reason having been discovered          ;   and the same explanation accounts
for the mutual penetration of the fragments of which some limestones
are formed,     lyid for the banded          structure    of some    which  possess
slaty cleavage.      The curious teeth-like         projections with which one
bed   of limestone sometimes enters into another, also to                 a certain
extent indicate a chemical        action depending on mechanical force;
and probably the same may be said of some of the peculiarities                   of
slickensides   and mineral veins.          It  is also possible that a pressure

willingly admit that very much remains to        be learnt    before we can
say to what extent the principles     I have   described are applicable      ;
and yet, at the same time, cannot but think that henceforth they
must be taken into account in many departments of chemical and
physical    geology, and will readily explain a number of facts which
 otherwise would be very obscure.

        of Chemistry,     and late Professor        of Toxicology      in the

     It is on record that Thrasyas, the father of Botany, was so skilled
  in the preparation of drugs, that he knew how to compound           a poison

which would remain for days in the living body without manifesting
its action, and would at last                  kill by   a lingering illness.        Theophrastus
speaks of this poison, and says its force could be so modified as to
occasion death in two, three, or six months, or even at the end of a
year or two years.              The writings of Plutarch, Tacitus, Quintilian,
and       Livy   are    full of instances of what seem to be this kind of slow
and       occult       poisoning.          In fact, until recently there has                   been   a
common belief among the unlearned that a skilful poisoner could so
apportion the dose and combinations of certain subtle agents that he
could destroy the life of his victim with certainty, and at the same
time measure                his allotted moments with the nicest precision,                       and
defy the utmost skill of the physician and the chemist.                               Even     so late
as the 16th century                     this belief was shared by the learned of the
medical profession                ;   for we are told, in Sprat's ' History of the Royal
Society,' that among other questions which were drawn up by the
earlier     Fellows             to be submitted          to the Chinese and Indians              was,
" Whether          the Indians can so prepare that stupefying herb, Datura,
that they make               it lie several days, months, years, according                    as they
will have        it,   in   a   man's body without doing him any hurt, and at the
end kill him without missing half an hour's time?"
     Modern toxicologists have long since discarded                            these notions, and
have set them down to the vague fears and exaggerated fancies of
the ancients, rather than to the sober contemplation of facts.                                    But
the account which               I     am about to give           of the physiological properties
of nitrobenzole will show that there                        is   one substance, at least, which
realizes to      a     great extent the extraordinary                 opinions of the ancients.
This compound may                      be given today, and yet,          if   the dose be not too
large,     it    shall not manifest its action until tomorrow,                            or the day
after, and shall then destroy life by                       a     lingering illness, which shall
not only defy the skill of the physician, but shall also baffle the re
searches of the medical jurist.  These facts are so remarkable, that
they would be hardly credited                       if    they were not susceptible of the
proof of demonstration.                    They     are likewise the more interesting and
important from the circumstance that nitrobenzole                              is   now   a   common
article of commerce, and                  is   accessible    to everyone.
     In   every manufactory where nitrobenzole and aniline are prepared
on   a   large scale, the peculiar narcotic effects of these poisons are often
observed.          The vapours escaping into the atmosphere                           are breathed
                                                                                 2r2

  by the workmen, and cause distressing headache and a heavy, sleepy
  sensation.     For the most part       these  effects are not serious, but         are
  quickly relieved by fresh air and a mild stimulant, as a glass of
 brandy and water.          Now and then, however, the workmen, from
 carelessness    in their habits, expose themselves to the action of com
 paratively large quantities of these poisons, and then the effects are
 most dangerous.         Two fatal cases of poisoning by nitrobenzole have
 been referred to me by the coroner for investigation               during the last
 two years, and in both instances they were the results of careless
 manipulation.        In  one case a man, forty-three        years  of   age,  spilt   a
 quantity    of the liquid over the front of his clothes, and                he went
 about for several hours in an atmosphere saturated with the poison.
 In the other      a boy, aged     seventeen     years, received a little      of the
 liquid into his mouth while sucking            at a siphon.      The    effects were
 nearly the same in both cases, notwithstanding            that in one the poison
was inhaled, and in the other        it was swallowed.        For  some time there
 was no feeling      of discomfort beyond that of drowsiness           ;   gradually,
however, the face became flushed, the expression stupid, and the gait
unsteady —the sufferers had the appearance of persons who had been
drinking.       Little by little this stupor increased, until it passed into
profound      coma, and in this condition they died.             The progress of
each case was much the same as that             of slow intoxication, excepting
that the mind was perfectly clear until the coming on of the fatal
coma.      This was sudden, like a fit of apoplexy ; and from that
moment there was no return of consciousness or of bodily power —
the sufferer lay as      if in  a deep sleep,     and died without a struggle.
The duration of        each   case was nearly the same         ; about four hours
elapsed frcm the time of taking or inhaling the poison to the setting
in of the coma, and the coma lasted for about five hours.
    After death there were no       appearances     of convulsion, but rather of
narcotism and apoplexy.           The   face was flushed ; the lips were        livid  ;
the superficial vessels      of the body, especially about the throat and
arms, were gorged with blood ; the dependent parts were turgid ;
the blood was everywhere black and fluid            ;  the lungs were somewhat
congested    ;  the cavities of the heart were full        ;  the liver was       of  a
purple    colour, and the gall-bladder         distended with bile     ;   the brain
and its membranes were turgid, and in the case of the man there was
much     bloody     serosity in the ventricles.         Analysis discovered the

 1863.]                                  553
existence of nitrobenzole in the brain and stomach, and also of ani
line.
   These effects were so remarkable, that             I  determined to examine
them still further      by experiments on domestic animals.               Dogs and
cats were submitted       to the action of from thirty to sixty drops of
nitrobenzole     which had been well washed with dilute sulphuric                acid
and water to free it from every trace of aniline.                 The poison was
generally administered by pouring it into the mouths of the animal?,
but sometimes it was given by means of an oesophagus-tube. When
the nitrobenzole       had come into contact with the mouth,               it always
caused discomfort, as      if from   unpleasant taste, and there was profuse
salivation.     Its local action on the stomach, however,           was never very
great, for there was rarely any vomiting until the setting in of nervou
symptoms, and this seemed to be due to sympathy rather than to
any local irritation of the stomach.              Two    classes  of   effects  were
clearly observed     :  there was either the rapid coma which charac
terized the operation of the poison on the human subject, or there
was a slow setting in       of paralysis and      coma,   after a long period      of
inaction.
   When the     effects were speedily fatal, the animal was soon seized         with
giddiness and an inability to walk.           The weakness of the limbs first
appeared in the hind extremities, and was manifested by a difficulty
in standing   ;  but very soon     it extended to the fore legs, and then to
the head and neck.          There was complete         loss  of voluntary power.
The animal lay upon its        side,  with its head drawn       a little back, and
with its limbs in constant motion,         as if in  the act of walking or run
ning.    The muscles of the back were occasionally fixed in spasm,
and every now and then the animal would have a sort of epileptic fit.
It would   look distressed, would howl as        if in  pain, and would struggle
violently.    After this it would     seem exhausted, and would lie power
less.   The pupils were widely dilated, the action of the heart                  was
tumultuous      and irregular,    and the breathing was somewhat difficult.
For   some time, however, the animal retained its consciousness,               for it
would look up, and wag its tail when spoken to               ; but suddenly, and
often at the close of a fit,     it would  become     comatose— the eye would
remain open, but the conjunctiva would be insensible to touch, and
the movements of the limbs would nearly cease              ; the breathing would
be slow and somewhat stertorous, and the animal would appear as                     if

                                      554                                [May 7,
 it wsre in    a deep sleep.    This condition would last until it died—
 the time of death varying from twenty-five minutes to twelve hours
 after the administration    of the poison.
     When the action of the poison was slower, there                was often no
 visible effect for hours or days.       At first there was always a little
 discomfort from the taste of the poison, but this soon subsided, and
 then for a day or more the animal appeared to be in perfect health.
 It   would go about as usual, would be quite lively in its movements,
 would eat its food heartily, and in fact would seem to be in no way
 affected by the poison.      Suddenly, however,     it would look distressed,
 it would have an attack of vomiting, and it would tumble over in an
 epileptic fit.   When this had subsided, it was generally found that
 the animal was weak, or even quite paralysed in its hind extremities            ;
 and after two or three of such attacks, the loss of voluntary power
 would extend to the fore limbs.       The animal would lie upon its side
 perfectly helpless    ; and then the progress of the case was much the
 same as that already described, except that      it was considerably slower.
 Consciousness,     for example, would be retained            for days after the
 animal was paralysed, and, although        it was quite unable to stand,       it
 would take food and drink when they were put into its mouth.                The
 condition in which it lay was most distressing        :   the look was anxious
 and full of fear   ; the limbs were in constant motion          ; and every now
 and then there would be a violent struggle, as          if the animal was in a
 fit, or was making fruitless efforts to rise.      This would last for days,
and then there would be either a          gradual restoration of voluntary
power with complete recovery, or death from exhaustion.                 The time
that elapsed from the administration        of the poison to the coming on
of the first symptoms, namely the epileptic fit, varied from nineteen
hours to seventy-two — in most cases it was about two days ; and the
time of death was from four to nine days.
     The post-mortem appearances were nearly the same in all cases,
whether the death was quick or slow. The vessels of the brain and its
membranes were extremely turgid        ;  the cavities of the heart were      full
of blood   ;  the lungs were but slightly congested         ;  the liver was of a
deep purple tint, and the gall-bladder distended with bile ; the stomach
was natural, without sign of local irritation ; and the blood all over
the body was black and uncoagulated.           Whenever the progress of the
case had been quick, and death had taken place                within twenty-four

 1863.]                                    555
 hours, the odour of the nitrobenzole was clearly perceptible                   in the
stomach, the brain, and the lungs             ;  and there was always unmistake-
able evidence of the existence of aniline in the organs of the body.                 In
the slower cases the odour of the poison had often entirely disap
peared    ; but generally        there were distinct traces of aniline in the
brain and urine, and sometimes in the stomach and liver; occa
sionally, however, no poison was found.
    It  has appeared to me that the facts which are here elucidated are
very remarkable          ; for they not only indicate a rare circumstance in
toxicology,      namely, that a poison may be retained in the system for
many days without showing its effects, but also that the poison may
be changed into an entirely different substance.                  The importance of
these facts cannot be overrated             ;   they are alike interesting     to the
chemist, the physiologist, and the medical jurist             ; for, without dwelling
on a very possible          occurrence — namely,       the criminal administration
of this poison, with the knowledge that the               effects would be delayed,
that the symptoms would correspond to those of natural disease, that
the progress of the case would be lingering, and that there would be
either no discovery of poison in the body, or the discovery of a thing
different from that administered           — it will    be manifest that the study
of   these facts by the medical        jurist is of public importance.        To the
physiologist       they are also interesting, insomuch             as they indicate   a
reducing power in the animal body by the conversion of nitrobenzole
into aniline.        I  have endeavoured to ascertain whether this is due to
a  living or     a dead    process.    In  the first place,     I find that dead and
decomposing organic matter will effect the change alluded to                      ; for
when nitrobenzole is placed in the dead stomach, or is kept in con
tact with putrid flesh for several hours, there is a partial reduction of
it into aniline.        This may     be the source      of the poison found in the
dead body      ;  but, on    the other hand, there is a great similarity in the
physiological       effects  of nitrobenzole and those of aniline.
    When aniline is given         to dogs and cats      in doses    of from twenty to
sixty drops, it        causes   rapid loss of voluntary power.            The animal
staggers in its gait, looks perplexed, and falls upon its side powerless.
Its head     is drawn        back, the pupils       are  widely    dilated, there are
slight twitchings or          pasms of the muscles, the breathing is difficult,
the action of the heart is tumultuous,              and the animal quickly passes
into a state of coma.          From this it never recovers, but remains upon

                                     556                                [May    7,
its side as   if  in a deep sleep, and so dies    in from half an hour to
thirty-two hours.
   The post-mortem appearances are much the           same as the last      : the
brain and its membranes are turgid,         the cavities of the heart are
nearly full  of blood, the lungs    are but   slightly congested, and the
blood all over the body is black and uncoagulated.              In   every case
the poison was easily discovered in the brain, the stomach, and the
liver.
   While, however, there     seems to be a probable conversion         of nitro-
benzole into aniline in the living animal body by a process of reduc
tion, there is also undoubtedly      a change    of  an opposite      character
going on upon the surface of the body, whereby the salts of aniline
are oxidized     and converted into mauve or magenta purple.               Some
remarkable facts illustrative of this have been brought under my own
notice, and have been the subject of clinical observation.
    In the month of June 1861,      a boy aged 16 was brought          into the
London Hospital in      a semi-comatose condition.       He had    been scrub
bing out the inside of an aniline vat, and while so doing he breathed
an atmosphere charged with the vapour of the alkali, and became
insensible.     He did not suffer pain or discomfort, but was suddenly
seized   with giddiness and insensibility.      When he was brought to
the hospital he looked like a person in the last stage of intoxication           :
the face and surface of the body were cold, the pulse was slow and
almost imperceptible,     the action of the heart was feeble,          and the
breathing was heavy and laborious.        After rallying    a little, he com
plained of pain in his head and giddiness.        It  was then noticed that
the face had a purple hue, and that the lips and lining membrane
of the mouth and the nails had the      same purple    tint.    The next day,
although the narcotic effects of the poison had passed away, he was
still remarkably blue, like   a patient in the last stage    of cholera.
   In   the early part of last year, sulphate of aniline was given in
rather large doses to patients in the London Hospital affected with
chorea.     The   doses ranged from a quarter    of a grain to seven grains.
They    were   frequently  administered,  so that large quantities       of the
salt were taken in a very short time.       In  one case as much         as -106
grains were given in the course of a few days.          No very remarkable
effects followed beyond this — that after a few doses had been taken,
and the system had become, as it were, saturated with the salt, the

   1863.]                                    557
  face became       of a leaden blue colour, the         lips and gums looked      as if
  the patients had been            eating black      currants,    and the nails also
  acquired a purple         hue.     The colour faded a little before the time
  came for the administration          of another     dose, but soon after taking     it
 it appeared again       ;  and this was the subject of constant observation.
  Dr. Fraser and Dr. Davies have recorded the results of their experi
  ence in five cases *, from which it would seem that, although the free
 alkali is a powerful poison, the sulphate of it has but little action
 upon the animal body.
      The general conclusions which appear to                me  to be warranted     by
 these investigations are        : —
      1st.   That nitrobenzole and aniline in its free             state are powerful
 narcotic poisons.
      2nd. That they        exert but little action,        as local irritants, on the
 stomach and bowels.
      3rd. That although         the effects     may be quick, and the fatal ter
 mination      of them rapid, yet nitrobenzole may remain in the system
 for   a long time without        manifesting its action.
     4th. That the salts of aniline            are not nearly so poisonous as the
 free alkali.
     5th. That in rapid cases of fatal poisoning, both the poisons are
 readily discovered in the dead body.
     6th. That in slow cases the poisons may be entirely changed or
 eliminated, and therefore not recognizable.
     7th. That both of the            poisons     appear to be       changed    in  the
body by processes          of oxidation       and   reduction, nitrobenzole       being
changed        into   aniline,   and     aniline   and    its  salts into mauve or
 magenta.
     In  an appendix     f are   given notes of the two cases of fatal poison
ing by nitrobenzole referred            to in the paper, and a detailed account
of twelve experiments on animals with nitrobenzole, and three with
aniline    ;  also the process employed for the recognition of aniline and
nitrobenzole in the dead body, as follows              : —
     1st.  The matters to      be analysed were bruised          in  a mortar   with a
little water, and very slightly acidulated with dilute sulphuric acid.

     2nd. They were then submitted to distillation in a glass retort — the
  distilled   products   being saved in three or four separate portions by
 changing the receiver at different stages of the process.               In this  way
 the presence of nitrobenzole was discovered.
     3rd. The residue in the retort, when reduced to a pulpy mass by
 the distillation,    was treated with strong spirit of wine and filtered.

  was    treated with a slight      excess    of subacetate of    lead,    and again
 filtered.     In this way gum, dextrine, &c. were removed.

 saturated solution of sulphate of soda in water.              In this manner the
 excess    of lead was precipitated      as a  sulphate.

 gether with ammonia from the animal matters, was found in the clear,
 colourless, distilled spirit.
     7th. This was neutralized, or rather made acid, with a slight excess
 of dilute sulphuric acid, and evaporated nearly to dryness in a white
 porcelain dish.       If necessary,    the spirit was saved by distillation.
     8th. The residue       was  of  a  pinkish colour if aniline was present,
 and occasionally there were little streaks of blue around the edges of
 the white porcelain dish.          If the quantity of the saline residue was
 not more than a grain or so,         it  was at once tested by dissolving       it in
 a few drops, or even in a single drop, of dilute sulphuric acid (1 to 1).
 A small portion of it was then placed upon a strip of bright platinum ;
 and the platinum having been connected with the positive pole                   of  a
 single cell of a Grove's       battery, the liquid was touched with the ne
 gative pole    : in a few secon ds,    if aniline was present, the liquid would
acquire a bronze, a blue, or a pink colour            ;  the kind of colour being
dependent on the am ount of aniline             present — bronze   being the result
of much aniline, and pink of a very little. In this way at least the
 g-j^th part of a grain of aniline was easily recognized.
    To another portion of the acid liquid placed upon a white porcelain
plate, a little peroxide of lead or red prussiate of potash was added,
and a blue or purple reaction followed.              This test is not     so delicate
as the last, for    it fails when the amount of aniline is           less   than the
-nsW" of       a grain-
    Other    tests may be resorted to       if necessary,   as when the      quantity

1803.]                                    559
of aniline is large.       Thus peroxide of        manganese         or bichromate of
potash may be used in the same way as the red prussiate of potash
in the last experiment ; but these           tests will not answer with        less than
the -j-jTyth of a grain of aniline.            Lastly,   a drop       of  a solution   of
chloride of lime may be added to the acid liquid, and                   if the  quantity
of aniline   exceeds the    tos^      part of a grain    it will    cause a purple re
action.
    9th.  If  the quantity of saline residue from             the last operation        is
large, and there is reason to believe that much ammonia is present,
this alkali must    be got     rid of, for it greatly interferes with the success
of the colour-experiments.             The residue, therefore, is made moist
with water, and rubbed down with about twice its bulk of neutral
carbonate of soda.          It   is then exposed to the air for a short time
until the odour of ammonia           has passed away.        It   is then treated with
 strong alcohol,     filtered,    acidulated    with dilute sulphuric acid, and
again evaporated.         The aniline is now fit for the colour-experiments.
    There    are no fallacies to these experiments              ;   for although, as     I
 have elsewhere shown, strychnia             will give nearly the same colour-
 reactions, yet in the first place this alkali is not volatile like aniline,
 and will not therefore distil over as the latter does ; and in the next
 place, while the best effects, in respect of colour, are developed with
 dilute   acid and aniline, strychnia          requires the         concentrated     acid.
 These differences are sufficient to prevent                any embarrassment           as
 regards the two alkaloids.

        Frederick W. Pavy, M.D.                         Communicated             by Dr.
        Sharpey, Sec. R.S.              Received    April 29, 1863.
                                      (Abstract.)
     The author    stated that the opposition         which his view on the         above
  subject received the evening of its announcement, in his former com
  munication    read January 8, 1863, had induced him to perform a series
  of additional experiments.            As from     these    experiments       some   im
  portant  confirmatory      evidence was supplied, he deemed                it desirable
 to present a further communication             to the Society on the subject.
     He had again denuded the stomach of                  a patch      of mucous    mem

                                           560                              [May    7,
brane, and in one experiment had allowed the animal to live for ten
days.      It   had fed in an ordinary manner every day, and when killed,
reparation was found in an advanced stage towards completion,                      the
walls opposite the denuded part having been considerably thickened
by new matter that had been thrown out.
     Upon much further extended observation the author found that
the standard he had taken from the rabbit, as regarded the post
mortem action of the contents of the stomach upon the organ itself,
was not     just in its application to the dog.         Actual experiment on the
dog had shown that upon the animal being killed at a period of full
digestion, and its temperature being afterwards maintained about the
degree     belonging to life, the effect at the end of five and six hours
only amounted to more or less digestion of the mucous membrane.
In   the rabbit, under similar circumstances, the effect had gone on to
perforation,      on account, apparently,       of the stronger acidity of the
gastric contents.        In   reality, then, the effect of arresting the circula
tion through the stomach during life, about coincided in both rabbit
and dog with what occurred, other circumstances being equal, after
death.
     As   a counterpart       to the experiments originally mentioned, where
dilute non-corrosive acids had been introduced                 into the stomach of
the dog, and the flow of blood through the organ afterwards arrested,
an    operation that was followed by comparatively rapid perforation,
the author        had used the same            acids, in the same quantities, and
similarly diluted, but the circulation            was allowed to remain free, and
now the stomach resisted digestive attack.                Ligatures had of course
been applied to secure the retention         of the acid liquid introduced.
     A    mode of experimenting         suggested by Dr. Sharpey had been
undertaken.          After an incision through the anterior wall of the sto
mach, a portion of the posterior wall had been drawn forward, and a
ligature placed tightly around           it,   so as thus to arrest the circulation
through     a   limited portion of the organ's parietes.         It   was found   that
this constricted mass underwent digestion like             a   morsel of food.
     An experiment had          been   performed      bearing on the explanation
that had been given to account for the attack upon the living frog's
legs and rabbit's ear by digestion whilst the stomach remained pro
tected.      Three    drachms of muriatic          acid, diluted    to three ounces
with water, were introduced into the stomach of                a   dog, and the end

of the    oesophagus   and the pylorus ligatured, without including the
vessels,   so that the circulation    through the organ    was left free.   In
one   hour and forty minutes death took place, and on the parts being
examined immediately, perforation, with extensive digestion of the
interior of the stomach throughout, was found. The author con
sidered that the question of result was clearly shown to resolve itself
into one dependent on degree of power possessed by the acid contents
of the stomach on the        one hand, as against the alkaline circulation
on the other.      With   a certain amount     of acid only in the stomach,
the circulation     can afford the required protection ; whilst with a
larger amount the influence of the acid prevails, and digestive solu
tion   of the organ is the result.         Allow, now, the contents of the
stomach to remain the same, and vary the degree of vascularity in
the parts submitted to the digestive influence.         We have simply here
a converse arrangement        of the circumstances     ; and the position is
represented by the situation        of the stomach    as compared    with that
of the frog's legs and rabbit's ear.
III. "On       a Question of Compound Arrangement."                 By   J. J.
        Sylvester, M.A., F.R.S.,             Professor of Mathematics in
        the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich.                 Received   April
        27, 1863.
    My successful but    as yet unpublished     researches into the Theory of
 Double Determinants have involved the consideration of the follow
ing curious case of arrangements.
    There are given m + n — l counters of n distinct colours just capable
of being packed into m urns. The question refers to the distribution
of the counters among the urns, subject to the condition that it shall
not be possible to form a closed circuit of double colours between
any number of the urns chosen arbitrarily, ex. gr. we must allow no
 distribution   of counters in which     one  urn contains blue and yellow,
a second yellow and red, a       third red and green, and a fourth green
and blue, because       here blue, yellow,     red, and green would form a
 closed circuit.    This condition, it   is evident, excludes the same com
 bination of colours from existing in any two of the urns, and also the
 repetition of any one colour in the same urn.            Any distribution   of
 counters obeying this condition may be called an excyclic distribution.

                                        562                           [May     7,
    I annex two propositions, one qualitative,       the other quantitative,
 referring to such distributions.
                              Qualitative Theorem.
    In any excyclic distribution       between   m urns   of  m + n—   1  coun
 ters  of  n different    colours, any set    of counters selected at will
 must be fewer in number than the number of distinct colours which
 they contain added to the number of urns from which they are drawn.
    Before going on to enunciate the second proposition        I must premise
 one or two simple definitions.
    The capacity of    an urn means the number       of counters it will con
tain, the frequency of a colour the number of counters of that colour,
so that the sum    of all the capacities and the sum of all the frequencies
must be    each equal to the number of the counters.
   Again, by the diminished capacity of any urn or diminished fre
quency of any colour, I mean such capacity or frequency respectively
diminished by unity.
    Finally, by the polynomial function of any set of numbers       a, b,  ...I,
I  mean the coefficient of x" . yh ... z1 in the expansion of
                            (x+y+...+z)"+i+---+i.
    I can now enunciate the following
                             Quantitative   Theorem.
    The number     of  modes    of excyclic distribution     between   m urns
of   m + n—   1  counters    of n different   colours is equal to the pro
duct   of the polynomial function of the diminished frequencies of all
the several colours multiplied by the polynomial
                                                             function of the
diminished capacities of all the several urns.
                                  Observation.
    A  double determinant means the resultant of a system of
                                                                  (m+n— I)

the second order in respect to the variables of these two systems taken
collectively.    Any such resultant is of the       degree     vim + n—l)_ .

Every term in this determinant will itself be a sum of simple deter
minants of the (m+n— l)th order, corresponding (each to each) with

appertaining                 to    that        term   ;   so that the        number of simple deter
minants whose sum constitutes a term in the grand total determinant
is always the product                          of two polynomial             coefficients.            In the par
ticular     case, where one                     of the systems contains only two variables,
one    of these polynomial                            coefficients becomes      unity, and the other
sinks down to a binomial coefficient.                                  The only instance of a double
determinant which is believed to have been considered up to the pre
sent moment is that given by                                  Mr. Cayley in the ' Cambridge and
Dublin Mathematical                            Journal,' vol. ix. 1854, for the                 case       of m=2,

IV. "On               a Theorem relating to Polar Umbrae."                                      By     J. J. Syl
        vester, M.A., F.R.S.                                  Received      April 27, 1863.
   By polar umbrae I mean such as obey in the strictest manner the
polar law of sign, so that not only any two appositions or products of
such umbrae derivable from one another by an interchange of two of
their elements are to be considered each as the negative of the other,
but also any such apposition                                 or product      becomes           zero   if the         same
element is found in it more than once.
   Thus Sir W. Hamilton's i,                                 j,     k are not polar umbrae, because
although          ijk=—jik=kij,                       &c.,    it,   jj, kk, instead of being nulls, are
in the Calculus of Quaternions taken as unities*.
   Let us now define any set arranged either in line or column of such
umbral           quantities to be multiplied by                         a   corresponding         set      of actual
quantities when each term of the one set                                     is   multiplied          by   the corre
sponding           one         of the other, and the sum taken of the products                                           so

or, in other words, the electromotive force         of a counle may   be consi
dered as the difference of the electromotive force of two metals, each
of which   is found by subtracting its tension at the higher          tempera
ture from that of the lower one.
   Everything therefore depends          on a knowledge   of the value of what
may be called the electric tension of each metal at the various tem
peratures.     This for every metal is a function of temperature, and
may be called, in the language of the paper, a function of the nature
(or name) of the metal and the temperature.
   (The nature of the metal may            be altered otherwise than chemi
cally.)
   If the  temperature      of the metal vary in any way throughout its
length, then   if it be homogeneous, the electromotive force will depend
only on the temperatures of its extremities.
   In  a circuit of   one metal, the author considers that at the      junction
of the ends there may be a real discontinuity of temperature while
there is a continuity of electric current.         He regards the explanation
of the effect by the stratum of air between the unequally heated ends
to be    unsatisfactory.       Mercury, as is known, will not produce
thermo-currents in this way.          The author considers that the texture,
&c., as well as the chemical nature of the substance, influences the
value of the thermo-electric          function.   He also shows the possi
bility of the thermo-electric        inversions first discovered by Professor
Cumming..

 I. "On       the Nature of the Sun's       Magnetic      Action   upon the
       Earth."     By Charles Chambers, Esq.                Communicated
       by the President.       Received  April 30, 1863.
                                 (Abstract.)
    If the sun were a    magnet of sufficient power to exert       a sensible
attraction upon a small magnet at the distance of the earth, it would
have a real influence on the earth by inducing        magnetism in its soft
iron, and    an apparent   one due to the direct action     of the sun upon
 the magnets used for measuring the earth's variations of force.           As
the earth rotates upon its axis, producing a varying relation, as to
position, of the place of observation with respect to the sun, a diurnal
variation will thus be produced       in the forces which act upon the
magnetometers, which variation       is shown to follow the simple        law
«=Asin(A+a), x         being the deviation of the magnet from its normal
position, h the hour-angle of the sun (and for a single day), A a con
stant coefficient, and a. a constant angle. A comparison of this result
 with the laws of the observed diurnal variations shows that direct and
inducing action of the sun is not the sole cause of the variations.
    An endeavour   is then made to prove that   if any part  of the observed
diurnal variations is due to this   cause, it is small  in comparison with
that produced by other forces in operation.          This is done by sepa
rating from the observed variations the part of them which obeys the
law *'=Bsin(A+/3), and comparing the variations in the values of
B and    /3 from month to month with those of         A and a, when it is
seen that the former obey a law which has but        little similarity to the
law of variation of the latter.

 III. " On     the Structure of the so-called Apolar, Unipolar, and
        Bipolar Nerve-cells of the Frog." By Lionel Beale, M.B.,
        F.R.S., F.R.C.P., Professor of Physiology and of General
       and Morbid Anatomy in King's College, London, and Phy
        sician to King's College Hospital. Received May 7, 1863.
                                    (Abstract.)
    The author adverts to the opinion generally received with regard
to the existence of apolar, unipolar, bipolar, and multipolar nerve-
cells, and observes that       if cells having    such very different relations
to the nerve-fibres they are supposed to influence, as apolar, unipolar,
and multipolar cells, do actually         exist, as many different kinds of
action must be admitted.           For it is hardly likely that a nerve-cell
unconnected with any fibre can affect the fibres at a distance from it
in the    same way as a cell acts upon         fibres which are in structural
continuity    with it.    Neither is it probable that      a cell with but    one
fibre proceeding from       it can constitute an organ     which  acts upon the
same    principle  as the cell from      which two or more fibres proceed.
If  no fibre, or but one fibre proceeds from certain cells, the formation
of complete^nervous      circuits, at least in these instances, is impossible    ;
and   if it be admitted that circuits do not exist       in every case, a strong
argument is advanced against the existence of such complete circuits
as a necessary or fundamental           condition   of a complete nervous ap
paratus.     But  if it can be shown, on the other hand, as the author
maintains is the case, that all the supposed apolar and unipolar cells
have at least two fibres proceeding           from them, the fact must be
accepted in favour of the view that such complete circuits may exist,
while the fact that the fibres connected with many cells have               been
seen to proceed in opposite directions some distance after leaving the
cell, is a very strong argument in favour of such general inference,
and at the same time an explanation of many arrangements which are
observed constantly in connexion with nerve-fibres in various tissues.
    Many observers have described apolar and unipolar cells in ganglia
in different parts of the frog. The author, on the other hand, has
failed to discover any apolar or unipolar cells in this or in any other
animal, and considers that the apparent absence of fibres, and the
presence of one fibre only in connexion with a cell, result from the
defective modes of preparation          generally employed.       He maintains

                                           570                                [May 21,
that every nerve-cell, central or peripheral, has at least two fibres
proceeding from        it*.   In many      cases he has demonstrated that these
fibres pursue opposite directions, and he considers that such an ar
rangement is general, and therefore necessary.                  The author considers
himself justified in drawing the following               conclusions from observa
tions he has made during the last three years.
     1st.   That in all   cases nerve-fibres are in bodily connexion            with the
cell or cells which influence them, and this from the earliest period
of their formation.
     2nd. That there are no apolar cells, and no unipolar cells, in any
part of any nervous system.
     3rd. That every nerve-cell, central or peripheral, has at least two
fibres in connexion with it.
     Though the present inquiry is limited to the structure of the par
ticular cells connected with the ganglia in different parts of the frog,
the author has studied the arrangement of nerve-cells and nerve-
 firbes in nervous centres, as well as at their peripheral distribution, in
many different animals.
     1.   General description       of  the ganglion-cells     connected with the
                   sympathetic and other nerves           of  the frog.
     The general form of these cells           is oval or spherical     ;  but the most
perfectly formed ganglion-cell is more or less pear- or balloon-shaped
in its general outline, and by its narrow extremity                       is continuous
with nerve-fibres which may be followed into trunks.
     The figure represents a well-formed ganglion-cell from                  a ganglion
close to one      of the large lumbar nerves of the little green tree-frog
 (Hyla arbored) . The substance of the cell consists of a more or less
granular      material, which by the slow action of acetic acid becomes
    * The word    " cell" is only  used in a general sense, as being shorter and     more
convenient     than " elementary   part."   It consists merely of, 1st, matter in a living
active state {germinal    matter), and 2nd, matter resulting from changes occurring
in this (formed material).       In the figure, what is ordinarily termed " nucleus "
and    "  nucleolus
                    " consists of germinal or living matter, while the matter at the
lower part of the cell and the nerve-fibres are formed material. A nerve-fibre
cannot produce a new nerve-fibre, but the " nucleus
                                                             " or
                                                                   germinal matter of a
nerve-fibre can produce new nerve-fibre. The formed matter never produces
matter like itself. Germinal matter can produce matter like itself, and from this
formed material may result.

 nucleolus.        In  some     of     these    cells, at about the central part or a
 little higher, are a number of oval nuclei, some of which are in con
 nexion with fibres.           The matter of which the mass of the cell con
 sists gradually diminishes                in diameter, and contracts        so as to form
 a fibre,     in which     a nucleus is often seen.              At the circumference of
 the cell, about its middle, the material seems gradually to assume the
 form of fibres, which contain numerous nuclei, and these pass around

fibre    comes   from the centre of the cell (straight fibre), and one or
 more fibres (spiral fibres) proceed from its surface.                       These points
 are represented in the           figure*.
     2. On the formation              of ganglion-cells in the fully formed frog.

 would not be intelligible without figures, it will not be given in
 abstract.       The development of             these cells and many other structures
 may be studied in the fully formed animal as well as in the embryo.

         c. Ganglion-cells    formed by changes occurring in what appears
      to be the nucleus of a nerve-fibre.
        3. Further changes in the ganglion-cell after its formation.
      Under this head the movement of the cell from the point where
  its growth commenced is described. It is shown that the two fibres,
  which at first seem to come from opposite extremities of the cell, lie
  parallel to each other.        They increase in length, and subsequently
  one is seen to be      twisted round the other, as shown in the figure.
  Sometimes the fibres below the point where the spiral arrangement
  exists run parallel for a long distance, but at length pursue opposite
  directions.     The author considers that the formation of the ganglion-
  cell commenced at the point where the fibres diverge, and that sub
  sequently the cell moved away, — the parallel fibres, which at length
 become straight       and spiral,   being gradually formed or drawn out
 as  it were from the cell.
          4.  Of the spiral fibre of the fully formed    ganglion-cell.
     The spiral fibre or fibres can be shown to be continuous with the
 material of which the body of the cell is composed, as well as the
 straight    fibre, but the former are connected with its surface, while
 the latter proceeds from the deeper and more central part of its sub
 stance.
    There     are many    nuclei in connexion with the spiral      fibre, and
 several nuclei of the same character imbedded in the substance of
the mass of which the cell is composed.          These latter nuclei seem to
be connected       with an earlier condition  of the matter which becomes,
when more condensed, spiral fibre.           A  great difference is observed
with regard to the extent of the spiral fibre in cells of different      ages.
In   the youngest cells the fibres near the cell are both parallel to each
other, but as the cell grows one is seen to be coiled round the other          ;
and the number of coils increases as the cell advances in age, while
the matter of which the fundus of the cell is composed gradually
becomes      less — apparently in consequence of undergoing conversion
into fibres.      Nuclei   are found  in the course of the straight fibre, as
well as    in connexion with the spiral fibre. Nuclei have been demon
strated in connexion with the dark-bordered          fibres near their origin
and near their distribution in all tissues.
    Next follows     a discussion  " on the essential nature of the changes

1863.]                                         573
occurring        during the formation of all nerve-cells, and on the for
mation of spiral fibres," but this is not adapted for an abstract.
The term "nucleus" is only employed in                            a general      sense.       The
author believes that the            " nucleus," " nucleolus,"             and centres within
the latter       ("   nucleoluli   ")   merely represent centres of different ages.
He considers that the matter of the nucleus                     becomes     gradually trans
formed into the formed matter around                      it,   and generally, that these
bodies are merely centres which arise in pre-existing                           centres.       He
maintains that from the outer formed                      matter connected with the
fibres new nerve-cells could not be produced,                        while he holds           that
from the nuclei, nucleoli,              and contained centres, entirely               new and
complete cells could be evolved.                 So he considers that the difference
in the properties and powers of the formed matter on the                             one hand,
and the nuclei and nucleoli                  on the other, depends upon these two
kinds of matter having arrived at different                     stages   of existence. That
which      is    formed cannot form new formed matter, nor appropriate
nutrient material          ;   but the living germinal matter of the nucleus can
be resolved into           formed matter, and        it    can appropriate           inanimate
pabulum, and confer upon              the same wonderful (vital) powers which
                                        it
it   possesses        itself, and which were communicated to        from pre    it
existing germinal matter.
     7.   Of the fibres in        the nerve-trunks continuous with the straight
                        and spiral fibres      of the ganglion-      cells.
     The conclusions upon this important question                        are as follows   :—
     1st. That in some instances very fine fibres, not more than the
inr.innr*^
                 o^   an English inch in diameter, are alone continuous with
both straight and spiral fibres of the ganglion- cell.
   2nd. That     dark-bordered fibre may be traced to the ganglion-
                       a
cell as the straight fibre, while the spiral fibres are continued on as
very fine fibres.
     3rd. That the spiral fibres may be continued onwards as                           a   dark-
bordered fibre which may even be wider, at least for some distance,
than the fibre continued from the straight fibre.
     4th. That both straight and spiral fibres may                       be continuous        with
dark-bordered           fibres.
     It   is   therefore quite certain that the spiral fibre               is   not connective
tissue, although the author considers                it   probable that many German

                                      574                            [May 21,
observers may adopt this view until they have an opportunity                of
seeing the fibres themselves.
                 8.   Of the ganglion-cells of the     heart.
   The author's conclusions       are quite opposed to those      of Kolliker,
who states that all the cells are unipolar, and that the fibre always
passes  in a peripheral     direction, also that the transcurrent fibres of
the vagus have no connexion with these cells.            The author, on the
contrary, affirms that the cells have at least two fibres coming from
them, that some of the fibres pass towards the heart, and others to
wards the brain.      He regards it    as very probable that many at least
of these ganglion-cells   are connected with fibres   of the vagus. Kolliker
has also stated (1860) that many apolar cells could be seen in the
heart, ganglia, and in the bladder.          The author has been able to
demonstrate fibres in connexion with so many cells which appeared
devoid of fibres, that he considers himself justified in denying the
existence of apolar and unipolar cells altogether.
   Next follow  some observations on       "  the ganglion-cells   and nerves
of arteries ;" " on     the connexion     of the ganglion-cells with each
other ;" and the paper concludes with a description of the so-called
"capsule" of the ganglion -cell, and a discussion on the nature and
formation of the connective tissue and its corpuscles in the immediate
neighbourhood    of nerve-fibres.
   The paper is illustrated with forty-seven drawings of the specimens,
magnified from 700 to 1 700 linear ; and the author states that many
of the specimens will probably retain the appearances he has copied
for several months. All the preparations have been made in the
same manner.      An outline of the process has been already given in
the author's previous communications,          but the author is aware that
it may   be some    time before the correctness of his conclusions          is
generally  admitted,     in  consequence    of the difficulty    of preparing
demonstrative specimens.

   Dear Sir, — The       favourable position of Jupiter for scrutiny of his
physical features may perhaps have already brought                      to  the Royal
Society some notice of the aspect of his belts.                 Whether that      be so
or not,   I think you will readily       excuse the desire       I feel to  lay before
the Society a sketch from my equatorial, which shows the colours of
several    celestial objects more distinctly            than  I  am   accustomed to
hear is the case with some other instruments               of the achromatic class.
   The sketch shows the usual equatorial bands*, or rather bands
nearly in the usual latitudes north and south of the equator. These,
to the eyes of my friends            and to mine, appear not dark grey, or
greyish brown, or brown, but nearly of the colour of some ochraceous
sands, or the yellower parts          of what is called      " red "  deal.     Several
friends to whom      I have shown the planet have immediately exclaimed,
" how    red the bands are    ;
                                 " " never     saw them so red before."
   The bands far from the equator are not reddened, but of a grey
tint a little warmed. The space between the equatorial bands, some
times described as yellow, appears rather bright white and silvery —
much the brightest part of the surface.                  The outer borders of the
equatorial bands are not parallel, the inner borders much unequal                      ;
in one part the two bands are connected across.
    Not the faintest trace of such          a tint  as that conspicuous        in these
bands appears on any part of the moon                ;   but it is pretty nearly the
tint of the supposed      " land " of Mars.            In fact, it was suggested to
my mind that these coloured             extra-equatorial      belts were land, seen
between white clouds,      of which the brightest band           was on the equator.

       Hydrazobenzol,        a new    Compound isomeric with Benzidine."
       By A. W. Hofmann, LL.D., F.R.S., &c.                      Received May 7,
       1863.
   The discovery, among the secondary products of the manufacture of
aniline, of xenylamine, the probable connexion of which with benzidine
(xenylene-diamine)       I   have already had an opportunity            of pointing
out*, has induced     me to submit the latter compound to some experi
ments.     In preparing      benzidine by the process originally pointed out
by  Zininf, viz. by treatment of azobenzol with sulphide of ammonium,
I  was   led to the observation of some            phenomena which appear to
have escaped    the attention of those who have hitherto studied this
substance.
   It  is generally supposed that the action of reducing agents upon
azobenzol produces directly benzidine.
                          Azobenzol.             Benzidine.
Such, however, is not the case.              The well-defined       base designated
by the latter name is only a secondary product              ;  the first compound
which is generated in this process being a neutral or feebly basic body,
differing in all its properties from benzidine, with which, however, it
is isomeric, and into which         it may   be converted     by simple treatment
with strong mineral acids.
   On passing a current of sulphuretted hydrogen into a solution of
azobenzol in alcoholic ammonia, the yellowish-red liquid is rapidly
decolorized, and yields on addition of water a crystalline precipitate
of a peculiar camphor-like smell.            This substance contains        a minute
quantity of the sulphur which separates, the bulk of which, however,
remains dissolved as polysulphide           of ammonium      ;  it is easily purified
by two or three crystallizations         from very dilute alcohol.        Submitted
to combustion, the compound thus obtained yields numbers which
coincide with those furnished by the analysis of benzidine.
   The properties in which the new substance, for which                   I  propose
the name hydrazobenzol,          differs from benzidine are the following         : —

benzol (in which it is somewhat less soluble), in well- developed white
plates, benzidine being always deposited from these solvents in well-
defined needles  and whilst the latter is freely soluble in boiling

water, from which it separates on cooling in the form of a crystalline
mass     of nacreous lustre, the former                         is so sparingly          soluble in water
that it is impossible to recrystallize it from that solvent.                                    The fusing-
point of hydrazobenzol is 131°C, that of benzidine being 118°C.
The basic properties of benzidine are well defined ; it dissolves even
in the weakest acids, such                        as acetic acid,        in which hydrazobenzol is
nearly insoluble.               Stronger acids, such as hydrochloric and sulphuric
acids, more especially on application of heat, dissolve hydrazobenzol                                        ;
but the solution                thus obtained contains no longer the unchanged
body     ;   the addition of alkali, fixed or volatile, produces a precipitate
which now              possesses     all the properties of benzidine.
    These          characters           are   sufficient        to individualize          hydrazobenzol.
There        is,   however, another property which marks its difference from
benzidine in even               a   more conspicuous manner.                       Benzidine when sub
mitted to          a   high temperature distils             ;   a   certain portion        is   decomposed
in this process, but the larger quantity volatilized without decom  is
position.   On heating hydrazobenzol considerably above its fusing-
point,       a   powerful       reaction ensues, the heat evolved being sufficient
to carry over nearly the whole amount of substance in the form of                                        a
deep red oil, from which, on cooling, crystals                                of azobenzol        are depo
sited.        On addition of an acid the oil yields                            a    further quantity of
this substance, and the acid solution                            is   then found to contain abun
dance of aniline.               The reaction which occurs                     is   simple enough.

and exposed to the action of the atmosphere, hydrazobenzol                      is gra
dually reconverted into azobenzol.
   It deserves to be noticed that some          of the chemists who have been
engaged   in the examination          of benzidine      must have occasionally
worked    with    hydrazobenzol.       Mr. Noble*,           who many years ago
prepared benzidine in my laboratory,              especially      remarks    that the
substance obtained by him is reconverted into azobenzol by the action
of nitrous acid.      I  have satisfied myself      that benzidine thus treated
yields no trace of azobenzol.
   From the experiments described, it is obvious that in the forma
tion of benzidine from azobenzol two distinct phases have to be dis
tinguished   :  in the first phase the molecule of azobenzol assimilates
a molecule    of hydrogen, but this hydrogen remains in                 a very feeble
state  of combination, being eliminated again by a great variety of
agents.    It is only under the influence of acids that the hydrogen
molecule becomes incorporated           in the system, if I may use this ex
pression, and fixed benzidine, a substance of great stability, is formed.
   Whatever view may be taken regarding the nature of azobenzol,
the constitution     of which it must        be admitted is        utterly unknown,

pound, and     it is this consideration which induced             me to propose     the
name hydrazobenzol        .

       H. L. Russell, Esq., A.B. Communicated by A. Cayley,
       F.R.S.      Received May 15, 1863.
                                 (Abstract.)
   In  my second Memoir
                              " On  the Calculus     of Symbols," I worked
out the general case of multiplication according to one of the two
systems of combination of non-commutative symbols previously given.
In   the present paper     I propose to investigate the general case of
multiplication according to the other system. I commence with the
 Binomial Theorem, to which the second system gives rise. In my
previous researches I obtained the general term of the binomial
theorem when the symbols combine according to the first system
 by equating symbolical coefficients      ;  here, on the other hand,      I  con
sider the nature    of the combinations which arise from the symbolical
 multiplication,   and obtain the general term by summation.               I  next
proceed to the multiplication     of binomial factors.         Here the general
term is obtained by considering        the alteration of weight undergone
by certain symbols in the process of multiplication.                 The multi
nomial theorem according to the second system is next considered
and its general term calculated.        I   conclude the memoir with some
applications of the calculus of symbols to successive            differentiation.
This paper completes the investigation of symbolical multiplication
and division according to the two systems of combination, the
general case of division having been worked out by            Mr. Spottiswoode
in  a very beautiful    memoir recently published          in the Philosophical
Transactions.

   The subject on which        I   have the honour     to address you      this
evening, is one which lies     at the foundation    both of Physiology and
Pathology, and, on account of its great importance, has engaged the

1863.]                                            581
best energies        of many very able men, among whom may                                 be men
tioned, for example, such distinguished                          Fellows    of this Society           as
John Hunter and Hewson                   ;   so that    it might well      seem presumptuous
in    me to hope to communicate                     anything      new regarding          it,   were   it
not that the constant progress of Physiology and the allied sciences
is   ever opening up fresh paths for inquiry, and ever affording fresh
facilities for pursuing            them.        Indeed, my difficulty, on the present
occasion, does not depend so much on the lack of materials as on
the complicated relations of the subject, which make me almost de
spair of being able, in the short time that can be devoted to                            a     lecture,
to give, in anything like an intelligible form, even an adequate selec
tion of the facts        at my disposal.
     It   may, in the first place, be worth while, more especially for the
sake       of any present who may not                      be physiologists,         to mention
very briefly some   well-known general facts respecting the con
stitution of the blood.  The blood,                      if
                                     examined by the microscope
within the       vessels      of   a   living animal,      is    seen to consist     of    a    liquid
and numerous small particles suspended in it.                          The liquid        is    termed
the       " liquor sanguinis,"          the particles          the "blood-corpuscles."       Of
these corpuscles         a   few are colourless, and are named the               " colourless "
or   " white    corpuscles."           The great majority         are coloured and cause the
red appearance of the blood, and hence are called the                                    "red cor
puscles."         Soon after blood has been shed from the body,                           it    passes
from the fluid into the solid form.                    This depends upon the deve
lopment in the blood of                a     solid material termed " fibrin," so called
from its fibrous nature, consisting, as examined by the naked eye, of
tenacious        fibres, and having              the same         character    also under the
microscope.         These fibres form             a    complicated        network    among the
blood-corpuscles,            and from their tenacity are the cause of the firm
ness      of the clot.     Soon after the process of solidification or coagulation
is   complete, the fibrin exhibits              a   disposition to shrink, and squeezes
out from among the corpuscles entangled in its meshes        straw-                       a
coloured fluid termed the serum, very rich in albumen, in fact very
similar in chemical composition to the fibrin, which, in its turn, may
be said to be identical chemically with the material of muscular fibre.
   The question before us, therefore,  What              is,         is    the cause of the de
velopment of this solid material, the fibrin?                          The subject may                be
looked at in two aspects, — first,                     as to the essential nature              of the
     VOL.    XII.                                                                2   t

process    of coagulation       ;   and secondly, as to the cause of its occur
rence when the blood is removed from the body.
   With regard to the first point, the essential nature of the process
of coagulation, different views have been entertained.   John Hunter
was of opinion that the coagulation of the blood, the solidification of
the fibrin, was an act of life — analogous, in some respects, to the
contraction of muscular fibre.                This,   on the other hand, was made
very unlikely by the observation of his contemporary,                       Mr. Hewson,
that blood may be kept in the fluid state by the addition of various
neutral    salts, but retains the faculty             of coagulating when water is
added to the mixture.               Mr. Gulliver, on        one occasion,     kept blood
fluid, by means of nitre, for upwards of a year, but found that it
still coagulated on the addition of water.                   It   seems exceedingly im
probable that any part of the human body should retain its vital
properties after bsing thus pickled for more than a year.                       But here
I   would wish to make an explanation of the use of this term                      " vital
properties."   When employing                 it,
                                      do not wish to commit myself
                                               I
to any particular theory of the nature of life, or even to the belief
that the actions of living bodies are not all conducted in obedience
to physical      and chemical laws.            But    it   appears that every compo
nent tissue of the human body has its own life, its own health,                      just
as we ourselves have        ;   and as the actions of living men will ever re
tain their interest whatever views be entertained of the nature                          of
life, so must the actions of the living tissues                     ever   continue to be
essential objects       of study to the physiologist         and pathologist.     When,
therefore, I     use the term
                                    " vital   properties,"   I     mean    simply proper
ties peculiar         to the tissues as       components          of the healthy living
body.
   Turning now to the other aspect of the subject of coagulation — the
cause of the occurrence of that process on the escape of the blood
from the living body — we find that here again various theories have
been     held, which      may be divided            into mechanical, chemical, and
vital.    The mechanical theory           was, that mere rest          of the blood was
sufficient to cause coagulation.              I     say this was the theory; but        I
believe   it   will               still taught
                       be found to be                         by
                                                many, that the cause
of the coagulation of the blood in an artery which has been tied is
its stagnation in the vicinity of the ligature.
    As to the chemical theories they have                    been various.      One very

   1863.]                               583
   natural view was, that exposure to the air was the essential cause of
  coagulation.     Mr. Hewson believed that this         was, at   all events, an im
  portant element in the causes of the phenomenon                ;  and many emi
  nent physiologists     and pathologists   have held the same view, except
  that, instead of the air as a whole, the oxygen of the air has been
  supposed to be the important element.
      Sir Charles Scudamore considered that coagulation was greatly
  promoted by the escape of carbonic acid ; and more recently the evo
  lution of ammonia has been regarded as the essential cause of the
  change.     According to the ammonia theory, due to Dr. Richardson
  of this city, the fluidity of the blood within the body depends on a
  certain amount of free ammonia holding the fibrin in solution, and
  the coagulation     of the blood when withdrawn             from the vessels is
  the result of the escape of the volatile alkali.
     Then,   as to vital  theories.   These have been held by many phy
  siologists, among whom may be mentioned                 Sir Astley Cooper and
  Mr. Thackrah, who, from experiments which they performed, were
  led to the inference that the living vessels         exert an active influence
  upon    the   blood, by which      coagulation      is   prevented     ;  and   Mr.
  Thackrah went       so far as to attribute      this action of the       vessels to
  nervous influence.       The view that the blood          is kept    fluid by the
  operation of its natural receptacles has been advocated more recently
  by Brucke of Vienna, whose essay will be found in the ' British and
  Foreign Medical Review' for 1857.            Briicke performed his experi
  ments on turtles and frogs, in which animals the blood remains fluid
 in the heart for days after death      ;  and  I  feel bound to say that some
 of the facts which     he has brought forward seem to me quite sufficient
 to show that the ammonia theory, whatever amount of truth it may
 contain, cannot be the whole truth, and cannot explain the fluidity
 of the blood within the body.            For example, Brucke found             that,
 having shed blood from the heart of a living turtle into a basin,
 and transferred,      with  a syringe,   a portion      of that blood into the
 empty heart of another turtle just killed, the blood thus transferred
 into the empty heart remained fluid for hours ; whereas that which
 was left in the basin coagulated in a few minutes.                 He also found
that blood continued fluid in the heart of a turtle long after the in
jection of air into the heart through          a vein till the cavities of the
organ contained a foamy mixture of blood and air.
                                                                   2t2

                                       584                             [June  11,
   Yet it by no  means follows that the vital theory and the ammonia
theory are necessarily altogether inconsistent.           It  might be true for
anything we could tell, a      priori, that the coagulation of the blood,
when shed from the body, might depend on the evolution of a certain
amount of ammonia,        previously      holding the fibrin in solution,    and
yet  it might, at the    same    time, be true that the cause of the         am
monia remaining in the blood in the healthy vessels                might   be an
action of the living vessels retaining        it there.    It  might be that an
action of the living vessels might chain down the ammonia and pre
vent  it from escaping, whereas, when shed from the body, it would
be free to escape.
   This notion   was,   I  confess,    at one time entertained by myself;
and one of my earliest experiments was performed with a view to the
corroboration   of the ammonia theory         as applied to blood outside the
body.     It seemed   to me desirable that further evidence           should   be
afforded of the effect of mere occlusion from air in maintaining              the
blood fluid.    If the ammonia      theory were true, then     if blood could  be
shed directly from a   living  vessel into an    air-tight receptacle composed
                                      Fig. 1.
of ordinary matter it ought     to remain fluid.       For this purpose,  I made
the following experiment     : —I   tied into the jugular vein,    V, (fig. 1) of

a sheep a long vulcanized india-rubber                           tube,      T, adapted by               means    of
short pieces               of glass tube         at its extremities, both               ends being con
nected with the vessel                     so that the current             of blood might                  be per
mitted       to flow through the tube, and                            then continue               its      natural
course.           When it had               been    ascertained that the blood                          was cir
culating freely through                    the tube, which could be readily                             done by
placing          the       finger on the cardiac aspect of the                          vein,     which was
then made to swell                    if   the circulation           was proceeding through                     the
tube, pieces of string well-waxed                             were tied at intervals                    of about
2 inches round                  the tube, which was thus converted into a number
of air-tight receptacles containing blood, which certainly had no
opportunity for the escape of ammonia.     The tube was then re
moved, and             I    found, in accordance with the view which                              I   was then
disposed to entertain, that the blood, instead of coagulating                                                com
pletely in a few minutes as it would have done                                     if   shed into a cup,
remained partially fluid in these receptacles after the lapse of three
hours.           But       I have     since found that          if   the experiment be repeated
in the      same way as regards its earlier stages, and                                 if,   after     a   few of
the strings have been tied on, the tube be cut across, the blood
which       is   in the part of the tube in the vicinity of the air, just like
that which     in the air-tight receptacles, remains fluid in part for
                       is
two or three hours.   In short, that my precautions in ensuring that
these receptacles should                    be   air-tight were, in          so far as they applied
to that object, utterly unnecessary.                      I     mention this partly as an illus
tration of the deceptions to which one                               is   liable in this inquiry, and
partly      because         the experiment thus modified seems to tell as clearly
against the ammonia theory as the original                                   one    seemed            to tell    in
favour      of it.          Those receptacles which had been formed                                   by   the ap
plication of ligatures before the tube was opened afforded certainly
no opportunity                  for the escape          of ammonia, and yet in them the
blood coagulated as quickly as                          in those which had communication
with the air— implying that facility for the evolution of ammonia
does not         in itself affect the process of coagulation at all.
  How then,                it   may be said,       is   the persistent fluidity of the blood
under these circumstances to be explained                              ?    That will         become more
obvious than           I        can   make    it   at present in the sequel                   ;   but in the
mean time        I         may observe that there are probably two explanations                                  :
one   is,   the coolness of the tube, and the other, far more important,

that the blood, in slipping                         through       this cylindrical         tube, hnd had
little opportunity of being influenced by its walls. The portion of
the blood that came first in contact with the walls of the tube had
coagulated           ;    and it is to be observed that                   I    never found, in these
experiments, the blood altogether fluid, even after a comparatively
short time           :    there has always been a certain amount of coagulation,
and only a certain amount of fluidity.                              A   layer of blood having thus
coagulated upon the internal                            surface of the tube, the fresh blood
which continued to flow through        was not brought into contact

blood.
     It   has    been long                known that     if    blood    is    stirred with    a   rod, the
process of coagulation                       is   pro

ascertain distinctly whether the
cause     of this         was the contact           of
the foreign solid, or the oppor
tunity given for the                      escape    of
ammonia;                 for   it   is   quite true
that, in the ordinary process of
stirring blood, more or                      less air
is   mixed with it.                  For the pur
pose      of determining this               I      de
vised     a    somewhat complicated
experiment, which,                       however,   it
may be worth                   while       to men
tion.     I      made               an    apparatus
(fig.     2)   of two portions of glass
tube,     A    and B, connected in a
vertical        position             by   means     of
vulcanized india-rubber,                     I,    the
lower portion of the glass tube
being also connected by india-
rubber,        I',   with      a    wooden han
dle, which handle,                   H,    was pro
vided with an upright piece of
wire, from which spokes pro

that they would, when moved, act as a churn on any blood contained
in the lower portion of tube.                           When the lower                piece   of tube   was
fixed by means of a vice,                      V, the flexibility of the india-rubber per
mitted the churn to be rotated so as to expose                                    the blood to its in
fluence.             This having         been arranged,             I first   poured in strong liquor
ammonia, so as to get rid of any slight acidity which the constituents
of the apparatus might                        be conceived to possess,                and then, having
poured out the ammonia, filled up the apparatus with water, and
boiled the whole in a large glass test-tube till all bubbles of air, in
any portion of              it,   were expelled.             Having then tied into            a   branch of
the carotid artery,                C,   of   a   calf   a   bent tube of small diameter, as re
presented, and having                        permitted       the blood to flow till           it   escaped
at the orifice            of the tube,        I      compressed the artery and passed the
tube down through                     the water to the bottom of the apparatus, and
then let the blood flow again, which had the effect of displacing
all     the water;           and when the blood                      appeared at the top of the
apparatus,            the    tube was withdrawn,                     when      two effectual       clamps,
CI, CI, were placed on the vulcanized india-rubber                                        connecting     A
and         B;     the india-rubber           was then divided between the clamps, and
we      had        the    state     of things represented at the right-hand side
of the diagram.                   The upper portion of the apparatus, the orifice of
which        was exposed to the air, was                      set aside and left undisturbed.
Having ascertained that                        the lower            portion     had    been    effectually
sealed       by the clamp, and thus prevented from any opportunity                                       of
escape       of ammonia,          I     subjected       it   to the action        of the churn for       a
certain number of minutes.                         It   so happened that the blood                  of that
calf was very slow in coagulating.                           I      knew this from previous ex
periments on the animal, and therefore continued the action of the
churn        for     a   considerable          time, viz. thirty-seven                minutes.    I   then
found the wire enveloped in                      a   mass    of clot    ;     and examination of the
fluid residue with                a     needle indicated             that the fibrin had been all
withdrawn            from the blood on which the churn had acted.                                   I   did
not now examine the other portion of the apparatus, which had been
set aside        ;   but at the end of an hour and                     a   quarter, when more than
double the time had elapsed,                     I   investigated this, and found the blood
in    it,   for the most part, still fluid and coagulable.                              Thus the blood
in the churn, which, from the time                           it     left the artery, had no oppor

tunity of parting with its ammonia, coagulated much more rapidly
than that in an open vessel.              The difference between the two was,
that the lower portion of the blood had been freely exposed to the
influence of the foreign solid, whereas the other had only been sub
jected to the action of the wall of the tube.
    The      same principle     may be illustrated        by an exceedingly simple
experiment which         I   performed only this very day.              Receiving blood
from the throat of a bullock into two similar wide-mouthed                         bottles,
I   immediately stirred        one    of them with        a clean ivory         rod for 10
seconds      very gently, so as to avoid the introduction of any air, and
then left both undisturbed.              At the     end       of   a certain    number        of
minutes       I found   that, while the blood which had not been disturbed
could be poured out as a fluid, with the exception of a thin layer                            of
clot on the surface, and an incrustation on the interior of the vessel,
the blood in the other vessel,           which had        been stirred     for so brief a
period, was already a solid mass.
    I   have only lately been aware of the great influence exerted upon
the blood by exposure for a very short                     time to a foreign         solid,
and     I   feel that many    of my own experiments, and many performed
by others, have been          vitiated for want of this knowledge. Take, for
example, the effect of a vacuum, which was observed by Sir Charles
Scudamore to promote coagulation.                   This has        been   considered         by
Dr. Richardson as an illustration of his theory, the vacuum being sup
posed to act by favouring              the escape    of ammonia.            I   have lately
inquired       into this subject, and      I   feel no doubt whatever that the
greater rapidity of coagulation in a vacuum depends simply on the
greater disturbance of the fluid.          I made    the following experiment             :   —
I   filled three bottles, such as these, from the throat of a bullock,
placed one       of them under the small bell jar of               an air-pump     in good
order and exhausted            it,   leaving the other two undisturbed.                  The
blood happened to be slow in coagulating                  ;    and at the end of about
forty minutes, in the         vessels where the blood had been                 undisturbed,
there was only      a   slight film of coagulum on the surface, whereas the
blood under the vacuum was found on examination                            to have   a   very
thick crust of clot upon it. But during the process of exhaustion
the blood had bubbled very much.     Indeed, any exhaustion of blood
recently drawn which   sufficient to cause the evolution of its gases
                              is

induces great bubbling                 ;    so that the pump cannot be used freely,                   for
fear of the froth overflowing.                          To this disturbance, involving the
exposure of successive                     portions     of blood in the bubbles to the            sides
of the    vessel,     I was      inclined to attribute the more rapid coagulation                       ;
but in order to prove the point,                        I   stirred for a few seconds the blood
in one of the vessels                 hitherto        undisturbed.           After eight minutes       I
emptied the three vessels.                        I   found that that blood which had not
been     disturbed at all, either by the vacuum or by the rod, was still
almost entirely fluid, only showing a thin crust upon the glass and
on the surface exposed to the                           air.      The blood which had             been
subjected to the vacuum had a thick crust                                   of clot on the surface,
and the sides of the glass were also thickly encrusted, but it still con
tained a considerable quantity of fluid that could be poured out from
its interior.         But that blood which had                       been     stirred   for only a few
seconds was a solid mass throughout.                                In     other words, gentle stir
ring of the blood for             a few seconds                had much greater effect in pro
ducing coagulation than the protracted and efficient exhaustion which
was continued             for upwards          of 40 minutes, which was a considerable
time     after      all    evolution          of gas, as indicated by bubbles, had
ceased.
     Other experiments precisely similar in their effect were performed.
I   therefore feel no hesitation in stating that the effects of a vacuum,
regarding which, indeed, the statements of different experimenters
have hitherto             been    conflicting,          afford no evidence in favour of the
ammonia theory.
  There is another point of very great interest in the history of the
coagulation of the blood, which has been supposed to give support to
the ammonia theory                ;    and that         is,   the effect of temperature.         It   has
been long known that blood coagulates more rapidly at                                     a   high than
at a low temperature, and, indeed,                            a   little   above   the freezing-point
remains entirely fluid.                    This       seemed      beautifully in harmony with the
ammonia theory, as heat would                               naturally promote, and cold retard
the evolution of the alkali, and                       a    depression      of temperature to near
the freezing-point            might be reasonably supposed to prevent its escape
altogether.         Indeed Dr. Richardson                      mentions as     a   fact, that ammonia
artificially mixed with blood                         ceases    to be given off under such cir
cumstances.

     Though thinking it not unlikely that this              was the true explanation
  of the influence of temperature             on coagulation,     I thought it    worth
  while to subject the matter to experiment.                 For that purpose    I kept
  the blood of a horse fluid by means of a freezing-mixture,                 and after
  wards by ice-cold water      ;   and when the corpuscles had subsided from
  the upper part of the blood,         I cautiously     added to the liquor sanguinis
  extremely dilute ice-cold acetic acid till it was of distinctly acid reac
  tion, the liquor sanguinis being of a colour that permitted the delicate
  application    of test-paper, which is impossible with red blood.                 By
  this means    any free ammonia which the fluid might have contained
  must have been neutralized         ;    yet so long as it was kept in the cold it
  continued    fluid,   but when brought            into a warm room, coagulated
 just  as a specimen     which had not         been acidulated.     Thus, when there
  could be no free ammonia in the liquor sanguinis at all,                  it was still
  affected as usual by temperature.
     This experiment may not              be satisfactory to    all minds, though I
 confess it appears so to me            ;   and as    this is a point of very great
 interest,  I   have sought in another way for evidence regarding                    it.
 First, however,      I will mention        an experiment which       will not at once
 appear to bear on the question of temperature.                    I  drew out a fine
 glass tube in such      a way   as to produce a fusiform receptacle continued
 longitudinally    each    way into a tube of almost capillary            fineness for
 about two inches, which again expanded at the end,                  as represented in
 fig. 3.    Having      squeezed    out a drop of blood from my finger,                1

sucked up a portion into the tube              till the receptacle A and its capil
lary extensions were filled.         I    then broke off the expanded ends, and
placed the little tube thus filled,          B, in a bath of the strongest liquor
ammoniae.        Here certainly the blood was in circumstances in which
it could not lose ammonia, but where any change in its amount must
be by way     of increase, and yet         I found, on opening the receptacle bv

1863.]                                         591
snapping it across after a scratch with a file, that instead of remain
ing longer fluid than in a watch-glass, the blood in                     it,   being more in
contact with the glass, was always more quickly coagulated, while
coagulation was still more rapid in the capillary tube, where the blood
was still more exposed to the influence of the foreign                               solid — the
greater     proximity to the liquor                  ammonia:    having         no influence
upon it.
  It   may perhaps be argued that the drop of blood employed being                                a
small drop, and this small drop having been drawn up by suction into
the tube,   it   might have parted with its ammonia before                 it    got into the
tube   ;but then (and now comes the bearing of the experiment on the
effect of temperature)  found, I   placed   similar tube filled in the
                                            if
                                             I            a
same way in       a   vessel    of snow,   so as not to freeze   it   but      to keep     it   ice-
cold, the blood in       it    remained fluid as long as   I    chose to keep          it   there.
Now    if  all the ammonia had left the blood before            it   was introduced into
the tube, cold ought, according to the ammonia theory, to have had no
effect in retarding its coagulation            ;   for, according to that theory, cold
operates     by   retaining the ammonia.              On the other hand,             if   we take
the other alternative and suppose that any ammonia which the blood
might have contained was still in these tubes, the former experiment
proves clearly that the retention of ammonia has no effect in produ
cing fluidity —no effect in preventing                 coagulation   ;   and    if   the reten
tion of ammonia has no effect in preventing coagulation, then cold
certainly     cannot prevent coagulation                by retaining           the    ammonia,
because,     even   if   retained,   it   would not influence the result.             In what
ever way we look at them, therefore, these simple experiments prove
conclusively        that cold maintains the fluidity of the blood in some
manner unconnected               with any influence        it   may exert            upon       am
monia.
    Then, again, varied the experiment in this way.
                      I                                     placed such   I
little tubes of blood in baths of liquor ammoniae at different tempera
tures.  By careful management, guarding against the volatilization
of ammonia and consequent reduction of temperature,   succeeded in        I
employing satisfactorily a bath of liquor ammoniae at 100° F., the
blood being in the bath within               a   few seconds of its leaving the ves
sels   of my finger, and         I   found that the high temperature,                      though
under such circumstances             it   could not possibly dissipate any ammonia

from the blood, yet accelerated its coagulation in precisely the                           same
way as when it was applied to blood in watch-glasses exposed to
the air.
    It   is clear, then,      that the promotion of the solidification                of fibrin
by heat is as independent of the evolution of ammonia as the coagu
lation of albumen under the same agency.                           Indeed it seems probable
that the two cases are analogous,               except that a higher temperature
is required in the one than in the other.
    When fine tubes containing blood               were placed in         liquor   ammonia?,
the alkali acted only upon those parts which were close to the ends
of the tubes     ; a   very small portion        was rendered            brown by      it,   and
beyond that      a   little   was kept permanently             fluid, but the chief length
of the blood in the tube was unaffected.              Having thus ascertained
that ammonia travels so            slowly along tubes of this capillary fineness,
I   thought I    might        have an   opportunity of giving the ammonia theory
a   fair test by tying such        a    tube as has been above described into the
jugular vein of        a   rabbit and filling      it    directly from the vessel, and
then ascertaining whether there was any evidence of retardation of
coagulation in the blood thus imprisoned.                          ButI   could discover no
such evidence, although                 sought for           in confirmation of           view
                                                     is it

then held.       To this, however, there                     one   special exception to be
made, viz. in the case of asphyxia.             I      found that        if   two such tubes
were filled from the same blood-vessel of               a     creature, one under normal
circumstances, and the other after asphyxia had been induced, there
was   amost remarkable difference between the rates of coagulation of
the blood in the two tubes, the asphyxial blood coagulating very much
more slowly than the ordinary blood                ;   but when the asphyxial blood
was shed into            watch-glass and air was blown through
                     a                                                           it,

lated rapidly, showing            that in the state of asphyxia                there must be
some volatile      element in the blood which has an effect in retarding
coagulation.
    Supposing at first that this volatile element must be ammonia,                           I
hoped to be able by chemical means to find evidence of its accumula
tion in asphyxia, and thus add  fact of great interest to physiology.

Imitating experiments previously made by Dr. Richardson,        passed             I

oichloride of platinum.              In order to prevent the possibility of the
loss of any ammonia,            I   directed blood from the carotid artery of a
calf fairly into   a   Woulfe's bottle by       means        of   a vulcanized india-rubber
tube tied into the vessel,                and then drew a certain volume of air
through it by      means    of        jar, the experiment being per
                                    an aspirating
formed first before, and then during asphyxia.  The same procedure
was adopted with a second calf, the animal being in each case under
chloroform, which does not interfere with the development during
asphyxia of the peculiarity in the blood above alluded to                           ;    but     I could
not find satisfactory       evidence      of accumulation of ammonia                    ;   and with
out going further into the question at present,                           I   may say that             it
seems     much more probable that the effect is due to carbonic acid,
which is known to have                a retarding        influence on coagulation,                    and
which probably accumulates greatly in asphyxial blood.
   But in justice to the author of the ammonia theory, and                                  to myself,
                                                                                   it,
too, who at one time expressed a qualified belief in                               it       is   but fair
to say that this theory              is   extremely      plausible.           It   has      been well
shown by Dr. Richardson                that ammonia          is   a   substance well fitted to
keep the blood fluid        if  it   be present     in   a   sufficient quantity.                An   ex
periment      of my own illustrates very well the same point.        drew                    I
out   a   tube about quarter of an inch in calibre (fig. 4), so that while
                        a

for two inches              retained its original width, the rest (some
                   at one end        it
ten inches) was pretty narrow, though far from having the capillary
fineness of those before described.   Into the thick part introduced                I
a drop of strong liquor ammonia?,               A, and then securely corked that
end of the tube, C.  The object of this was that there should be                                        a
strong ammoniacal atmosphere in the narrow part of the tube.  then                               I
opened   branch of vein, V, in the neck of sheep, introduced the
           a                a                                      a

orifice should be in the current of the main trunk of the vein, tied it
in securely.          I then removed the                cork and made pressure on the vein
at the cardiac side, causing the vessel to swell and blood to pass into
the fine part of the tube             ;   and before the blood had reached the part
of the glass moistened by the ammonia,                               I   put in the cork again and
withdrew the tube.             In   a short time, on             introducing         a hook   of fine      wire
into the extremity of the tube,                     I   found the blood already coagulated                      ;
but on filing off a small portion of the tube,                              I   found the blood there
fluid.        The portion of blood thus exposed                           soon    coagulated, when,             a
second      small piece of the tube being removed by the file, fluid blood
was      again disclosed, which                again soon                coagulated    ;   and this pro
ceeding was repeated with the same results time after time, till, near
the thick part of the tube, the ammonia in the blood was so strong
as to prevent coagulation                 altogether.
    This experiment illustrates how fitted the ammonia                                     is to   maintain
the fluidity of blood, and also how apt                                  it is, when present in the
blood, to fly speedily off from                 it,     leaving      it    unimpaired       in its coagu
lating properties         ;   and   it   must be confessed that the end of the tube
sealed     with   a   small clot resembled most deceptively the extremity                                       of
a   divided      artery              But although the experiment

to me that,       if   the cause of the fluidity of the blood was free ammonia,

duced blood by pressure directly from the vein into this ammoniacal
atmosphere, this blood, lying between the strong ammoniacal atmo
sphere on the one side and the ammonia naturally present in the blood
within the vein on the other side, ought to remain flui-'

into   a   non-ammoniacal           atmosphere.                 This experiment alone,              if    duly
considered, would,            I   think, suffice to show that the blood                            does    not
contain enough ammonia to account for its fluidity.

     One more experiment, however, may be adduced
with the                I mounted a short but wide
                   same object.
glass tube, open at both ends (T, fig. 5), upon the
end of a piece of strong wire, W, and connected
with the latter            a coil   of fine silver wire, S,             so that    it
hung freely in the tube. I then opened the carotid
artery of a horse, and through the wound instantly
thrust in the apparatus so far that I was sure
the tube lay in the common carotid, which in
veterinary              language means the enormous                            trunk
common to both sides of the neck of the animal.
The tube being open at both ends,                                    and slightly
funnel-shaped at that end which                                  was         directed
towards            the heart, had           thus a full                current     of
arterial       blood        streaming           through          it.         Having
ascertained how long the arterial                            blood took to
show the first appearance of coagulation in a watch-
glass,     I   very soon            after removed the apparatus,
and, on taking out the coil of silver wire, found that
it   was already crusted                 over with coagulum.                     Yet
here assuredly there had been no opportunity for
the escape of ammonia.
     From this experiment it is obvious that there is                                     a very great      dif
ference        between ordinary solid matter and the living vessels in their
relation to the blood.                   But the       same conclusion may be drawn much
more       simply          from     experiments             which        I    had the       opportunity of
performing               after    making         an    observation             which it      seems     strange

opportunity of investigating the subject of coagulation, and of making
observations as satisfactory as they are simple.                                         Here are two feet

foot has been exposed.                  The veins            I   see   have contracted very much
since     I   reflected the skin from them before our meeting                                ;    and   I   may
remark that such contraction, dependent on muscular                                              action, may
occur days after amputation,                     indicating            the persistence of vital pro
perties in the veins.              Now      as   I   cut across this vein, blood flows out,
fluid but coagulable.                 Into the vein of this other foot has                       been   intro
duced a piece of fine silver wire, and when                            I   slit up the vein you will see
the effect it has produced.                  Exactly             as far as the silver wire extends,

     it
          is,
as        is     of itself sufficient to prove the vital theory in the sense
that the living vessels                differ entirely from ordinary solids in their
relation to the blood.                 It   is   perfectly             clear that by introducing a
clean piece        of silver wire (and platinum                         or glass or any other sub
stance chemically inert would have had the same effect)                                    I     do not add
any chemical material or facilitate the escape of any, and yet coagu
lation occurs round about the foreign solid.
     Again,     if a    blood-vessel be injured at any part, coagulation                                    will
occur at the seat of injury.                 As      a   good illustration of this, and also
as bearing         upon the ammonia theory,                       I     may mention the following
experiment.             Having      squeezed         the blood out of              a   limited portion       of
one    of the veins of        a   sheep's foot, and prevented its return                           by   appro
priate means,        I    treated the empty portion with caustic ammonia, the
neighbouring            parts of the vein being protected from the irritating
vapour by lint steeped in olive oil.                             After the smell of ammonia had
passed off,     I    let the blood flow back again and left                          it   undisturbed        for
a    while, when     I    found on examination   cylindrical clot in the part
                                                                   a
that had been           treated with ammonia, while in the adjacent parts of
the same vessel the blood remained fluid.                                    I     repeated this experi
ment several times and always with the same result.                                              Where the
ammonia had acted there was                      a   clot.         The chemical agent used here
was one which, so long as any of                      it   remained, would keep                   the blood
fluid     ;   yet its ultimate effect was to induce coagulation, the vital pro
perties of the vein having been destroyed by it.
     If   a   needle or   a   piece    of silver wire             is   introduced for       a    short time
into one of the veins of the sheep's foot,                             it   is   found on withdrawal to
be covered over           with    a   very thin crust of fibrin, whereas the wall                             of
the vessel itself        is   never found to have fibrin or coagulum                               adhering
to   it   unless   it   has been injured.                Now this            seems to     imply that the

 1863.]                                  597
ordinary solid is the active agent with reference to coagulation              — that
it  is not that the blood is maintained         fluid by any action of the living
vessels, but that    it is induced to coagulate by an attractive agency on
the part of the foreign solid.           We   see at     any rate that the foreign
solid has an attraction        for fibrin which       the wall of the vessel has
not.
    And yet     I own   I  was at first inclined        to  think that the blood
vessels must in some way actively prevent coagulation.                   There were
two considerations       that led to this view.           One was, that the blood
remained fluid in the small vessels after death, but coagulated in
the large.     Now why should that         be 1    It  seemed only susceptible     of
explanation from there being some connexion between the size                  of the
vessel and the circumstance          of coagulation.        It looked as if in the
small veins the action of the wall of the vessel was able to control
the blood and keep it fluid, but that the large mass in the principal
trunks could not      be so kept under control.            The other circumstance
was, the rapid coagulation of a large quantity of blood shed into                   a
basin.     Why should this occur unless there               was   some spontaneous
tendency in the blood to coagulate?                 It   seemed    scarcely credible
that it  was the result     of contact with the surface of the basin.
     Both  these notions, however, have since been swept away.                In the
first place,  I have  observed recently that it is by no means only in small
vessels that the blood remains fluid after death.               If blood be retained
within the jugular vein of a horse or ox by the application of ligatures,
either before or after the animal has been struck with the poleaxe, it
will often continue fluid, but coagulable, in that             vessel,  which is up
wards of an inch in diameter, for twenty-four or even forty-eight hours
after it has been removed from the body.              I say  often, but not always.
The jugular vein      seems to be     in that intermediate condition,       between
the heart and the small vessels, in which it is uncertain whether it will
retain its vital properties       for many hours, or will lose them in the
course of one hour or so.          Unfortunately      for my present purpose, it
happens that in this jugular vein, removed from an ox six hours ago,
coagulation has already commenced, as               I can ascertain by squeezing
the vessel between my fingers.            But now that       I lay open the vessel,
you observe that the chief mass of its contained blood is still fluid,
and we shall at all events have an opportunity               of seeing that what is
now fluid will in a short time be coagulated.                  It  is an interesting

 circumstance with reference to the question which we are now con
 sidering, that the coagulation always begins in contact with the vein,
 indicating that it is not the wall of the vessel that keeps the blood
 fluid, but that, on the contrary, the wall of the vessel, when deprived
 of vital properties, makes the blood coagulate.
    The observation of the persistent fluidity of the blood in                 these
 large vessels furnished the opportunity           of making    a very satisfactory
 experiment, which       I  hoped to have exhibited before the Society          ; but
 as there was some clot in the vein,        I did  not think fit to run the risk   of
 failure.    The experiment is performed in the following                 way.      A
 piece of steel wire is wound          spirally round     one  of the veins in its
 turgid condition, and with        a needle and thread the coats       of the  vessel
 are stitched here and there to the wire,             care being taken to avoid
 puncturing     the lining membrane,          and thus the vessel is converted
 into  a rigid   cup.      Two such cups being prepared, and the lining
 membrane of the vein being everted at the orifice of each so as to
 avoid contact of the blood with any injured tissue,            I found  that, after
 pouring blood to and fro through the air in a small stream from one
 venous receptacle into the other half a dozen times, and closing the
 orifice  of the receptacle to prevent drying, the blood was still more or
 less completely fluid after the lapse of eight or ten hours.                On the
 other hand, if a fine sewing-needle is pushed through the wall of an
 unopened vessel so that its end may lie in the blood, it is found on
 examination, after a certain time has elapsed, that the needle is sur
 rounded with an encrusting          clot.    It is scarcely necessary to point
 out how entirely the ammonia theory and the oxygen theory, as well
 as that   of rest, fail to account    for facts like these.
    While the blood may remain fluid for forty-eight hours in the
jugular vein of a horse or an ox, it coagulates soon after death in the
 heart of very small animals, such as mice ; so that it is obvious that
 the continuance of fluidity in small vessels is not due to their small
 size.
    It  is a very curious question, What is the cause of the blood remain
 ing so much longer fluid in some vessels than in others               ?   I  believe
 that we must accept         it simply   as an ultimate     fact, that just as the
braiu loses its vital properties earlier than the ganglia             of the heart,
so the heart and principal         vascular trunks lose theirs sooner than the
 smaller vessels of the viscera, or than more superficial vessels, be they

large or small.        We       can see a final cause for this,                     so to speak.            So
long as the heart is acting, circulation                       will   be sure to go on                in the
heart and principal trunks              ;   whereas, on the contrary,                     the more su
perficial parts are liable to temporary causes                         of stagnation, and                occa
sionally to what amounts to practical                         severance          from vascular and
nervous connexion with the rest of the body ; and it   so to speak,                   is,
of great importance that the blood should not coagulate so speedily
in the   vessels     of   a   limb thus circumstanced                  as   it    does in the heart
after   it   has ceased to beat.            Were     it   not for this provision, the surgeon
would     be unable to apply                a   tourniquet without fear                of coagulation
occurring in the vessels              of the limb.             As     an    illustration of the im
portance of      a   knowledge of these facts,                I       may mention             a   case that
once occurred in my own practice.                    I     was asked        by  a   surgeon in       a   coun
try district to amputate an arm which he despaired of.                                      The brachial
artery had been wounded, as well                        as   veins and nerves, and at last,
being foiled with the hemorrhage,                          he wound         a    long bandage round
the limb at the seat of the wound as tightly as he possibly could.                                           It
had been in this condition with the bandage thus applied for forty-
eight hours when           I      reached the patient           ;     and the limb had all the
appearance of being dead.                       It   was     perfectly       cold, and any colour
which    it   had was of        a   livid tint.         But having          been lately engaged in
some of the experiments which                    I      have been describing, and having
thus become much impressed with the persistent vitality of the tissues
and the concomitant fluidity of the blood,                       I     determined to give the
limb    a     chance by tying the brachial                      artery.             Before    I      left the
patient's house he had already                   a    pulse at the wrist, and             I     afterwards
had the satisfaction of hearing that the arm had proved                                     a   useful one.
   One of the two arguments in favour of activity                                   on the part          of the
vessels as     a   cause      of the fluidity of the blood having                     been completely
disposed of, let us now consider the other, viz. the rapid coagulation
of blood shed into            a   basin, appearing at first sight to imply                        a   sponta
neous tendency of the blood to coagulate, such as would have to be
counteracted         by   the vessels.          This also       has proved fallacious.
   In    the first place       it   appears that the coagulation,                      after all, does
not go on in       a   basin so suddenly as one would at first sight suppose,
but always commences in contact with the foreign solid.                                       When blood
has been shed into             a   glass jar,     if,   on the first appearance                 of   a   film at
the surface, you introduce                  a   mounted needle             curved at the end                be
                                                                                      2   u   2

  tween the blood and the side of the glass and make a slight rotatory
  movement of the handle, you        see  through the glass the point of the
  needle   detaching a layer of clot whatever part you may examine.
 The process of coagulation having thus commenced in contact with
 the surface of the vessel into which the blood is shed, may under
 favourable circumstances       be ascertained to travel inwards,         like ad
 vancing crystallization,    towards the centre of the mass.         It   appears,
 however, that this extension of the coagulating             process would not
 take place had not the blood been             prepared    for the change by
 contact, during      the process of shedding,       with the injured orifice
 of the blood-vessel and with the surface of the receptacle. I have
 only very recently become       acquainted with the remarkable subtlety
 of the influence exerted upon blood by ordinary solids. I was long
 since struck with the fact, that if I introduced the point of an
 ordinary sewing-needle through the wall of a vein in a sheep's
 foot and     left it for twelve hours      undisturbed,     the clot was      still
 confined to a crust round the point of the needle, implying that
 coagulum has only a very limited          power of extension.       I   thought,
 therefore,    that   by proper   management       it might     be  possible      to
 keep    blood   fluid in  a vessel   of ordinary solid matter lined with
 clot.    But various attempts made with this object failed entirely, till
 I  lately adopted the following expedient.         Having opened the distal
 end of an ox's jugular vein containing blood and held in the vertical
position, taking care to avoid contact of any of the blood with the
wounded edge of the vessel,        I  slipped steadily down into       it a  cylin
drical tube of thin glass, somewhat smaller in diameter than the vein,
open at both ends, and with the lower edge ground              smooth in order
that it might pass readily over the lining membrane, and so disturb
the blood as little as possible by its introduction,        and influence only
the circumferential     parts of its contents.      The tube    was   then kept
pressed down vertically upon the bottom of the vein by a weight, in
a room as free as possible from vibration,        and   I found on examining
it  at the end   of twelve hours that the clot    was a tubular one, consist
ing of a crust about one-eighth of an inch thick next the glass and
the part exposed to the air, but containing           in its interior fluid and
rapidly coagulable blood.       In another such experiment, continued for
twenty-fours,      though the crust of clot was thicker, the central part
still furnished coagulable blood.

   But it may pernaps               be argued        by those who say that the blood
vessels are active in maintaining                   fluidity,     that the small portion of
the vein covering             the end of the tube was acting upon the blood,
which certainly was fluid where in contact with                           it,   the clot being in
the form of          a   tube open at the lower end.              To guard against such              an
objection      I     made the      following experiment           :—  I   extended         a   tube like
that above described               by   means   of thin      sheet gutta percha,           G(fig.6a),

contriving          that the internal surface of the gutta percha should be per
fectly continuous with that of the glass tube as represented in section
in fig.   6    b.      The lower part of the gutta-percha tissue was strength
ened      by   a    ring of soft flexible wire such as  used    veterinary sur
                                                                  is            by
geons for sutures, and the wire                  W     was also extended upwards to the
top of the glass so as to maintain the rigidity of the gutta-percha
portion during its introduction into vein, but at the  a                          same time, from
its softness, permit the gutta-percha part to be bent                             at   a   right angle
after   it   had been introduced,            and so close the orifice of the glass tube

poured blood into it from the jugular vein of an ox.                                           I   wished to
compare the condition of blood which had been simply poured into a
tube, with blood which had been introduced without any disturbance
of its central parts. But in order to make the experiment a fair one,
as it might be said that the blood poured from the vein had been
more exposed to the air than that into which the tube was slipped,                                           I
proceeded in the following way                     :   — I obtained       a long vein containing
plenty of blood, and having first filled the second tube, with the gutta
percha bottom (fig.               6d), by simply pouring blood into it from the
vein,        I   cut off a   portion of the vein which had been thus emptied,
and having tied one end and everted the lining membrane of the
other end, and having also everted the lining membrane of the orifice
of the remainder of the                   vessel      which     was      full, I poured the blood
from the full portion through the air into the empty part.                                          In doing
this     I   had difficulty in getting blood enough, and it passed                                  through
the air in slow drops, and that only when the vein was squeezed                                            by
my warm hand.                  At last, having introduced sufficient for the pur
pose,        I   slipped down the compound tube and bent its gutta-percha
portion,          as represented in fig. 6 c, and left both                          tubes for a while
undisturbed.               At the end of three hours and                  a   half      I   found that the
blood which had been simply poured in was a mass of clot, and fluid
squeezed          from     it yielded no threads of fibrin, coagulation being com
plete.           How long it had          been so      I   do not know.             I   did not examine
the other blood until seven hours and three quarters had expired,
and then found that, just as in the cases where                                 a   simple glass tube
was introduced, the clot was tubular, and the chief part of the blood
was      still fluid in its interior, the only difference being that in this
case     the clot formed a complete capsule, being continued over the
gutta percha instead of being deficient below, as it was when the
vein closed the end of the tube.                        Now     if   we consider the two parts
of this           comparative         experiment,          we   see      that       the receptacles        in
which the blood               was ultimately           contained were precisely similar in
the two cases, viz. glass tubes closed below                                    with gutta percha            ;
and that the blood                    which    was simply            poured into the tube was
much less exposed to the air than the other, and also was not sub
jected, like         it,   to elevation    of temperature,           a   circumstance which pro
motes coagulation             ;   but yet this blood became completely coagulated
in   a   comparatively            short       time,     whereas       the     other after          a   much

longer time was coagulated only                            in    a layer      in contact      with the
foreign solid.           But in the latter                case the blood had been             so intro
duced as to avoid direct action of ordinary matter on any but the
circumferential          parts of it         ;   whereas in the former, though                  poured
quickly, it had run down the side of the glass, and                                        as   a    con
sequence          of this almost momentary contact with the foreign solid,
the central parts, like the circumferential,                           underwent the process of
coagulation.
      Mysterious  this subtle agency of ordinary solids must appear,
                      as
its occurrence is thus matter of experimental demonstration, and by
it the coagulation of blood shed into                           a basin is accounted for ; while
it    is also shown conclusively                 from this experiment that the blood, as
it exists within the          vessels,       has no spontaneous tendency to coagulate,
and therefore that the notion of any action on the part of the blood
vessels to prevent coagulation is entirely out                          of the question. The          pe
culiarity of the living            vessels consists not in any such action upon the
blood, but in the circumstance, remarkable indeed as it                                 is,   that their
lining membrane, when in                    a    state    of health,    is   entirely negative in its
relation to coagulation, and fails to cause that molecular disturbance
or,   if   we may so speak, catalytic                     action which       is   produced upon the
blood by all ordinary matter.
 I       afterwards found that the simplest method of maintaining                                   blood
fluid in      a   vessel composed entirely                 of ordinary matter was to employ
a    glass tube similar to those above described, except that its upper
end was closed           by   a   cork perforated by              a   narrow tube terminating in
a piece       of vulcanized india-rubber                   tubing that could be closed by               a
clamp.         This tube was slipped down into vein till the blood, having
                                                                   a
filled   it   completely, showed itself at the orifice of the india-rubber
tubing, to which the clamp was then applied.                                  The whole apparatus
was now quickly inverted, and the vein was drawn off from over the
mouth of the tube, which was then covered with gutta-percha                                         tissue
to    prevent evaporation.                  After the inverted               tube had      been kept
undisturbed          in the vertical position for nineteen hours and three
quarters,         coagulable blood was obtained from the interior of the
clot.
     We have        seen that      a    clot has but very slight tendency to induce
coagulation in its vicinity unless the blood has been acted on by an
ordinary solid       ;     and    it   is   probable that with perfectly healthy blood

                                                          604                                    [June    11,
it would be unable to produce such an effect at all.                               This appears to
me      to be very interesting                    physiologically,          but especially so with
reference            to pathology.            I   must not go now fully into the circum
stances           that lead me to it              ;    but   I   may express the opinion            I    have
formed, that clot must be regarded as living tissue in its relation to
the blood.              It      is no doubt a very peculiar                 form of tissue, in this
respect, that it is soft, easily lacerable, and easily impaired                                         in its
vital properties.                 If     disturbed, as in an aneurism,             it will readily         be
brought            into that condition which leads to the deposition of more
clot      ;    but   if undisturbed, it           not only fails to induce further coagula
tion, but seems to undergo spontaneous organization.                                        I   have seen a
clot in the right side of the heart, and extending into the pulmonary
artery and its branches, unconnected with the lining membrane                                               of
auricle or ventricle or with the pulmonary artery except at one small
spot where it had a slight adhesion, developed into perfect fibrous
tissue by virtue, it would                        appear, of its own inherent                   properties.
Another observation which                         I   once made, and which then completely
puzzled me, now seems capable of explanation.                                    In laying open the
blood-vessels of a dead body,                         I   observed in many of the veins a deli
cate white lace-like                     tissue which        evidently must have            been    formed
from a clot.              This       I   now believe to have had the same relation to
the coagulum                  as the       flimsy cellular             tissue of old    adhesions         has
to lymph.
     It       may not be altogether superfluous to mention some other facts
illustrativeof the active influence of ordinary matter in promoting
coagulation, and the negative character of the lining membrane of
the vessels.              I   find that a needle introduced into one of the veins                           of
the foot of a sheep for a much shorter time than is necessary to pro
duce the first appearance of the actual deposit of fibrin upon                                     it,   leads
after         a   while to coagulation                 where the needle          had lain — in other
words, that           a   foreign solid,          by   a   short period of action on the blood,
brings about           a      change that results in coagulation, though the blood
still         lies in the       living     vessels.       I     have    also ascertained that after
blood has been made to coagulate in                              a   particular vessel by introducing
a   needle into           it,   if   the coagulum as well as needle                    is   removed, and
more fluid blood                is   allowed to pass in, this blood remains fluid for an
indefinite period, showing that the needle had not impaired the pro
perties of the vessel by its presence                        ;   so that the previous coagulation

1863.]                                             605
must be attributed not to any loss of power in the vein, but simply
to the action  of the foreign solid.
     In seeking for an analogy to this remarkable                               effect    of ordinary
solids upon the blood, we are naturally led to the beautiful observa
tions of Professor              Graham,          lately       published    in the Philosophical
Transactions.               He has there shown what insignificant                          causes        are
often sufficient to induce a change from the fluid or soluble to the
"pectous," or insoluble condition of "colloidal" forms of matter.
Indeed Mr. Graham has himself alluded to the coagulation of fibrin
as being probably               an example        of such       a transition.
     There is, however, another remarkable circumstance that must                                        be
taken into consideration, of which                        I   myself have been only recently
aware,     and which may be new to several Fellows of the Society                                   ;   and
that     is,   that in spite of the influence of an ordinary solid the liquor
sanguinis        is   not capable of coagulating per se.                         It    was       observed
many years ago by my colleague, Professor Andrew Buchanan,                                                of
Glasgow,         that the fluid of           a   hydrocele,        generally regarded as mere
serum, coagulated firmly                 if   a    little coagulum of blood diffused in
water was added to               it— an      effect which         he was disposed to attribute
to the agency of the white corpuscles*.                              I     repeated Dr. Andrew
Buchanan's            observations last year, and satisfied myself first that the
diffused clot did not act simply by providing solid particles to serve
as     starting-points           for   the    coagulating          process.     I        tried    various
different       materials in       a   finely divided state, and found that none of
them, except blood, produced the slightest effect.                               But  I     found that
if   a   mixture        of serum and red corpuscles from                        a   clot was added
to some of this hydrocele-fluid,                     it       was soon converted into             a     firm
solid mass.            If   a   small quantity of the serum and corpuscles was
dropped into the fluid and allowed to subside without stirring, coagu
lation rapidly took               place in those parts where the red corpuscles
lay, while other parts                 of the fluid remained for                a     long time un-
coagulated.            This     seemed       to indicate         that the red corpuscles had
a    special virtue in inducing                  the change.        I     confess, however, that
till very lately       I     was inclined to suppose that in the hydrocele-fluid
the fibrin must be in some peculiar spurious form.                              We know that the
buffy coat of the horse's blood coagulates in                         a   glass without addition
of clot, and       we know that           lymph coagulates            ;   so thatI    did not doubt

 that liquor sanguinis would always undergo the change when influenced
by ordinary          matter.       But     an observation           which      I   made not many
 days ago, shows that this was                 a   mistake.           I    obtained the jugular
 vein of a horse, and having kept it for a while in a vertical position
 till   I   could    see through          its transparent           coats that the          red cor
 puscles had fallen from the upper part,                       I   removed all bloody tissue
 from that part of the vein, and punctured                            it   so as to let out the
 liquor sanguinis          into     a glass.       Finding           after     eighteen         minutes
 that the liquid had not                 begun to coagulate,               I   added a drop of
 serum and corpuscles to a portion                   of      it,   and within seven             minutes
 there was     a    clot wherever the corpuscles lay, whereas the rest                           of the
fluid was still very imperfectly coagulated after another half hour
had elapsed. That the liquor sanguinis to which no addition had
been made           coagulated at all, was sufficiently                    explained by micro
scopic investigation,             which    showed not only abundant                       white    cor
puscles, but also several isolated red ones that had not subsided.                                This
observation was made three hours after the death of the horse, but                                     I
obtained essentially similar               results on repeating the experiment in
another horse an hour after death                   ;   so that there can             be no      doubt
whatever that the fibrin was in the same condition as                                  it   is   in the
blood-vessels of       a   living animal.          The observation appears also par
ticularly satisfactory on this account, that the liquor sanguinis was
not separated from the corpuscles                       by
                                          any process of transudation
through the walls of the blood-vessels, which might                                be conceived        to
involve retention of some constituent of the liquid, which, though in
solution,     might               through their pores, but simply
                        be unable to pass
by the subsidence of the corpuscles, which must have left all the
materials of the liquor sanguinis behind them.                               Hence    it   is   proved
beyond question            that   if   the liquor sanguinis                could     be    separated
completely from the blood-corpuscles,                    it   would resemble the fluid                 of
hydrocele in being incapable of coagulation when shed into                                 a    cup.
    Now this struck         me as    a    very satisfactory and beautiful truth,                       in
asmuch as       it    clears away all the old mystery                        of the distinction
between      inflammatory exudations and dropsical effusions.                              Dropsical
effusions, exhibiting          little disposition         to coagulate, have been                 sup
posed to consist almost exclusively of serum, and the exudation                                        of
the entire liquor sanguinis has been                      regarded         as the special         cha
racteristic of inflammation          ;    and very unsatisfactory theories have been

  1863.]                                 607
 put forward by ingenious pathologists to account for this difference.
 But it now appears that        a dropsical    effusion, like that of hydrocele,
 is undistinguishable     from pure liquor sanguinis.
     Various   dropsical    effusions   have    been    lately    investigated   with
 reference to their coagulability on the addition of blood-corpuscles, by
 Dr. Schmidt of Dorpat, who finds that while they differ from one
 another in the amount of water they contain (just as is the case
 with serum filtered artificially through animal membranes under dif
 ferent degrees    of pressure), yet they        are  all but universally coagu-
 lable.    Schmidt    has also   carried the investigation further.          He has
 found that by chemical means he can extract from the red corpuscles
 a soluble material which,       when added to these exudations, leads to
 coagulation.     In other words, he shows that the corpuscles do not
 act as living cells, but by virtue of a chemical material which they
 contain, which can be used in the state of solution, free from any
 solid particles whatever.          He found also that the aqueous humour
 made a dropsical effusion coagulate, and that the same effect was
 produced by a material extracted from the non-vascular part of the
 cornea.     Hence he regards the blood-corpuscles              as only resembling
 other forms of tissue in possessing this property.                  These observa
 tions are extremely interesting,        if  trustworthy     ;  and that they are
 so,  I  do not at all doubt      ;  but having only read Schmidt's papers
 within the last day or two, I have not yet had opportunity of verify
ing his statements*.
     It remains to be ascertained what share the material derived from
the corpuscles has in the composition of the fibrin.               Schmidt inclines
to the opinion     that the fibrin is probably composed, in about equal
proportions,    of  a substance furnished         by them and one present in
the liquor sanguinis.        If this  be true, the action      of  an ordinary solid
in determining      the union of the components of the fibrin may be
compared to the operation of spongy platinum in promoting the com
bination of oxygen and hydrogen.
   * Since this lecture was delivered I     have verified an important observation
made by Schmidt, viz. that a given amount of corpuscles causes complete        coagu
lation of only a limited quantity of hydrocele-fluid.       From this he draws the
inference, that the action of the corpuscles cannot be of the nature of fermenta
tion — the coagulative efficacy of the corpuscles being not continued indefinitely,
but becoming exhausted in the process of coagulation. For Schmidt's papers,
see Archiv fur Anat. Phvs. &c. 1861 and 1862.

    It may    be  asked, How comes it that when the blood of a horse is
shed into a cup, the buffy layer coagulates as rapidly,            or nearly so,
as the lower parts      rich in corpuscles   1
    This  is indeed a question well worthy        of careful study. We know
that the liquor sanguinis left by the subsidence of the red corpuscles
within a healthy vein is incapable of coagulating when shed, except
in a slow manner, which is accounted for by the corpuscles that remain
behind in it.        Hence it appears that when the blood as a whole is
shed into a glass, the agency of the ordinary solid leads the corpus
cles to communicate        to the   liquor sanguinis, before they subside,         a
material or at least an influence which confers upon it a disposition
to coagulate, though       it still remains fluid for    some   time after they
have left   it.    Just  as we have seen that a very short       time of action
of the ordinary solid upon the blood           as a whole is sufficient    to give
rise to coagulation, so we now see that, provided an ordinary solid be
in operation, the presence        of the corpuscles for but     a  little while is
enough to make the liquor sanguinis spontaneously coagulable, though
not immediately solidified.         We shall  see, before concluding, an      illus
tration of the importance of this fact to pathology.
    It remains to be added, that serous membranes resemble the lining
membrane of the blood-vessels in their relations to the blood, as is
implied by      John Hunter's observation that blood, which had lain for
several    days in a hydrocele, coagulated when let out.               The same
thing   is well illustrated    in a frog prepared like this which           I   now
exhibit.      About four hours      ago, a knife having been passed between
the brain and cord to deprive the creature of voluntary motion in the
limbs and trunk, the peritoneal cavity was laid open in the middle
line, and its edges being kept raised and drawn aside                  by pins,    I
seized   the apex of the ventricle        of the heart with forceps and re
moved it with scissors.         In  a  short time the whole of the animal's
blood was in the peritoneum, and it may be seen that it is still fluid
in spite of this long-continued         exposure.      When   I first performed
the experiment three years and a half ago, the weather being cool
 (about 45° Fahr.) and a piece of damp lint being kept suspended above
the frog to prevent evaporation and access of dust, I found that the
blood remained fluid in the peritoneal cavity for four days, except a
thin film    on the surface, and a crust       of clot on the wounded part        of
the heart     ;  but a piece    of clean glass placed in the blood in the

 1863.]                                 009
peritoneum became speedily coated with coagulum.                      Here, it will be
observed, not merely the liquor sanguinis, but the corpuscles also
were present in the serous cavity, yet no coagulation took place in
contact with its walls.
    I think it probable, though not yet proved, that all living tissues
have these properties with reference to the blood.                     We know that
the interstices of the cellular tissue contain coagulable fluid, and                    I
have seen anasarcous liquid coagulate after emission                ; but this indeed
may possibly have been merely liquor sanguinis, coagulating in con
sequence    of slight admixture of blood-corpuscles              from the wounds
made    in obtaining it.
   Looking now at the principal results which we have arrived at, it
must, in the first place, be admitted that the ammonia theory is to be
discarded as entirely fallacious.         The fact that this theory           is exceed
ingly plausible,    and has been supported            by many ingenious argu
ments and experiments, is of course no reason               why     we should retain
it if  unsound.     On the contrary, the more specious it                 is the more
necessary    is  it that it should       be effectually     cleared away         ; for it
mystifies the subject of coagulation most seriously               ;   and   I  may say,
for my own part, that it has cost me an amount of experimental
labour of which the illustrations         brought     forward this evening con
vey but little idea.     Still   these have been,      I trust, sufficient to show
that the coagulation of the blood is in no degree connected with the
evolution of ammonia, any more than with the influence of oxygen
or of rest.     The real   cause     of the coagulation        of the blood, when
shed from the body, is the influence exerted upon it by ordinary
matter, the contact of which for a very brief period effects a change
in the blood, inducing a mutual           reaction between its solid and fluid
constituents,    in which the corpuscles impart to the liquor san
guinis a disposition to coagulate.          This reaction is probably simply
chemical in its nature ; yet its product, the fibrin, when mixed
with blood-corpuscles       in the form of          an    undisturbed        coagulum,
resembles healthy      living tissues in being incapable               of that cata
lytic action upon the blood which is            effected   by all ordinary solids,
and also by the tissues themselves when deprived of their vital pro
perties.
   These principles have, of course, very extensive applications to the
study    of disease  ;  but    I   must content myself with alluding very

briefly    to inflammation,     the    most important      of all pathological
conditions.
    If   we inquire   what is the great peculiarity       of inflamed parts in
relation to the blood as examined by the naked eye, we see that it
consists in a tendency to induce coagulation in their vicinity — im
plying,     according   to the conclusions just stated, that the affected
tissues have lost for the time being their vital properties, and com
port themselves like ordinary solids.          Thus, when     an artery or vein
is inflamed, coagulation occurs upon its interior, in spite of the cur
rent of blood, precisely as would take place         if it had been artificially
deprived of its vital properties.         On   one  occasion   I  simulated   the
characteristic adherent clot of Phlebitis by treating the jugular vein
of  a  living  sheep  with caustic ammonia, and then allowing the circu
lation to go on through the vessel for a while, when, on slitting it
up, I found its lining membrane studded with grains of pink fibrin
which could be detached only by scraping firmly with the edge                of a
knife.      Again, comparing     an inflammatory     exudation into the peri
cardium or into the interstices of the cellular tissue with dropsical
effusions into the same situations, we are struck with the fact that,
while the liquor sanguinis effused in dropsy remains fluid, the inflam
matory product       coagulates.     Now   we know     that in intense inflam
mation      the capillaries  are choked     more or less with accumulated
blood-corpuscles,     which must cause great increase in the pressure          of
the blood upon their walls       ;  and from what we know of the effect of
venous obstruction       in causing dropsical effusion of liquor sanguinis
through increased pressure, we are sure that we have in the inflam
matory state the physical conditions for a similar transudation of fluid
through the walls of the capillaries.         And the natural interpretation
of the difference in the two       cases as regards coagulation seems to be,
 that whereas in dropsy         the fluid is forced through         the pores of
healthy vessels, in inflammation the capillary parietes have lost their
healthy condition,      and act like ordinary matter; so that the liquor
 sanguinis, having been subjected, immediately before effusion, to the
combined influence of the injured tissue and the blood-corpuscles,
has acquired a disposition        to coagulate,   just like the buffy coat of
horses' blood shed into a glass, or like the frog's liquor sanguinis
filtered by Muller from its corpuscles, the injured vessels acting upon
the blood like the filter.

   This view of the condition of intensely inflamed parts is exactly
that to which I was led some years ago by a microscopic investiga
tion, the results of which were detailed in a paper* that received the
honour of   a place in the     Philosophical Transactions.         It was there
shown, as   I think  I may venture to say, that the tissues generally are
capable  of being reduced under the action of irritants to        a state quite
distinct from death, but in which they are nevertheless temporarily
deprived of all vital power, and that inflammatory          congestion is due
to   the blood-corpuscles     acquiring   adhesiveness such as they have
outside the body, in consequence of the irritated tissues acting to
wards them like ordinary solids.
   I  cannot avoid expressing my satisfaction that this inquiry into the
coagulation of the blood has furnished          independent confirmation     of
my previous conclusions regarding the nature of inflammation.

   The molecular mobility of        gases  is here considered in reference
chiefly to the passage of gases, under pressure, through a thin porous
plate or septum, and to the partial separation of mixed gases which
can be effected,  as will  be shown,    by such means.      The investigation

arose out     of  a renewed   and somewhat protracted inquiry regarding
the diffusion      of gases  (depending      upon the same molecular         mobi
lity), and    has afforded certain new results       which may prove to       be   of
interest in a theoretical     as  well as in a   practical point of view.
    In   the diffusiometer, as first constructed, a plain cylindrical glass
tube, rather less than an inch in diameter and about ten inches in
length, was simply closed at one end by a porous plate of plaster of
paris, about one-third       of  an inch    in thickness, and thus converted
into    a gas   receiver*.    A   superior material for the porous plate is
now found in the artificially compressed graphite of            Mr. Brockedon,
of the quality used for making writing-pencils.                This material is
sold in London in small cubic masses about 2 inches square.                 A cube
may easily be cut into slices of a millimetre           or two in thickness       by
means of a saw of steel spring.           By rubbing the surface of the        slice
without     wetting    it upon    a flat sand-stone,     the thickness     may be
further reduced to about one-half of            a millimetre.    A   circular disk
 of this graphite, which is like      a wafer in thickness but possesses con
siderable tenacity, is attached by resinous cement to one end               of the
glass tube above described, so as to close it and form a diffusiometer.
 The tube is filled with hydrogen gas over a mercurial trough, the
porosity of the graphite plate being counteracted for the time by
 covering    it tightly with  a  thin sheet   of gutta percha.     On afterwards
 removing the latter, gaseous diffusion immediately takes place through
 the pores of the graphite.        The whole hydrogen will        leave   the tube
in forty minutes or an hour, and is replaced by a much smaller pro
 portion of atmospheric air (about one fourth), as is to be expected
from the law of the diffusion           of   gases.    During the process, the
 mercury will rise in the tube,      if allowed, forming a column of several
 inches in height     — a fact which illustrates strikingly the intensity of
 the force with which the interpenetration of different gases is effected.
 The native or mineral graphite is of         a lamellar structure, and appears
 to have little or no porosity.       It  cannot be substituted for the artifi
 cial graphite as a diffusion-septum.            Unglazed   earthenware      comes
 next in value to graphite for this purpose.
     The pores of artificial graphite appear        to be really so minute, that

  a gas in mass cannot penetrate the plate at all.                     It  seems   to be
  molecules only which can pass             ;   and these may be supposed to pass
  wholly unimpeded by friction,                for the smallest pores that       can   be
  imagined to exist in the graphite must be tunnels in magnitude to the
  ultimate atoms of a gaseous             body.    The   sole motive agency appears
  to be that intestine movement             of molecules which is now generally
  recognized as an essential property of the gaseous condition of matter.
     According to the physical hypothesis now generally received*, a
 gas is represented as consisting of solid and perfectly elastic spherical
 particles or atoms, which move in all directions, and are animated
 with different       degrees     of velocity in different     gases.     Confined   in a
 vessel, the moving particles are constantly             impinging against its sides
 and occasionally against each other, and such collisions                    take place
 without any loss of motion, owing to the perfect elasticity of the par
 ticles.    Now if the containing vessel be porous, like a diffusiometer,
 then gas      is projected        through the open channels, by the atomic
 motion described, and escapes.                 Simultaneously the external air or
 gas, whatever       it may     be, is carried inwards      in the  same manner, and
 takes the place of the gas which leaves                  the vessel.     To the    same
 atomic or molecular             movement is due the elastic force, with the
 power to resist compression, possessed                 by gases.      The molecular
 movement is accelerated by heat and retarded by cold, the tension
 of the   gas being increased         in the first instance and diminished in the
 second.      Even when the         same gas is present both       within and without
 the vessel, and is therefore in contact with both sides of the porous
plate, the movement is sustained without abatement
                                                                     — molecules con
tinuing to enter and           leave  in equal number, although nothing of the
kind is indicated by change of volume or otherwise.                     If the gases in
communication           be different but possess        sensibly the same specific
gravity and molecular velocity, as nitrogen and carbonic oxide do, an
interchange       of molecules         also   takes place without any change in
volume.        With      gases    opposed of unequal          density  and molecular
velocity, the amount of penetration ceases of course to be equal in
both directions.

  These observations are preliminary                  to the consideration                     of the
passage through         a graphite   plate, in one direction only, of gas under
pressure, or under the influence of its own elastic force.                                It   is to be
supposed that a vacuum is maintained on one side of the porous sep
tum, and that air or some other gas, under a constant pressure, is in
contact with the other side.              Now    a gas may pass into a vacuum                          in
three different        modes, or in two modes besides that immediately
before us.
   1.   The    gas may enter the vacuum by passing                         through         a minute
aperture in a thin plate, such as a puncture in platinum foil made by
a fine steel point.          The rate of   passage      of different          gases is then re
gulated      by their specific gravities,         according             to a pneumatic                law
which was deduced by Professor                   John Robison               from         Torricelli's
well-known      theorem of the velocity of efflux of fluids.                         A   gas rushes
into a vacuum with the velocity which a heavy body would acquire
by falling from the height of an atmosphere composed of the gas in
question, and supposed to be of uniform density throughout.                                        The
height of the uniform            atmosphere      will     be inversely as the specific
gravity of the gas, the atmosphere of hydrogen, for instance, sixteen
times higher than that of oxygen.                But      as the velocity acquired by a
heavy body in falling is not directly as the height, but as the square
root of the height, the rate of flow of different gases into a vacuum
will    be   inversely     as the square root      of their respective densities.
The velocity of oxygen being 1,            that of hydrogen will be 4, the square
root of 16.   This law has been experimentally verified*. The times
of the effusion of gases, as I have spoken of                       it,
                                                 are similar to those
of the law of molecular diffusion          ;   but   it   is   important to observe that
the phenomena of effusion and diffusion are distinct and essentially
different in their nature.           The effusion movement affects masses of
gas, the diffusion movement affects               molecules         ;   and   a   gas     is   usually
carried by the former kind of impulse with                     a   velocity many thousand
times greater than by the latter.               The effusion velocity of air                     is   the
same as the velocity          of sound.
   2.   If   the aperture of efflux be in         a   plate        of increased thickness,
and so becomes           a   tube, the effusion-rates              of   gases   are disturbed.
The rates of flow of different             gases, however, assume                    again     a   con
stant ratio to each           other when the capillary tube                     is   considerably

elongated, when the length exceeds the diameter at least 4000 times.
These     new proportions       of efflux   are  the rates    of the   " Capillary
Transpiration of Gases" *.           The  rates were found to be the same        in
a capillary    tube composed of copper as they are in a tube of glass,
and appear to be independent           of the material of the capillary. A
film of   gas  no doubt adheres to the inner surface of the tube, and the
friction   is really that   of gas upon gas, and is consequently unaffected
by the nature of the tube-substance.             The rates of transpiration are
not governed by specific gravity,           and are indeed singularly unlike
the rates    of effusion.
    The transpiration-velocity        of oxygen being     1, that of chlorine     is
 1 -5, that  of hydrogen 2-26, of ether vapour at low temperatures the
same     or nearly the same number as hydrogen, of nitrogen and
carbonic     oxide   half the velocity of hydrogen,         of olefiant  gas,  am
monia, and cyanogen 2 (double or nearly double that of oxygen), of
carbonic acid 1*376, and of the gas of marshes 1*815.                 In the same
gas the transpirability of equal volumes               increases with     density,
whether occasioned by cold or pressure.             The transpiration-ratios of
gases appear to be      in constant relation with no other known property
of the    same gases, and they form a class         of phenomena remarkably
isolated from all else at present known of gases.
    There is   one property     of transpiration    immediately     bearing upon
the penetration of the graphite plate by gases.              The capillary offers
to the passage      of gas a   resistance analogous to that of friction, pro
 portional to the surface, and consequently increasing as the tube or
 tubes are multiplied in number and diminished in diameter, with the
 area of discharge preserved constant.            The resistance to the    passage
 of a liquid through a capillary was observed by Poiseuille to be
nearly as the fourth power of the diameter of the tube.                  In gases
 the resistance also rapidly increases ; but in what ratio, has not been
 observed.     The consequence, however, is certain, that         as the diameter
 of the capillaries may be diminished beyond any assignable limit,               so
 the flow may be retarded indefinitely,          and caused at last to become
too small to be sensible.          We may therefore have         a mass   of capil
laries of which the passages         form a large aggregate, but which are
individually too small to permit        a sensible flow   of gas under pressure.

the congeries of capillary tubes.            Indeed    the state     of porosity     de
scribed appears to be more or less closely approached by all loosely
aggregated mineral masses, such as lime plaster, stucco, chalk, baked

compacted by pressure, and in the highest degree perhaps by artifi

    3.  A  plate of artificial   graphite, although it appears to be practi
cally impenetrable        to gas   by either of the two modes of passage
previously     described, is readily penetrated             by the agency of the
molecular     or diffusive movement of gases.               This appears on com
paring the time required for the          passage   of equal volumes of different
gases    under    a constant     pressure.        Of the following three gases,
oxygen,     hydrogen,      and carbonic       acid, the time required            for the
passage    of  an equal volume       of  each    through     a  capillary glass tube,
 in similar circumstances      as to pressure and temperature, was             formerly
 observed to be as follows       :—

 of a  column    of mercury of 100 millimetres in height, in times which
 are as follows    : —

    It  appears then that the times of passage               through the graphite
 plate have no relation to the capillary transpiration-times                      of the
 same gases first quoted above.           The new times in question, however,
 show a close relation       to the square roots      of the densities of the re
 spective gases, as is seen in the last Table             ;   and so far they agree
with theoretical times of diffusion usually ascribed to the same gases.
    The experiments were varied by causing the gases to pass into a
Torricellian vacuum, and consequently under the full pressure of the

   This penetration of the graphite plate by gases appears to be
entirely due to their own proper molecular motion, quite unaided by
transpiration.        It seems    to offer the simplest possible exhibition of
the molecular        or diffusive    movement.      This pure result is to        be
ascribed to the wonderfully fine porosity of the graphite.               The inter
stitial spaces,    or channels, appear to be sufficiently small to extin
guish transpiration, or the        passage  of  masses, entirely.     The graphite
becomes a molecular         sieve, allowing molecules only to pass        through.
   With   a plate     of stucco, the penetration of gases under pressure is
very rapid, and the volumes of air and hydrogen passing in equal
times are as 1 to 2*891, which is a number for hydrogen intermediate
between     its   transpiration-volume        2-04   and  diffusion-volume      3-8,
showing that the passage through stucco is a mixed result.
   With    a    plate of biscuitware,       2-2  millimetres    in thickness,    the
volume of hydrogen          rose to 3-754    (air= 1), approaching closely to
3*8, the molecular ratio.
   The rate of     passage    of a gas  through graphite appeared also to be
closely proportional to the pressure.
   Further, hydrogen was found to penetrate through a graphite plate
into a vacuum, with sensibly the same absolute velocity as it diffused
into air, establishing the important fact that the impelling force is the
same in both movements.             The molecular mobility may therefore be
spoken of as the diffusive movement of gases              ;  the passage    of  gas
through a porous plate into vacuum,            as diffusion   in  one direction or
single diffusion    ;  and ordinary diffusion, or the passage of two gases
in opposite directions,       as double, compound,      or reciprocal diffusion.
   Atmolysis. — A partial separation of mixed             gases and vapours       of
unequal diffusibility can be effected by allowing           the mixture to per
meate through a graphite plate into a vacuum, as was to be expected
from the preceding views.          As this method of analysis has       a practical
character    and admits of wide application, it may be convenient to

distinguish    it by a peculiar name.      The amount of the separation is
in proportion to the pressure, and attains its maximum when the
gases pass into a nearly perfect vacuum.             A variety of experiments
were made on this subject, of which perhaps the most interesting
were those upon the concentration         of the oxygen in atmospheric air.
When     a  portion of air confined in a jar is allowed to penetrate into a
vacuum through        graphite   or   unglazed earthenware,         the nitrogen
should pass more rapidly than the oxygen in the proportion              of 1 -0668
to 1, and the proportion        of oxygen be proportionally increased in
the air left behind in the jar.        The increase in the oxygen actually
observed when the air in the       jar was reduced from        1 volume
                   To 0-5      volume, was (V48 per cent.

                       0-0625      „      „    2-02        „
Or, the oxygen increased from 21 to 23-02 per cent. in the last
sixteenth part of air left behind in the jar.
    The most remarkable      effects  of separation    are produced      by means
of the tube atmolyser.        This   is simply     a narrow tube     of unglazed
earthenware, such as a tobacco-pipe stem two feet in length, which
is placed within a shorter tube of glass and secured in its position by
corks, so as to appear like a Liebig's condenser.             The glass tube is
placed in communication with an air-pump, and the annular space be
tween the two tubes is maintained as nearly vacuous as possible.                Air
or any other mixed gas is then allowed to flow in a stream along the
 clay tube, and collected as it issues.         The    gas   so atmolysed     is of
 course reduced in volume, much gas penetrating through the pores                of
 the clay tube into the air-pump vacuum          ;  and the slower the gas is
 collected the greater the proportional      loss.    In  the gas collected, the
 denser constituent    of the mixture is thus concentrated in         an arithme
 tical ratio, while the volume of the gas is reduced in a geometrical
 ratio.    In one experiment the proportion         of oxygen in the air after
 traversing    the atmolyser was increased to 24-5 per cent., or 16-7
 upon 100 oxygen originally present in the air.            With   gases differing
 so much    in density and diffusibility as oxygen and hydrogen, the sepa
 ration is of course much more considerable. The explosive mixture of
two volumes of hydrogen and one volume of oxygen, gave oxygen con

                                                           — The   diffusiometer
 was much improved           in construction     by Prof. Bunsen,      from   the
 application   of   a lever    arrangement to raise and depress         the tube
 in the mercurial       trough.       But the    mass   of stucco forming     the
 porous plate in his instrument was too voluminous, in my opinion,
 and, from being dried by heat, had probably               detached itself from
 the walls of the glass tube.           The result obtained of 3-4 for hy
 drogen, air being     1,  is,  I  understand,    no longer insisted    upon by
 that illustrious physicist.        It is indeed curious     that my old expe
 riments generally rather exceeded          than fell short of the theoretical
 number for hydrogen,          */          OR=3-7997.
                                                            With stucco    as the
 material, the cavities in the porous plate form about one-fourth of its
 bulk, and affect sensibly the ratio in question, according          as they are
or are not included in the capacity of the instrument.                Beginning
 the diffusion    always with these cavities filled with hydrogen,            the
numbers now obtained with a stucco plate of 12 millims. in thick
ness, dried   without heat, were 3-783, 3-8, and 3739 when the volume
of the cavities of stucco      is added to the air and hydrogen, and 3*931,
3*949, and 3*883 when such addition is not made to these volumes.
The graphite plate, on the other hand, being thin, and the volume
of its pores too minute to require to         be taken into account, its action
is not attended with the same uncertainty.               With  a graphite   plate
of   2 millims.   in thickness, the number for hydrogen into air              was
3*876, and of hydrogen           into oxygen 4*124, instead of 4.        With a
graphite plate of    1 millim. in thickness, hydrogen       gave 3*993 to air   1.
With    a graphite plate      of  0*5  millim. in thickness, the proportional
number     for hydrogen to air rose to 3*984, 4*068, and 4*067.                 A
similar   departure    from the theoretical        number was observed when
hydrogen was diffused into oxygen or carbonic acid, instead of air.
All  these experiments were made over mercury and              with dried  gases.
It  appears that the numbers are most in accordance with theory when
the graphite plate is thick, and the diffusion slow in consequence.             If
the diffusion be very rapid, as it is with the thin plates, something
like a current is possibly formed in the channels of the graphite,

taking the direction of the hydrogen and carrying              hack in mass a
little air, or the slower    gas, whatever       it may be.  I  cannot account
otherwise for the slight        predominance which the lighter and faster
gas appears always to acquire        in diffusing through the porous septum.
         Speculative ideas respecting the constitution        of matter.
    It is conceivable that the various kinds of matter, now recognized
as different    elementary substances, may possess one and the same
ultimate or atomic molecule existing in different conditions of move
ment.      The essential unity of matter is an hypothesis in harmony
with the equal action of gravity upon all bodies. We know the
anxiety with which this point was investigated by Newton, and the
care   he took    to ascertain that every kind of substance, "metals,
stones, woods, grain,       salts, animal     substances, &c.,"   are  similarly
 accelerated in falling, and are therefore equally heavy.
    In  the condition of gas, matter is deprived        of numerous and vary
ing properties with which it appears invested when in the form of a
liquid or solid.      The   gas exhibits    only a few grand and simple fea
tures.     These again may all be dependent upon atomic and molecular
mobility.      Let us imagine     one   kind of substance only to exist, pon
derable matter      ;  and further, that matter is divisible into ultimate
atoms, uniform in size and weight.              We shall have    one  substance
and a common          atom.     With the atom at rest the uniformity of
matter would be        perfect.    But the atom possesses always more or
less motion, due,     it must   be assumed, to a    primordial impulse.    This
motion     gives rise to volume.        The more rapid the movement the
greater the space occupied by the atom, somewhat as the orbit of a
planet widens with the degree of projectile velocity.            Matter is thus
made to differ only in being lighter or denser matter.             The specific
motion    of  an atom being inalienable,       light matter is no longer con
vertible into heavy matter.            In  short, matter of different density
forms different substances — different inconvertible         elements as they
have been considered.
    What has already been said is not meant to apply to the gaseous
volumes which we have occasion to measure and practically deal
with, but to a lower order of molecules or atoms. The combining
atoms hitherto spoken of are therefore not the molecules of which
the movement                     affected by heat, with gaseous expansion as
                   is sensibly

the result.     The  gaseous   molecule must itself be viewed as composed
of   a group or system    of the preceding inferior atoms, following as a
unit laws similar   to  those which regulate its constituent atoms.            We
have indeed carried one step backward and applied to the lower order
of atoms ideas suggested by the         gaseous   molecule, as views derived
from the solar system      are extended to the subordinate          system of a
planet and its satellites.     The  advance   of science may     further require
an indefinite repetition of such steps of molecular division.                 The
gaseous molecule is then a reproduction of the inferior atom on a
higher   scale.   The molecule or system is reached which is affected
by heat, the diffusive molecule, of which the movement is the subject
of observation and measurement. The diffusive molecules are also
to be supposed uniform        in weight, but to vary in velocity of move
ment, in correspondence with their constituent atoms.               Accordingly
the molecular volumes of different elementary substances have the
same relation to each other as the subordinate atomic volumes               of the
same substances.
   But further,   these more and less mobile or        light and heavy forms
of matter have    a singular relation connected      with equality of volume.
Equal volumes of two of them            can  coalesce    together, unite their
movement, and form a new atomic group, retaining                 the whole, the
half, or  some simple proportion      of the original movement and         conse
quent volume.      This is chemical combination.         It  is directly an affair
of volume, and only indirectly connected with weight.                 Combining
weights are different, because the densities, atomic and molecular, are
different.    The volume of combination          is uniform,      but the fluids
measured vary in density.           This fixed combining           measure — the
metron of simple substances — weighs        1  for hydrogen, 16 for oxygen,
and so on with the other       " elements."
   To the preceding statements respecting atomic and molecular                mo
bility, it remains to be added that the hypothesis admits of another
expression.     As in the theory of light we have the alternative hypo
theses of emission and undulation, so in molecular mobility the motion
may be assumed to reside either in separate atoms and molecules, or
in  a fluid medium    caused   to undulate.     A special   rate  of vibration or
pulsation originally imparted to a portion of the fluid medium enlivens
that portion of matter with an individual existence, and constitutes it
 a distinct substance or element.

     With respect to the different       states  of gas, liquid, and solid, it may
 be  observed that there is no real incompatibility with each other in
 these  physical    conditions.      They are often found together in the
 same substance.       The liquid and the solid conditions supervene upon
 the gaseous     condition rather than supersede it.            Gay-Lussac made
 the remarkable observation that the vapours emitted by ice and water,
 both at 0°    C,  are   of exactly equal tension.         The  passage from the
 liquid to the solid state is not made apparent in the volatility of
 water.    The liquid and solid conditions do not appear as the extinc
 tion or suppression of the gaseous           condition, but something super
 added to that condition.           The three conditions (or constitutions)
probably always coexist in every liquid or solid substance, but one
predominates over the others.             In  the general properties    of matter
we have, indeed, to include still further (1) the remarkable loss of
elasticity in vapours under great pressure, which is distinguished by
Mr. Faraday      as the   Caignard-Latour       state, after the name   of its dis
coverer, and is now undergoing             an investigation    by Dr. Andrews,
which may be expected to throw much light upon its nature                     ; (2)
the colloidal condition or constitution,         which intervenes between the
liquid and crystalline     states,  extending into both and affecting proba
bly all kinds of solid and liquid matter in a greater or less degree.
The predominance of a certain physical state in a substance appears
to be a distinction       of  a  kind with those distinctions recognized in
natural history as being produced by unequal development.                   Lique
faction or solidification may therefore not involve the suppression of
either the atomic or the molecular movement, but only the restriction
of its range. The hypothesis of atomic movement has               been elsewhere
assumed,    irrespective of the gaseous condition, and is applied by            Dr.
Williamson     to the elucidation     of a remarkable class of chemical re
actions which have their seat in a mixed liquid.
    Lastly, molecular or diffusive mobility has an obvious bearing upon
the communication of heat to gases by contact with liquid or solid
surfaces.     The impact of the       gaseous    molecule, upon a surface pos
sessing a different     temperature, appears to be the condition for the
transference of heat, or the heat movement, from one to the other.
The more rapid the molecular movement of the gas the more frequent
the contact, with consequent communication of heat.                  Hence, pro

times more frequently than it would be          if placed in air, and 4 times
more frequently than     it would  be  if placed in an atmosphere of oxygen

   The first three sections of this paper are occupied by a discussion
of the Laws of the Disturbances of the Magnetic Declination at Kew,
derived from the photographic         records of the Kew Observatory be
tween January     1,   1858, and December 31, 1862.          In  the first sec
tion a synoptical table is given, showing the direction and amount of
the easterly and of the westerly deflections of the declination magnet
at 24 equidistant epochs on each of 95 days of principal disturbance
occurring in the years 1858 to 1862 inclusive.            The deflections are
measured from the normals of the same month and hour, computed
from the undisturbed positions       at the same epochs on the 1825 days
comprised in the five years since the commencement of the photo
graphic records.      The phenomenal laws of the disturbances on the
95 days are then investigated, and are compared with the correspond
ing laws derived from        a far larger   number of observations in the
same   years, taken out by the well-known           process employed by the
author in the reduction of the observations of the colonial magnetic
observatories.    The result is shown to be that, so far as the laws of
the disturbances     are   concerned, the two processes       furnish mutual
confirmation  — the    laws being approximately       the same whether they
are derived from      the whole body of the hourly positions, or from
that portion only which includes 95 days (or on an average 19 days
in each year) which were specially affected by disturbance, — but that
for the purpose of eliminating the effects of the disturbances in the

"subsequent investigat ion of the secular, periodical, and other minor
 magnetic variations,      the process of elimination      introduced by the
 author and employed by        him   for  several  years past in the reduction
 of the colonial observations has the advantage of separating from the
 whole body of the observations a far greater portion of the disturb
 ing influence than would       be gained by the simple omission           of the
 observations on the 95 days.         The laws of the disturbance-diurnal
 variation, thus found to be approximately the same whether obtained
 from the narrower or from the wider basis of investigation, are then
 stated, and are compared with the results of similar investigations
 recorded in the author's previous publications        — the points of    accord
 ance or   of difference being severally discussed in the third section.
   The fourth section contains Tables of the " Diurnal Inequality," and
 of the   " Solar-diurnal    Variation
                                        "  at Kew, showing the mean values
 at each hour and in each month.           The   " Diurnal Inequality " is ex
 plained as consisting of two principal       constituents, viz. the " Disturb
 ance-diurnal     Variation," and the      " Solar-diurnal Variation."       It is
 obtained for each month by taking the differences between the mean
 positions of the magnet at each of the 24 hours, in the month, and
 the mean position in the month itself (viz. the mean of all the days
 and all the hours)— no omission whatsoever being made of disturbed
 observations.
    The   " Solar- diurnal   Variation"     is obtained by a similar process,
 after the    separation    and omission      of all the observations which
 differed by a certain small and constant value from the normals of
 the same     month and hour.           By this process the       effects  of the
 " Casual   and Transitory changes
                                         " are in a
                                                      very great degree elimi
 nated, and a very close approximation           is obtained to the systematic
 diurnal action of the sun upon the direction          of the horizontal mag
 net, apart from the effects of disturbances.         The solar-diurnal varia
 tion thus obtained at Kew is compared with results similarly obtained
 at six other stations, viz. three stations in the interior of the two
 great northern continents, one equatorial station, and two stations in
 the middle latitudes of the southern hemisphere           — thus    generalizing
 upon a very extensive scale the action of the sun in producing the
 phenomena under notice.
    The fifth section is occupied by a similar generalization of the facts
 which have placed in evidence the existence of a semiannual inequality

 1863.]                                  625
in the solar-diurnal      variation, having     its epochs coincident, or very
nearly    so,   with the sun's     passage    of the equator, and dependent
consequently on the earth's position in its orbit. The sun's action
in producing this semiannual inequality is shown to be character
istically different from that which is manifested in the solar-diurnal
variation itself, pointing apparently to a difference in the mode of
the sun's action in the two cases.
    The sixth section contains        a tabular    view of the   " Lunar-diurnal
Variation     " at Kew, in each of the five years during which the photo
graphic     record has been maintained           there ;  this is followed     by a
 comparison with similar results at other stations on the globe, and a
 statement of the principal points of agreement or of difference which
 are shown thereby.

       vatory, from 1858 to 1862 inclusive."— No.                II.   By Major-
        General Edward Sabine, P.R.S. Received June 18, 18G3.
                                     (Abstract.)
     This paper is   a continuation     of the preceding one.        It  consists of
 two sections, the seventh and eighth.              In the seventh section the
 author discusses the secular change and annual variation of the decli
 nation  ;   and in the eighth       section, the annual variation         or semi
 annual inequality      of the inclination and of the horizontal and total
 magnetic force.
     Seventh Section.    — The    positions of the horizontal       magnet at 24
 equidistant epochs in the day, tabulated from the photograms of the
 Kew declinometer, with the omission of the disturbed observations,
 as described      in the former paper,        are grouped     in weekly     means,
 forming 52 mean values, corresponding to the number of weeks in
 the year.      A Table is given of these weekly values, comprehending,
 in five columns, the five years from January 1858 to December 1862
 inclusive, and from these a sixth column is formed, representing the
 mean declination       in each   of the 52 weeks of     a mean or    typical year,
 corresponding in this instance to the year 1860.             The mean declina
  tion obtained from all the weekly results in the five years, and corre
  sponding to its middle epoch       July  1,  1860, is 21° 39' 18"-   1 ; and from
  a comparison of the mean declinations corresponding             to  July   1 in the

                                      626                          [June 18,
  columns which severally present the weekly values in the years from
• 1858 to 6182 inclusive, the mean value      of the secular change corre
  sponding to the period comprised in the Table is deduced.            A pro
  portional  part   of the secular change is then applied with its appro
 priate sign to each of the weekly values in the mean or typical year.
 These should all correspond with the mean declination of the whole
  Table (viz. 21° 39' 18" -1), or should exhibit only such small and
  unsystematic differences as might reasonably be ascribed to casual
  errors.   The final column of the Table contains these differences,
 in which it is    at once seen that they divide themselves into two dis
 tinct categories, distinguished   by the — sign in the semiannual period
 from March 21 to Sept. 21, and by the + sign from Sept. 21 to
  March   2 1.   Hence the author     infers the existence of a variation in
 the declination     at  Kew having an annual period, and consisting of
 a  semiannual inequality with epochs coincident, or nearly so, with the
 sun's passage of the equator — the magnet being deflected towards the
 east when the sun is     north, and towards the west when he is south of
 the equator.     The amount of the semiannual inequality,     as shown    by
 the Table, averages — 28"*95 in the weeks from March           21   to Sept.
  21, and   +   29"-9 in those from September to March.          The whole
 amount of the annual variation at Kew is therefore 58"-85.
     The result thus obtained from the observations       at  Kew is com
 pared with the result     of an investigation  of the corresponding phe
 nomena     at Hobarton in the southern        hemisphere,   obtained from
 hourly observations of the declination during five years, commencing
 in October 1843, and terminating in September 1848. The obser
 vations themselves are published in the 2nd and 3rd volumes           of the
 Hobarton Observations, and are treated, for the purposes of this
 paper, precisely in the same way as those of the Kew Observatory,
 forming a table strictly analogous      to the one, previously described,
 at Kew.     The final column of the Hobarton Table exhibits the differ
 ences, in each    of the 52 weeks of the typical year, from the mean
 declination derived from the whole of the observations in the five
 years.    The + and — signs in this column attest in as striking a
 manner as do those at Kew, the existence at Hobarton of a semi
 annual inequality      of which the epochs coincide, or very nearly so,
 with the sun's passage of the equator : the direction of the deflec
tion is the    same as at   Kew, viz., of the north end of the magnet

1863.]                                   627
towards the east when the sun is north of the equator, and to the
west when he is south         of the equator.        The amount of the deflection
in the first-named       semiannual period           is,   on the average,           19"*1   in
each week; and in the opposite semiannual period                           19";      making
together an annual variation of 38"- 1.
  The author then refers to the result of                    a   similar      investigation
of the phenomena at St. Helena in the equatorial zone, the parti
culars of which have been already published                   in the 2nd volume of
the St. Helena Observations.           The result, derived from eight years
of observation, of which five years were hourly, evidences at that
station also the existence of        a   semiannual         inequality        with epochs
coinciding, or nearly so, with the equinoxes — the deflections being also
in the   same   directions as those at Kew and Hobarton, viz., to the
east when the sun       is   north, and to the west when he              is   south, of the
equator.   The amount of the annual variation thus produced   less                     is
at St. Helena than at either Kew or Hobarton — the semiannual dif
ference being about 7'', and the annual variation                 14".
  The author remarks that the difference in the amount of deflection
at the three stations may, in part at least, be occasioned                    by   the differ
ence in amount of the antagonistic force of the earth's magnetism,
tending to retain the magnet in its mean position in opposition to all
disturbing causes.   The antagonistic force, viz. the horizontal com
ponent of the earth's magnetic force,  approximately 5-6 (in British
                                                is
units) at St. Helena, 4*5 at Hobarton, and 3-8 at Kew.
  In note appended subsequently to the delivery of this paper, viz.
       a
on June 19, 1863, the author refers to           a     similar investigation of the
phenomena at the Cape of Good Hope, published                      in 1851, in the           1st
volume of the magnetical observations at that station.                        The volume
contains the fortnightly means         of the declination from July 1842 to
July   1846, corrected for secular change, and collected in Table                        III.,
page v, of that volume.          The differences of the declination in                   each
fortnight,   so corrected, from the mean declination              of the whole period,
are shown in its final column.           The    mean       of the thirteen fortnights
(in the four years) between March 26 and Sept. 23,       0'*4 more            is
easterly, and of the thirteen fortnights between September 24 and
March 25,       0'*4   more westerly     than the mean value — showing                       an
annual           of 0'-8 (or 48"), or
           variation                   semiannual inequality ave

    Sept. 24 to    March 25.    This is in accordance with the conclusions
    at all the other stations at which the phenomena have been sub
   jected to a suitable investigation.     The antagonistic horizontal     com
   ponent of the earth's magnetism is approximately        4*5.
      Eighth Section. — In the eighth section the author examines            the
   evidence which the monthly determinations of the dip and of the hori
   zontal component of the magnetic force at Kew afford of the existence
   of a semiannual inequality in the absolute values of the dip and of the
   total magnetic force.    The results of the monthly determinations from
   April 1857 to March 1863 are exhibited in two Tables, one appro
  priated to the dip, and the other to the horizontal      force.   The whole
   series  of the determinations of the horizontal force were made with the
  same    unifilar magnetometer and the    same collimator magnet through
  out, and also by the same observer,      Mr. Chambers,    one   of the assist
  ants at the Kew Observatory.        In  the monthly determinations     of the
  dip from     April 1857 to September 1860, twelve different circles, and
  their twenty-four needles were occasionally employed, the mean of all
  the observations in each month being taken as the mean result in that
 month.        There were also several observers in this part of the series,
 chiefly four.       In the months from October 1860 to March 1863,
 one circle with its two needles were the sole instruments, and Mr.
 Chambers the sole observer.         The probable error of a single monthly
 determination of the dip in the first part of the series, when several
 instruments       and several observers were employed,       is stated to be
 + 0'-69     ;  and in the second part of the series, obtained by a single
circle and the same observer throughout, the probable error is         +0'*75;
whence      it is inferred that the greater number of partial results which
contributed to produce the monthly mean in the earlier period more
than counterbalanced the diversities which might have been occa
sioned by the peculiarities of the different observers and of the differ
ent instruments.         The probable error of a single  monthly determina
tion of the dip, after the application       of the corrections for secular
change and annual variation, is stated to be + 0'-71, and           of a single
monthly determination of the horizontal          force derived from the 72
monthly determinations + *0024.
     The results of the monthly determinations          at Kew,    as  bearing

   1863.]                                    629
  upon the question of annual               variation,   may be briefly        stated as
  follows  : — 1st. The        dip is subject to an annual variation, which, on
  the average of the six years, amounts to l'-35             ;  consisting of a semi
  annual inequality with epochs coinciding, or very nearly so, with the
  equinoxes    ;  the mean dip being on the average 0'-65 lower than its
  annual mean value in the six months from                April to September, and
  0'*7  higher     than its annual        mean value in the six months              from
  October     to March.           2nd. That the horizontal        force is subject to
  a semiannual        inequality     having the      same   epochs — being       on the
 average     -0013 higher than its annual mean in each             of the six months
 from   April    to September, and -0013 lower than its annual mean                    in
 each   of the months from October to March.                   3rd. That, combining
 the results of the dip and horizontal force, the                     total   terrestrial
 magnetic force is expressed in British units by 10*3002 as its mean
 value in the months from             April to September, and by 10*30347 in
 the months from October to March, — there being thus a difference
 of -00327, by which the intensity of the magnetic force of the earth
 is greater in the months when the sun is south of the equator than
 in the months when he is north of the equator.
     This conclusion is compared with the results obtained in                   a corre
 sponding manner from the published                  observations of the Hobarton
 Observatory,       viz., with the monthly determinations of the horizontal
 force in the five years from January 1846 to December 1850 inclu
 sive, and    with those of the dip in the ten years from January 1841
 to  December 1850 inclusive.             From these data the conclusions are
 drawn, 1st, that at Hobarton the dip is subject to an annual variation
 amounting       to    l'-  18,  consisting   of  a   semiannual     inequality     with
 epochs coinciding or nearly so with the               equinoxes — the (south) dip
being on the average             0'*59 less  in the months from April to Sep
tember, and 0'-59 greater in the months from October to March than
the mean annual value            ;  and 2nd, that the horizontal force is subject
to a similar       semiannual inequality,        being -0007 less than its mean
value in the months from             April to September, and        *0005    greater in
the    months      from October        to March     ;  and combining        these    two
results,   that the total force at Hobarton is expressed in British
units by 13-56882 in the months from October to March, and by
13*55195 in the months from April to September: the difference,
•01687, expresses          the measure of the greater intensity of the earth's

magnetic force when the sun is south than when he is north of the
equator.
   The author concludes this section of his investigations by drawing
the attention of the Royal Society to this concurrent evidence, from
the observations of three observatories situated in parts of the globe
so distant from each other, of a semiannual inequality having such
strong features of resemblance in both hemispheres,             and remarks
that it seems difficult to assign such effects       to any other than to    a
cosmical cause.     The "inequalities" may in themselves seem to be
small   ; but judged of scientifically, i. e. in the proportions they bear
to their respective probable errors, they are large.
IV.    "Experiments, made at Watford, on the Vibrations occa
       sioned by Railway Trains passing through a Tunnel."
       By Sir James South,            LL.D., F.R.S., Member of the
       Board of Visitors     of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich.
       Received June 17, 1863.
                                  (Abstract.)
    These experiments were made         in  consequence    of  an attempt   in
 1846 to run a line of railway       through Greenwich        Park, in what
seemed     to several competent judges a dangerous proximity to the
Royal Observatory.
    It was   abandoned, but (as Sir James South was informed) only
for a time ; and he thought it right to make some examination of
the probable effects of such a vicinity, especially as to the power of
a tunnel in deadening the vibrations.
    The Watford tunnel    was    chosen   as the observing station, being,
on the high authority of the late         Mr. Warburton, in ground very
 analogous to that on which the Royal Observatory stands          ;  and every
facility for making observations       was    afforded by the late     Earl of
Essex, through whose park and preserves this tunnel passes.
    As the chief inconvenience to    be feared from the proposed       railway
was the disturbance     of the observations by reflexion in mercury, it
 seemed    best to take a series of these under circumstances as nearly
as possible resembling those     which might      be expected at  Greenwich.
An Observatory     was therefore erected,    in which  a large and    powerful

   1863.]                                 631
  transit- instrument       was mounted, with all the attention to stability
  that could be given in a first-class Observatory           ; and it had sufficient
  azimuthal      motion to enable the observer to follow the Pole-star in
  its whole course       ; so that night or day     (if clear), he could have the
  reflected image of the star in the mercurial vessel, ready to testify
 against the tremors caused by any train.
     The distance of the       vessel from the nearest      part of the tunnel was
  302 yards, that proposed for Greenwich being 286 yards.                 The length
  of the tunnel is 1812 yards; its southern or London end is 643
 yards      from where the mercury           was  placed, its northern      or Tring
 end 1281 yards        ;  and about 64 feet of chalk and gravel lie above the
 brickwork of its crown.            The author's preparations were not com
 plete   till December       1846,  and then a continuance of cloudy weather
 interfered with observation till January the           1 1th, 1847, when and on
 the following       nights he obtained results so decisive that he felt              it
 his duty to communicate them at once to the then First Lord of the
  Admiralty, the late Lord Auckland, who was so satisfied with them,
 that in     a letter to Sir James, dated "Admiralty,          Jan.   26, 1847," he
 recorded the impression they had made on his mind in the following
 words    : — " They would      be quite conclusive   if the question    of carrying
 a tunnel through Greenwich             Park were again to       be agitated."     Sir
 James, however, continued the work to the end of March.
     With the ordinary disturbance to which               an Observatory     is liable
 (as wind, carriages, or persons moving near it), the reflected image
 of a star breaks up into a line of stars, perpendicular to the longest
 side of the mercury-vessel.            With increased agitation, another line
 of stars perpendicular         to the first appears, making a cross. With
still more the cross          becomes    a series of parallel lines of   stars  ; still
more makes the images oscillate            ; and  at last all becomes a confused
mass of nebulous light.            The first of these (the line) is not injurious
to onec lass of observations          ;  but the others are, and therefore the
second (the cross) was taken as a measure of the beginning and end
of injurious disturbance. Signal shots were fired when a train passed
the southern entrance of the tunnel, and             a shaft   1 162 yards from     it.
Hence the train's velocity was obtained, and thence its position at
any given time.
    Upwards of 230 observations are given in detail, and their most
important results are shown in a Table, which contains the date, the
                                                                    2 y2

distances at which the cross of stars begins and ceases to be visible,
those at which the series  of parallel lines is seen, the velocity in
miles per hour, the weight of each engine, and also the length and
weight of each train (when it could be identified).
     This Table proves that in all                cases but one           (which in fact is scarcely
an    exception) there is sufficient vibration to excite the cross at 670
yards, and that in 24 per cent. of the number                                   it is   seen        beyond
1000,    its maximum                 being 1176.      At the southern end such dis
tances reach far beyond the tunnel, while                                  at the north they fall
within it.         From comparing them in the two                          cases, the author infers
that the train's            agitation     extends laterally as far when it is in the
tunnel as when in the open cutting.                            The amount of disturbance
does not depend solely on the velocity and weight                                of the train, but
also on other circumstances, of which prolonged action and length of
train are the chief.            In one    instance, with only a velocity of                 1   1*4 miles,
the cross was seen at 1110 yards —a proof that no regulation of the
speed in passing an Observatory                     at a distance            of 300 or 400 yards
would be of any avail.
  The system of parallel lines is only seen between lines making
angles of 45° with the perpendicular to the rails, that at distances                 is,
under 427 yards             ;   it   scarcely ever    is      produced        unless the cross be
visible beyond 1000 yards.
     These forms are also produced                   by   the reports of cannon of twelve
ounces calibre, at distances from 300 to 3000 yards                              ;   in the last         case
there   is   but   a   faint trace of the cross.               In all, the appearance               is   mo
mentary, not lasting in any                case more than            a    second and    a   half.    They
are not produced by the roar of                a   two-pound rocket fired 82 feet from
the mercury, though very loud.                      When the cannon were fired in the
tunnel, where the perpendicular                     meets          it,   two sets of tremors were
seen — one,        he believes, propagated through the ground,                                  the other
through the air about                 a   second later, the sound escaping probably
through the shafts.                  Attempts were made to substantiate or refute
this hypothesis         ;   but the difficulties of rapidly shifting and unshifting
the coverings prepared for the purpose were such as to compel him
to relinquish them.
     These observations were reduced in                   1   84   7 ;   but conceiving all danger
to the Royal Observatory                    was    past, the author              did not think             it
necessary then to proceed with them.                           As, however, no Observatory

  V.  " Preliminary Notice       of an Examination of Rubia* munjista, the
         East-Indian Madder, or Munjeet of Commerce." By John
         Sten house, LL.D., F.R.S. Received June 18, 1863.
     It is rather remarkable      that while few vegetable substances have
 been so frequently and carefully examined by some            of the most emi
 nent chemists than the root of the Rubia tinctorum,                or ordinary
 madder, the Rubia munjista,           or munjeet,    which is   so extensively
 cultivated in India and employed as a dye-stuff, has been, compara
 tively speaking, very much overlooked, never having been subjected,
 apparently,     to anything   but a very cursory examination.         Professor
 Runge,    at the close  of his very elaborate memoir upon madder, pub
 lished in 1835, details a few experiments which he made upon the
 tinctorial power of munjeet, the constituents          of which he regarded
 as very similar to those    of ordinary madder.       Professor Runge stated
 that munjeet contains twice as much available colouring              matter as
 the best Avignon madder.           This result  was so unexpected that the
 Prussian Society for the Encouragement          of Manufactures,      to whom
 Professor     Runge' s  memoir     was originally addressed, referred       the
 matter to three eminent German dyers, Messrs. Dannenberger, Bohm,
and Nobiling.        These gentlemen reported,     as  the result of numerous
carefully     conducted   experiments, that, so far from munjeet           being
richer in colouring matter than ordinary madder, it contained only
half the quantity.       This conclusion has been abundantly confirmed
by the experience of my friend           Mr. John Thorn, of Birkacre, near
Chorley,     one  of the most skilful of the Lancashire printers.          From
some incidental notices     of munjeet in Persoz and similar writers, and
a few experiments which       I made some years ago,      I was led  to suspect
that the colouring matters in munjeet, though similar, are by no
means identical with those of ordinary madder, and that probably
the alizarine or purpurine       of madder would      be found to be replaced
by   some corresponding      colouring principle.     This hypothesis    I  have
found to be essentially correct      ; for the colouring matter of munjeet,
instead of consisting of a mixture of alizarine and purpurine, contains

                                            634                           [June  18,
 no alizarine at all, but purpurine          and a beautiful     orange colouring
 matter crystallizing        in golden scales, to which      I purpose giving the
 name     of " munjistine."         Munjistine exists in munjeet in considerable
 quantity, and can therefore be easily obtained.
     The colouring matter of munjeet may            be extracted  in various ways   ;
 that which      I have  found most suitable is as follows      : — each pound    of
 munjeet in fine powder is boiled for four or five hours with two pounds
 of sulphate of alumina and about sixteen of water.               The whole of the
 colouring matter is not extracted by a single treatment with sulphate of
 alumina     ; the operation must be repeated therefore two or three times.
 The red liquid thus obtained is strained through cloth filters while
 still very hot, and the clear liquor acidulated with hydrochloric acid.
 It   soon   begins to deposit a bright red precipitate, the quantity of
 which    increases    on standing, which it should be allowed to do for
 about twelve hours.          This precipitate   is collected on cloth filters and
 washed with cold water         till the greater portion of the acid is removed.
 It  is then dried, reduced to fine powder, and digested in a suitable
 extracting apparatus with boiling bisulphide of carbon, which dissolves
 out the crystallizable       colouring principles of the munjeet, and leaves
 a considerable quantity       of dark-coloured resinous matter.        The  excess
 of the bisulphide of carbon having been removed by distillation, the
 bright red extract, consisting chiefly of a mixture of munjistine and
 purpurine, is treated repeatedly with moderate quantities of boiling
water and filtered.          The munjistine dissolves, forming a clear yellow
liquid, while almost the whole of the purpurine remains on the filter.
When this solution is acidulated with hydrochloric or sulphuric acid,
the munjistine        precipitates in large yellow flocks.         These are col
lected on a filter and washed slightly with cold water.               The precipi
tate is then dried by pressure, and dissolved in boiling spirit of wine
slightly acidulated with hydrochloric acid to remove any adhering alu
mina. As the munjistine does not subside from cold alcoholic solutions,
even when they are largely diluted           with water, about three-fourths     of
the spirit are drawn off by distillation, when the munjistine is deposited
in large yellow      scales.     By two or three crystallizations out of spirit
in the way just described the munjistine is rendered perfectly pure.
    I  have likewise succeeded in extracting munjistine directly from
munjeet by boiling        it with water, filtering the solution, which has        a
dark brownish-red         colour,     and then acidulating     with hydrochloric

1863.]                                 635
acid.    The precipitate which falls is collected on a filter, washed,
dried, and treated with boiling spirit of wine, which leaves a large
quantity of pectine undissolved.         The munjistine which dissolves in
the alcohol is obtained in a pure state by repeated crystallizations          in
the way already indicated.        The first process which   I have  described
is, however, by far the best.        The colouring matter of munjeet can
likewise be     extracted with boiling solutions of alum ; but I find sul
phate of alumina greatly preferable, as the alum, by its tendency to
crystallize, very much impedes the filtration of the liquids.      I   likewise
attempted      to employ Professor     E. Kopp's process with sulphurous
acid, which gives such excellent results with ordinary madder, but              I
found    it wholly inapplicable to munjeet.
    Munjistine, prepared by the processes described, when crystallized
out of alcohol, forms golden-yellow plates of great brilliancy. It is
but moderately soluble in cold, but dissolves pretty readily in boiling
water, forming       a bright yellow solution, from which it is deposited
in flocks when the liquid cools.          Saturated solutions almost gelati
nize.     It dissolves to some extent in cold, but more readily in boiling
spirit of wine, and is not precipitated by the addition of water. It
dissolves in carbonate of soda with a bright red colour.         In ammonia
it forms     a red solution   with  a slight tinge of brown : caustic soda
produces      with it   a  rich crimson colour.     Both its aqueous and
 alcoholic solutions, when boiled with alumina, form beautiful flakes of
 a bright orange colour, almost the whole of the munjistine               being
 withdrawn from solution.        These flakes are soluble in a large excess
 of caustic   soda, with a fine crimson colour.      Munjistine dyes cloth
 mordanted with alumina a bright orange. With iron mordant it yields
 a brownish-purple colour, and with Turkey-red mordant a pleasing
 deep orange.       These colours are moderately permanent, and bear the
 application of bran and soap tolerably well.       The munjistine sensibly
 modifies the colours produced        by munjeet, giving the reds a shade
 of scarlet,  as  has been long observed.
    Commercial nitric acid dissolves munjistine with a yellow colour,
 but   does    not appear to decompose it even on boiling.              Fuming
 nitric acid (1*5) dissolves munjistine in the cold, and on application
 of heat decomposes it, no oxalic acid being produced. It readily
 dissolves in cold sulphuric acid with a bright orange colour        ;  and the
 solution    may be heated      nearly to boiling without blackening           or

                                                       636                                            [June        18,
giving off sulphurous acid; it is reprecipitated by water in yellow flocks
apparently unaltered.    When bromine water is added to a strong
aqueous solution of munjistine,                       a pale-coloured             flocculent precipitate
is immediately produced                  ;    this, when collected on a filter,                         washed
and     dissolved          in     hot spirit,         furnishes            minute        tufts of crystals,
evidently      a substitution            product.              I    may remark,           in passing, that
when alizarine is treated with bromine water in a similar way,                                               it    also
forms a substitution product crystallizing in needles.                                         I am   at present
engaged in the examination of both these compounds.
   When munjistine is strongly heated                               on platinum foil,            it readily in
flames and leaves no residue ; when it                              is carefully heated               in a    tube,
it fuses, and crystallizes again                     on cooling.            It   sublimes more readily
than either purpurine or alizarine, forming golden scales which con
sist apparently of unaltered munjistine, as they give the characteristic
rich    crimson        coloration            with    caustic         alkalies.    Baryta water pro
duces a yellow precipitate with munjistine.                                  Acetate of lead throws
down a bright crimson precipitate, both in its aqueous and alcoholic
solutions.       I   expect, from this and the bromine                                   substitution         com
pound, very shortly to ascertain the atomic weight of this body                                                    ;   in
the mean time          I    submit the results of its ultimate analysis.

however, essentially different from rubiacine, both in several of its
properties, such as its solubility in water and alcohol, &c., and in the
amount of its carbon — rubiacine, according to Dr. Schunck's analysis,

containing 67-01 per cent. of that element, while munjistine contains
only 64.      The spectra afforded by solutions of the two substances,                                     as
may be seen from the following                   extract from a letter received from
Professor     Stokes, are decidedly different.
     " The   two substances are perfectly distinguished by the very differ
ent colour of their solution in carbonate of soda, when a small quantity
only of substance is used.   The solution of munjistine is red inclining
to pinkish orange, that of rubiacine a claret-red.       The tints are
totally different, and indicate a different mode of absorption.    Both
present a single minimum in the spectrum                          ;    but while that of             rubia
cine extends from about D toF, that of munjistine extends from
a    good way beyond D to some way beyond F. The beginning
and end of the band in each case is not very definite, and varies of
course with the strength of the solution                    ;   but by comparing the sub
stances with different strengths of solution, there can be no doubt
of the radical difference in the position of the band of absorption.
In    this way it is easy to convince oneself that the difference of colour
is not to    be explained         by the possible admixture                   of   some        small im
purity present in         one or other specimen.                 With caustic potash mun
jistine gives as nearly as possible the same colour                                      as    rubiacine,
agreeing with the colour of rubiacine in carbonate of                                    soda.       There
appears to be a slight difference in the spectrum of the munjistine
and rubiacine           solutions,     but not enough                 to   rely on   ;    so that         the
substances are not to be distinguished                      by their solutions in caustic
alkalies.
     "A   second perfectly valid distinction                    is,   however, afforded              by   the
different    colour      of the fluorescent light of the ethereal solutions.
The solid substances themselves and their ethereal solutions                                     are fluo

purpurine         and munjistine.
    I   cannot conclude this preliminary                   notice without       acknowledging
the essential services             I    have received from Professor               Stokes, who
kindly submitted the different products obtained by me to optical
examination.   Though it is plain that a substance optically pure,
that     is,   containing      no impurities        affecting the spectrum,            may still
be far from being chemically                   so, yet the spectroscope           is   extremely
useful     in   indicating admixtures of kindred substances of very similar
properties,          having    a   great affinity      for each       other,     and   therefore
not readily separable.             I   feel certain therefore that      if     Professor Stokes
would draw up           a   short treatise embodying his extensive and accurate
observations          on the spectra of the colouring                  matters and similar
substances, he would confer               a    great boon on the cultivators            of orga
nic chemistry.
                       Postscript. — Received July                  18, 1863.
    Since the preceding paper was communicated to the Royal Society
I   have been enabled           to examine the action of nitric acid on munjis-
    *
    I    may     mention that the rubiacine which Professor Stokes                examined was
prepared       by Dr. Schunck himself.

tine much more fully.       When munjistine is digested with moderately
strong nitric acid, as already stated, copious fumes are given off, the
munjistine    gradually   dissolving  and forming       a colourless     solution.
When this is evaporated to dryness on the water-bath,                a white cry
stalline mass is obtained, consisting almost entirely of phthalic acid
contaminated with a small quantity only of oxalic acid.               The oxalic
acid may be easily removed by washing the mass with a little cold
water and then pressing         between   folds    of bibulous     paper, or by
neutralizing   the mixture of the two acids with lime and then treating
with boiling water, which dissolves the phthalate of lime. The acid
freed from oxalic acid by either of these methods presents all the
usual reactions of phthalic acid.       One of the most convenient ways
of purifying it consists in subliming it repeatedly in a Mohr's appa
ratus, when the anhydrous acid is obtained in beautifully white
iridescent four-sided prisms, frequently several inches in length.

    From this result it is evident that the acid chiefly produced by
the action of nitric acid upon munjistine          is phthalic acid, which, as
is well known, may also be procured from alizarine and purpurine.
This reaction, therefore, indicates      a very close      relationship    between
these three substances, the only true colouring principles of madder
with which    we are at present acquainted.

       On Isomeric Diamines."        By A.W. Hofmann, LL.D.,F.R.S.

 agents upon dinitrobenzol.             Phenylene-diamine,           the last product of

      Nitraniline,   as might have been expected, was found to be readily
  convertible into phenylene-diamine.
      By the researches of M. Arppef, chemists have become acquainted
 with a second nitraniline, which is obtained by the action of fuming
 nitric acid upon phenyl-pyrotartramide and subsequent treatment of
 the nitro-compound with potassa.                  This substance, which, as I after
  wards found, may be more readily prepared by a similar                        treatment
 of other     less  difficultly obtainable          phenylamides,       such as phenyl-
 acetamide or phenyl-succinamide, is isomeric with ordinary nitraniline,
 but differs from the latter compound                 both in its physical        and che
 mical properties, so as to leave no doubt regarding the individuality
 of the two compounds, which              have accordingly        been distinguished      as
 alpha-nit raniline and beta-nitraniline.                   This singular isomerism,
 which has been traced also in other phenyl-derivatives,                      remains un
 explained!.       Whilst engaged with the examination                     of phenylene-
 diamine, the idea naturally suggested itself,                   to ascertain whether
 beta-nitraniline,      when submitted           to reducing      agents, would yield a
 body isomeric but differing from the phenylene-diamine obtained from
 dinitrobenzol     and alpha-nitraniline.
      Beta-nitraniline    is readily reduced by a mixture              of iron and acetic

     % Among the various attempts I have made to decipher this isomerism, I may
 mention the treatment of the two nitranilines with the iodides of methyl and
 ethyl.   But these substances are not acted upon by the reagents in question, and
 I  take this opportunity of correcting an error which has crept into my paper on
the molecular constitution of the volatile organic bases (Phil. Trans. 1850, vol. i.
p. 93).    In this paper I state that the action of iodide of ethyl on nitraniline gives
rise to the formation of hydriodate of ethyl-nitraniline.           This statement is based
upon a single platinum determination. The platinum-salt of nitraniline con
tains 28G6 per cent* of platinum, that of ethyl-nitraniline 26-53 per cent.           Ana
lysis had furnished me 26-23 per cent.          I have since satisfied myself that the salt
was the imperfectly purified platinum-salt of nitraniline.

  acid.    The basic compound which distils over has the            same compo
  sition  as phenylene-diamine,        viz. C, H6 N2, and presents in its pro
  perties many analogies with this substance, but it is far from being
 identical with it.       The two diatomic      bases  obviously are related to
  each other in the same manner as the two nitranilines               from which
 they are derived, and         I  propose therefore to distinguish        them as
 alpha-phenylene-diamine           and   beta-phenylene-diamine.        Beta-phe-
 nylene-diamine      differs from alpha-phenylene-diamine        by its superior
 crystallizing power      :  whilst the latter for days and often for weeks
 remains liquid, the former immediately,           when separated from one        of
 its salts by an alkali, solidifies into a beautifully crystalline mass.        The
 fusing-point of alpha-phenylene-diamine           is 63° (corr.), that of beta-
 phenylene-diamine        is 140° (corr.)   ; the former boils at 287° (corr.),
 the latter at 267° (corr.). Beta-phenylene-diamine               is remarkable
 for the facility with which it sublimes even at temperatures below
its boiling-point. The experiment succeeds particularly well in a
 current of hydrogen gas, when the base is obtained in splendid cry
stalline plates resembling pyrogallic acid.
     The salts of beta-phenylene-diamine,            although   they are      more
soluble than      the corresponding        alpha-phenylene-diamine       salts, are
distinguished     by the same superior crystallizing power.          They    are all
remarkable for the facility with which they yield beautiful and mostly
well-formed      crystals.
     I  have examined only         two of these salts somewhat          more mi
nutely.
     Hydrochlorale of Betaphenylene-diamine. — This salt crystallizes
in large prisms, which are at present in the hands of M. Quintino

   The sulphate and nitrate are easily crystallizable          salts, somewhat
less soluble in water than the hydrochlorate.
   Beta-phenylene-diamine       and its salts are remarkable for the facility
with which they are converted into violet-           and blue-coloured     com
pounds under the influence of oxidizing            agents such as chlorine,
bromine, chromic acid, ferric and platinic chloride, &c.
   Both alpha- and beta-phenylene-diamine are readily attacked by
the iodides of the alcohol radicals ; and a means was thus afforded of
ascertaining    whether   both    substances   exhibit the     same   degree of
substitution.     Since only the last products of substitution        presented
any interest,   I have submitted the two bases to methylation.             This
experiment     showed    that both     alpha-  and beta-phenylene-diamine
are capable   of absorbing six equivalents of methyl to produce ammo
nium compounds of perfect substitution, and that both bases must
therefore be represented by the formula
                                      H2 VN,.

   Whilst studying the methylated derivatives of the two bases,               I
have, of course, repeatedly obtained the lower, still volatile bases,
which   on this occasion were submitted to a few experiments.

but to have actually the same degree of substitution,            as far as the
latter may be rendered transparent by the action of iodide of methyl.
Under     these circumstances    I was pleased to observe     some additional
phenomena       which removed every doubt            regarding   their  indivi
duality.
   On mixing      a solution of beta-phenylene-diamine in sulphuric acid
with peroxide of manganese, the odour of kinone becomes at once
perceptible,    and on heating       the   mixture,    kinone  distils  over —

   The reaction proceeds with such         ease that a few milligrammes       of
the diamine, when submitted to this treatment in the test-tube, yield
a distinct crystalline    sublimate of kinone, readily recognizable by its
many salient properties.        Alpha-phenylene-diamine,       when similarly
treated, evolves a faint odour of kinone, but does not yield crystals of
this substance.
   The elegant and      easy formation    of kinone in this reaction presents
some    interest,   inasmuch    as the process appears to be of general
 application, and will probably lead to the preparation of the higher
homologues of kinone.
    I have observed the formation of beta-phenylene-diamine              in two
 additional reactions, which, in conclusion,       I beg leave to mention.

        LL.D., F.R.S.        Received June 2, 1863.
   In   a short paper recently submitted to the        Royal Society,       I pointed
out the existence of two aromatic diamines, both represented by the
formula                              (C,H4)"-
                         C0H8NW=       H2           |n2,
                                       Ha
and closely resembling       each other, but differing          in   some    of their
fundamental characters to such an extent that              I   did not hesitate to
assert their individuality, and to distinguish          them as alpha-pheny-
lene-diamine and beta-phenylene-diamine.
  The existence of two closely allied bodies among the diatomic
derivatives of the phenyl-series very naturally suggested the idea of
searching for two similarly related monatomic bases of the same group,
and accordingly    I undertook   during the last week a careful comparison
of specimens of aniline prepared by different processes. This com
parative study is still incomplete, but I beg leave to record even now
an observation    which appears to merit the attention of chemists.
  I   have, in the first place, examined aniline obtained by distillation
of isatin (indigo) with hydrate of potassium.
  The    base prepared   in this manner boils      at 182°, and possesses        the
general characters attributed to aniline.          But neither by treatment

with mercuric or stannic chloride nor with arsenic acid is this sub
stance converted into aniline-red.
    Aniline derived from benzol was next submitted to examination.
The benzol employed for the preparation of the base was partly
obtained by the distillation of benzoic acid with lime, partly by the
fractional distillation     of coal-tar naphtha, and the ultimate solidifica
tion of the product, boiling between 80° and 83°.
    Both varieties of benzol       were treated     with fuming nitric acid, and
the nitro-compound         thus obtained converted into aniline by means            of
iron and acetic acid.
    The    base    prepared    from    benzoic benzol        boils at 182°.      Like
indigo-derived      aniline, it refuses to yield the red colour by treatment
with the agents previously mentioned.
    Aniline obtained from coal-tar benzol,          as might have     been expected,
likewise boils at 182°, and neither mercuric nor stannic chloride                 nor
 arsenic acid converts this substance into aniline-red.
    When     I  communicated these observations to my friend               Mr. E. C.
 Nicholson,      I found that in this     case, as   in  so many others, practice
 is far in advance of theory.         The facts which        I  have mentioned had
 been long known to        this distinguished manufacturer, who in reply to
 my note transmitted to me a gallon of absolutely pure aniline boiling
 at 182°, prepared from coal-tar benzol, and perfectly incapable                    of
 yielding aniline-red.
    During the last few months          I have   had occasion to examine a great
 variety of commercial specimens of aniline, more especially samples
 which had been kindly supplied to me by Messrs. Simpson, Maule,
 and Nicholson, of London, and by Messrs.                    Renard     Brothers  and
 Franc,    of Lyons.       All  these  specimens furnished,          by the ordinary
 processes,    very notable quantities of aniline-red, but they also invari
 ably boiled at a higher temperature, exhibiting in fact boiling-points
 varying between 182° and 220°.
     It is thus obvious that commercial aniline contains a base different
from normal aniline, the cooperation of which is indispensable for
  the production     of aniline-red.
     Is this  base an isomeric variety         of aniline,    an aniline   holding to
 the normal aniline a relation somewhat similar to that which obtains
 between alpha-       and beta-phenylene-diamine           ?  *   It  is well  known

 that  Mr. Church has separated from coal-tar naphtha           a hydrocarbon
isomeric with benzol, parabenzol,         which boils   at 97°-5.     This sub
stance     is readily  converted into a nitro-compound,        and ultimately
into the corresponding base.        Is it the   base thus formed    which gives
rise to the formation of aniline-red      ?
   Or is it not more probable           that   commercial     aniline    contains
another base analogous or homologous with aniline which is involved
in the generation of the red      ?
   These are questions equally interesting          for theory and practice,
and the solution of which will probably throw considerable light upon
the still enigmatical genesis of rosaniline.
VIII.       "Contributions     towards the History of the Colouring
        Matters      derived from Coal-tar."         By A. W. Hofmann,
        LL.D., F.R.S.        Received June 9, 1863.
   In    a previous   Note I have shown    that the red colouring matter can
not be obtained from normal           aniline by the action of the agents
usually employed for the preparation of this colour on a large scale.
This observation naturally induced         me to seek for the constituent       in
the commercial aniline which gives rise to the formation of aniline-red.
    I  have already remarked that the commercial            product     which is
best suited for the manufacture of the red colour, boils at a tempera
ture appreciably       higher  than the boiling-point of normal           aniline.
The idea presented itself of submitting this substance to a fractional
distillation, or else of effecting a methodical separation of the hydro
carbons which constitute        the starting-point for the manufacture of
the bases      ; but, as is well known, these processes      are   difficult and
tedious, and there is little chance of success           unless the operation
be performed on a very large scale.
   In    the hope of accelerating the inquiry,      I  examined the action of
mercuric and stannic chlorides         upon the homologues        of aniline, of
which     I  fortunately possessed some pure specimens.        The contiguous
term toluidine was the first to fix my attention.         The  presence    of this
base    in commercial aniline could not be doubted, since the benzol
employed in the manufacture of this substance almost invariably boils
at temperatures        between 80° and 100°,       or even higher.        Indeed
Mr. Nicholson having convinced himself that pure aniline is not
                                                                   2 z 2

available for the preparation       of rosaniline, was       at one time disposed
to consider toluidine the true source of the so-called aniline-red.
    But toluidine the purity of which          was established by combustion
when submitted under the most varied circumstances to the action
of the agents already mentioned, does not produce              a trace  of colouring
matter.     The subject, which thus appeared to                 become    more and
more obscure, was elucidated by a happy experiment.
   A   mixture  of pure aniline and pure toluidine, when heated with
mercuric^chloride,     stannic    chloride,     or with arsenic acid,        instan
taneously produced a magnificent red          of most intense tinctorial power.
This experiment appears        to show that the red belongs to both the
phenic and toluic series.
    I have not   as yet pursued my researches            further in the new field
opened by this experiment.
    In conclusion   I may be allowed to state that by transforming               into
oxalate    commercial    aniline, and       especially    a  specimen     of aniline
which was furnished to        me   by Mr. Nicholson           as  particularly well
adapted for the preparation of the red,           I  have been enabled to obtain
considerable quantities of toluidine in         a state   of perfect purity.
    Having thus    at my disposal the necessary          material,   I hope  soon to
acquire further experimental data for the explanation of the forma
tion of rosaniline.

measurement of the chemical brightness of various portions                    of the

are   of sufficient interest to warrant his bringing them before the
Society.

 the sun's disc is nearly double that from its borders, and that the
equatorial       regions      are    somewhat         hotter    than     the   polar,    whilst
observers have long noticed a great difference in luminosity between
the centre and edge of the disc.
   For the purpose of obtaining                       a   measurement of the relative
chemical      brightness of various portions of the solar disc, the image
of the sun, of about             4   inches in diameter, obtained by a 3£-inch
refractor*,      was     allowed to fall into a camera placed on the
instrument,       upon a sheet of standard photographic                      paper prepared
according to the method described in the above-mentioned research.
The peculiar property of this standard paper is that it can always
be prepared of one and the same degree of sensitiveness, and is per
fectly   homogeneous.             The exposure lasted for from                    30   to    120
seconds, the sun's motion being carefully followed by a tangent-screw.
 After exposure, the shade of tint at several points on the picture was
determined by comparison with a graduated photographic strip in-
solated in the pendulum-photometer,                        and the chemical intensities
corresponding         to these shades            obtained by reference to the Table
given in the memoir above cited.                     The following numbers give the
chemical      brightness,       thus obtained, at various points on the sun's
disc on May 9th, 1863.                 From these numbers it is               seen    that the
intensity of the chemically active rays                   at the centre is from three to
five times as great as that at the edge                   of the disc, the chemical rays
thus showing         a wider variation           than the calorific       rays exhibited as
determined        by Secchi.          This is doubtless owing to the relatively
greater absorption           effected by the solar atmosphere                   on the more
refrangible chemical rays.

    The sun-pictures obtained on the sensitive paper must possess
only a slight tint, otherwise the differences in shade cannot be
accurately observed      ;   they then exhibit       a  peculiar   coarse   mottled
appearance, which is not due to imperfections               in the paper or the
lenses, nor to the action       of the earth's atmosphere.
    Perhaps these irregular dark and light patches are owing to clouds
in the solar atmosphere, and they may have an intimate connexion
with the well-known phenomenon of the red prominences.

   A     healthy muscle            contracts with more vigour           if   the current         be
direct — that         is to say, the positive pole towards the centre, the nega
tive pole towards the periphery.
   If a      muscle paralysed from recent injury to the brain be acted
upon in the same way, it will be found to contract more vigorously
than a healthy one under the same intensity of current.
   If an      extensor muscle paralysed and wasted, the result of poison
ing by lead, be treated in the same way, no contraction can be induced
even with the highest power of the apparatus ; the unparalysed
flexors will alone contract.
   If a      muscle paralysed and wasted from loss of nutrition, as in those
local paralyses which are the sequelae of fever, the exanthemata, con
vulsions, irritation during teething, &c., be acted on in the same way,
no contraction can be induced             ;   if the   current is increased in intensity,
the healthy or antagonistic muscles contract.
   In    these two latter instances — after treatment by the continuous
galvanic       current, when circulation             has been re-established, and the
paralysed muscles arc better nourished                   — if   the current be reversed,
the positive          pole placed on the insertion              of the muscle, and the
negative pole on the belly, and               if   the current is not too strong, faint
contraction          takes place, gradually            increasing    until the muscle            is
sufficiently        restored to contract under the direct stimulus.
   A    singular                    with these paralysed and wasted
                        fact in connexion
muscles       is,
            that they will contract at the will of the patient, for some
time, before they will do so to the stimulus of the current      but the          ;
paralysed       muscles are not safe from               a   relapse until they contract
vigorously          to the ordinary direct electrical stimulus.
   At   a    certain stage of improvement, when the paralysed muscle will
neither contract to the will nor to the electro-magnetic current,                     it       will
do so to the combination of the two.

 XI. "    On the Influence of Temperature on the Electric Con-
        ducting-Power of Alloys."                      By A. Matthiessen, F.R.S.,

    The subject of this paper has                 been divided into four parts, viz.       : —
    I.  Experiments           on the influence of temperature               on the electric
 conducting-power            of alloys composed of two metals.
    II.  Experiments on the influence of temperature on the electric
conducting-power             of  some alloys composed          of three metals.
    III.     On a method by which the conducting-power                           of  a   pure
metal may be deduced from that of the impure one.
    IV.   Miscellaneous           and general remarks.
    In  the first part, after having                 given the numerical        results,     we
proceed to explain the law which regulates this property.                            It  is as
follows   : —
    The observed percentage decrement in the conducting-power                           of an
alloy   between       0°   and     100° C. is to       that calculated     between   0°   and
 100° C. as the observed conducting-power                     at 100° C. is to that cal
culated at 100° C.

where Po and         Pc represent the observed and calculated percentage
decrements in the conducting-power                       of the alloy between 0° and
100° C.     ;  and X       „  and X'        its observed and calculated conducting-
power at 100°         C,      Pc is equal in nearly all cases to 29*307 *, the
exceptions being only in the instances of thallium and iron alloysf.
    The above law holds good for most of the alloys belonging to the
first and third groups, as well as for a part of those belonging to the
second group       J.
   Now,      if the  above proportion,

fact    that the absolute              difference between                      0°   and 100° C. in the
resistance      of    an   alloy is equal            to the absolute difference between                     0°
and 100° in the calculated resistance                             of the alloy.
  Formula         2 may also be written
                                   r          — r'          =r        — r'

which,     if   correct, leads to the expression
                                         rt~ r t~r(f~ ro°;
that is, the absolute difference between the observed and calculated
resistances of an alloy at any temperature equals the absolute
difference between the observed and calculated resistances at 0° C. ;
or, in other words,
                      r — r' =a constant                         (3)
  After giving various examples to show the correctness of the                                       above,
we prove that from the expression
                                                     a constant
                                   r—r't=                                                                  (3)
we may deduce the formula for the correction of resistance or con-
ducting-power           for temperature               of an alloy              as soon as we know          its
composition           and its resistance at any temperature                              ;    for, as r'
r'-,    and     r'f   may be calculated with the help of the formula given
for the correction of conducting-power                                  for temperature for most of
the pure metals,           if   the constant           rt—r't           be determined, then
                                  rioo°=r'ioo°+constant'

                                                           +constant;
and from these terms the formula for the correction of resistance or
conducting-power            for temperature may                         be calculated,       which   in   most
cases    will   be    found very near the truth.
   In    the second part we show by                        a   few experiments that most alloys
of three metals will probably be governed by the same law with
respect to the influence of temperature on their conducting-power as
alloys    of two metals.

 For when      we consider the last two terms     of the proportion, and bear
 in mind that       a  trace of another metal has very little or no effect
 upon    V       (when    it represents the conducting-power         of an alloy
 consisting of one metal with only a trace of another metal), while               it
 alters

 replaced by     M      .
    We verify this by comparing the conducting-power of a pure
 metal directly determined, with the conducting-power of the same
metal deduced from a determination of the conducting-power of its
alloy with small quantities         of other metals.      It  is a curious fact,
 that the deduced values from experiments upon hard-drawn                    wires
are in reality the conducting-powers        of the annealed wire of the pure
metal.     After having thus verified the method, we have not hesitated
to employ it in the determination of the conducting-power of certain
metals which have not yet been            experimented      upon in a state     of
purity.
    In  the fourth part we point        out, first, that the percentage de
crement in the conducting-power           of alloys between      0° and 100°     is
never greater than that of the pure metals composing them             ; secondly,
that the conducting-power          of alloys  decreases    with  an increase    of
temperature (some bismuth alloys form an exception to this law) ;
thirdly, that in some cases the percentage composition of an alloy
may be deduced from its conducting-power,             with the aid of the per
centage     decrement in its conducting-power         ;  fourthly, the method
which    we have used       for determining the    class  to which the metals
belong     in respect to the conducting-power of their alloys ; and
fifthly, that the results which we have obtained and described in this
memoir fully bear out the views put forward in a former one on the
chemical nature of alloys.

XII. " On      the Peroxides of the Radicals of the Organic Acids."
       By Sir B. C. Brodie, Bart., Professor of Chemistry in the
       University of Oxford.       Received June 18, 1863.
                                (Abstract.)
   In   a former notice published    in the ' Proceedings of the Royal
Society' (vol. ix. p. 361), an announcement was made of the dis
covery of a new group of organic combinations, the peroxides of the
radicals of the organic acids— bodies which in the systems of the
combinations of these radicals occupy the same relative position as is
held by the peroxides of hydrogen,        barium,   or manganese in the
systems of the combinations       of those elements.     An account was
given   of the mode of preparation and properties of two members of
this group, the peroxides of benzoyl and of acetyl, Cu H10 04 and
C4 H, Ot.     The present paper contains an extension of this inquiry.
In it is   given an account of several other peroxides of monatomic
radicals, the peroxides of nitro-benzoyl,    of cumenyl, of butyl, and of
valeryl, and also an inquiry into the action of the peroxide of barium
on the bibasic anhydrides.
   The nitro-benzoic peroxide is formed by the action of fuming nitric
acid on the peroxide of benzoyl.       It stands to peroxide of benzoyl
in the  same relation as anhydrous    nitro-benzoic  acid stands to anhy
drous benzoic acid, and may be regarded as derived from that peroxide
by the substitution    in it of two atoms of peroxide of nitrogen for
two of hydrogen.      The formula of the substance is Cu H8 (NO,)a 04.

   The peroxide of cumenyl is procured by a process strictly analogous
to that by which the peroxide of benzoyl is formed ; it has the con
stitution CM HM 04.
   The peroxides of butyl and valeryl      are prepared   by the action of
hydrated     peroxide of barium    on the anhydrous     acid.   It  is only
 necessary to mix in a mortar equivalent quantities of the two sub

    When anhydrous succinic acid, lactide, or anhydrous camphoric
 acid is mixed with an equivalent of hydrated peroxide of barium, a
 solution is obtained possessing the most powerful oxidizing properties,
 which bleaches indigo,     evolves    chlorine   with hydrochloric acid, and
 oxidizes the protosalts      of  iron and manganese, but which does not
 discolour permanganic acid, or give with chromic acid                       colour
                                                                  the^hlue
formed by peroxide of hydrogen. When boiled, the solutions evolve
 oxygen, and afterwards contain a salt of the acid employed — in the
 case  of succinic acid, giving      a crystalline  precipitate of succinate of

lead a precipitate of camphorate of lead.              These solutions are in a
state of continual decomposition.           Only   in one instance, that of cam
phoric acid, was it found possible to analyse the substance, and that
only by indirect processes. The oxygen contained in the organic
peroxide was estimated in a measured portion of the solution by means
of  a standard    solution   of iodine    ;  the camphoric        acid formed     on
 boiling was determined by precipitation with acetate of lead in another
 measured portion ; and in a third portion the barium was estimated
as sulphate.    The results of       these determinations        are given below,
 the camphoric     acid being assumed as correct.              They lead to the
 conclusion that the solution contains the elements of one equivalent
of anhydrous camphoric acid,          one   of oxygen, and    one   of baryta.

 That the substance formed is to         be regarded as the baryta salt       of the
 peroxide of camphoryl, and not as the camphorate of the peroxide of
 barium, is proved by the reactions of the solution, which does not
 give peroxide of hydrogen when decomposed by acids, or a precipitate
 of the hydrated peroxide of barium when heated with                  a solution   of
 baryta.
    The organic peroxides constitute            a new and peculiar        group of
 chemical substances characterized by reactions never hitherto                found
 in any compound of carbon, and which materially extend our views
 of the possible properties of the so-called organic combinations, and
 of their analogies to inorganic substances. They are the organic
 representatives of chlorine in the same sense as the oxides of the
 compound     ammoniums       are the representatives        of potash, and in a
 yet closer sense than ether and alcohol           resemble the oxide and its
 hydrate,   or than    ethyl   or marsh-gas are analogous to hydrogen.
 This analogy is of a profound character, not consisting merely in
 the analogy of symbolic form, but in the absolute identity of reactions.

The admitted analogies of the peroxide of chlorine have as it were
their maximum in the organic peroxide.                Not only is chlorine re
presented in the peroxide, but hydrocloric acid is represented in the
organic acid, and a series      of parallel equations may readily be con
structed, showing the identical character of the reactions of the two
classes of substances.       Both bleach a solution of indigo, oxidize the
protosalts    of iron and    manganese,      decompose water under the in
fluence of sunlight,     and evolve oxygen with an alkaline               peroxide,
forming the salt of the corresponding acid.
XIII. " Explorations         in Spitzbergen, undertaken by the Swedish
        Expedition     in 1861, with the view of ascertaining the
        practicability of the measurement             of an Arc of the Meri
        dian."     By Dr. Otto     Torell,       Professor of Zoology in the
        University of Lund.          Communicated           by the President.
        Received June 2nd, 1863.
    In  the year 1858     I  made a voyage to Spitzbergen,            in company
with two other naturalists, in order        to investigate the Natural History
of that country.
    I  was thereby induced to study the           history of the various Arctic
 expeditions that had gone out from England.
    In Beechey's and Barrow's works             I  saw mentioned a suggestion
 which    attracted my attention in a high degree.               A  letter is there
 given from Captain      Edward Sabine to Mr. Davies Gilbert, in which
 the writer, on his return from his celebrated Pendulum                Expedition,
 proposes     to explore    Spitzbergen,      with the view of ascertaining
 whether the measurement of an          arc of the meridian could be carried
out there*.
    An arc from Ross Islet to Hope Island would comprise nearly 4 J°
 of latitude — equivalent to an arc of 9° in the mean latitude of France,
 and of 7° in the mean latitude of Great Britain.
    The difficulties    opposed by climate          and ground      were not con
 sidered by Captain Sabine to be so great as not to be surmounted                   ;
 and he offered, in company with another officer and a sergeant of

Artillery, to show either the feasibility or,       once   for all, the impos
sibility of the undertaking.        A  special advantage is pointed out by
Spitzbergen     being divided into two nearly equal parts from north to
south, thus very materially facilitating       communications      between the
different   angular   points.    Admiral Beechey      says   that Captain   Sa
bine's plan was placed before the Royal Society in 1825 by Sir            John
Herschel, taken into consideration in the autumn of the             same year,
and warmly supported         by Mr. Davies Gilbert, Sir Humphry Davy,
the then President,       and by other members of the Royal Society.
The reasons why it       was not carried out are not mentioned ; but         Sir
John Herschel      leaves us to infer that Captain Sabine was called upon
to display his powers in another scientific         undertaking     of  a more
arduous though not less important kind.           This explanation appeared
to be natural,      and thus the whole matter was shelved for many
years.
    The plan in question      seemed to me so simple and practical, and at
the same time so useful in a scientific point       of view, that I could not
help espousing     it with  a very warm interest.      In  the year 1860, the
Swedish government and Diet, as well as Prince Oscar, granted funds
for a new scientific expedition     to Spitzbergen.      Being placed at the
head of this undertaking, in which a rather large number of scientific
men were willing to take part, I did not fail to call the attention of
the Academy of Sciences to the plan proposed by General Sabine in
1825.     The Academy were alive to its importance;             and their two
astronomical     members, Professor     Selander and Assessor Lindhagen,
who had themselves taken part in the Swedish-Norwegian               triangula-
tion, considered that the explorations ought to be carried out, and for
that purpose they issued the requisite directions to two of the parti
cipators in the expedition, Messrs. Duner and Chydenius.              To them
it was confided     to investigate whether    suitable angular points could
be found     from the islands north of Spitzbergen          to Hope Island in
the South, either along the western coast of Spitzbergen or through
Hinloopen Strait and Weide Jans Water, which nearly divide Spitz
bergen into two from north to south.           One went on board the ship
which,    according    to the plan, was to explore the north of Spitz
bergen and Hinloopen Strait, and the other on board the other ship
which was to explore the west of Spitzbergen and Weide Jans Water.
At the end of May 1861 the two vessels reached Amsterdam Island, in

                                           660                          [June 18,
 nearly 80° latitude     ;   and at the commencement of June they passed
 Verlegen Hook, and anchored in Treurenburg Bay,                 whence Parry,
 in 1827, made his celebrated attempt to reach the North Pole.
 But the polar        ice    immediately      afterwards  pressed    against   the
 coast,   and imprisoned        both vessels     more than a month       in Treu
 renburg Bay.        The pack was so close that no boat excursions of any
 extent could be made.             The explorations for survey were a good
 deal impeded      by this circumstance          ; for the investigation   of the
 western coast of Spitzbergen could not be commenced until a much
 later period than intended.           The survey of Weide Jans Water could
 not be   carried into effect, owing to drift ice, adverse winds, and calms.
 Mr. Duner, to whom this undertaking was allotted,             as well as the   in
 vestigation of the practicability       of the survey along the western coast
 of Spitzbergen,     came to the conclusion        that no impediments existed
 for  carrying    out the triangulation         from Ross Islet to Amsterdam
 Island, but that the mountains surrounding Magdalena Bay are so
 steep and difficult or impossible of access, that the continuation of
 the survey southwards          must    be   considered,  if not absolutely   im
possible,    at least     so   difficult and entailing     such heavy expense,
 that its execution along that coast will probably             never be carried
 into effect.
    Mr. Chydenius, who          was   to explore the northern      portion of the
 arc, presumed      to be     measurable from Ross Islet to Hope Island,
was more fortunate in his work.            During sundry boat excursions and
 ascensions of many mountains from the northernmost part of Spitz
bergen to the termination of Hinloopen Strait, he succeeded in com
pletely solving the problem as to that part of Spitzbergen, comprising
nearly the half of the arc to be measured.              The survey    was carried
out courageously and energetically under circumstances of frequent
difficulty,   as well  in the drift ice     as  in crossing the glaciers of the
interior.
    The accompanying map makes              a detailed description  unnecessary,
and   I therefore confine myself to stating that all the lines of the
sights in the network marked with continuous lines are, with one single
exception, observed, and that           Mr. Chydenius has had opportunities
of convincing himself that though not all the lines of the sights in
the network marked with dotted lines are observed, yet nothing pre
vents the angular points connected by them from being seen one from

  1863.]                                 661
 the other.     The triangles connected by continuous lines of the sights
 are  nine in number.        Their angles are computed by Mr. Chydenius
 in an accompanying Table.            All  the angular points are selected on
 moderately high and accessible          mountains, situated close to, or not
 very far from the coasts, and the distances between them are not
 greater than will admit of the signals being easily seen.             Mr. Chy
 denius found      the ground, as well in Low Island as to the west of
 Treurenburg, to      be favourable for measuring a base.
    As the survey,     so far as carried out, proves that,      for executing the
 measurement of an arc of the meridian, no impediments exist which
 may not be overcome by courage and perseverance, there remains the
 question whether the part not yet explored may be expected to be
 equally    favourable  ;  the reply    to this    cannot, of course, be fully
 given until a similar       survey has been made of the still unknown
 portion  ;   there are, however, means of partially judging of the pro
 spects of success.       Mr. Chydenius considers himself almost justified
 in stating with certainty that the mountains marked X and % on
 the map will be found to be visible from Weide Jans Water.
 He is inclined to think that the             easiest   communication    may be
 made through Lomme            Bay.    The distance from Hinloopen Strait
to Weide Jans Water cannot be great.                   According to statements
 which, however, we were unable to verify, there is said to be a strait
 connecting     these  two sheets of water, and a vessel is reported to
have sailed through        it.   Mr. Lamont is also of opinion that Weide
Jans Water is open to the north.            This,   if found to be true, would
tend greatly to facilitate the work.
    It is also probable that the network can be drawn from the Waigat
Islands at the southern          embouchure      of Hinloopen Strait to the
Walter Thymen Bay, through the latter to Weide Jans Water, and
further   to   Hope Island.
    There still remains the question as to the facilities that the land
on the two sides of Weide Jans Water may afford for the survey.
Those walrus-hunters whom           I have interrogated regarding that part
of the country,      are unanimous     in their opinion     as to the mountains
on the western side being similar to those on the west coast, that is
to say, as inaccessible as possible.         But the country to the east of
the said Water is described as a             tableland, in which accessible
mountains       may be found      in several places.       There   are therefore

well-founded       reasons for thinking that the whole arc will be found
measurable      if  the survey is continued.     Mr. Chydenius has offered
to furnish the remaining part of the exploration.
    The Swedish Academy            of Sciences consider the completion of
the survey so important,        that they have petitioned Government            to
supply funds for carrying         it into effect during the present or next
year.      There is every probability that the money will           be granted,
and,    if the result turn out as expected, that necessary         steps  will be
taken for executing the measurement of the arc itself.
    The Swedish Government has,           at the instance   of the Academy      of
 Sciences, already furnished        means  for preliminary investigations in
reference to another geodetic enterprise, namely, for the Swedish
share of the         proposed  large middle-European       triangulation    from
 Palermo     to Trondhjem, and have asked the Estates for money for
executing the measurement.           Should, then, the survey in Spitzbergen
also be carried out, an important contribution         will  be made, not    only
 to ascertain the compression of the globe in the vicinity of the          North
 Pole, but also for the much-sought-after        knowledge of the real form
 of the earth on different portions of its surface ; and the undertaking
 will to a certain degree complete the results both of the projected
 middle-European         triangulation    and   of  the   Russo-Scandinavian
already effected.
     If  the triangulation    in question   be executed,    it will not    be  the
 only result arising from        several  years' scientific labours in Spits
 bergen.      It   is superfluous   here to allude    to many investigations
 of importance which may be made ; it is sufficient to keep in mind
  the situation of Northern Spitzbergen, distant scarcely 10° of latitude
 from the North Pole.          There are well-founded     reasons for    thinking
  that the execution of the measurement in question may be looked
  forward to.       And if we seek for the origin of the whole matter, we
 can trace     it in Captain Sabine's well-planned and lucidly explained
  project, which he submitted to the examination of the Royal Society
 in 1825.

XIV. " On        the Magnetic Disturbance which took place on the
        14th of December 1862."              By Balfour Stewart, M.A.,
        F.R.S.       Received May 19, 1863.
  On the 14th of December 1862, a magnetic disturbance occurred
about 6 o'clock in the afternoon, and was registered by means of the
Kew magnetographs.            As usual it       was accompanied         by an auroral
display and by earth-currents,           and the latter phenomena were ob
served at Greenwich by means of a system of telegraphic wires which
had recently come into the possession of the Astronomer                     Royal.
  By the kindness of Mr. Airy, the Kew Observatory                           has been
favoured with a copy of the curves which represent the earth-cur
rents collected at Greenwich during the progress of this disturbance                      ;
and a comparison of these with the Kew magnetograph                         curves will
form the subject of the following paper.                 It   will, however, first       be
necessary to state the arrangement adopted at Greenwich.                           There
are two wires proceeding            from the Observatory,            one   ending near
Croydon     and the other near Dartford (nearly at right angles)                   ;   and
these    are well insulated      throughout      their entire length,        and have
good earth-connexions        at their extremities.
  From      these,   by means of galvanometers, the intensity                of earth-
currents    is recorded  for two very favourable directions ; and from
these   again the intensity of those currents which flow in the magnetic
meridian, and in a direction perpendicular               to   it,   may be very easily
deduced.         The standard for direction         is   the current which flows
through the wire of      a   battery from the zinc pole, and which            is   called
the zinc-current.       With this explanation the earth-current diagrams
appended to this paper will be quite intelligible              ;    and with regard to
the magnetic curves,      it   is   only needful to remark that increasing or-
dinates denote decreasing declination and decreasing horizontal                    force,
and that the normal lines, which have been furnished                       through the
kindness of General Sabine, denote the position which the curves
would have occupied had no disturbance supervened.    But before
proceeding       to compare together the two sets of curves,                 it   will   be
necessary    to advert to    a   peculiarity of disturbances which            enters as
an essential element into        all such discussions.         It   has been found by
General Sabine that      if  the disturbances of declination be divided into
two categories, easterly and westerly, these obey very different laws
                                                                       3a2

of daily variation, and also that this difference is not of the                            same
description for all stations     ;   so that we are compelled to view a mag
netic disturbance as the resultant effect of two disturbances of differ
ent character, superimposed upon one another.                            General Sabine has
likewise stated his opinion          that this duality of action may perhaps
be due to the        disturbing force entering the earth at two or more
points, one      denoting magnetism of a more permanent kind, and the
other magnetism of an induced description.                           A   study of the Kew
disturbance-curves         tends to give confirmation to such an idea                      ;   for
in these it is seldom found that the whole body of force which pro
duces a disturbance is one which preserves the same type throughout
and only varies in intensity.             Even   if we   suppose that this type                will
vary with the hour of the day, we shall find,                   if   we take disturbances
which last for several days, that the type of force at a given hour of
the first day is in very many cases different from that during the
same     hour of the second.         When, however, we confine our attention
to very abrupt       changes of force, we find that the disturbance-type
which     these display retains more         of the      same    character throughout
a disturbance.        In   order to explain this, we may perhaps suppose
that there are two sets        of magnetic particles in the earth — one set
being of the nature of soft iron, and the other similar                          to hardened
steel.  Now only the first of these would be acted on by any very
sudden change in the disturbing force, since it would require time in
order to influence the second set. We may thus perhaps account
for the fact that any very sudden change is of one type, since it only
influences one set of particles. Let us now consider what will take
place    if a   disturbance of the same primary nature continues for any
length of time.  Here the hard-iron particles will also be influenced
to an extent compounded of the time and of the average value of the
disturbing force during that time.               The magnetic needle, therefore,
will now    be acted on by the    joint influence of these two sets of par
ticles, whereas at     the beginning of the disturbance it was only acted
on by one of them, namely, the soft-iron                  ones.          The type of force
will therefore have changed          if   the hard-iron particles are differently
distributed in our globe from the soft-iron ones                     ;    and   if,   instead of
two, there are many sets of particles, we shall have                        a   very compli
cated effect.
  Now this duality of disturbing forces must                    be considered when we

 J863.]                                 665
 attempt    to ascertain the connexion between such forces and earth-
 currents, since we are not entitled to suppose that one of these two
 forces is related to earth-currents        in precisely the    same manner as
 the other.     A   small soft- iron force may be comparable to a large
 hard-iron one as far as an earth-current is concerned ; or the reverse
 may be the case.       When, however, there         is a very rapid change      of
 disturbing force, since this     affects the earth     through only    one set  of
 particles, we shall by its means be better able to trace the bond of
connexion     between a single type of magnetic force and the corre
sponding earth-current.        Rapid changes of force          are   therefore   of
peculiar value in such an investigation.
    Bearing this in mind, let us endeavour to connect together the
phenomena of earth- currents and magnetic disturbances by two
successive hypotheses, one of which,           it would    seem, must represent
the truth unless there be some new link of connexion between mag
netism and electricity with which we are unacquainted.                  The first
hypothesis    is that in which earth-currents         are supposed to give rise
to magnetic disturbances        according to the laws by which a current
acts upon a magnet.        This may     be called the theory    of direct action.
    By the second hypothesis, earth-currents            are supposed to be      in
duced, or secondary currents generated in the crust of the earth by
those small but rapid changes in terrestrial magnetism which consti
tute disturbances.      This may be called the theory of induced action.
    Now, first, on the theory of direct action.          Zinc-currents going to
the south should correspond with magnetic disturbances decreasing
the declination   ;  and zinc-currents      going to the east should corre
spond with an increase of horizontal force ; but we find by the diagrams
that while on this hypothesis the disturbance of the horizontal-force
needle will be tolerably well accounted for by the east and west cur
rents, the same correspondence does not hold between the north and
south currents and the declination-disturbance.              But  I do not think
that this circumstance, rightly viewed, tells either in favour of or
against the hypothesis.        A   glance at the earth-current        curves will
show that the ordinates      of the   one bear generally a fixed proportion
to those of the other, showing us that the total current has flowed
backwards and forwards along one line*           ; and though it is equally ap
parent, by a glance at the magnetic curves, that the same type of force
    * This had  been previously observed  in other cases by Mr. C. V. Walker.

                                     666                            [June 18,
has not been preserved throughout        the disturbance, yet the explana
tion of the unity of type in the earth-currents        may be that these are
twisted into a line of motion, owing to the disposition of the conduct
ing strata of the earth's surface, just       as a current    can only move
backwards or forwards along an insulated wire.             Indeed a little re
flection will show us that earth-currents     are not local phenomena      ; so
that  if we  endeavour to estimate quantitatively their influence on the
magnet according to the hypothesis of direct action, we must first ex
tend our field of observation, and obtain their value in other countries
besides our own.
   But to return to our comparison of curves. We see that for the
greater part of the disturbance both the horizontal force and the
declination were very much above        their normal lines, while on the
other hand the currents were frequently crossing their zero lines, — and
that both currents were simultaneously           and for a long portion      of
their time very near zero,      although    during this time the magnetic
disturbance was considerable.
   Next, with respect to     a very abrupt disturbance     which commenced
about    8h 50m,  the corresponding earth-current      curves are exceedingly
powerful, alternately passing and repassing the zero line to nearly
the same distance on both sides, while the absolute disturbance of the
horizontal force, and probably of the declination, was not very great.
   We have thus, in the first place,       a very sluggish action    of earth-
currents, while      the magnetic disturbance was considerable, and in
the next place a very violent action of the former when the absolute
disturbing force     was  by no means excessive      ; and we may add that
at 9h 50m both earth-currents      were near zero, while both elements of
the earth's magnetism were much disturbed.
   For all   these reasons this comparison     of the curves  is unfavourable
to the hypothesis of direct action.
   Let us now consider the other hypothesis, or that of induced action,
and we shall find the following points in its favour.
    1st.  That in this disturbance, for   at least one hour, both elements
of the earth's magnetic force remained           at a considerable    distance
from their normals, and that during           this time the earth -currents
observed were exceedingly small.       Now, on the hypothesis of induced
action, the earth-current effect depends not on the absolute value of
the disturbing     force, but on its rate of change     ; and   if during this

^63.]                                   667
period    we examine the horizontal-force          curve,    we shall     find    the
abruptness of change not so great as in those cases where greater
earth-currents     were produced,       while   in the declination-curve          the
abruptness of change during this period is exceedingly small.
    2nd.  A  reference to the diagrams will show us that in general the
most abrupt magnetic disturbances are those which are accompanied
by the greatest earth-currents,        and that in particular a very abrupt
disturbance, which took place about         8h 50m, was    accompanied by very
strong earth-currents,      alternately positive and negative, those of the
one name being nearly as powerful             as those   of the other, while on
the other hand the corresponding           magnetic disturbances were on an
average decidedly on one side of the normal lines.
    On the other hand, the following fact seems at first to tell against
the theory of induction.         An inspection of the curves will show that
we have currents remaining           on one. side of the zero- line for some
length of time, during which the magnetic disturbances have never
theless changed in both directions.            When, however,      we reflect on
this circumstance,    we are led to see that since we have two sets                of
disturbances taking place simultaneously,           so we must also have two
sets  of earth-currents.      Now   one of these disturbances, which        we may
perhaps call the soft-iron        one,   reproduces those small and rapid
changes which take place in the primary force, while on the other
hand the hard-iron disturbance            averages   these small changes and
presents us with a disturbance- wave of long period.             Precisely, then,
as  in the magnetic curves       we have waves      of short period superim
posed upon waves of long period, so          will it be in the earth-current
curves.     Those   currents    due to the soft-iron       disturbances     will   be
superimposed      upon     those due to the        hard-iron    ones,    with this
difference, that we are not entitled to assume           that the proportion       in
intensity between the two simultaneous earth- currents must be pre
cisely that which exists between the rates of change of the two cor
responding simultaneous disturbances.             It will  be apparent that      this
feature of duality ought also to be presented by the aurora            ;  and here
it is well known that     we have at least two phenomena, one            of  a more
fitful and the other of        a more     permanent character, namely, the
streamers and the auroral arch.           We may suppose the first of these
phenomena to correspond to the soft-iron, and the second to the hard-
iron disturbances.       Indeed    it is questionable whether the different

                                         668                              June 18,
   varieties   of aurora:      are confined to these two    ;  for General Sabine
  has informed       me     that he himself,    along with the late Sir Edward
   Parry, observed       at   Lerwick in the Shetland Isles in 1818, at the
  same instant, two auroral arches crossing            one another    at an angle.
  But,   be this as    it may, when     we reflect that there are many kinds      of
  particles in our earth, some of which may be affected more rapidly
  than others by a primary magnetic force, we shall cease to wonder
  that the phenomena presented are of a complicated description.
      All  these considerations have induced me to          think that it is lost
  labour to attempt a quantitative           comparison when our observation
  of the magnetic disturbances and their corresponding earth-currents
  is confined to one locality ; and it will be seen from this paper, that
  while endeavouring          to  uphold  the hypothesis     of induced action,    I
  have done so by a comparison of a general and qualitative rather than
  by one of a quantitative nature.

         Physicians, Professor of Physiology and of General and
         Morbid Anatomy in King's College, London ; Physician to
         King's College Hospital, &c. Received June 5, 1863.
     Few anatomical inquiries of late years have excited more interest
                                                                   '
 than the present one. Since my paper published in the Philosophical
Transactions' for the year 1860,           several  memoirs have appeared in
 Germany.         In my paper just published in the last volume of the
 ' Transactions,'     I  have replied to the statements of      K iihne  and  Kol-
liker, but      I  had not succeeded        in actually   tracing the very fine
nucleated fibres      I had    demonstrated from one undoubted nerve-trunk
to another.         As   a demonstration,     therefore,   my conclusions     were
defective, though the only explanation to be offered of facts               I  had
observed was that included             in the view   I  propounded    in my first
paper.       The question between my opponents and myself upon this
matter is not one of interpretation, but a question of simple fact.
I   assert that the fine nerve-fibres can be followed much further than
the point where Kiihne and Kolliker             maintain the ends or termina-

 tiotu are situated,      if the specimen be so prepared             as to prevent
 destruction of these most delicate fibres, and the refractive power of
 the medium be such as to enable us to           see  them.
     I propose to present to the Royal Society next session a paper in
 which    I  shall demonstrate the truth of the conclusions          I have     arrived
 at  ; but   as my specimens are already prepared, and during                  the last
 few months several drawings          have been      made,    I   hasten to give a
 short statement of facts, in order that those who have been led to
 conclusions opposed to my own may have an opportunity                    of studying
 the very same muscle.
     The great width and refractive power of the large elementary
 fibres of the pectoral of the common frog render it impossible to
 follow for any great distance amongst them nerve-fibres of the
 60    ood^ of       an 'nch = -000187'" in diameter;            and  I  have there
 fore long been searching for a very thin voluntary muscle, with fine
 fibres, which, like the bladder of the frog, could be examined with
 out the necessity of making thin sections, and thereby deranging the
 relation of all the finest and most delicate structures.            Such a muscle
 I have   found in the extensive mylo-hyoid        of the little    green tree-frog
 (Hyla arborea).        The elementary fibres of this muscle             are scarcely
                                             = •0036'" in diameter
 more than the
                      -00(.th of an inch                                    ;   and as
 there are but two layers, the fibres of which are at right angles to
 each other, all the structures        in the muscle can          be demonstrated
 most beautifully.       The very long thin muscular fibres are not too
 close for exact observation.        The vessels can be readily injected.*
     These specimens       have been      prepared     upon     the same plan as
 others, and are preserved in glycerine, which enables                  me    to press
 the thin muscle and separate           the fibres further from each other,
 while the finest fibres of the nerves are prevented, by the viscid
 medium,      from breaking     or from being so compressed amongst the
 other tissues as to be destroyed or rendered invisible.                The muscle
    * The   very thin and wide intercostal muscles of the Chameleon, after having
been soaked in glycerine, may be separated    into two layers, external and internal
intercostal*, in each of which the finest ramifications of the nerve-fibres      may be
followed, and their relation to the sarcolemma       demonstrated.      The long ele
mentary fibres of the thin tubular part of the tongue of the same animal are also
favourable for this investigation; but the Chameleon is only to be obtained occa
sionally, and the muscle of the green tree-frog, above referred to, possesses many
advantages.

fibres are completely disintegrated.              The capillaries     were injected as
in the other cases*.
     In this thin muscle, networks formed by bundles of dark-bordered
fibres, consisting of from two to five or six, may be very easily shown,
and with high powers (700 to 3000 diameters) the very fine nucleated
fibres resulting from the division and subdivision of these in a dicho-
tomous     f manner,       can be readily demonstrated.
     In  this thin muscle      I have often followed      individual fine nucleated
nerve-fibres, now over, now under muscular fibres, sometimes cross
ing transversely, sometimes obliquely, and sometimes running for a
certain distance parallel to the fine muscular fibre.                     The drawing
accompanying           this paper renders further description              unnecessary.
I   shall enter into full detail in my communication               next session     ;  but
as the summer is the period to obtain specimens                  of the Hyla,        I am
anxious my fellow- labourers in Germany should at once be acquainted
with the advantages of the thin muscle alluded to ; and I cannot
too strongly recommend this beautiful little frog, which they have
the advantage of procuring more readily than Englishmen,                       for micro
scopical investigation.          All  the tissues are beautifully       distinct, and    I
challenge those who are interested in these questions to discuss them
with    me, selecting the tissues       of this animal for special study.

cular fibres from   a dark-bordered fibre.       One of the subdivisions of this fibre is
seen at /, where it again runs with a very fine dark-bordered fibre (o). The dark-
bordered fibre (o) was some distance higher up in the specimen, but its place has
been altered in order to avoid the necessity for a still larger drawing. Above b a nu
cleus of  a very fine nerve-fibre  is seen.  Such nuclei lie upon the surface of the mus
cular fibres, external  to the sarcolemma.       The nucleus often appears as    if it were
within   the sarcolemma    (c), but the fibres proceeding from each extremity render
such a position impossible. The relation of these nerve-nuclei to the sarcolemma
is seen at I in profile. The nuclei, as well as the fibres for a certain distance,
often adhere to the sarcolemma        very firmly ; but in the thin mylo-hyoid muscle
the course of the fibres over or under, but always external to the muscular fibres,
may be readily traced if the muscular fibres be separated slightly from each
other, as represented in the drawing.

in many other fine fibres in different parts of the specimen.
   Traces of connective tissue are seen in all parts near the fine nerve-fibres and
around the muscular fibres.         Here and there some very fine connective        tissue-
fibres, which were    not altered    by acetic acid, are represented.     These represent
the remains of fine nerve-fibres, which existed in a state of functional activity at
 an earlier period.
   The drawing, with the exception of the position of the nerve-fibre (o) above
mentioned, is an actual copy from nature.          The relative position of the muscular
fibres, the form and    general   characters   of the so-called nuclei, and the position
and size of the nerve-fibres    and their nuclei have been carefully preserved.
   I  have traced the very fine nerve-fibres in so many instances      from one trunk to
 another ramifying at a very considerable       distance,  that I cannot believe any true
 terminations or ends exist.

 strating the connexion between the nerve-cells and fibres in the grey
 matter of the convolutions             and in other parts of the mammalian
 brain, and have followed individual fibres for a much greater distance

 than can be effected in sections prepared oy other processes of inves
  tigation which    I have tried.      In many instances       one     thick fibre is
 continuous     with  one  or other extremity of the          " cell,"     while from
 its opposite portion from three to six or eight thinner fibres diverge
 in   a direction  onwards and outwards.         This arrangement is particu
 larly distinct in the grey matter of the sheep's brain. The broad
 extremities of the cells for the most part are directed towards the
 white matter of the hemisphere.             The cells   have no cell-wall ;       and
 the matter of which the fibre is composed is continuous with that                  of
 which the outer part of the      "  cell
                                          "  consists.
     The so-called "granular matter," or "granular matrix," which is
 described as existing in considerable quantity in the grey matter
 around the cells and between the fibres, results,                I  think from the
 disintegration    of the finest nerve-fibres and cells         ;   for in the speci
 mens    I  have prepared, the tissue intervening           between       the cells  is
 seen to be composed      entirely   of nerve-fibres.     The majority of these
 fibres are not more than the          Yo^oooth of         an mcn m diameter ;
 and many fibres, whose continuity           with cells can       be demonstrated,
                                                                   *
 are as fine as this at a distance      of not more than                th of an inch
from their origin.        The slightest displacement of the thin glass
 covering the specimen will often destroy these delicate fibres, and
 nothing but amorphous granular matter results. The apparently
 free nuclei in the more superficial part of the grey matter are really
 the nuclei of cells, with every one         of which fibres are in connexion.
There are no cells with      less than two fibres      in continuity with them.
 In the brain of a young animal it is        easy to find many cells connected
 together by broad bands of fibres, which vary much in length                     and
thickness     ; but in the adult    a-  positive connexion between two con
 tiguous cells can be demonstrated only here and there.                  As the cells
separate further and further from each other, the fibre becomes so
thin and long, and it changes the plane in which it ramifies to such
an extent, that it cannot often be traced for any great distance.
     The fibres   are formed as the cells,      originally continuous, become
separated further and further from each other.                 In    all parts of the
nervous system the so-called           "cells"    (often termed         "nuclei" in
peripheral parts) are structurally continuous with each other through
the fibres.

1863.]                                      673
  The fibres        are not offsets or outgrowths         which        grow centrifugally
from different          adjacent cells and then join or anastomose with one
another, but they result, on the other hand, from the moving away
from each other of cells which were originally continuous                           ;       so that a
very thin fibre         of fgo   o oo^1
                                        of an mch m diameter, and perhaps
three    or four thousandths          of an inch in length, represents the
broader and shorter bands or cords of communication                           which existed
at an earlier period of development, when the cells were much closer
together.
  It    has been stated that nerve-cells do not exist in the white matter                            ;
but numerous cells           are present     in this tissue for the distance of
perhaps the sixth of an inch or more beneath the grey matter.                                       I
do not propose now to enter into detail               ;    the arrangement of the
cells and fibres will be accurately represented in drawings                             ;    for it is
not possible for me to convey an accurate idea of the structure of
this elaborate tissue by description. I may be permitted to offer the
following general conclusions resulting from observations upon the
grey matter of the convolutions of man, the sheep, cat, and dog.
   1.   The numerous nerve-cells of the grey matter                     are    all connected
or give origin to at least two fibres.
  2. These          fibres, wide near their       origin, gradually             diminish in
thickness until they are not more than the                      (J10    „ th   of       an inch    in
                                                          1 Q
diameter.
  3. The granular matter said to be so abundant                        in   the grey matter
consists of fine and very delicate nerve-fibres, which are easily broken
down when thin sections of this soft tissue are submitted to micro
scopical examination without special preparation.
  4.    It   is   probable that the cells of the grey matter of the convolu
tions are connected together        ;     but in the adult the cells are not often
connected with those cells which are situated nearest to them.
  5. There         is   no reason for supposing that the nerve-cells, here or
elsewhere, influence          any nerve-fibres     save    those which              are struc
turally continuous with them                  .

     The author    gave      a detailed description               of his apparatus, and of
the method employed in drying the air.
   The result of his experiments gave as the coefficient of increase of
elasticity of air of constant volume for 1° F. 0-002040, this being
slightly different from that given by Regnault, which is 0-002036.
   He also finds that the temperature of the freezing-point of mercury
is constant, and that its value on Fahrenheit's scale, as given by an
air- thermometer, is — 3/°-93, while as recorded by a standard mercu
rial thermometer it is          — 38o-00.          It   is probable that this difference
is owing to an anomalous contraction   of mercury before it freezes,
similar to the corresponding expansion of water ; but this effect in the
case of mercury seems to be very small, and it may be said that a
mercurial    thermometer          properly         graduated,         will denote the true
temperature, even down to the freezing-point                          of the mercury itself.

  2nd.    As regards weight.               By the weight of any letter in respect to
any given variable is to be               understood the exponent of that variable
in the term affected with the coefficient                             ;   and by the weight of any
term of the resultant              in respect to such variable, the sum of the
weights of its several simple factors                     ;     each term              in the resultant in
respect to any given variable has the same weight                                          ;   and this weight
may also be proved to be alike for each variable in the same set, and
may be taken as the weight of the resultant in respect to such set.
This being premised, we have the following theorem : —
   The value of the weight of the resultant in respect to any particular
set of the variables, ex. gr. the (1 +«) set, will be the coefficient of
                              pi+"    . <P . rv . . . wx                  in P.
   In    the particular       case where               a=/3=y               . . .     =X, the               above    ex

coefficients.      Thus,     ex.    gr.,    if     we    suppose each equation linear in
respect to the variables of each set, the degree of the resultant in
respect to the coefficients of any equation will be

 degree becomes         ir(n), and the weight                  —    i— —        '-.
   The    above theorems are,         I      believe, altogether new.

    A   few remarks arising out of the perusal            of this paper may per
 haps not be considered as        out of place on the present occasion.         They
 are not meant as in any way impugning                the author's     views of the
 laws determining       the fracture     and disruption       of glacier  masses,   or
 their application to glacier-phenomena in general, but in relation to
 the somewhat mysterious process of regelation itself, and to those
 generally recognized and most remarkable facts of the gradual con
 version of snow into more or less transparent ice, and the reunion                 of
 blocks and fissured or broken fragments, under the joint influence                 of
renewed pressure and of that process (whatever its nature), into conti
nuous masses.        If  regelation be really a process of crystallization, it
seems exceedingly       difficult to imagine how the molecules forming the
cementing layer between two juxtaposed surfaces can at once arrange
themselves conformably to the accidentally                differing  axial arrange
ments of those of the two surfaces cemented.                  A   macled crystal is
indeed a crystallographical         possibility ; but then the      axes  of the two
individuals   cohering by the macle-plane have to each other a definite
geometrical relation in space, as is well exemplified in the case              of the
interrupting film in Iceland spar.             At   the temperature        at which
" regelation "    takes place (viz. the precise limit between the liquid
and solid states), it seems to me very possible that the cohesive forces
of the molecules of the cemented surfaces may                   be so nearly coun
teracted as to bring those surfaces into what may be so far regarded

as a viscous state as to permit (not indeed a sensible and finite change
of figure of     a small portion    of the  mass   without fracture, but) a cer
tain freedom      of movement in the individual molecules, to some sen
sible depth within the surface, so as to allow of a gradually progressive
deviation of their axes from exact parallelism,              and thus to effect a
transition from        one   crystalline   arrangement       to another — not by
macling, but by curvilinear distortion, such as may be conceived to pre
vail in pearl-spar and other similar disturbed forms of crystals.             Nay,
I can conceive      it possible that by very long continuance         at this exact
temperature (especially        if aided by tremors short of disruption         pro
pagated through the mass, which, as we              see  in the crystallization of
cold wrought iron in the axle-trees of railway carriages, powerfully
favour the crystalline rearrangement of molecules even in the most
rigid solids)     the contiguous      blocks may influence each other's cry
stallization to a greater and greater depth through the medium of the
cementing film, thus tending continually            to straiten the curve of the
connecting       chain of axes, and after a very long time to bring the
two blocks into perfect conformity,             so as to form an uninterrupted
crystal   ;   and this, or something       like this,   I  take to be the process
by which the snow of a          neve- is converted into the imperfectly trans
parent and sometimes fully transparent ice of a glacier.                  Tremors
of the kind here alluded to would not            be wanting    in a glacier in con
tinued process of displacement,          and in some part or other of which
disruptions consequent on violent strain are momentarily taking place.
   On the subject of the temperature of the interior of a glacier,                 I
would observe that there will be found in the archives of the Royal
Society, on the occasion of the Committee for recommending objects
of inquiry to Lieut. Foster during one of his Polar expeditions, a
recommendation of mine that the expedition should be furnished
with a set of boring-implements for the purpose of piercing some
very large and compact mass of ice, with the expectation of finding
it much below the freezing-temperature.             The heat of summer, it was
suggested, would all be carried off in the water resulting from surface-
melting     ;  while the intense cold of a polar winter would penetrate the
interior, and thus give rise to       a mean   temperature very far below that
of the external climate.           The implements (if       I  remember rightly)
were furnished, but Lieut. Foster reported that no mass of ice suffi
ciently large could be met with so free from fissures                as  not to be

permeated by infiltering water during          the summer months            ;  and  if
any results were obtained, they were not striking or definite enough
to be worth recording.       That the lower surface of         a glacier  in contact
with the earth is in     a constant    state  of fusion,      even   in those cold
regions, is proved by the phenomena recorded by Dr. Kane of the
Mary Minturn River in lat. 78° 54', and the feeder of the Kane
Lake, lat. 78° 18', which never ceases to flow, summer or winter.
Admitting this    as a general fact, the sliding       of  a glacier on its bed    is
an obvious necessity ; and that     it should    be unaccelerated is no more
a matter   of wonder or difficulty of conception than the unaccelerated
descent   of the weight of a clock which is never abandoned to its own
impetus, but brought to rest after every momentary descent by the
action of the scapement, — or the unaccelerated fall of a body in a
resisting medium when the resistance becomes                 equal to gravity,     —
or of a weight gradually and uniformly lowered by the hand.                      Per
haps the more general way of conceiving it would be to regard the
whole glacier as a mass propped up against          a support anyhow inclined,
and prevented from tumbling over sideways by lateral stays.                     Such
a mass would rest     in its position,  if duly   supported either by a base-
abutment, or by a heap of its own debris          ;   but   if  these  were   slowly
abraded, destroyed, or picked        away, the whole mass would descend
 bodily in the exact manner of the withdrawal             of support.
   On the disruption of a nearly homogeneous elastic solid in a state
of strain, I would add a remark which seems to me of some moment,
as explanatory    of the greater cohesive strength which is well known
to be   imparted to cements, especially those of a resinous or gummy
nature, by the admixture       of extraneous matter in fine powder.                If
in such a solid there be one portion, however small, weaker than the
rest, the strain being uniform, a crack will originate in that place. Now
a crack, once produced, has a tendency to run — for this plain reason,
that at its momentary limit, at the point on which it has just arrived,
the divellent force on the molecules there situated is counteracted
only by half the cohesive force which acted when there was no crack,
viz., the cohesion of the uncracked         portion    alone.      But   if  a crack
anywhere produced be stopped from running by encountering a solid
particle of greater cohesive force, fracture will no longer be determined
by the accidental deficiency of cohesion at some weak point, but by
the average resistance of the whole cementing mass.

    It  would,    I  think,   be interesting to determine, on the more trans
parent portions of glacier ice, by the simple and easily applied test of
polarized light, whether a definite crystalline structure prevail in its
interior, and      if so, in what direction the axis lies     in relation to the
lines of fissure in the crevasses.           Nor is there any reason why the
idea above thrown out respecting the mutual modification               of structure
of two     masses cemented by regelation, at or near         their plane of junc
tion, should not be subjected to a similar test.
XX. "       On the Absorption           and Radiation of Heat by Gaseous
         and Liquid Matter." — Fourth Memoir.                   By John Tyn-
         dall, F.R.S.          Received June 18, 1863.
     In his    former researches on the absorption and radiation of heat
 by gaseous       matter, the author compared different gases and vapours
at a common thickness with each other.                  In the first part of the
 present communication           he determines, in the case of several gases and
 vapours, the absorption effected by different thicknesses of the same
 gaseous body.           His least thickness     was  001 of    an   inch, and his
 greatest 49-4 inches       ; thus the thickness varied from     1 to nearly 5000.
 The apparatus employed for the smaller thicknesses consisted of a
 hollow cylinder, with its end closed by a plate of rock-salt ; into this
 fitted a second hollow cylinder,            with its end closed by       a   second
 plate of salt.       One cylinder moved within the other as a piston, and
 by this means         the plates of salt could be brought into flat contact
 with each other, or separated to any required distance. The dis
 tance between the plates was measured by means of a vernier.                    The
 cylinder     was   placed horizontal,     being suitably    connected with the
 front chamber          used in the      author's  former   researches,     and the
 source of heat employed was a copper plate, against which                  a steady
 sheet of gas-flame was caused to play.
     The absorptions of carbonic oxide, carbonic acid, nitrous                 oxide,
 and defiant gas were determined by this apparatus, and such                      dif
 ferences as might          be   anticipated   from   former   experiments      were
 found.      Olefiant gas maintained its great supremacy over the others
 at   all thicknesses.      A  layer of this gas, 0-01 of an inch thick, effected
 an absorption        of about    1 per cent. of the total radiation.      To show

   the competence of the apparatus to measure an absorption of this
   magnitude, it is only necessary to state that the galvanometric                       de
   flection corresponding          to this absorption was        1 1 degrees.     Were     it
   worth while, it might         be shown that the absorption          by a plate    of the
   gas not more than          100Qth of an         inch in thickness is capable of
   measurement.         A   layer of olefiant      gas 2 inches in thickness         inter
  cepted nearly 30 per cent. of the entire radiation.                    Such a layer,
  encompassing the earth as a shell, permitting                     the passage     of the
  solar rays, and preventing             the escape of the terrestrial ones, would
  probably raise the surface of the earth to a stifling temperature.                      A
  layer of the gas three-tenths of an inch in thickness intercepts                     11 -5
  per cent. of the radiation.             Such a layer,   if diffused  through      10 feet
  of air, would     be far more attenuated than the aqueous vapour                actually
 existing in the air      ;   still it would effect     an absorption     greater than
 that which        the author         has ascribed     to the      atmospheric     vapour
  within    10 feet   of the earth's surface.         In  the presence of such facts,
 arguments drawn from the smallness                 of quantity of the atmospheric
 vapours are entirely devoid of weight.
     For larger thicknesses of            gas and vapour, a tube was employed,
 which     was divided into         parts capable of being used separately or
 together.       The mode of proceeding               was   this  : — A brass cylinder
 49'4 inches long had its two ends stopped with rock-salt                     ;  a source
 of heat    was attached to          it exactly as in the author's experiments
 described in former memoirs.                The pile and the compensating cube
 also occupied their old positions ; but instead of determining the
 absorption effected in a column of gas or vapour equal in length                        to
the whole tube, the tube was now divided into two independent com
partments by a third plate of rock-salt.                   Let   us call the compart
ment furthest        from the pile the first chamber, and that nearest to
the pile the second chamber.              The experiments      were commenced        with
the first chamber very short, and the second chamber long                     ;  and the
plate of salt was subsequently               shifted   so as to lengthen the          first
chamber and shorten the second one, the sum of the lengths of both
chambers being preserved constant at 49*4 inches.
    The absorption       effected     in the first chamber acting alone was first
determined     ; then the absorption effected by the second chamber acting
alone   ;  and finally,      the    absorption    effected when both          chambers
were occupied by the gas or vapour was determined.                      This arrange

 1863.]                               681
 ment enabled the author       to examine the influence of the sifting
which occurred in the first chamber on the absorption                effected  by
 the second one.      The thermal coloration of the various           gases   was
 rendered very manifest by these      experiments — the        heterogeneity    of
the obscure calorific flux being demonstrated, and the selective action
of the   gases  on particular    constituents    of the flux exhibited.         A
 stratum of carbonic oxide 8 inches thick being placed in front of a
 tube containing 41*4 inches of the same gas, those 8 inches inter
 cept 6-02 per cent. of the whole radiation        ; the same 8 inches being
 placed behind the column        41*4 inches in length,         the absorption
 effected is almost nil.     So with carbonic        acid :  8 inches   in front
 absorb   6-25 per cent., while behind      they absorb a scarcely mea
 surable quantity.      Similar remarks apply        to the other gases,      the
reason manifestly being, that when the 8-inch           stratum is in front,    it
intercepts   the main portion     of the rays which give it its thermal
 colour, while when    it is behind, these rays have been in great part
withdrawn,    and to the remainder the gas is transparent.
    From analogous reasoning we conclude that the sum of the ab
 sorptions of the two chambers, taken separately, must always be
greater than the absorption effected by a single column of gas of a
length equal to the sum of the two chambers.                 This conclusion is
illustrated in   a striking manner by the results ; and it is further
found that   if the mean of the sums of the absorptions of the two
chambers, taken separately, be divided by the absorption of the sum,
the quotient is the same for all gases.       It  is also to be inferred from
the foregoing    considerations, that the sum of the absorptions must
diminish   as the two chambers     become    more unequal in length, and
must be a maximum when they are equal.
    In these days a special interest attaches to the radiation from any
gas   through itself, or through any other having the same period of
radiation.    The author records the results of an elaborate series of
experiments on this point.      The experimental tube, 49-4 inches long,
was divided into 'two compartments by a partition of rock-salt.              The
compartment     nearest to the pile was filled with the gas which was
to act as absorber, while the chamber most distant from the pile
contained the gas which was to act as radiator.             This latter gas was
warmed     by the destruction   of its own vi* viva within the chamber.
The radiation was what the author has called dynamic radiation.

                                       682                             [June   18,
The lengths       of two chambers      were  varied,  the radiating       column
being lengthened, and the absorbing one shortened at the same time.
The experiments        were  carried out with a considerable         number     of
gases and vapours.
   The experiments with the vapours           were   thus  executed.        First,
the chamber nearest the pile was occupied by vapour                of   a certain
 pressure  ;  the other chamber was then occupied by the same vapour
at the same pressure.        The entrance of the vapour     was so slow, and
its quantity was      so small, that    the dynamic    radiation     due to the
destruction of its own vis viva was almost insensible.              The needle
being at zero, dry air was allowed to enter the chamber most distant
from the pile    ; the air became heated, communicated          its heat to the
vapour, and the latter radiated it against the pile.           It  is quite evi
dent that not only does this case resemble, but it is of the same
mechanical nature as that in which a vibrating tuning-fork is brought
into contact with       a surface   of  some  extent.    The fork, which a
moment before was inaudible,          becomes   at once a copious source        of
sound; it communicates its motion to           a body   of sufficient dimen
sions to transmit it in large quantities to the air.        What the sound
ing-board is to the tuning-fork, the vibrating        compound molecule is
to the elementary atom.         The tuning-fork    swinging   alone is in the
condition    of the elementary atom radiating alone, the sound of the
one   and the heat of the other being insensible ; but in association
with the particles of acetic or sulphuric ether, the elementary atom
is in the condition of the tuning-fork applied to its sound-board,
communicating       through    the molecule motion      to the luminiferous
ether, as the fork through the board communicates it to the air.
    These experiments show the great opacity of a gas to radiations
from the same gas.          They  also show, in a very interesting manner,
the influence of attenuation in the case of the vapours.               The indi
vidual molecules of a vapour may be powerful            absorbers and radi
ators, but in thin strata they may constitute an open sieve, through
which    a large   quantity   of radiant heat may pass.          In   such   thin
strata, therefore,    the vapours,     as used   in  the experiments,        were
generally found less energetic than the gases, while in thick strata
the same vapours showed an energy greatly superior                to   the same
  gases.
   A.  few striking results are recorded by the author in illustration          of

1863.]                                  683
the influence of a lining within the experimental tube on the radiation.
A ring of    blackened    paper, for example, not more than 1£ inch in
width, placed within a polished brass tube, radiated, when dry air
was permitted    to enter the tube, a quantity       of heat sufficient  to urge
the needle of the galvanometer through an arc of 56°             ; while, when
the ring was removed, the radiation from the whole surface of the
tube produced a deflection of only 7°*5.
    The author finally examines the diathermancy of the liquids from
which the vapours made use of in his experiments were derived ; and
the result leaves     no shadow of doubt upon the mind, that              if  any
vapour be a strong absorber, the liquid of that vapour is also a strong
 absorber.    The phenomenon is           one in  which the individual mole
 cules are implicated, the molecule carrying          its power as a radiant
 and an absorbent through all its states of aggregation.           The order of
 absorption in liquids and vapours is precisely the same.            These facts
 revive thoughts regarding the connexion between radiation and con
 duction,   to which   the author       has  already given expression.       In  a
 future memoir he hopes to throw additional light on this important
 subject.
 XXI. " Account        of Observations          of Atmospheric       Electricity
        taken at Windsor, Nova Scotia." By             Joseph     D. Everett,
        M.A., F.R.S.E., Professor of Mathematics, &c. in King's
        College, Nova Scotia.            Communicated by Professor          Wil
        liam Thomson.            Received    June 18, 1863.
     1.  The observations here described were taken at my house, which
 is on the College hill, Windsor, in latitude 44° 18' 34" N., and
  longitude   64° 8' 30"    E. They were taken at a landing-window
  looking  N.E.,  whose     sill  is 27 feet above the ground.        There is a
  very clear view from the window, and no trees, buildings,             or other
  obstacles to screen   it from the full effect of atmospheric electricity.
  The ground slopes away on the N.E., E., S.E., and S., and is nearly
  level in other directions,       rising slightly, however, for the first 20
  yards on the   N.W.      The surrounding        country  is undulating,     with
  the exception of a stretch of flat alluvial soil which runs past the
  base  of the College hill, and to which the ground slopes away from

                                                     684                                     [June          18,
my house in the directions above                          indicated,        the fall amounting               to
from 60 to 70 feet.  The flat in question connects the two rivers
Avon and St. Croix, which unite just below Windsor, and is scarcely,
if   at all, above  high- water mark, being protected from inundation by
dykes.        The view from my house is bounded in the distance on all
sides      by ranges of thickly wooded hills, whose average height                                           is
about 500 feet, and nearest distance about three miles.
      2. The apparatus used for collecting the electricity of the air was
Professor Thomson's water-dropping                              collector, which consists of an
insulated can of copper, having a brass pipe leading from                                   it,   through
which the water             can    be      discharged            by   turning   a    tap.     The can
stands upon         a  shelf just inside the window, and the pipe projects
through      a    hole      inch in diameter in
                            1|                     board which    inserted
                                                                   a                        is
under the lower sash                of the window.                 The pipe extends nearly
horizontally outside the window                          to    the distance of feet inches
                                                                                     3            6
from the sill      ;    and the water, when turned on, flows from the end                                   in
a    stream so fine, that two or three hours are required to discharge a
pailful of water.           The end of the pipe                  is   about level with the sill             of
the window.            It   is   assumed that the effect of the stream of water
flowing      from the pipe            is   to reduce the pipe and can to the same
electrical potential as the air at the place where the water breaks into
drops.       The time required                 to reduce the can to the potential                     of the
air   is   not more than          a   minute.            In     my earlier observations           I     ob
served      the electricity of the air as soon as                      I    could after turning on
the water     ;   but in looking over my observation-book,                            I     found the
electricity       recorded was uniformly weaker at the first observation
than at the second,              taken about          a       minute later.      In    my later ob
servations   I     always allowed          a    full minute.
     3.   In the commencement of winter the frost interfered with the
system of water-dropping.                  I       first tried to obviate the difficulty by
leaving the water running                  ;   but   a   little always remained in the pipe
after the can was emptied, and by freezing burst the pipe.                                        I    then
shortened the pipe by removing some joints of it.                                    This prevented
the bursting        of the pipe, the remaining portion being of stouter
material than that removed                     ;   and
                                                     I        continued to take observations,
with the pipe thus shortened, from Nov.                               1   7th to Dec. 2nd     ;       but   as
the weather grew colder, the water froze in that portion of the pipe
which was inside the window                     ;   and after thawing           it   on two or three

  1863.]                                 685
 occasions by the heat of a spirit-lamp,           I  determined to dispense,    if
 possible, with water-dropping,      and collect the electricity of the air by
 a  burning match.        Accordingly, from Dec. 2nd to March 30th I
 employed matches such as are used with Professor Thomson's Por
 table Electrometer (consisting of rolls of blotting-paper          prepared with
 nitrate  of lead), the burning match being fixed on the end of the
 water-dropping     pipe.  The   effect   of shortening the pipe is to weaken
 the electricity collected, in a constant ratio, which         I have ascertained,
 by observations      taken alternately with the pipe shortened and re
 stored to its full length, to be about        1  to 3*1.    This difference has
 been allowed    for in reducing the observations,        as it was very desirable
 to furnish my tabulated results in a          form easily admitting of com
 parison by inspection.       I have, nevertheless, inserted the letter S in
 the column     " Remarks "     against all observations         taken with pipe
 shortened.
    I have in like manner compared, by alternate observations, the
results obtained respectively by water- dropping and burning match,
and my observations lead to the inference that the results obtained
by both methods are the same.               The letters M and W, when they
occur in the column " Remarks," denote respectively that the ob
servations against which they stand were taken with burning match
and water-dropping.        (See Table     IV.)
    4. For testing and measuring the electricity thus collected I have
used the "Station Electrometer," except in a few cases, when                     I
have employed        the "Portable      Electrometer."         Both instruments
are inventions      of Professor    Thomson.         The former consists of      a
Leyden jar, having within it        a needle     of aluminum suspended by        a
glass fibre, and connected (by platinum wires dipping in sulphuric
acid) with the inner coating of the jar.              In  the neighbourhood     of
the needle are two brass plates, also connected with the inner coating
of the jar, called the    " repelling   plates," because their function is to
repel the two ends of the needle, causing             it to rotate, and thereby
twist the glass fibre.       A brass    cage surrounds       both the needle and
the repelling     plates.   It hangs    from glass pillars, which insulate      it
from the jar (and therefore also from needle and repelling plates) ;
and an arm of brass attached to it projects through a hole to the
outside of the jar, furnishing the means of connecting the cage with

the object to be tested.       This projecting      arm is surrounded     by a
hollow cylinder of pumice soaked in sulphuric acid, for the purpose
of drying the air which enters the jar, and thus preserving insula
tion. The insulation thus obtained is so good that the jar loses, on
the average,  only 2 or 3 per cent. per diem.
   5. The force    of repulsion between the needle and the repelling
plates depends not on the potential of the jar absolutely, but on the
difference between this and the potential of the cage, being for any
given position of the needle proportional       to the square of the differ
ence  of potentials.    In taking an observation, the force of repulsion
is ascertained by applying     torsion to the glass fibre until the near
end of the needle is brought       into a line between two sights, one       of
which is on the plate of glass which covers the jar, and the other on
the bottom of the cage.       The amount of torsion applied is read off,
and is assumed to measure the force of repulsion in the sighted posi
tion of the needle   ; hence the square root of the number of degrees
of torsion measures the difference between the potential of the inner
coating of the jar and the potential of the cage (the latter being the
same as that  of the body tested) in terms of a unit which is constant
for any  one  electrometer.     In accordance with a convention which
has been adopted by Professor Thomson,            I  have always multiplied
the degrees of torsion by 10 before extracting the square root.          Thus,
if E  denote the number of degrees of torsion required to bring the
needle to the sights when the cage is connected with the earth, and
A  the number required when the cage is connected with             a conductor
to be tested, the potential of the inner coating of the jar will be
 VlO E,   and the potential of the conductor tested will be            VlO A;
hence the potential      of the body     tested   will  be  VlOE- VlO A.
It  is by this last formula      that the    numbers      under   the heading
" Electricity of Air " in my tabulated results have been calculated.
If A is greater than E, the formula still holds, and the negative sign
indicates that the electricity of the conductor         tested is of opposite
kind to that with which the jar       is charged.      E  is called the earth-
reading, and  A  the air-reading.
   6. The portable     electrometer, which is more convenient for use
when the electricity of the air is very strong, also contains a needle
and repelling   plates, surrounded by a cage which is insulated from
them, the whole being enclosed in a Leyden              jar ; but the needle,

1863.]                                       687
instead     of hanging freely by a glass fibre, is attached to the middle
of a fine wire of platinum, whose two ends                     are   secured in such a
manner as to keep it always tight.                The    needle    and repelling plates
are put in connexion with the body to be tested, the cage being con
nected with the inner            coating of the jar, an arrangement                which,
though opposite to that adopted in the Station Electrometer,                             re
quires the same formula to be applied in reducing the readings.
     7.  The best possible test of the accuracy of the method of reduc
tion above described is to observe the potential of the same conductor
 with two electrometers,            and    try whether        their indications      (thus
 reduced) differ in a constant ratio when the charges of their jars are
 varied. I have applied this test, giving charges of different strength,
 sometimes of the same kind and sometimes of opposite kinds, the
 conductor      tested being a short wire of copper or brass connecting
 the    electrodes of the two instruments.                  These    experiments       were
 performed for the purpose of ascertaining the ratio in question, with
 the view of reducing all my observations to a common standard                       ;  and
 I have    also investigated this ratio by connecting the jars of the two
 instruments,      and taking earth-readings           ;    but this method is          less
 convenient because it involves the admission of undried air into the
jars, thus impairing insulation, and rendering accurate observation
 difficult  ;  whereas in the former method of observing,                   if performed
 in favourable weather, the insulation is             as good as perfect.         As it is
 important      to establish practically the accuracy of the method of re
 duction      pursued,    I  give in extenso     all the comparisons that          I   have
 made by the methods just described.
     8.  In   using the Station Electrometer,            I  have given a fresh charge
 to its Leyden jar about once a week             :  when charged too highly, it is
  not sufficiently      retentive ;  when not high enough, the instrument is
  not sufficiently sensitive.        With    a charge     of fifty units, which is my
  average   working charge,         a difference   of   1°  in the angle of torsion is
  equivalent to
                    •
                      1  of a unit of charge,    so that     if the  difference between
  air-reading and earth-reading             is 1°, the      strength     of atmospheric
                   •
  electricity is     1.    The   average     strength      of atmospheric electricity
  observed has been from thirty to forty times greater than this, and
  has in a few cases been 800 times greater.                  Hence it is obvious that
  readings to whole degrees are abundantly sufficient                  ;  and  I have not
  thought it necessary to aim at greater minuteness, more especially
                                                                         3c2

 as the variation      generally amounts to two or three degrees                              every
 minute.
      9.    Of late each observation has consisted of an earth-reading,
 followed by five air-readings, taken at intervals of a minute.                          During
the first three months           of observation the number of consecutive
readings was irregular, and the interval between them was not always
the same.        The loss of charge in    ten minutes is practically insensible,
and is sometimes more than counterbalanced by changes in the zero
of torsion produced by the strain upon the fibre during the observa
tion.   The only case in which any considerable loss occurs is when
the electricity of the air is very strong negative (that of the jar being
positive), causing a very high air-reading.      The jar holds very well
when the reading is 360° (corresponding                   to 60 units)       ;    and    I    gene
rally give it     a charge    of about this amount, renewing it when it has
fallen a little below 250° (or 50 units).
    10. The Station Electrometer stands on the shelf at the distance
of about a foot from the can.             In taking           earth-readings, the elec
trode is connected with one of the brass foot-screws which support
the instrument, the connexion being made by a brass wire.                             In taking
air-readings, the electrode is connected with the can by means of a
copper wire.   The square roots          are generally taken on the spot by a
table which serves for all whole         degrees from 0° to two revolutions.
      11.   The Station Electrometer       has never been removed from its
place except during very cold weather, when the sulphuric acid at
the bottom of the jar sometimes became                        frozen over, so that the
needle was prevented from turning             ;    and   it   was    necessary to remove
the instrument        to a warm room, sometimes to thaw the ice, and
sometimes to prevent it from freezing.                 The ice in question   am         is,
                                                                                         I
informed,      not frozen water, but      a       definite compound of sulphuric
acid and water.        It   was most liable to form when the acid had been
for   a     long time unchanged, but    I     have seen        a     little of   it   when the
acid had been less than         a   week in the jar.            It   never formed unless
the temperature of the instrument was as low as about 20°.
  12.       On the first occasion of its formation, being taken by surprise,
and not using proper precautions,        I        broke the glass fibre which sup
ported the needle     :     this was on the 3rd of December.                     A    new fibre
was put in on the 6th, and the sights were adjusted to suit the new
fibre on the      8 th, the observations of atmospheric electricity being

   1863.]                                    689
  taken with the Portable Electrometer               in the meantime.         On several
   subsequent       occasions the Portable         Electrometer     was used in con
  sequence of ice having formed in the Station Electrometer.                       On all
   other occasions the observations have been taken with the Station
   Electrometer,       except when the electricity           was too     strong   or too
   variable to be conveniently measured by it.                On  one occasion,    in the
   first month of the observations (Oct. 22nd), in showery weather,
   the earth-reading        being one revolution        and 19°, the negative elec
   tricity of the air      was so strong     that six revolutions were not nearly
   sufficient    to bring the       needle to the sight.          Electricity of such
   strength is very common during showers either of rain, hail, or snow,
   being    always positive      during snow, generally negative during hail,
   and generally negative (in some instances alternating with positive)
   during heavy rain. On such occasions I have generally had recourse
  to the " Portable," which is less sensitive.
       13.  On    some     occasions, when the electricity of the air has been
  strong,     it has been      so violent     in its fluctuations      from second to
. second, that the needle of the
                                             " Station "   was quite unmanageable
  from the extent and rapidity of its vibrations.                  On such occasions,
  which are denoted by the word                " vibration
                                                             "  in the column " Re

  violently agitated, and on            these    occasions, which only          occurred
  when the electricity observed was very strong and of opposite kind to
  that in the jar,       I  have always found that the jar was discharging.
  On    a few occasions,      especially on the 6th and 7th of January, the
  needle of the
                      " Station,"   though not trembling as in the cases above
  alluded to, has been remarkably unsteady, the air-reading                    changing
  by several degrees every two or three seconds.

 These ratios, when stated in numbers, are respectively

     15. The cage        of the Station          Electrometer              was taken out and
 replaced on January 13th and              April 10th,         an operation which involves
 a readjustment       of the repelling plates, and may thus affect the sensi
 tiveness of the instrument.                On the latter occasion                a slight change
 was also made in the position               of the upper sight, tending to render
the instrument        rather less       sensitive ; but I do not think the effects
 of  these changes have been sufficiently great to be worth                             taking into
account.       One at least of the electrometers seems to be affected by
some uncertain        disturbing       cause,    which renders it more sensitive on
some days than on others.                   This    is well exemplified               by the com
parisons of January 14th and January 19th, the mean results ob
tained on the two days respectively differing                           by 8 per cent.          Even
on the same day results obtained with different charges do not pre
cisely agree, and the discrepancies are much greater than could arise
from errors of reading.            They do not follow any easily ascertained
law   ; and   I am inclined      to attribute           them to imperfect elasticity in
one or both      of the fibres — a          cause    which may also                have produced
discrepancies between results on different days, for the zero of torsion
has not always been tested when the comparisons were made                                     ;  and

 1863.]                               691
as the instruments    have been left standing with different amounts of
torsion on the fibres at different times, the zero of torsion may have
changed.     This  cause would     principally affect the Portable Electro
meter, whose zero of torsion has always been assumed            to be 30°, ex
cept on May 2nd, when it was very carefully tested, and found to be
30°-l.    The zero of torsion for the Station Electrometer has         been so
frequently tested, that no sensible correction        can  be needed     for it
beyond what has been made.            That the Portable      Electrometer     is
affected by some such disturbing cause will be seen by reference to
the comparisons on February 11th, where the earth-readings of the
"Portable"    are 51-0, 51-8, 51-2, the increase from the first reading to
the second apparently depending on the increased torsion which was
applied in the interim, and the subsequent fall being assisted by the
diminution which     was made   in the torsion between the       second   read
ing and the third.     The " Portable"      also seems to hang a little (see
comparisons on November 4th).
    16. Besides errors from want         of exactness in reducing all the
observations, except those taken with Station II., to units of that
instrument, and those arising from changes in the Electrometers
themselves, it is probable that others have been produced by circum
stances affecting the collection of the electricity       from the air, the
place where the water-stream breaks into drops             being subject to
small variations, depending on the wind and the head of water in the
can.    In like   manner, when burning matches are used,            the place
where the smoke breaks away depends upon the wind and the length
of the match, the latter being sometimes six and sometimes only
three inches at the commencement of an observation.             Rain or snow
falling on the pipe    has also doubtless a disturbing     effect, equivalen
to a shortening    of the pipe   ;  but the effect cannot be great     ;  for  I
have tested that during a shower of rain, when the water in the can
was not allowed to flow out, a strong artificial        charge given to the
can and pipe, though      of the opposite kind to that of the rain, was
dissipated with extreme slowness       ; but when the water was turned on
and a fresh charge given, the loss was extremely rapid — say thirty
times as fast as before.      This observation has       been   confirmed by
observing that even when the electricity of the air during heavy snow
or rain was excessively strong, as collected by water-dropping,            very
feeble  indications were obtained     if  the water was turned off.       It  is

                                                  692                                   [June 18,
obvious that the law of distributionof electricity on the surface of a
conductor gives the end of the pipe a great advantage over other
portions of it as regards power of collecting electricity from the air.
Notwithstanding that the tendency of rain or other downfall is to
make the electricity appear weaker than it really      virtually                is,    by
shortening          the   pipe,   the     observed electricity             is   generally        much
stronger during heavy showers than at any other time.
     1   7.    The errors resulting        from these various causes,                  though        not
insignificant        in themselves,          in comparison with the
                                           are very small
variations which really occur in the electrical potential of the air,
as will be seen by the most cursory glance at the tabulated ob
servations.
     18.       My observations have generally              been taken regularly             at three
stated times in the day, viz.,               between       8   and    9   a.m., between          2   and
2£ p.m., and between              9   and     9£   p.m.   ;    and in many instances ob
servations have been              taken at other hours as well.                       On Sundays
some       of the observations have generally                 been omitted.         Either during
or immediately            before or after each electrical                 observation,      I     have
also observed barometer, dry- and wet-bulb thermometer, cloud, wind,
and state of weather generally.                     The barometer used            is   an   Aneroid
of the usual         size, nearly new and in good condition.                     I     have ascer
tained, by experiment, that             it   is   affected by temperature, the disturb
ance being         in the   same direction          as   for   a   mercurial    barometer.                It
has also an index error           of about        *06, reading too low by this amount                     ;
but  I        have not applied any correction for either cause                  ;     and   it   would
scarcely be worth while to do so, as very little connexion appears to
exist between the fluctuations of the barometer and those of atmo
spheric electricity.
     19.      My two thermometers (dry- and wet-bulb)                       are mercurial         with
unusually         long degrees.         They      are placed outside the window                      of   a
room in the second story, in which there                        is   never any fire     ;    and are
read through          the window,         from which they are about six inches
distant.         The window       faces     the north-west,           and the thermometers
are well protected from radiation                   except from the window, while at
the same time exposed to              a   free current of air.
I        have carefully tested          the thermometers in melting snow, which
showed that at 32° the dry-bulb read                      *4   too high, and the wet-bulb
•7   too high.       I    have also tested          them in water at various tempera

tures beside a thermometer            which has        been tested at       Kew Observa
tory   ;    and as the errors at other points of the scale were found not
to differ much from those at 32°,             I have   applied a uniform correction
of —*4 to the readings of the dry-bulb, and of                    — -7      to those of the
wet-bulb.           In   the tabulated observations        I   have       entered the cor
rected reading            of the dry-bulb thermometer,               and the       corrected
difference between dry and wet.
     My observations of cloud         are recorded in the usual way, the figure
in the column            " Amount "   denoting the number of tenths of the sky
that are covered with cloud.             In   the column       "Kind"        the abbrevia
tions ci., cu., st., nim., are used to denote cirrus, cumulus, stratus,
nimbus.
     The direction of the wind has            been     inferred from observations of
smoke and clouds, or from other obvious sources.                          The force of the
wind has generally           been set down by estimation,             1   denoting a light
breath, 2 a moderate wind, 3 a rather high wind, 4 a gale, 5 a vio
lent gale.          Where    the velocity is given in inches per hour in the
column
               " Remarks," it    has been observed with a hemispherical cup-
anemometer.
     20. The entries of electricity are in three columns.                          The first
contains the mean of all the observations which compose the group,
these observations being generally taken at intervals of a minute                       ;   the
second column            contains the highest potential observed (that     the        is,
strongest         positive  or the weakest  negative)   and;the third  column
contains the lowest potential observed (that               is,   the strongest negative
or weakest positive).
   When    greater number of observations have
                a                                                    been taken consecu
tively, they have been broken up into groups                     ;   and    in   grouping   I
have       been     careful, as far as practicable, to avoid including positive
and negative in the          same group   ;   but sometimes, when the electricity
was weak and oscillating,          I    have allowed them to enter the same
group      ;    and in these instances  I     have obtained the mean by dividing
the algebraic sum by the number of observations. As regards the
number of observations to be combined in one group, my arrange
ment has been somewhat irregular, depending generally on conve
nience         as regards the pages    of my observation-book.
     The time entered corresponds nearly to the centre of                        each group.
It   is    sometimes given in hours and quarters, sometimes                   in   hours and
minutes.

   2 1.  For the sake of showing the variations of atmospheric electricity
from minute to minute,         I subjoin all the observations taken on the
 10th day of each month, from October to March.               With the excep
tion of the evening of February 10th, these are fair samples of
ordinary observations.        I  also subjoin   the observations which were
taken on the 26th of November, as a specimen of very great and
rapid changes in atmospheric electricity.           In all these instances the
electrical potential of the air is given in units of the electrometer
with which it       was observed.    The readings of dry and wet bulb are
also given without correction.         (See Table I.)
   22. I also subjoin Tables of all the observations (or rather the
mean highest         and lowest of each group) taken during         rain, snow,
hail, sleet, and fog.       These numbers       are merely   copied from      the
complete Table of observations already given, and thus collected              for
greater convenience of reference.          (See  Table II.)
   It  will   be observed that the electricity found is almost        invariably
positive    during snow.      Out of   25 days on    which observations were
taken during snow, there were 23 on which positive electricity only
was observed, on the remaining 2 days both             positive and negative
being observed.
   Of 28 days on which observations were taken during rain, there
were 9 on which positive         only was observed, 7 on which negative
only, and      12  on which both kinds were observed.
   There    were only 2 days on which        observations were taken during
hail, and on both of these both kinds of electricity were observed,
but with     a great preponderance     of negative.
   On   2 days observations were taken during sleet.          In  one instance
the electricity found was positive, and in the other it changed from
weak positive to weak negative.
   On    5   days observations     have been taken during fog, and the
electricity     found   was always positive,     generally  much     above   the
average    strength.
   Light rain, unless accompanied by mist, has never shown strong
electricity   ;  but heavy rain,  as also moderate rain   with mist, is in the
majority of instances marked by very strong electricity.
   I have     not been able to ascertain, by inspection,       any connexion
between the direction of the wind during rain and the accompanying
electricity.

  23. Altogether there are 20 days (out of about 170) on which
negative electricity has been observed; but on every one of these
days positive      electricity was observed also.                 With the exceptions of
December 10th and 19th, negative electricity has only been observed
either during downfall              (i.  rain, hail, sleet, or snow) or immediately
                                          e.
before    or after it.         In   these two exceptional instances the sky was
entirely covered with nimbi,         and the negative electricity observed
was weak.        In    the latter the observation was taken about    p.m.              9     ;
and the next following observation, taken between                        8   and   9   a.m. the
next morning, showed positive electricity of unusual strength.
    There are only         2    days (February 4th and March 14th) on which
the strength    of electricity, when there was no downfall or fog, has
been as    high as 10, and on these two occasions the temperature of
the air was below zero.               The average strength of electricity, giving
equal weight       to all observations, and excepting those taken during
downfall or fog, has been 4*2 or 4-3, — the averages for the respective
months     being— Oct. 3-3, Nov. 3-1, Dec. 4-0, Jan. 4*2, Feb. 5-6,
March 5-5.
    24.   With the view of investigating the diurnal range of atmospheric
electricity,   I   have added, for each                  month,   all observations taken
during the      same hour, and have divided the sums by the numbers                          of
                                         "
observations.          By " observations          I      mean, here and during the re
mainder of this section, the numbers representing the mean electrical
potential for      each        group of readings, as entered in the complete
tabular statement already given, except when there are two or more
such entries for the same hour, in which case their arithmetical mean
has been adopted and reckoned merely as one observation.
    Again, dividing the day into three portions                   — before    noon, noon to
6   p.m., and after        6   p.m., — have divided the sum of all observations
                                      I
taken in the     same       portion of the day, for each month, by the number
of observations        ;   and  I have, in the same manner, found the mean
potential "at all hours" by dividing the sum of all observations
taken during month by the number of observations.
                   a
    It will    be seen that    for every month of the six the electricity                    is
weaker after       6   p.m. than in either of the previous portions of the
day.  (See Table III.)
  25. The average potential                    at each    hour for the   6   months may be
found either (1) by dividing the sum of all observations taken at the

same   hour during the     6 months by the number of observations, or        (2)
by taking the arithmetical        means  of the monthly means.         Which
ever method be adopted, the results for some         of the hours will, from
paucity of observations, be liable to much uncertainty.             As a  check
upon results obtained by these         two methods, and to remove errors
arising   from the greater       average strength    of electricity in some
months than in others, I have (3) divided the sum of observations
at each hour for each month by the mean of observations "at all
hours" for that month, and, after adding the corresponding sums
for the 6 months, have divided by the number of observations. This
method of reduction       I  conceive to be the fairest of the three, as       it
amounts to multiplying each observation by a factor inversely pro
portional to the mean electrical potential for the month in which              it
is taken.     It gives   the mean potential at each hour, supposing the
general mean derived from observations           at all hours    to be unity.
The   means    obtained in this way are headed        " Reduced Means
                                                                            " in
the annexed Table of Diurnal Range, those obtained by the other
two methods being given in the two preceding columns.
   All  three methods agree in furnishing the following results         : —
   1.  That between      7 and 8 a.m. the strength     of electricity is below
the mean.
   2. That between 8 and        9 a.m. its strength is above the mean, and
takes a very decided maximum.
   3. There is apparently a minimum between 10 and              11  a.m.  ;  but
observations are few.
   4. That from     1  to 7 p.m. the strength     is above   the mean,      with
the apparent exception of the hour 4-5.
   5. That from 7 p.m. to midnight the strength is below the mean.
   The mean here referred to is the mean of all observations, and is
probably not the true mean value for the 24 hours.

 XXII. " On      the  Brain of a Bushwoman ; and on the Brains of
       two Idiots of European Descent."           By John Marshall,
       F.R.S., Surgeon to University College Hospital.           Received
       June 18, 1863.
                                (Abstract.)
    The author having described the mode of preparation and dissection
of the three brains, divides his paper into two parts,     one relating to
 the Bushwoman     and her brain, and the other to the idiots and their
brains.
                       1. The Bushwoman' s brain.
    The Bushwoman was      aged, and about 5 feet high — unusual for her
race.
    The form of the cranium is      a long  narrow ovoid — less dolicho
cephalic, however, than the Negro skull      ; the face is high-cheeked,
and the nose     very  small and flattened.     The frontal   sinuses are
absent, and the walls of the cranium are thick — so thick that its in
ternal capacity is less than would be expected from its outward form
and size, being equal to 35 oz. av. of water, or 60-64 cubic inches,
which, for the height of the Bushwoman's         body, is decidedly, but
not very small.
    The actual weight     of the preserved encephalon proved to be
21*77 oz. av., which would probably represent, as the author shows,
31*5   Oz. for the weight of the recent brain enclosed in its mem
branes.     Allowance being made for the height of the body, this is
less by 8-5 oz. than the average weight of the brains of European
 females of the same age, as estimated from the Tables of Dr. Boyd,
published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1861.
    The cerebrum     proper   probably weighed, in its recent state,
 27*25 oz., the cerebellum 3*45 oz., and the pons with the medulla
oblongata -8 oz.
    The ratio of the cerebrum to the cerebellum    was as usual, 7*7 to 1 ;
 that of the cerebrum to the body was probably as       1 to 52, and that
 of the cerebellum to the body as 1 to 4 18, instead of the usual ratios
of 1 to 41, and 1 to 328.
    An examination of the general form of the cerebrum shows that
 it is small, but long — defective in width, and especially in height.
 Its outlines and surfaces are angular and flat instead of rounded and

1863.]                               709
full.    The frontal region is very narrow, shallow, much excavated
below, and compressed laterally        near the entrance of the Sylvian
fissure.   The parietal region is low, but prominent laterally ; the
occipital region is long, but defective in height ; and the temporal
region is long, but narrow.
    The   cerebrum   overlaps the cerebellum by -5 inch, which is as
great an absolute overlap as is usual in European            brains, but less
relatively to the length of the brain, which is very long in the Bush-
woman.
    The fissures, lobes, and convolutions    are then described at length,
and compared with those      of the ordinary European brain, with those
of the Hottentot Venus's brain figured by Gratiolet, and with those
of the young Chimpanzee.          It is impossible to give in an abstract
even an outline   of the facts recorded in this part of the paper.
    The general result of the inquiry is to show that the fissures are
rather more complex than in the brain of the Hottentot Venus, but
much less so than in the European.         They    are rather more complex
on the left than on the right side of the brain.            They    are widely
separated from those of the Ape's brain.
    The author concludes — 1. That all the convolutions              proper to
man are present, but, as compared with the European                 brain,  are
much      more simple,   and less marked      with secondary sulci.        The
greatest deficiency is in the occipital and orbital convolutions.
    2.  That the convolutions, taken generally, are rather more complex
 than those represented in Gratiolet' s figure of the Hottentot Venus's
brain, which may be partly due to the obliteration           of details in the
 latter during its long period   of preservation.
    3 & 4. That the resemblance         between the Bushwoman's           brain
and the Hottentot Venus's brain is sufficient to justify the conclusion
that the latter  was not an idiot, or a defectively developed individual       ;
 but both brains, as compared with the European,            have an infantile
 simplicity, characteristic partly of   sex, but chiefly   of race.
    5. That the convolutions being more simple, can            be more easily
 traced   and compared on the two sides than usual, but still show
 abundant evidences of the asymmetry characteristic          of man.
     6. That there   is a greater difference between the Bushwoman's
 cerebrum and the highest Ape's cerebrum than between               it and the
 European cerebrum     ;  but a less specific difference between it and the

                                              710                                   [June 18,
European        than between the Chimpanzee                  and the Orang          ;   and,    of
course, much less             than between the highest              and lowest Quadru-
manous brains.           There    is,   however, less difference between the Bush-
woman and the highest Ape than between the latter and the lowest
Quadrumanous animal.
    7.The general results, the author thinks, justify the expectation
that characteristic differences of degree of cerebral development may
hereafter be found in the several leading races of mankind.
  The author then proceeds to describe the colour and relative pro
portions of the grey and white substance, the commissures, ventricles,
                                    **
and ganglionic masses.
    The commissural fibres of the corpus callosum                      are very deficient
in the Bushwoman          ;    and the other commissures are also small.                      The
body and anterior cornu             of the lateral ventricle        are also small       ;     but
the posterior cornu and its contained parts are very large.
    In    the cerebellum, the median parts appear to be somewhat less
developed than the hemispheres.                    Its transverse commissural fibres
are more largely developed than                the same system of fibres in the
European brain       ;   the Chimpanzee standing, in this respect, still lower.
The      laminae   of the cerebellum         are even      more numerous than in the
European        specimen with which the Bushwoman's                        brain was com
pared.        The cerebellum       seems     to be more perfectly developed than
the cerebrum.
                                 2. The Idiots' brains.
    Some account         is    first given of the age, height,             and bodily and
mental condition          of   these idiots,    one     of whom      was   a   woman, aged
forty-two years, and the other                 a   boy of twelve.       The former            was
able to walk, though badly, to nurse                a   doll, and to say       a   few words     ;
whilst the latter could not walk, nor handle anything, nor articulate
a   single word.
    In    the idiot woman, the weight                 of the recent encephalon                was
10 oz.    5   grs., of which the cerebrum weighed 7-6 oz., the cerebellum
1*95 oz., and the pons            with the medulla oblongata               042   os.     In    the
idiot boy, the recent encephalon weighed 8-5 oz., the cerebrum
5-85 oz., the cerebellum 2-25 oz., and the pons with the medulla
oblongata       *4 oz.    These         are the two      smallest    idiots'       brains      the
weights of which have been recorded.
    Calculations are then entered upon                by   the author to show the pro-

 1863.]                                   711
bable ratios, in the two cases, of the weight of the encephalon, the
cerebrum, and the cerebellum            to that   of the body, and of the        re
lative weight of the cerebrum to the cerebellum.                The result of this
inquiry is to prove that the entire encephalon was, in each case,
about one-fourth of its normal proportional weight.                 The cerebrum
was much more defective than the cerebellum.                   The idiot boy had
relatively more cerebellum, and the idiot woman more cerebrum.
    On studying the general form, dimensions, and relative position of
 the parts of the encephalon, it appears that the entire brain in the
idiot woman resembled very closely,           at first sight, both   in its general
mass and in the form of its anterior part, the brain of the Chim
panzee    ;  but   a  closer comparison        shows    great differences.      The
cerebellum especially is of very great size, forming about one-fourth of
the entire mass, and, instead of being covered by the cerebrum, has
about -35 inch of it exposed posteriorly.
    A   detailed description is then given of the fissures, lobes, and con
 volutions,    which  are compared       with those of the healthy brain and
 with those of the Chimpanzee.             Only the most general conclusions
 arrived at can here be given.
    Of the lobes, the temporal       are remarkably large     ;  the parietal seem
 to be next highly developed       ;  whilst the occipital and frontal      are the
 smallest.      According to the author      —
     1.  The idiots' cerebra    are not     merely diminutive      organs, having
 all the proper parts on      a smaller scale, but these parts are fewer in
 number,      less  complex,   and     different   in relative    proportion and
 position.
    2.   Nevertheless     all the    primary and connecting convolutions
 proper to the human cerebrum are represented in the idiots, but
 are very remarkably       simplified.
    3. The degree       to which    the convolutions      of those parts     are de
 veloped follows the order observed in the lobes themselves.
    4. The convolutions       of the idiot woman       are more developed than
 those of the idiot boy, except those of the parietal region.
    5. The peculiarities in the idiots' cerebra are due to arrest of             de
 velopment occurring at some period of foetal existence.
     6. Judging from external appearances generally, it might be sup
  posed that this period was about the latter half of the seventh month,
  and somewhat earlier in the boy than in the woman.                   But  a closer

                                        712                            [June   18,
 examination       shows that    the malformation      is not due to a simple
 arrest occurring so late in foetal life, but commences much earlier in
 the parts at the base     of the cerebrum, and then influences the evolu
 tion   of the superficial parts of the hemispheres.        The corpora striata
 appear to be specially affected, and through these the whole hemi
 spheres, but the frontal lobe especially.         The interest of this obser
 vation in a general physiological view, and especially in regard to the
 mental condition of idiots, is pointed out.
     7.  It  is not certain whether the idiots' brains had undergone any
 local evolutional change as the result       of education or training.
    8.   It  is certain that they had increased somewhat in size after the
 general cessation of evolutional changes in their form.
    9.   The idiots' brains differ — the woman's being more developed
 on the whole, especially in the temporal regions. Her mental powers
 were also greater.
    10. These idiot brains are somewhat less developed than the two
microcephalic       cerebra figured by Leuret and Gratiolet.
    1 1.  The convolutions in the idiots' brains         are more simple than
those of the higher Apes, and approach,             in this respect, those of
still lower Quadrumana.          But the points of difference between the
idiots' brains and those of the Quadrumana are very decided.                They
are human cerebra, although          so imperfectly   developed.     They show
a general conformity       to the cerebral plan of the Primates generally         ;
but already they manifest special human characters.
    In   regard to the internal       structure  of the cerebrum and cere
bellum,      many facts are noticed.        The commissural       fibres of the
corpus      callosum   are very imperfectly     developed.    The lateral ven
tricles and their contents generally          are fairly developed;      but the
corpora striata are very small.          The cerebellum is well developed in
all its parts in both idiots, but is not perfectly so in either.             It is
larger in the idiot boy ; but the transverse commissural fibres are
much      less   developed in him than in the woman.            In accordance
with Malacarne's        statements, the laminae     are fewer in number in
both idiots' brains than in the perfect brain.           The cerebellum is not
merely larger, but much more developed in its form than the cere
brum, and it certainly        continued   to be developed to a much later
period.
   In   a postscript-note,   dated August 6th, 1863, the author gives an

account   of the examination of two idiots' brains preserved in the
museum of St. Bartholomew's       Hospital, and also of a series of wax
models of fetal brains in the museum of Guy's Hospital.
   The result of the additional information      so obtained is entirely to
confirm the descriptions and explanations given of the structure and
mode of formation of the idiot brain,

       Received August 19, 1863.
                               (Abstract.)
   The discovery of this colouring matter in 1856, and its introduc
tion  as a commercial article, have originated that remarkable series      of
compounds     known as Coal-tar colours, which have now become so
numerous,    and, in consequence of their adaptability to the arts and
manufactures,    are of such great and increasing importance.           The
chemistry of mauve may appear to have been rather neglected, its
composition not having been established, although it has formed the
subject of several papers by continental chemists.      Its chemical nature
also  has not been generally understood       ; and it is to this fact that
many of the discrepancies between the results of the different expe
rimentalists who have worked on this subject are to be attributed.
   On adding a solution of hydrate of potassium to        a boiling solution
of commercial crystallized     mauve, it immediately changes in colour
from purple to a blue violet, and, on standing, deposits a crystalline
body, which, after being washed with alcohol and then with water,
presents itself as a nearly    black  glistening    body,   not unlike pul
verized specular iron ore.
   This substance is    a base   which  I  propose to call Mauveine      : it

dissolves in alcohol,       torming     n   violet solution,   which immediately
assumes     a purple colour on the addition          of acids.   It  is insoluble, or
nearly so, in ether and benzole.               It is also a very stable body, and
decomposes ammoniacal salts readily.                 When heated strongly it      de
composes, yielding a basic oil.             Its analysis has led to the formula
                                     Ca7«Ha4N4.
     Hydrochlorate of Mauveine. — Tbis salt is prepared by the direct
combination of mauveine with hydrochloric acid.                    From its boiling
 alcoholic solution it is deposited in small prisms, sometimes arranged
in tufts, possessing     a   brilliant green metallic lustre.       It is moderately
 soluble in alcohol.       Carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and chlorine deter
 minations have led to the formula
                                   C„Ha4N4HC1.
 I   have endeavoured to obtain a second hydrochlorate,                but up to the
 present have not succeeded.
     Platinum-Salt.    — Mauveine        forms a perfectly definite and beauti
 fully crystalline compound with bichloride of platinum, which, if
 prepared with warm solutions, separates in the form of crystals of
 considerable dimensions.            It  possesses    the green metallic lustre     of
  the hydrochlorate,      but on being dried        assumes a more golden colour.
  It  is very sparingly       soluble in alcohol.        The analysis of this salt
  has led to the following formula,
                                 C„Ha4N4, HPtCl3.
      Gold-Salt. — This       substance separates       as a crystalline  precipitate,
   which, when moist, presents a much less brilliant aspect than the
  platinum     derivative  ;  it is also more soluble in alcohol than that
   salt, and when recrystallized appears to lose a small quantity of gold.
   Its analysis has given numbers agreeing with the formula
                                 C„Ha4N4,       HAuCl4.
      Hydrohromate      of Mauveine.       —This salt is     prepared in a similar
   manner to the hydrochlorate,           which it very much resembles, except
   that  it is less soluble.      Carbon,     hydrogen, and bromine        determina
   tions give results agreeing with the formula
                                    C27Ha4N4,nBr.
      Hydriodate of Mauveine.          — In    preparing this salt from the base, it

 is necessary to use hydriodic acid which is colourless, otherwise the
 free iodine    will slowly act upon the new product.            It crystallizes in
prisms, having a green metallic lustre.          It  is more insoluble than the
hydrobromate.           Its analysis has led to the formula
                                   C„Ha4Nt,HI.
    Acetate     of  Mauveine.    — This salt is best     obtained by dissolving
the base in boiling alcohol           and acetic acid.     It is a beautiful salt,
crystallizing in prisms possessing the green metallic lustre common
to most of the salts of mauveine.              Combinations of this substance
gave numbers agreeing           with the formula
                                CMH24N1,C2H4Oa.
    Carbonate      of Mauveine. — The      tendency of mauveine to combine
with carbonic acid is rather remarkable.              If a  quantity of its alco
holic solution       be thrown     up into a tube containing        carbonic acid
over mercury,         the   carbonic   acid will  be    quickly absorbed.       To
prepare     the carbonate, it is necessary to pass            carbonic   acid   gas
through boiling alcohol containing          a quantity   of mauveine in suspen
sion  ;  it is then filtered quickly, and carbonic acid passed through
the filtrate     until cold   ;  on standing, the carbonate will be deposited
as prisms having a green metallic lustre.            This salt, on being dried,
gradually      loses   carbonic acid.     From experiments that have been
made with this salt, it would appear to have the composition of an
acid carbonate, viz.
                                 C^H^N4, H2C03.
    In  the analysis of salts of mauveine great care has to be taken in
drying them thoroughly,           as most  of them   are  highly hygroscopic.
    I am now engaged         with the study of the replaceable hydrogen in
mauveine, which         I  hope will throw some light upon its constitution.
From its formula,         I believe it to be a tetramine, although up to the
present    I have    not obtained any definite salts with more than one
equivalent of acid.          Mauveine, when heated with aniline, produces
a blue     colouring    matter, which is now under investigation.            A salt
of mauveine, when heated alone, also produces                  a violet   or blue
compound.

       Brain." — Third Series.          By  J. Lockhart       Clarke, F.R.S.
        Received September 1, 1863.
    Structure of the Valve of Vieussens.           — The   valve of Vieussens
consists of four different kinds of layers.          The most inferior layer is
 composed of epithelium, which is continuous with that of the fourth
ventricle. The second layer is a stratum of longitudinal nerve-fibres,
continuous with the white          substance of the inferior vermiform       pro
 cess  of the cerebellum.        The third layer consists of     a multitude   of
 round, granular nuclei      of about the 3500th of      an inch in diameter,
 traversed by fibres derived from the subjacent layer.             These nerve-
fibres, in my preparations,         may be seen in the most unequivocal
manner to divide and subdivide into small branches, to which the
 nuclei are attached as by stalks.         The fourth or uppermost layer is
 chiefly granular, but is also interspersed with nuclei of the same
kind. Along its under side, where it joins the preceding layer, is a
row of large multipolar       cells, which are connected by their processes
with the nuclei of both layers*.
    Structure of the Cerebral Convolutions. — In the human brain
most of the convolutions, when properly examined, may be seen to
consist of no less than eight distinct and concentric layers.               This
laminated structure is most marked at the end of the posterior lobe.
On cutting off the rounded point of this lobe in the human brain,
by a transverse section, at about the distance of an inch, measured
along the side of the longitudinal fissure,         I found, at this part, that
the stratified appearance was very indistinct in the upper and outer
convolutions,    while it was still clearly observable in the inner and
lower convolutions which rest on the cerebellum.              It was most con
spicuous in the convolution that lies over the bottom of the posterior
notch of the cerebellum, and which runs outward and upward, and
then winds inward, to reach the surface at the side of the longi
tudinal fissure.
    In  vertical sections of convolutions        taken  from the end of the
posterior   lobe, where the laminated         structure  is most marked, the

 first or superficial  layer is a comparatively thin stratum of fine and
 closely-packed   fibres, intimately     connected externally       with the pia
 mater — with which      they are very liable to be torn away —while in
 ternally they are continuous with fibres radiating              from   the grey
 substance.
    The second layer is of a pale or whitish colour, and several times
 the thickness of the one just described.          It consists, first, of fibres
 running parallel with the surface, both around the convolution and
longitudinally ; secondly, of fibres radiating across them from the
grey substance      beneath,     and  crossing  each    other     with different
 degrees of obliquity     ;  and thirdly,  of a small   number of scattered
nuclei, which are round, oval, fusiform, or angular, and have their
longer axes in different directions, but mostly within-outward.
    The third layer is of a grey colour, from two to four times as
thick as the one above it. It is densely crowded with cells of small
size, but of different shapes, in company with nuclei like those of the
preceding layer.      The cells are more or       less  pyriform, pyramidal,
triangular, round and oval, or fusiform.       The pyriform and pyramidal
cells — especially in the outer portions of the layer — lie for the most
part with their tapering       ends toward the surface     ;  and the oval and
fusiform cells have generally their longer axes and their processes           in
a similar   direction.      In  the deeper portions of the layer, however,
their position is more irregular, many of them lying with their
longer axes parallel with the surface, and in connexion with a multi
tude of fibres which run in the same direction and in great number
along the layer.      They contain     each a comparatively      large granular
nucleus, which frequently nearly fills the cell.         Two, three, four, or
more processes spring from the broader ends of the pyramidal cells,
and run partly toward the central white substance, and partly in
the plane of the layer, to be continuous with nerve-fibres in different
directions.
    The fourth layer is of     a much    paler colour.     It  is crossed, how
ever,   at right   angles to its plane, by narrow          long    and vertical
groups of small cells and nuclei of the same general appearance as
those of the preceding lamina.           These groups are separated        from
each other by bundles        of fibres radiating toward the surface from
the central white substance, and, together with           them, form a beau
tiful and fan-like structure.       This layer is distinguishable      from the

it gradually passes into, or blends with, the next                        one below    it,   or the
fifth lamina.
   This fifth layer consists of the                   same    kind of vertical and radiating
groups of small cells and nuclei                     ;   but the groups are broader, more
regular,    and, together with the bundles of fibres between                                 them,
present    a   more distinctly fan-like arrangement.
    The sixth layer       is   again paler, and somewhat whitish, but contains
some    cells and nuclei which have                      a   general resemblance to those of
the preceding layers and are arranged only in                             a   faintly radiating
manner.
    The seventh layer              is   of   a   reddish-grey colour, of about the same
depth as the preceding,                   and contains the same kind of cells and
nuclei, but in much greater numbers, and mixed with some others of
rather larger      size   :    only here and there they are gathered into the
small elongated groups which give                             the   appearance of radiations.
On its under side             it   gradually blends with the central white layer,
into which its cells are scattered for some distance.                            Both this and
the preceding lamina are traversed by nerve-fibres which run along
their planes, or parallel with the surface of the convolution.
   The eighth layer           is   the central white stem or axis              of the convolu
tion. As just stated,          it       contains, for some distance below its summit,
a   gradually diminishing               number of scattered cells and nuclei, extend
ing from the lower      of the next upper layer.

separate, and disposed with their longer axes at right angles to the
curved surface of the convolution, and therefore in the direction of
the fibres radiating from the central white stem, with which some, at
least, are continuous*.

in all directions, in         a    fan-like manner, toward the surface of the con

(already mentioned) in the inner grey layers, some of them become
continuous with the processes of the cells, and others turn round to
become      horizontal,        both in           a   transverse and longitudinal       direction

as regards the convolution,            and with different degrees of obliquity.
While the bundles themselves             are by   this   means reduced        in    size,   their
component fibres become finer as they approach the surface, in con
sequence, apparently, of branches which they give off, to be con
nected with cells in their course.           When they arrive at the outer grey
layer, they are reduced to the finest dimensions, and form a close
network, with which the nuclei and cells are in connexion*.                          Through
this layer, however, many of them pass in straight                          lines, and, in
company with processes              from some     of the cells, traverse the next
outer and white layer, in which part of them turn round the circum
ference of the convolution           — part run longitudinally and with various
degrees   of obliquity, but parallel with the surface, decussating with
the former — others appear to form loops by returning                         to the grey
lamina from         which they proceed — while the rest continue                            their
vertical course, crossing each other at different angles, and reaching
the surface, where they become continuous with the compact and
thin stratum of fibres which forms the first layer of the convolu
tion, and is in immediate connexion with the pia mater.
   While the bundles of fibres diverge on all sides from the central
stem of white substance, another system of fibres, springing from
each side   of the      base     of the stem, curve inward and form                a beautiful
arch over its summit, where they decussate                   each   other, and partly
constitute the innermost pale layer.              The fibres of the stem itself are
crossed transversely and obliquely by a variable number of others of
different diameters        ;   and in longitudinal sections (that            is,   in sections
made   inthe length of the convolutions) these transverse and oblique
fibres are frequently seen to increase in number toward the base of
the white substance, where they decussate each other at every pos
sible angle.
   Such   is   the structure of the convolutions             at the extremity of the
posterior lobe, in which the laminated                   appearance    is   most marked.
In almost all other convolutions, however, eight                    laminae,  although
sometimes indistinct,            may be brought into view        by   means of solution

   of potash or soda.      Sometimes, as in certain parts of the posterior
   lobe itself, one can scarcely make out more than seven layers, there
   being only one broad layer of arciform fibres running along the grey
   layer outside the white central stem.        It  is an error to call the layers
   containing these arciform fibres (for I shall so name them) the white
   layers of the convolution, for they are always interspersed with
   numerous cells, with processes       of which they        are continuous.        In
   some parts   of the brain (on the vertex for instance) the second (from
   the centre) of the arciform bands of fibres is very broad and strong,
  and thickly interspersed with large and small cells of different
  shapes.     These arciform fibres of the convolutions run in different
  planes, transversely,    obliquely,   and longitudinally.        Where      a con
  volution   bends round upon itself at a right angle, a section made
  at the angle contains them in abundance              ;   but here the    separate
  fibres forming    the arciform   bands are very short, being cut in their
  passage.     The curved arciform       fibres, then,      establish  an    infinite
  number    of communications in all directions between different parts
 of   each   convolution,   between different       convolutions,    and between
 these and the central white substance.              I  have already shown that
 the more      superficial  layer of grey substance           contains  numerous
 arciform fibres, but finer and less strongly marked.
     But the convolutions at the extremity of the posterior lobe differ
 from the rest, not only in the greater distinctness of their several
 laminae, but also in the appearance of some of their cells.                On    ad
 vancing forward, the convolutions contain a great number of cells                  of
 a much    larger kind.    In  a section, for instance, taken from a convo
lution at the vertex, and in      a vertical line passing through        the optic
 thalamus, the greater number of the cells differ but little from those
at the extremity of the posterior lobe        ;  but amongst       these   cells, in
the two inner bands of arciform fibres, and the grey layer between
them,    I found   a number    of much larger,      triangular,   oval, and pyra
midal cells scattered      about at variable       intervals.    The pyramidal
cells   are very peculiar.      Their   bases    are     quadrangular,    directed
toward the central white substance, and give off four or more pro
cesses, which     run partly toward the centre to            be continuous     with
fibres radiating     from the central stem, and partly parallel with the
surface of the convolution,       to be continuous with arciform fibres.
The    processes   may frequently be seen to subdivide into minute

 1863.]                                  721
 branches which      form part of the intervening         network,   as  I have
 described on former occasions.          The opposite end of    each pyramidal
 cell tapers gradually       into   a  straight  process which    runs directly
 towards the surface of the convolution,         and may be traced to a sur
 prising distance, giving off minute branches in its course, and be
 coming lost in the surrounding network.               Many of these cells, as
 well as those of a triangular,       oval, and pyriform shape, are as large
as those   of the anterior grey substance of the spinal cord.
    In other convolutions I again found the vesicular structure some
 what modified.       In the surface convolution, for instance, at the side
 of the longitudinal fissure, on a level with the anterior extremity
 of the corpus callosum, all the three inner laminae are thronged with
 pyramidal, triangular,       and oval cells, of considerable size, and in
 much greater number than in the situation last mentioned.             Between
 these, as usual, is a multitude       of the smaller cells.
    The cells of the convolutions in man certainly differ in some respects
from those of the larger mammalia — from those, for instance, of the
 ox, sheep, and cat.
    In the early  foetal brain   of mammalia and man the structure consists
 of one uninterrupted      nucleated network.       As development    advances,
separate layers may be distinguished.             In  a foetal sheep 2£ inches
long, for instance,     I  distinguished    six layers in a transverse section
of the brain, extending from the vertex to the interior of the lateral
ventricle.   The first, second, and third corresponded to those which
I  have described in the convolutions         of the adult human brain, and
still consisted of roundish nuclei connected by a network of fibres.
The third of these layers consisted chiefly of a dark and dense
stratum of nuclei, exactly similar           to that which the caput coma
posterioris of the spinal cord presents at the same period of develop
ment.    The fourth layer consisted chiefly of elongated and radiating
groups of nuclei.        The fifth layer was dark, containing nuclei and
a dense    stratum of transverse fibres.          The sixth layer was com
posed of epithelium, uninterruptedly           connected with the network of
the preceding     layers, and having precisely the same appearance as
the epithelium     of the cord at the     same period   of development.

nected with nuclei.    This network   is partly formed by the minute
ramifications of the processes which proceed from the large nucleated
cells along its inner border, and which completely reach the surface,
communicating with each other in their course.       In my preparations
this arrangement is very distinctly seen.

       OBITUARY NOTICES OF FELLOWS DECEASED
          Between 30th Nov. I860 and 30th Nov. 1861.
    William Baly       was born at   Lynn, in Norfolk, in 1814, of parents
distinguished    for  their intellectual    culture and literary tastes. He
was educated in the Lynn Grammar School, and was apprenticed to
Mr. Ingle (now Dr. Ingle, of Emsworth),              an active and esteemed
practitioner of that town.
    In  1831 he entered as a    pupil of University College, London, and
in 1832 at St. Bartholomew's        Hospital.     At the former he attended
the lectures, and at the latter the practice, necessary for the usual
diplomas    of the College of Surgeons and the Apothecaries' Hall.
At   both schools alike he distinguished himself by earnest and suc
cessful work   ;  and at the end of his pupilage he attached himself
to St. Bartholomew's,       where he devoted himself zealously         to the
study    of clinical   medicine,    chiefly   under   the  guidance   of Dr.
 Latham and Dr. Burrows, who          even then observed so much      of good
promise in him that they advised him to prepare to venture on the
life of a physician in London.       Accordingly in 1834, after obtaining
the    Diploma of the College of Surgeons and the Licence of the
Society of Apothecaries, he went to Paris with a view to the further
prosecution of his studies, and, after a winter spent there, to Heidel
berg, and thence to Berlin, where he graduated as Doctor of Me
dicine in 1836.
    On his return to England he settled in London, with the view of
establishing himself in practice.       During the first four years of this
period of his career he was occupied with the translation of Miiller's
' Haudbuch der Physiologie,' a task which he executed with the
same scrupulous     care  as he   gave   to all his later works ;  for he not
only rendered the German into English of a better style, but he
thoroughly studied and worked through the book, repeating many
of the observations it described, and examining many of its doc
trines.   His annotations to that work, if published separately, would
have gained for him the reputation of being an expert and original
physiologist.
    In  1840, through the recommendation of Dr. Latham, Dr. Baly
was appointed to visit and report on the state of the Milbank Peni
tentiary, where dysentery was very prevalent.           This led in the next
    vol. xii.                                                     a

year to his appointment        as Physician to that establishment.            The
post was of immense advantage to him.                 It gave him sufficient
means of living, while he had very little private practice. The num
ber   of sick under his    care was often large ;    their  diseases had pecu
liar interest    ; and he was brought       into contact with Government
officers, many of whom          could appreciate his trustworthiness          and
rare ability.       For nearly twenty years during which he held this
appointment, among all the changes to which the prison was sub
jected in its discipline and purpose, and in all the varieties of admi
nistration    under successive     Home Secretaries, inspectors, and go
vernors,    he was always well esteemed,          always trusted,     and very
generally referred to as a principal medical adviser of Government
 on questions of the hygiene         of prisons.    The chief results of his
 studies at the prison are comprised in his numerous              Reports   ;  but
 more especially in a most elaborate paper on the
                                                             " Diseases of Pri
 sons," in the twenty-eighth volume of the               '
                                                           Medico-Chirurgical
 Transactions,'     and   in his ' Gulstonian      Lectures    on   Dysentery,'
 published in 1847.        To the  same studies also may be referred       much
 of the knowledge displayed in the Report on Cholera, drawn up in
 conjunction with Dr. Gull, at the desire of the College of Physicians.
    In  1841   Dr. Baly became Lecturer on Forensic Medicine               at  St.
 Bartholomew's       Hospital.    He held that Lectureship         for fourteen
 years  ;  and though, as his simultaneous work at the prison showed,
 he never forgot      that the real business of his life was in Practical
 Medicine, yet he worked          assiduously    and conscientiously      at the
 duties of this subsidiary appointment.
     In 1846 Dr. Baly was admitted         a  Fellow of the College of Phy
 sicians  ; in 1847    a Fellow of the Royal Society ; in 1854 he became
 Assistant-Physician to St. Bartholomew's Hospital; and in 1855,
 in conjunction with Dr. Burrows, Lecturer on Medicine there. He
 was now     fairly in the tide of practice, with every prospect of attain
 ing high reputation as a hospital physician, and of multiplying a
 hundredfold the value of his knowledge by diffusing it among his
 pupils.
    But his social position was to      be yet more eminent, and      his influ
 ence yet wider.       In  1859 some one    of adequate fitness was required
 who might at first share with Sir James Clark, and then hold alone,
 the office   of Physician in immediate attendance on the Queen and

                                     in
the Royal Family.      Those who were charged to make a just selec
tion for this high office wisely fulfilled their responsible task in the
choice of Dr. Baly, whose pre-eminent qualifications for the duty
were unanimously     admitted by the whole medical profession.            To
himself the appointment is said to have been a surprise ; but how
well he justified the selection was shown by the proofs of confidence
which he received from the Queen and the Prince Consort, and the
esteem in which he was held by the whole of the royal household.
    With the highest honours of his profession within his reach,
trusted   by his Sovereign,   esteemed     by his brethren,    and held in
affection by his many   friends, — the   pride of his two sisters, who had
worked    lovingly with him in his laborious days, — his prosperous
career was sadly terminated and his valuable life in a moment cut
off, on the 28th  of January, 1861, by       one of those fatal chances to
which railway travelling is still but too liable, but in this unhappy
case apparently baffling human foresight.
    Dr. Baly's early death occasioned      a wide-spread   feeling of grief.
Literally he was mourned from the palace to the prison.           With the
sense of bereavement was mingled that of disappointed hope ; for with
his clear and vigorous intellect, his well-balanced and cultivated mind,
his devotion to the profession of his choice, his severe sense of duty,
his assiduous habits,   and his    freedom from all controversial       ten
dencies, there was sure promise        that,   had he been vouchsafed a
longer life, he would have yet done much for the advancement               of
knowledge and the good of mankind.
    George Bishop was born August 21, 1785, at Leicester.                He
 was well known in the commercial world as the head of the largest
 manufacture of British wines in the kingdom.           Having a taste for
 astronomy, he erected an observatory in 1836 at his residence, South
 Villa, in the Regent's Park.      He received the services of such ob
 servers, among others, as   Mr. Dawes and Mr. Hind, who soon gave
 his observatory a European name.        Without entering into details on
 double stars, nebulae, &c., we shall but say that the South       Villa ob
 servatory claims eleven of the small planets, ten discovered by         Mr.
 Hind and one by Mr. Marth. It is now removed to Twickenham
by Mr. George Bishop, Jun.
    Mr. Bishop was successively Secretary, Treasurer, and President
                                                             o2

   Society in 1848.           lie  died June 14, 1861.         He will stand high
   among those        of his day (no small number) who have devoted com
   mercial wealth to the increase of knowledge             ;  and will be remem
   bered with all the additional            honour   due to uprightness      and be

\      Sir William Cubitt            was the son of a miller of Dilham, in      Nor
   folk, and at an early         age was apprenticed to a     joiner. ; After some
   years spent in the exercise of his trade, and in the works required
   for repairing the mills of the district, he entered the factory of
   Messrs. Ransome of Ipswich.               In their employment Sir William
   became practically        acquainted with the details of Civil Engineering        ;
   and about this period of his life he invented the self-winding              appa
   ratus of windmills,         and the now well-known instrument           of prison
   discipline, the tread-wheel.          About 1826 he removed to London and
   began business on his own account as a civil engineer, and in time
   attained the foremost rank in his profession.              The works executed
   by Sir William Cubitt on the Norfolk and Lowestoft Navigation,
  on the Severn Navigation,            the South-Eastern    and the Great North
   ern Railways,       the landing-stages      at Liverpool, the new Rochester
  Town Bridge, the Berlin Water-works, &c., may be referred to as
  illustrations of his practical skill ; and it is not too much to say that
  the manner in which             the South-Eastern     line   is carried   between
  Folkestone     and Dover is one of the boldest pieces of engineering             of
  which    we have examples           in England. In 1851 Sir William was
  charged with the superintendence of the working details of the Great
  Exhibition building, and for his exertions on that occasion he re
  ceived the honour of knighthood.
      Sir William Cubitt was born in 1785, and died October 13th,
  1861.     The date of his election into the Royal Society is April 1,
  1830.
     Dr.   William Henry Fitton,               who died in London on the 13th
  of May,    1 86 1 , was born in Dublin in January        1 780.    His family was
  originally of Cheshire, but had long           been settled   in Ireland.    After
  passing through         his school education, he entered        Trinity College,
  Dublin, and in       1 798,  through his proficiency in classics, obtained the

Senior Scholarship.      He took his     Degree of Bachelor     of Arts in
   Although originally intended for the Church, Mr. Fitton chose a
medical career, and with that view pursued his studies in the Uni
versity  of Edinburgh, where he also attended the Lectures of Professor
Jameson on Natural History, and made the acquaintance of various
young men, zealous in study, who afterwards attained to distinction
in science and literature. After taking his Doctor's degree, he passed
some time    in London, studying medicine and chemistry, and in 1812
removed with his widowed mother and his three sisters to North
ampton, where he began practice as a physician.
   After eight years' stay in Northampton,       he married a lady who
brought him the means of living independently of his profession, and
he accordingly    withdrew from practice, and took up his abode           in
London, where he dwelt for the rest of his life, occupied chiefly with
his favourite pursuit of geology, and contributing, by his personal
qualities and accomplishments, and by his open hospitality,         to pro
mote useful and agreeable social intercourse among the scientific men
of the metropolis.
   From his youth up Fitton was devoted to geology. Before he left
Ireland he collected fossils, determined barometrically the height of
the chief mountains,    and made excursions into Wales        to study its
mineral structure.     His first publication on the science was a memoir
" On    the Geological Structure of the Vicinity of Dublin," communi
cated to the Geological      Society in 1811, and printed      in the first
volume of its 'Transactions.'      From 1817 to 1841 he contributed to
     '
the Edinburgh Review' a series of articles which present a just and
enlightened commentary on the progress of geological science for the
eventful thirty years of which they treat.       But the    researches   on
which the reputation      of Dr. Fitton    as a geologist  will most    de
servedly and most enduringly       rest,  "are those by which, during
twelve active years   of his life (from 1824 to 1836), he laboriously
developed the true descending order of succession from the Chalk
downwards into the Oolitic Formations, as exhibited in the south-east
of England and in the adjoining parts of France.     Before these labours
commenced geologists had only confused notions as to the order of the
strata beneath the Chalk, as well as of the imbedded fossil remains      of
each stratum.    It was Fitton  who made the Greensand Formations his

own, by clearly defining the position and character of the Upper and
the Lower Greensands, as separated by the                 Gault*."     This state
ment is from a recent notice of          Dr. Fitton, containing further inter
esting information        on his life and labours, and proceeding from an
authority unquestionable, both as regards personal knowledge of the
man, and just appreciation of his work.
    Dr. Fitton was elected into the Royal Society in 1815.                 He be
longed also to the Linnean, Astronomical,               and Geographical     Socie
 ties.    Of the Geological Society he was           one  of the most active and
 distinguished     Fellows   ;  he served    for  some years    as Secretary, and
 eventually attained to the honour of the Presidency               ; and in 1852,
 when he had for some years ceased from active labour, the Society
 " conferred     on   their veteran    associate   the highest honour in their
 gift, the Medal founded by his dear friend Wollaston."
     Sir  John Forbes         was born   in December 1787, at Cuttlebrae, in
 the parish of Ruthven,           Banffshire.    In   1 799 he went to the     Aca
 demy     of Fordyce, where he formed that friendship with Sir James
 Clark which remained           a source  of life-long pleasure to both.        Ob
 taining a Bursary (founded by an ancestor of his mother's) to the
  Grammar School at Aberdeen, he proceeded thither in 1802 ; and
 in the following year he entered at Marischal College in Aberdeen,
 where he remained until 1806f.              From Aberdeen he went to Edin
 burgh, where he obtained a surgical qualification; and in 1807 he
 entered the medical service of the Navy, in which he served, chiefly
 in the North      Sea and     in the West Indies (where he was present at
  the taking of Guadaloupe by Sir P. H. Durham, to whom he acted
  not only as flag-surgeon          but as secretary),       until 1816.      Being
  placed on half-pay at the general reduction which took place at the
  conclusion    of the war, he returned to Edinburgh, where he spent               a
  year and then graduated.             On the recommendation          of Professor
  Jameson he settled at Penzance as the successor of Dr. Paris, and
  there he remained until 1822, giving              his attention    not merely to
     * Address delivered    at  the Anniversary Meeting of the Geological Society,
  1862.
     t  Among other Professors whose lectures he attended there was Dr. Robert
  Hamilton, who gained a high reputation by his published works, but who was
  locally noted for his extraordinary " absence of mind," of which Sir J. Forbes was
  accustomed to relate some most amusing illustrations.

                                         Tii
professional     but also to scientific pursuits, especially meteorological
and geological investigations.         His "Observations on the Climate
of Penzance" and his papers on the " Temperature of Mines" are
still quoted as of standard value ; and two papers on the " Geology
of the Land's End" give further evidence of his           zeal and sagacity as
a student     of Nature.     It was during    the last year of his residence
at Penzance that he published            his translation   of Laennec's great
work on 'Auscultation,' which           was   at that time but little known
and still less appreciated in this country, but which impressed Dr.
Forbes's mind with        a sense   of its value that was soon justified by
the general voice of the more enlightened part of the profession.
In 1822 he removed to Chichester               as  successor to Sir William
Burnett; and there he continued for twenty years, obtaining the
principal practice in the town and in the neighbouring district of
 Sussex   ; while there too he formed that friendship with Dr. Conolly
which led to their subsequent association in two medical works of
great importance.        The first of these was the ' Cyclopaedia of Prac
 tical Medicine,' the publication        of which was commenced in 1832
 and completed in 1835, under the joint editorship of              Dr. Tweedie
 (to whom the original idea of the work is due), Dr. Forbes, and
 Dr. Conolly. Besides undertaking a large share of the editorial
                                               '
 labour, Dr. Forbes furnished        to this     Cyclopaedia'   several articles
 of high excellence, which contributed in no small          degree to establish
 its   reputation.     Previously    to   its  completion    he projected    the
 '
    British and Foreign Medical Review,' associating Dr. Conolly with
 himself as editor ; the publication of this journal, which commenced
 in January 1836, was carried on under their joint superintendence
  for four years, Dr. Forbes performing nearly all the editorial labour ;
  and on Dr. Conolly's removal to Hanwell in 1840, which occasioned
  his relinquishment    of his connexion with the ' Review,' Dr. Forbes
  became    its sole editor, and continued to discharge that duty until
  1847.     It was  chiefly with the object of improving         the 'Review'
  that he removed to London in 1840, giving up a lucrative practice
  and a high social position      at Chichester, under the full conscious
  ness that he could     not expect to attain a corresponding         status in
  the metropolis.      In   the next year he was appointed Physician to
   the Prince Consort      and to the Queen's Household,          and he conti
   nued to hold these appointments until compelled to relinquish them

                                           Vlll
  by the failure of his health in 1859.            He was elected into the Royal
 Society in 1829.
                      '                                                            yet
    Although the Review' never attained                a commercial     success,
  there cannot be two opinions as to the importance of the benefits                  it
 conferred on the medical profession.               Previously    to its commence
  ment there had been nothing that deserved              to be called full and fair
                                                           '
 criticism in medical journalism         ; the so- called    Reviews' being either
 mere analyses of the books which they professed to criticise,                      or
 confined to a general expression             of the opinion formed       as to  their
 merits or demerits by writers who were too frequently incapacitated
 by ignorance or prejudice,           or by both combined,         to pronounce      a
 trustworthy verdict.          It was Dr. Forbes's constant object to secure
 the services of the best-informed and most impartial contributors
 whom he could succeed in enlisting              ; and such was the estimation
              '
 which the Review' soon acquired, not only for its truthful appre
 ciation of the works        it criticised, but for the original information
 contained in many of its articles, that he had no difficulty in assem
 bling around him       a staff   of able and zealous assistants, over whose
productions he exercised a judicious editorial supervision, stamping
upon them everywhere his own peculiar marks of justice, accuracy,
and vigour.       It was    his constant      object to give an account of the
progress    of every department of medical             science, wherever and       by
whomsoever       made    ;  and by this means he largely diffused an ac
quaintance with the best foreign medical literature among the pro
fession in this country.           Constantly seeking to infuse fresh blood
into the organism of which he was the life, he was always glad to
avail himself of the assistance of young men who could give the
requisite evidence of ability and            probity,   to whom on his part ho
afforded the benefit of his wise counsel and kindly aid              ; and it would
not   be difficult to point to several men now holding positions more
or less   distinguished,      who would gladly testify how much             of their
subsequent      success    they owe to their        early association with        the
¦
   Review' and with its editor.            It  was very seldom that he       himself
wrote more than          short 'Notices'        of books, or paragraphs inter
polated in the longer articles of his contributors             ; but he departed
from his usual course in 1846, putting forth (avowedly as his own)
a remarkable article entitled
                                       " Homoeopathy, Allopathy, and
                                                                             Young
Physic   ;"  the purpose of which was in the first place to expose the

errors and absurdities of Homceopathy,                    whilst bringing into promi
nence the     " vis    medicatrix         natura"      as the real agent    in its reputed
cures, — next to point out that the ordinary routine of medical prac
tice, as carried on by a large proportion                of the profession, is scarcely
less erroneous     in principle and             even   more mischievous in result, —
and thirdly, to assert the doctrine that Rational Medicine should be
based on the recognition               of the curative powers of Nature                 as the
foundation of treatment, and that it should place its chief reliance
on those methods which carry out the indications                      afforded by the
" natural history" of each form of disease, that       the course     is,                    it
would run      uninterfered with by Art. These views, which he
              if
subsequently expanded in      small treatise entitled "Nature and
                                        a
Art in the Cure of Disease," were put forth in the first instance
with an incautious brusquerie which raised       storm of indignation
                                                              a
against their author, and damaged the reputation of the 'Review.' But
although what was injudicious                   in form and manner for        a    time pre
vented what was really just and true from obtaining                      a   fair hearing,
yet much of the effect which the author strove to produce has gra
dually developed itself; for there can                  be no doubt that the practice
of the better-educated portion of the profession    now essentially is
based on the principles which he enunciated   and although various
                                                              ;
influences have cooperated to bring about this reform, yet no small
share   of its merit must            be assigned       to the honesty and vigour         with
which truths were spoken out in    Young Physic,' which conserva
                                                '
tive timidity would have continued to keep in reserve.
   The advance of years and other circumstances determined Dr.
Forbes  in 1847 to relinquish the editorship of the 'British and
Foreign Medical Review,' and to transfer his property in    to its                 it
publisher, who has made                it   his constant aim to keep up the high
tone impressed on           it   by its originator, and to maintain the position
he acquired for        it   as the   " leading    medical journal," not only of this
country, but of the world.
  With the exception of the small treatise just referred to, Dr.
Forbes did not make any further additions                     to professional or scien
tific literature   ;   but he published, under the name of                 'A Physician's
Holiday,' an account of               a   summer excursion in Switzerland, which
acquired    a   popularity that led him to two further ventures                         in   the
same     line, respectively          entitled    'Memorandums made            in   Ireland,'

and an     'Excursion      in the Tyrol.'       In     1852 the University    of
Oxford conferred upon him the Degree of D.C.L., and in 1853 the
honour     of knighthood was bestowed upon him.                At   the end    of
1854, having been requested by Government                to organize and super
intend a large hospital      at Smyrna       for the sick of the Crimean war,
he accepted the post with alacrity            under    the promptings    of that
earnest desire to make himself useful             in his day and generation
which had shown itself in his previous undertakings, and actively
commenced the necessary arrangements ; but with more time for
deliberation      and consultation    with friends      he began to question
whether his physical powers would            be equal to the post, and    finally
determined to resign it.          Not long subsequently he had the first
warnings      of that failure of nervous power which progressively in
creased,   until in 1859 he found it necessary to withdraw            altogether
from active life, and to remove to the residence             of his only son at
Whitchurch near Reading, where he gradually and tranquilly sank,
his death occurring on the 13th of November, 1861.
  Although Sir John Forbes cannot be ranked among those who
have advanced the science of medicine by the discovery of new facts
or the promulgation         of new principles,        he must be regarded     as
having done most essential service to the cause of progress, on the
one hand by his ready recognition             and zealous diffusion     of every
novelty of sterling value, on the other by the determined onslaught
which he made upon prevalent errors, and the vigorous earnestness
with which he pleaded for generally-neglected truths. In the depth
and extent of his knowledge, in his sagacity as a reasoner, in the
earnestness       of his search for truth, in his fearless courage in pro
claiming    it,
              in his single-minded devotion to right and justice, and
in the disinterestedness with which he sacrificed all personal consi
derations to promote the general good, Sir              John Forbes combined
all the best qualities of    a   Reformer.     When     we add to this estimate
his ardent love       and extensive knowledge of literature, the general
liberality of his sentiments, the wide range of his sympathies, the
geniality of his disposition, and that active benevolence which cease
lessly urged him to employ every means in his power for the promotion
of objects of public philanthropy, and for the individual benefit of
those who had acquired       a   peculiar claim to his regard, we have such
a   combination of admirable qualities as could not but command for him

                                       XI
the general respect and esteem        of his contemporaries and the warm
attachment of a large circle of private friends.
    The Royal Society has lost       a young    and promising   associate  in
Mr. Henry Gray,         who was cut off by an attack of small-pox on the
8th of June, 1861,     at the early age   of thirty-six.
    Mr. Gray   was  Lecturer on Anatomy       at St. George's  Hospital, and
had been nominated to       the office of Assistant Surgeon to the Institu
tion.    During the brief career vouchsafed to him, Mr. Gray laboured
assiduously and with much success in Anatomy and Physiology. In
 1849 he gained the triennial      prize of the Royal College of Surgeons
for   an Essay on the
                        " Anatomy     and Physiology of the Nerves of the
 Human Eye," and soon afterwards he presented a paper to the Royal
 Society
           " On the Development of the Optic and Auditory Nerves,"
 which was published in the 'Philosophical Transactions' for 1850.
 Another contribution, entitled     " On  the Development of the Ductless
 Glands of the Chick," appeared in the volume for 1852.             He then
 undertook    an important    research into the Anatomy and Physiology
 of the Spleen, in the prosecution of which he was aided by an allot
 ment from the annual grant placed at the disposal of the Royal So
 ciety by Parliament for the promotion         of science ; and his   labours
 were rewarded by the triennial       " Astley   Cooper  Prize" of .£300 in
 1853.     Two papers on more strictly professional subjects appeared
           '
 in the Medico-Chirurgical Transactions.'             His last work was a
 '
   Systematic Treatise on Anatomy,' which was published in 1858, and
 has rapidly gone through two editions.            Mr. Gray   was, moreover,
 an accomplished and      lucid teacher of anatomy, and much        esteemed
 in private life, so that his early death was very widely lamented         by
 his professional brethren.      His election into the Royal Society took
 place in 1852.
     Eaton Hodgkinson          was   the son of a farmer at Anderton, in
 the parish of Great Budworth, Cheshire, where he was born on the
  26th of February,   1 789.   When but six years old he lost his father ;
  and in compliance with the wish of his uncle, the Rev. Henry
  Hodgkinson, Rector of Arberfield, Berkshire, he was sent to a
  classical school, in order to fit him for a university course, with a
  view to his entering the Church.          The youth, however, had little

                                         xu
 turn for languages, and it was determined to send him to the pri
 vate school in Northwich to learn mathematics, to which he had
 shown a strong inclination.          He   seems  to have profited greatly by
 the instruction     he received there, for in after-life he often expressed
 his gratitude     to his early master,   Mr. Shaw, for laying the founda
 tion of his future mathematical acquirements.
     In 1811 his mother and family removed to Manchester, where
 Mr. Hodgkinson assisted his mother in carrying on business, by
 which she eventually earned a competency.             In Manchester he had
 full  scope to   follow the bent of his mind for mathematical and phy
 sical pursuits.       Here also he made the acquaintance of various
 eminent     persons distinguished      for their scientific attainments    or
manufacturing       and engineering skill    ; and, following the example of
some other young men          of his acquaintance who were desirous of im
provement, he became         a pupil of Dr. Dalton, then a private teacher
of mathematics in Manchester, and read with him the works of La
grange, Laplace,       Euler, and Bernoulli.      The friendship thus begun
continued uninterruptedly until Dr. Dalton's death.
    The erection of the factory of Phillips and Lee first       gave occasion
to    Mr. Hodgkinson's experimental inquiries into the strength of
materials used in construction, which, amongst other results, led him
to propose a new form of cast-iron girder.           He discovered that cast
iron resists compression with an energy nearly six times as great as
that with which it resists extension; and he accordingly recom
mended a form of cross section, in which the upper                 and lower
flanges present sectional areas corresponding with the power           of re
sistance to compression and extension respectively;            and this form
has now been universally         adopted.     At the works of Messrs.   Fair-
bairn and    Lillie, then rising engineers, Mr. Hodgkinson obtained the
requisite means and facilities for making his experiments.
    In  1840   Mr. Hodgkinson communicated to the Royal Society              a
memoir,      entitled   "Experimental       Researches   on the Strength    of
Pillars of Cast Iron and other Materials," which was published in
the 'Philosophical Transactions'            for 1840, and obtained for its
author the award of the Royal Medal for the year 1841.                The re
sults of further inquiries were given in a later paper, published          in
the    'Philosophical     Transactions'     for 1857.     He was elected a
Fellow in 1341. The formulae he deduced for calculating the

                                        Sill
strength and deflexion      of pillars and beams have         been accepted    with
implicit confidence, and now have             a  place in all engineering text
books.
   Mr. Hodgkinson         became   a Member         of the Manchester Philoso
phical Society in 1826, and from 1822 to 1844 contributed seven
                   '
papers to its Memoirs,' chiefly on the mechanical principles of
engineering.      He was also     an active      Member of the British Asso
ciation  for the Advancement          of Science, and contributed          valuable
matter to the    *
                    Transactions'         '
                                    and Reports' of that Association.
   The combination of experimental skill with mathematical know
ledge which characterized Mr. Hodgkinson was turned to account
on the occasion of the construction             of the Conway and Britannia
tubular bridges.        He was engaged by Mr. Fairbairn to assist in
the experimental inquiry which         it was     deemed   advisable to institute
before commencing those great and novel undertakings ; and he con
tributed valuable formulae to Mr. Stephenson for calculating the true
results of the experiments.          It is to the results which were then
obtained that we owe the application of wrought-iron plain and boxed
girders in the art      of construction.        For a similar reason he      was  in
 1847 appointed on the Royal Commission to inquire into the properties
of wrought and cast iron, and their application to railway structures.
   In 1847 Mr. Hodgkinson was appointed Professor of the Mecha
nical Principles of Engineering in University College, London, and
delivered several courses of lectures, although in later years delicate
health interrupted      his labours.
    Mr. Hodgkinson married in            1841      Catharine,   daughter     of the
Rev. William Johns, of Manchester,               an intimate    friend of Dalton.
She died childless       in little more than a year after her marriage ;
and, after remaining a widower till within eight years of his death,
he married     for his second wife (who still survives him) Miss
Holditch,    daughter of Henry Holditch, Esq., Captain in the
 Cheshire   Militia.     He died at Eaglesfield House, near Manchester,
on the 18th of June, 1861.
   Francis Palgrave, K.H.,             author     of ' The Rise and Progress of
                                   ' The Merchant and Friar,'
the English Commonwealth,'                                            'The History
 of England and Normandy :'— born             July   1788;  died 6th    July, 1861;
 the only sou of      Mr. Meyer Cohen        ;  assumed the name of Palgrave

on    his marriage, in 1823, to Elizabeth daughter of Mr. Dawson
Turner of Great Yarmouth.
    The bankruptcy of his father,          at the beginning   of this century,
compelled Palgrave to exchange the dream of foreign travel and the
expectation of a life of competence for the necessity of working for
his living.    But he neither shrank from the duties thus unexpect
edly laid upon him, nor neglected that mental cultivation which             his
father's   unstinted   care  had commenced.          In his  sixteenth year he
entered a lawyer's      office, and continued      there, on the expiry of his
articles, as managing clerk      till the year 1822.
    A   home education gave early maturity to his abilities.             When
                                              '
but eight years old he translated the Battle of the Frogs and Mice,'
attributed    to Homer, from Latin into French.             Before he had at
tained his twentieth year he had contributed             many articles to the
minor periodicals of the day       ; and not many years later he became a
                         to the ' Edinburgh
                                                 ' and '
regular contributor                                       Quarterly Reviews.'
Writing for the press and writing anonymously were alike distasteful
 to him ; but as he devoted the whole of his only certain income, that
derived from the lawyer's office, to his father, he was compelled to
this means of support.         His early promise of talent did not fail of
fulfilment.     He was endowed with       a mind quick to acquire languages,
— to    grasp the laws of physical      science, — to  appreciate the beauties
of poetry and art. He was also gifted with a bright imagination, a
thirst for knowledge, and the power of patient industry. Honesty
 and simplicity of nature ennobled all he said or did, and true humi
 lity made him unwilling to trust his own researches, and ready to
 receive suggestions from minds however different in stamp from
his own.
     In  1821   Palgrave   submitted     to Lord Spencer a scheme for the
publication    of the national records, which was unanimously approved
by the Commission of Records, "many glorious things," according
 to Mr. Hudson Gurney's friendly report, being said of him by all.
 This took place in 1822, and from that time till 1838 he was occu
                                        '
 pied in the publication of the Parliamentary Writs,'
                                                                   '
                                                                     Exchequer
 Calendars,' and other works of great magnitude             and historical  im
 portance    connected with the Commission.            He was also engaged
on his own literary        undertakings,     and in practice as a barrister,
 chiefly in pedigree cases.      Much labour also devolved on him        as one

                                             XV
of the Municipal Corporation Commissioners, though he withheld
his signature from their report.                He was knighted in 1831, as an
acknowledgment           of his contributions        to constitutional    and parlia
mentary     history    ;  and was appointed Deputy Keeper              of the Public
Records in 1838, a post which he held up to his death.                       Previous
to his appointment,             the national     muniments     were scattered over
fifty-six different repositories, many of them but little fitted for the
safe custody      of the public archives.           A different system of manage
ment, a     different scale of charges for searches and copies, prevailed
in each.       By the exertion of great activity and perseverance he
brought these various establishments under                  one system, and     finally
united their contents at the Rolls Estate.                   His 'Annual Reports,'
twenty-two in number, afford ample proof of the extent of his official
labours.     He was       elected a     Fellow of the Royal Society in 1821.
    The   dates   of Palgrave's writings are as follows : — He brought out
in   1831   a short history           of English affairs from the acquisition of
 Britain by the Romans until the Norman Conquest ; and in the
                              ' Rise and
 year following, the                         Progress of the English Common
                     '                            '
 wealth.'     The Merchant and Friar was his next publication.                       In
  1841, after the labour           of  several years, he furnished Murray with
                                    '
 the first edition of the Handbook to Northern Italy.'                       The first
                             '                                             '
 two volumes of the History of England and Normandy appeared
 in  1851 and 1857.         These volumes treat of the Carlovingian            empire,
 the rise of the Capetian dynasty, and the foundation                 of the Duchy
 of Normandy.            Materials      are left that  carry the narrative      to the
 time of Henry       I. He       also contributed, principally between the years
  1815-21 and 1840-45, upwards of forty articles to the                 'Edinburgh'
 and ' Quarterly Reviews.'
     With the exception of the handbook,                 one  purpose, the elucida
 tion of our national history, runs through his works.                    The ' Com
                '
 monwealth        represents the national life of England before the Con
  quest.    The character of the people and general aspect of the realm
 is exhibited by an examination of those legal and social institutions
  which regulated the daily life of the community, as he felt that the
  attention of historians had hitherto been too exclusively confined to
 the political action of the times.               The little history of the Anglo-
  Saxons was designed to supply that biographical                   portraiture    and
  narrative detail necessarily excluded from a constitutional               history.

                                            XVI
     In  the    '
                  Merchant and Friar,' Roger Bacon is employed as the
  expounder of mediaeval philosophy. Intimate acquaintance with the
  curious arts of the middle ages, astrology and alchemy, with physical
  science,   both ancient and modern, — the archaeological incidents dis
  closed by study of the city archives, — a sensibility to the beauties            of
  architecture     and nature,     supplied     the author     with ample means
 towards a just comparison of the arts and customs                 of the past and
  present.     The illustration of important constitutional           principles, as
  shown, for instance, in the development of trial by              jury and of the
  parliamentary representation of the English counties, even more than
  a picture of mediaeval        society and manners, was his object in this
 story.     Especially did he wish          to impress upon his readers that
  essential truth, that our     " constitution     is based, not upon liberty,   but
 upon   law," — that Parliament        is not only an assembly of the political
 estates   of the realm, but    a judicial tribunal, that High Court        to which
 even   the poorest in the middle            ages could    apply for justice. In
 spite   of the    " wit   and wisdom
                                          "   contained in the ' Merchant and
 Friar,' the animated pictures of past times and varied display of
 knowledge, the outpourings          of one who loved study for its own sake,
 it is but   an unknown      book.
     Further investigation of Anglo-Norman history, and that passion
 for his subject which springs from long-continued research, led Pal-
 grave to abandon his intention of continuing,                in one volume, the
 'Commonwealth' to the            accession     of the Stuarts, and he devoted
 himself to investigate the times that lay nearest to the Conquest.
 This was, however, to him no brief undertaking.                  To the right un
 derstanding of the process by which our constitution              arose   after the
Conquest, he felt it necessary to treat fully of the Norman dynasty
from its first establishment,          and to exhibit       the  parallel   between
France under the Capetians, and the German                   empire after the ex
tinction    of the Carloviugian       dynasty.       But he   was not enabled to
complete this great project           before declining       powers impeded his
progress.
    Palgrave sought throughout          his writings to enforce certain leading
historical     principles.     Independent       study   convinced    him, at the
commencement of his career,
                                       " that    the states   composing Western
Christendom       were to be considered as carrying on the succession             of
the imperial       authority of Rome,"        a doctrine upon which,      as he be

                                         XTU
lieved, all real conception of mediaeval and modern history depended.
The insight which led him to grasp this important theory, the " great
key of mediaeval history," and trace its influence upon the general
system of human affairs, has entitled him, in the language of one of
his reviewers, to a place in the very highest rank of historical in
 quirers.
    He held an opinion of his own upon that vexed question of our
history, the position assumed by William and his Normans towards
conquered England.         He convinced himself that the idea, upon
which Thierry laid such       stress,   of  a bitter war  of race against race
being waged against the Anglo-Saxons,            was greatly overcharged.      To
him it    seemed   that the remarkable         fact in English history is the
practical   union of interests, that the continuity        of English national
life was never broken by the Normans            : hence the vigorous and un
interrupted    progress of national power.         The lessons, however, from
past times which he sought to enforce were not exclusively historical.
    Political economy    was a study      of great interest to him.        But he
never missed an     opportunity of pointing out a source of error which,
in his opinion, pervaded the whole school — the "considering the
science of political economy as being entirely subject to calculation,
                                                          "
 wholly a matter of figures ; whereas in fact the wealth of nations,"
 even in the narrowest sense of the term, is quite as much rated by
 passion and imagination, the imponderable elements which evaporate
 during the analysis, and leave no residuum in the crucible."
    Imbued with reverence and deeply stored with the learning of the
 past, he shrank from that tendency, perhaps              more general thirty
 years ago than now, to contrast triumphantly the progress of modern
 science with mediaeval     credulity.       He inclined the rather to regret
 the wisdom that still lingered than to boast of the knowledge                that
 had come.       That appeal   to
                                   " civilization,"   so common     with French
 historians, as the highest standard of human perfection, was specially
 distasteful to him.     On the contrary, he maintained that all the
 elements which are      really beneficial in nationality are directly at
 variance with the French idea of civilization           — that with    national
 language, national institutions,       and national religion    it cannot amal
 gamate.
     Art was   a subject to which      he gave    but casual attention   ;  yet in
 this his appreciation of what        is real, and  of true  taste, gave him an
    VOL.   XII.                                                       b

                                     xtui
insight beyond his time.         He early claimed for gothic architecture
the place it now holds in popular estimation.             Years ago he sug
gested that principle in design, since enforced by Mr. Ruskin, that
in the physical world the curve is the token of life or organized
matter, as the straight line indicates death or inorganized            matter.
His article on the     " Fine Arts in Florence  "  (Quarterly Review, June
 1840) is a fine example of his range of mind, and contains passages
eloquent with picturesque description, and stored with sound histo
rical and artistic knowledge.
    Few living men have equalled Palgrave in the extent of his reading,
 still fewer have surpassed him in sincere and independent inquiry.
 His language was vigorous and often pointedly descriptive. He was
capable of vivid biographical portraiture,       and of tracing acutely the
original development and meaning of laws and titles.          Still he lacked
some qualifications      towards a great historian.      His habit of mind
 was rather     that of an advocate than a judge, which         diverted him
from that perfect judgment which characterizes Hallam and               Thirl-
wall.      His feeling for the importance of the laws and social institu
 tions that influenced the daily life of the people prevented him in
 some degree      from grasping the history     of the nation    as a whole.
The habit of dictating his writings tempted him to a diffuseness and
redundancy of style ; and, not unlike Southey, he has left passages
 in his writings which are fanciful rather than humorous, and hardly
worthy of his powers or of history. This estimate of Palgrave's
 literary position has been mainly adopted from a criticism on his last
 volume in the Edinburgh Review of April 1859.              Notwithstanding
 failings such as these, the writer assigns to him a place among the
 highest rank of historical inquirers, and states that the new light which
 he has thrown        upon the ancient institutions     of our land, and his
 share in enabling us to realize the grand picture of mediaeval Europe,
 should secure to him the deep gratitude of every historical student.
     He   passed,   like Scott and Southey,       a life of unremitting     in
  dustry.    As his years were continued from occupation to occu
  pation,  without the chasm of       a single day, so his hours      led him
 on from work to work        — the  page   of history before breakfast, the
  office in mid-day, his library and books in the evening.            Though
 he could not rest content save in a round of unremitting             activity,
 friendship    and home love were still the salt that made life precious

                                          XIX
to him.        A  man so gifted and true-hearted            could hardly fail of
meeting     with  worthy    love  and   honourable    friendship ; and in these
blessings he amply shared.             The mutual devoted love and noble
companionship        that was    given to him in his wife formed indeed
the keystone of his happiness         ;  yet friendship was to him no empty
word.      Deservedly     so, for he could claim the affectionate regard of
those that really knew him, above all of Henry Hallam and Sir
Robert Inglis, and of Hudson and Anna Gurney. Nor did he escape
the notice of distinguished men.              While quite young, Byron had
remarked of him, that he would be at the tip-top of whatever pur
suit he embarked in.          Describing    an ideal translator   of ancient Ger
man poetry, Scott mentioned Palgrave's name.                Later in life   we find
Dr. Arnold proposing to put questions to him on our history,                  as the
person who could answer them better than any one else.
    An animated talker in society, at home he was not                less ready to
amuse and to instruct.          He  was so    bright and playful,    so exceeding
in kindness and indulgence, that he was there as a boy among his
 children, sharing in their talk, joining in their arguments, or telling
 stories, allegories   of his own invention or       scenes from    history.     He
 ever  glowed with kindness and sympathy; but latterly animation
 was dimmed by sorrow from which               there was no recovery, and by
the commencement of that gradual decay of mind and body of which
he died.      In 1 847 he parted with      a very dear son for the    East  ;  about
 five years after that, the best part of his life was buried in his wife's
 grave.   The remaining years were chiefly marked by declining powers
 and the death of friends, and did but speak to the truth of Hallam's
 sad words,    " time    can never reinstate us to the position       of domestic
happiness."        The latter portion       of his official life   was,   however,
smoothed      to him by the most considerate kindness                of Sir John
 Romilly, a comparative stranger till his appointment                as Master     of
the Rolls.
    A  mind such      as Palgrave's, that adhered instinctively        to truth for
its   own sake,     however antagonistic       to popular     fancy, that turned
 rather   towards the oppressed and humble than to the successful,
 that was naturally averse to party feeling, and distrustful of the idol
 of the day, — such     a mind, so endowed       with wisdom not of this world,
 so many-sided      and imaginative, could not expect to be generally ap
  preciated, or to cause any immediate effect, or to reap the fruit of
                                                                    62

its labours.       Still,  even in this life, he anticipated, in great measure,
the reward which is given to those that follow after true knowledge,
and strive to guide others in the right way.
    General Sir      Charles William Pasley, K.C.B., of                the Royal
Engineers, was born at Eskdale-Muir, Dumfries, on the 8th                 of Sep
tember      1 780.    In his early years he displayed the impetuosity and
high courage which distinguished              him in after life, as well as the
perseverance, ability, and liberality for which he became no less re
 markable.
    Having received          a solid  preliminary    education in Scotland,     he
joined the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich in August 1796,
and obtained a commission in the Royal Artillery on the 1st of
 December, 1797.            He was transferred to the Royal Engineers on the
 1st   of April 1798, and on the 2nd of August             1799 he was gazetted
as   first Lieutenant in that corps.
    Between       1799 and 1807 he served in Minorca, Malta, Naples,
and Sicily, and was employed on various important                   services   and
confidential missions.          He was sent by General Villettes to commu
nicate with Lord Nelson in 1804; and after having been promoted to
 the rank of second captain on the 1st of March 1805, he served under
 the Prince of Hesse-Philippsthal in the defence of Gaeta against the
 French in 1806, and under Sir John Stuart at the battle of Maida
 (in Calabria) in the^ame year.             The experience of that battle con
 firmed the strong opinion which he had always maintained — in oppo
 sition at that time to many in the British army — that the English
generals would beat the French marshals as soon as they got a chance
 of doing     so.
     Captain Pasley took part in the siege of Copenhagen under               Lord
 Cathcart in 1807, and joined Mnjor-General Leith at Oviedo in the
 north of Spain in September 1808.                 He was employed to recon
 noitre the Asturian frontier, and then to communicate with General
 Blake    at Reynosa      in November, and he left Soto on the      1 5th  of that
 month at night as the French entered it.                After joining Colonel
 Robert Crawford's Brigade, he was           retained by Sir David Baird as his
extra aide-de-camp, in consequence              of his general attainments and
knowledge of the Spanish language.                He soon after joined Sir John
Moore's staff in       a similar capacity, and was attached to     it during the

 retreat upon, and at the battle of Corunna.          Though   a great admirer
of Sir John Moore, he was much annoyed at this retreat, and could
never afterwards speak of it with patience— his conviction having
been that the army ought to have turned round upon its pursuers
whilst it was strong, and to have maintained a footing in the Pe
ninsula, instead of waiting to fight at Corunna after it had been se
riously weakened by retreat, and then quitting the country.               From
his intercourse with the Marquis of Romagna and others, he was
also convinced that the Spanish troops might under improved                  ar
rangements have been made more useful.
    Captain Pasley next accompanied the expedition to Walcheren ;
he was employed in reconnoitring the coasts of Cadsand and Wal
cheren under the fire of the enemy's batteries          ; and he was present
at the siege of Flushing in 1809.          Leading   a storming   party of 100
men under Colonel         Pack, to obtain possession of      a French battery
on the dyke according         to his own proposal, he was first wounded
(though not disabled) by a bayonet in the thigh, and then, after
reaching the top of the dyke, shot through the body by a French
 soldier from below, belonging to a fresh party of about sixty whom
he challenged to surrender to twenty men.             The bullet  passed   in at
one side and out at the other,       injuring the spine in its progress, and
 it was hardly expected at first that he could recover. Portions of
 bone, sash, and clothes came out of the wound afterwards by degrees,
 and  it rendered him incapable of duty for more than          a year*.
    In   November     1810 Captain Pasley published        the first edition of
his ' Essay on the Military Policy and Institutions of the British
 Empire.'      This work appeared in a time of great national despon
 dency   ;  and its principal objects were to advocate greater energy
 and perseverance in prosecuting          the war with      France,   judicious
 offensive action in the conduct of that war, and especially a more
 vigorous    policy  in Spain,    and to demonstrate      that Great    Britain
 had   " sufficient force and a favourable        opportunity for destroying
 the French empire."         It attracted great attention,     and was highly
 approved on account of the manly and patriotic spirit which it dis
 played, though the doctrines of political economy which it contained
 were disputed.      It ran  rapidly through four editions, and     was favour-
    * He took   advantage  of this opportunity to teach himself German amongst
 other things.

                                   XXII
ably noticed (by    Mr. Canning    as was supposed)       in the ' Quarterly
Review' of May 1811, in which it          is  characterized as one of the
most important political works that had ever fallen under the obser
vation of the reviewer.      The opinions it expressed were contrasted
with the humiliating language then to be found in the pages of the
English press, and with the principle of husbanding resources which
was alike the watchword     and the fatal error of the despondents.
   Whilst in command of the Plymouth Company of Royal Military
Artificers in 1811, Captain Pasley set himself to consider how im
provements could best be made in the practice of Military Engineer
ing.   He had found       on  active service the       serious   disadvantage
under which the Royal Engineers         laboured, of having no properly
educated men at their disposal, and no good system for regulating
their operations  ; and the remainder       of his life  was chiefly devoted
to the supply of these wants.       Finding that the ordinary modes of
instruction were unsuited     to his object, he composed an elaborate
treatise intended to enable     the noncommissioned         officers   to teach
themselves and their men without the assistance              of mathematical
masters, on a method similar to that of Dr. Bell and           Mr. Lancaster,
and to go through their courses of geometry in the same manner as
their company drills or their small-arms      exercises.    The system thus
organized was found so successful at Plymouth, that it was intro
duced on an extended scale into the schools at Chatham in spite
of  some objections  — one critic  fearing that the men would            become
better educated than their officers, and might be consulted by the
 Generals commanding    !    His energy and success, backed by the re
presentations of the Duke of Wellington from the Peninsula as to
the defective condition of the Engineer Department in the Field,
led to the formation      of the Establishment        for Field Instruction
at Chatham,     and to his appointment        to the office of Director of
that establishment, with the rank of Brevet-Major. He was pro
moted to the rank of Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel            in May 1813, and
he became a Lieutenant-Colonel      in the Royal Engineers in December
 1814. Following up his designs, he completed a work on Military
                                                                     '
             '
Instruction in three volumes, of which the first was published in
 1814, and the second and third in 1817.         The former contained the
course of practical geometry before referred to ; the two latter a com
plete treatise on elementary fortification,    including the principles of

                                         xxili
the science, and rules for construction, many             of which apply to civil
as well as to    military works.
     Finding, in 1817, that his men had          been   " most grossly ill-treated
by the Army Bread Contractor," he was led to inquire into the system
under which the army was supplied with provisions               ;  and in   1 825 he
printed and circulated, but abstained from publishing,              a volume con
taining the result of his investigations.            The exposure which he thus
 afforded of abuses that were prejudicial to the soldier, and the im
provements that he suggested and was partly the means of intro
 ducing, were in themselves services of great value.                  In  1818, he
published a volume        of " Standing Orders," containing a perfect code
 of military rules for the duties of all ranks in the army.
     Colonel   Pasley    organized,    during his residence at Chatham*,
improved systems        of telegraphing, sapping, mining, pontooning, and
 exploding    gunpowder      on land and in water, and laid down rules
which, being founded on careful experiment, will always endure,
 besides preparing pamphlets and courses of instruction               on these and
 other subjects.      The volume which contained his ' Course of Prac
                       '
 tical Architecture      was especially valuable.         His work on the ' Prac
tical Operations of a Siege,' of which the first part was published                in
 1829, and the second in 1832, is still a text-book, and the best that
 has been written in any language on that subject.                Every operation
 in it  was treated as a separate study ; and         it exposed various mistakes
into which the French and German authors                     had fallen.      It was
 translated into French, and published in Paris in 1847.
     Early in  1831 Colonel     Pasley prepared a pamphlet, and in May
                                                                    ' Observations
  1834 he completed a volume of 320 pages, entitled
 on the Expediency        and Practicability of simplifying and improving
 the Measures, Weights, and Money used in this country, without
 materially altering the present standards.'              He strongly advocated
 the adoption of the decimal principle of division in all its simplicity
 for our coinage, as well as for our weights and measures, and
 opposed with equal ardour the introduction of the French units into
 this country.
     He sent to the press in May 1836 the first sheets of a work con
           '

  " Patent Lithic    Cement," and     " Blue Lias    Cement."
     In connexion with experiments on the explosion of gunpowder
 under water, Colonel       Pasley was led to undertake, and successfully
 to carry out, the removal of two sunken vessels from the bed of the
 Thames near Gravesend, in the year 1838.                 He received for this
 service the thanks of the municipal           authorities, and was presented
 with the freedom of the City of London in a gold box. Embold
 ened by the success of these operations, he proceeded to execute the
 more formidable task of clearing away the wreck of the ' Royal
                                                                         '
 George' from the anchorage at Spithead, and that of the Edgar'
 from St. Helen's.       The value of the materials recovered from these
 vessels was more than        equal to the expense       incurred   in their re
moval.        Portions of six  successive  summers, from 1839 to 1844 in
clusive, were devoted by him to this work         ; but he never asked for nor
received from the Admiralty any remuneration for the important sea-
vices that he rendered in this manner to the navy and the nation.
    Colonel Pasley remained at Chatham till the end of the year 1841,
when he was appointed, at the age           of  61, to the office  of Inspector-
General of Railways.         During the twenty-nine years and a half that
he was at the head of the Royal Engineer Establishment,                there was
hardly any subject connected with his profession as a military man
and an engineer — of instruction, construction, or destruction — that did
not benefit by his attention.         His presence   there was of the greatest
advantage to his country          as well  as to his corps.      The corps of
Royal Engineers       owes,  in fact, its existence in its present condition,
as well as     its high state of efficiency, to his energy, his example,
and his exertions     ; and the success of the British army in many a
field has been due in no small degree to the system of instruction            at
which he laboured       so devotedly, and which       he rendered so perfect.
As the latest example of the advantage of that system             we may refer
to the recent war in New Zealand, which was                brought   to a close
mainly      through   the employment      of Pasley's methods, by officers
(one of them his own son) who^had been trained by him at Chat

                                        XXV
bam.       The  easy and bloodless       capture of the native pahs, which
resulted from a systematic employment of the spade, proved at once
to their defenders the hopelessness of further resistance.
    He became a Brevet-Colonel          in 1830,   a Colonel  of Engineers in
1831, and a Major-General in the Army in 1841.                He received the
honorary distinction of        D.C.L.  at  Oxford in  1844 ; and   in 1846, on
relinquishing    the appointment of Inspector-General         of Railways, he
was made a      K.C.B. for general services.        He held the appointment
of Public Examiner        at the  East India Company's Military Seminary
at Addiscombe       for sixteen years, up to the year 1855, and took an
active part in its management, contributing materially to the high
standard which      it reached and at which it was maintained.          He was
elected a Fellow of the Royal Society as far back as 1816             ;  he was
also of old standing in the Astronomical,         the Geological, the Geogra
phical,     the Statistical,   and other societies  ; and he lost no oppor
tunity of contributing        to the advancement of practical science.       He
was     also a liberal     subscriber    to a great number       of charitable
institutions.
    He held no public office after 1855, but occupied himself chiefly
in re-editing his works, superintending the construction of pontoon
 equipages, and in other matters connected with his profession, as well
 as   in advocating the introduction         of decimal coinage, devoting      a
large proportion      of his time to the benefit or advancement of his
 friends and relations.        He  was promoted to the rank     of Lieutenant-
 General on the 11th of November            1851, and to that of General on
 the 20th of September 1860.
     He was twice married.          His first wife died of consumption in a
 few months,      his    second died     in 1848.     Of  six  children,   three
 survive him.      He     was   well and hearty up to within a week of his
 death ; but his long life of labour was brought to a close at his
 residence at 12 Norfolk Crescent, Hyde Park, from congestion of
 the lungs, on the 19th of        April 1861.
     John T. Quekett          was bora at Langport, Somersetshire,        in the
 year 1815; he was the fourth son of the late              Mr. Quekett, head
 master of the Langport Grammar              School,   and received his early
 education in that establishment.           Being intended for the medical
 profession, he was sent to London and apprenticed              to his brother,

                                      XXVI
the late Edwin Quekett,         lecturer  on botany at the London Hos
pital, at which institution he pursued          his medical studies.     After
passing the usual examinations, he, in June 1840, obtained by com
petition   the appointment      of Student of Human and Comparative
Anatomy in the Museum of the College of Surgeons, and at the ex
piration of the term of his appointment became Assistant-Conser
vator.    While holding these appointments,            Mr. Quekett    was  en
abled freely to follow      his   strong inclination    for microscopical  re
search, which     had    very decidedly      shown itself in early youth      ;
and after having formed a most elaborate and valuable collection            of
specimens of the tissues of plants and animals, including numerous
fine injections of the vessels, in preparing which he was remarkably
skilful and successful, he was in 1844 appointed by the Council of
the College to deliver annually a Course of Demonstrations, with a
view to the exhibition      and connected description of the collection,
and the explanation of the method and resources of microscopical
study.    This collection, numbering 2500 preparations, was purchased
by the College.       On the retirement of Professor Owen in 1856,
Mr. Quekett was appointed Conservator of the Hunterian Museum,
and also Professor      of Histology, which appointments he held till
his death, which took place at Pangbourne,         in Berkshire, on the 20th
of August, 1861, at the early       age  of forty-six.
   Mr. Quekett     was the author     of an elaborate treatise
                                                                ' On the
                                                                          Use
of the Microscope,' published in 1848, and speedily again in         a second
edition.    He also prepared the ' Descriptive and Illustrated Cata
logue of the Histological Series contained in the Museum of the Royal
College of Surgeons of England,' the first volume of which appeared
in 1850, and the second in 1855.           In 1852 he published a volume
of  ' Lectures on
                   Histology,' which was followed by a second in 1854.
Besides these separate works, Mr. Quekett contributed numerous
                '
papers to the Transactions of the Microscopical Society,' of which
he was one of the founders, and, after labouring              zealously in its
service for nineteen years as Honorary Secretary, was elected Presi
dent in 1860.      He was    a fellow    of the Linnean     Society, and was
elected into the Royal Society in 1860.
   Although best known for his microscopical pursuits, Professor
Quekett had devoted himself very successfully to the observation of
facts throughout     the whole field     of natural history.      In original

research the character of his mind led him less towards speculation
than to the determination of facts        ;  and accordingly he has left behind
him a rich store of trustworthy          materials, the result of his acute and
careful observation and faithful record.            His knowledge on all sub
jects of microscopic       investigation    was   extensive and accurate, a nd
he was ever ready to give the benefit of            it to others, and especially
to his numerous medical brethren, who continually sought his aid on
questions determinable by means of the microscope.
     Professor   Quekett    left a widow and four children,          to whom the
 Council of the College of Surgeons, in consideration of his merits
and services, have kindly and considerately granted a liberal pension.
     Friedrich Tiedemann,             Foreign Member of the Royal Society,
was born      at Cassel, on the 23rd         of August 1781.       In his father,
 Dietrich Tiedemann,       a Teacher in the Caroline College        in Cassel, and
 afterwards Professor       of Philosophy in the University of Marburg,
he was not only blessed with an affectionate and watchful parent,
 but enjoyed the advantage of an accomplished and painstaking pre
 ceptor, — to whose private        tuition, indeed, much more than to the
 teaching of the school and gymnasium, he was indebted for his early
 educational training, and for a thorough grounding in classical studies.
     While yet a boy      at the gymnasium         of Marburg,    to which    town
 his father and family had removed, the young Tiedemann                  showed a
 decided turn     for those pursuits       in which he     was destined    in after
 life to become so eminent.         He delighted in dissecting and preparing
 such animals as he could procure, and was thus naturally led to the
 pursuit of Zoology and Medicine.             In  1 798 he accordingly entered
 the University of Marburg, where he remained until 1802, diligently
 studying    medicine and       the   auxiliary   sciences.   The progress he
 made was, however, owing more to his own ardent love                 of the work
 he had undertaken        than to the professorial teaching of the Univer
 sity, which, one or two chairs excepted, appears to have been at
 that time conducted in an irregular            and slovenly way.       For better
 means    of studying practical medicine he therefore went to Bam
 berg, where he made the acquaintance of Dollinger — and thence to
 Wurzburg      ; and having in the mean time returned to Marburg, he
 took his Doctor's degree in that University in 1804.
     Tiedemann'   s first essay as a teacher of anatomy was made in 1803.

                                   xxvm
In the winter of that year he delivered the lectures and superintended
the practical studies in the anatomical school of Marburg, as sub
stitute for Professor Briihl, who was incapacitated by ill health ; and
next year, being invited by the Professor, and prompted by his own
inclination, he established himself as     "  Privatdocent
                                                              " in   the  Uni
versity, and gave lectures on Physiology,          Comparative     Osteology,
and on Gall's Craniology,      which   then    attracted   much     attention.
Feeling, however, the need of further preparation, he went again to
Wiirzburg to work at dissection under Hesselbach, and afterwards to
Paris, where he studied hard in the great museum of the Garden of
Plants,   and attended the lectures of Cuvier,         Geoffrey St.-Hilaire,
Lamarck, Dum6ril, and Haiiy.
   On his way to Paris, Tiedemann had made the acquaintance of
Soemmering at Frankfort, and gained his favourable opinion ; and
now, through the recommendation of that great anatomist, who had
in the mean time removed to Munich, he            was offered the Professor
ship of Zoology and of Human and Comparative Anatomy in the               Uni
versity of Landshut.      This offer, flattering    as it was to so young a
man, he naturally accepted,    and to Landshut he accordingly went in
1805.     There  he found a new and handsome anatomical theatre,           but
no collection of preparations or other appliances for teaching.        During
the first few years    of his incumbency therefore he had to labour
hard to supply these wants, besides discharging his professorial duties,
even to the temporary    injury of his health.
   The war between France and Austria having broken out afresh in
the spring    of 1809, Landshut and its neighbourhood             became    the
scene  of active military operations, and Tiedemann, in addition to his
regular duties, took charge of one of the temporary hospitals esta
blished in the place.    But in spite of the distractions of these trou
bled times he steadily pursued his scientific work.            In that same
                                            '
year appeared the first volume of his Zoologie,' and in 1810 and
 1814 the two parts     of the second volume.        The author's object in
this work was to combine zoology with comparative anatomy, and to
found the classification of animals upon their organization.           On the
part which    comprehends Birds he bestowed especial pains, and with
a view to the preparation    of it made numerous dissections, measure
ments, and observations of various kinds        ;  so that  it is still valued
as a  rich store of information on the   class   to which it refers.

                                                                           '
    Two of his minor works, the ' Anatomic des Fischherzens and
the ' Anatomie und Naturgcschichte des Drachens,' having in the
mean time appeared, Tiedemann            in  1811   made a journey to the
shores of the Adriatic to study the organization of the Echinoderms,
a subject    which had   been proposed for a prize-question     by the French
Institute.      The issue of his labours was his great work on the
llolothuria, Asterias, and Echinus, which gained the prize, established
his reputation     as a Zootomist,   and brought him a nomination as Cor
responding      Member     from   the  Academies     of Paris, Berlin, and
Munich.
    The study of the brain — in its structure and development, its
 differences among animals, its characters in different races of man
kind, its    defects and deformities  — was a subject on which Tiedemann
 bestowed much labour, both mental and manual.               In 1 8 1 3 he pub
lished the 'Anatomie der Kopflosen Missgeburten,' and in 1816 his
well-known description of the anatomy and development of the Foetal
 Brain,     In this work he described the successive stages of develop
ment of the human         brain, and showed the correspondence of these
 transitory conditions with its permanent conditions in animals lower
 in the   scale ; and notwithstanding     the great advances    of this  as well
 as other departments     of embryology in later times, Tiedemann's work
 is still held in high estimation.
     These researches on the brain, so happily begun, were continued
 through many years of Tiedemann's life.            The breaking up of the
 Grand-Ducal Menagerie at Carlsruhe           afforded him the opportunity
  of dissecting several rare animals, and of publishing in 1821 the
 ' Icones Cerebri Simiarum.'        In 1825 he gave, in two memoirs pub
                    '
 lished in the Zeitschrift fur die Physiologie,' a comparison of the
 brains of the Orang Outang and Dolphin with that of Man               ; and he
 has left behind him a large collection of unpublished          figures of the
 brains of animals, which, in the hands of his distinguished          son-in-law
 Prof. Bischoff of Munich, may yet prove serviceable           to science.
     The comparison of the brain of the Negro with that of the Euro
 pean, to which he next directed his attention, became for Tiedemann
  a subject of keen interest.    After collecting all the materials to which
  he could find access on the Continent, he made a visit to England in
  1835, mainly for the purpose of making examinations and measure
 ments     of the brains and crania of different       races   to be found in

                                            xxr
British collections.        The fruits of      these labours he presented to the
Royal Society, of which he had a few years before been elected a Fo
reign Member, in a memoir entitled
                                                   " On the Brain of the Negro,
compared with that of the European and the Orang Outang," which
                            '
was published      in the     Philosophical Transactions' for 1836, and            ap
peared afterwards in German as a separate work in 1837.                    From his
extensive researches,      Tiedemann arrived at the conclusion that, whilst
in the majority of cases the Negro's brain is undoubtedly less than
that of the European, there are nevertheless individuals of the negro
race  in whom the brain         is as large as   in the Caucasian   ;  and coupling
this result with the fact, shown as he conceived by careful historical
and literary inquiries, that there is no province of intellectual activity
in which individuals of pure negro            race have not distinguished      them
selves,    he draws the inference that there is no impassable limit be
tween Caucasian and Negro which should unconditionally                   denote   the
one as the master       of the other.
   In   1816 Tiedemann accepted            a call to Heidelberg,   where he under
took the Professorship          of Physiology, as well as that of Anatomy.
His physiology        was, like Haller's, founded on anatomy, observation,
and experiment.         It is true   that, while a student at Wiirzburg, he was
for  a time an ardent hearer          of Schelling, in the hope of       a new   illu
mination      of biological    science    through the German          " Naturphilo-
            "  but his solid sense and the positive scientific progress he
sophie   ;
had already made soon led him to distrust the allurements of a vain
system.       It was in this practical spirit that, at a riper age, he        joined
with the accomplished chemist Leopold Gmelin in those elaborate
researches which ended in the celebrated experimental Essay on Di
gestion (Die Verdauung, nach Versuchen, 1825), in which the names
of the anatomist and chemist are so honourably associated. Tiedemann
also  entered on the laborious task of preparing a systematic work
on physiology on an extended plan, somewhat after the manner of
                    '
the ' Element a of Haller ; and the first volume, embracing general
physiology, was published           in 1830.       The issue of the third volume
was prematurely forced upon him by the unauthorized publication                     of
the corresponding part of his lectures            ;  but the work was not further
proceeded with, and the part published,                 although full of learning,
and displaying        other excellencies characteristic        of the author, and
although      it was   translated both into French           and into English, at

                                      x*xi
traded comparatively         little attention.     At that time, indeed, the
revived and improved use of the microscope in physiology,                 the more
exact application of physical experiment, and other influential causes
were about to introduce a mass of new materials into the science, and
to involve a fresh handling of the old in any systematic treatise that
should be up to the actual state of knowledge               ;   and it is probable
that advancing years and other cares indisposed the author                  to per
severe    in what had    become an arduous task.
     Tiedemann     meanwhile      did not intermit     his labours     in human
and comparative anatomy.             He had, in conjunction with Oppel and
 Liboschitz, projected a work on the anatomy and natural history of
Reptiles ; but, in consequence of the death of his collaborators, it
went no further than the part on Crocodiles, which appeared in 1817.
In 1820 he published         a monography       of the Ursine Sloth; in 1822
his 'Tabulae Nervorum            Uteri,' which    he dedicated to the Royal
 Society,     and in the same year came out the 'Tabulae               Arteriarum
 Corporis Humani.'         This grand work, though not exactly faultless
in every point,       has, more than any other,          contributed     to spread
abroad the name of Tiedemann              ; for the figures it contains have
 been    reduced and copied and disseminated, in collections of anato
 mical     plates and in anatomical systems and hand-books,                in every
 part of the world where anatomy is taught.             A  supplement, contain
 ing additional figures of varieties in the distribution          of the arteries,
 was published      in 1846.
     Besides the works noticed in this brief sketch, Tiedemann was the
 author of various minor essays and memoirs, published separately, or
 contributed     to Transactions    of Societies and Journals.        He   was also
  associated    with the two brothers          Treviranus     in conducting the
  'Zeitschrift    fur Physiologie.' A        complete list of his writings is
  appended to a memoir of his life read before the Bavarian Academy
  of Sciences, by his son-in-law Professor Bischoff, from whence the
  facts in the present notice have been mainly derived.
      In   1807 Tiedemann       married  the daughter      of the Obervoght       of
  Rastatt, whose family name was von Holzing; and with her he lived
   in happy union to the end of his days. She bore him seven children,
   of whom three survive him.         Unhappily three of his sons were drawn
   into the revolutionary       movement in Baden in 1848, for which the
   eldest paid the forfeit of his life, and the other two had to exile them

                                      xxxu
 selves  from their fatherland.      These deplorable events weighed        all
 the more heavily on the old man, as his own political tendencies were
 strongly conservative.      Added to    these family afflictions, a  growing
 infirmity of his eyesight induced Tiedemann to withdraw from public
 duty, and to retire in 1849 to Bremen, and thence soon after to
 Frankfort.     There   he met   with a kind reception from numerous
 attached friends,   and in 1854 he was honoured          by the celebration
 of his   " Doctor-Jubilaeum,"      on the fiftieth anniversary of his pro
 motion to the Degree of Doctor.           On this occasion not only his
 immediate friends and countrymen, but men of science in all parts
 of the world joined in the general testimony of respect ; and a medal,
bearing his likeness, was struck in commemoration of the event.
 Having recovered    a very serviceable degree     of vision by a successful
operation    for cataract, he continued to      enjoy his retirement, and to
gratify his passion for natural scenery in summer excursions among
the Bavarian Alps     ; but after a time he became      subject to attacks   of
bronchitis,   under which he finally      sank on the 22nd       of January,
 1861.
    Tiedemann, besides a thorough acquaintance with the literature of
his special department, possessed a large stock of accurate general
information   — the fruit of   diligent reading and personal observation,
favoured by a singularly     exact and capacious memory.          His private
as well as his public    life was characterized     throughout    by elevated
sentiment, manly independence, and strict integrity. We have already
mentioned the special honour conferred upon him in his old age           ; and
as a further evidence    of the   esteem   in which he    was   held, we may
add that he was elected a member of no less than sixty-two            learned
Academies and Societies.       He was also raised to the rank of Privy
Councillor by the Grand Duke of Baden, and received orders of
Knighthood from Baden, Bavaria, Greece, and Prussia.             His election
to the Foreign Membership       of the Royal Society took place in 1832.

    OBITUARY NOTICES OF FELLOWS DECEASED
           Between 30th Nov.          1861   and 30th Nov. 1862.
   Peter Barlow,           Esq., was born at Norwich in October 1776,
and died at      Charlton in Kent on the 1st of March 1862.                After
going     through    an   ordinary   school    education,    he chose     mathe
matics as a special study, and obtained the place of Mathematical
Master, and subsequently that of Professor, in the Royal Military Aca
demy at Woolwich.          During the earlier part of his career he gave his
attention chiefly to pure mathematics        ; and his first original work was
'On the Theory of Numbers,' which appeared in 1811.                     In   that
work he shows       an acquaintance    with the writings of foreign mathe
maticians to an extent at that time unusual.           In 1814 he published
a Mathematical       and Philosophical Dictionary      ;   also his well-known
Mathematical      Tables, which, besides other cognate matters of use and
interest, gives the factors,     squares,   cubes, square roots, cube roots,
and reciprocals      of all numbers up to 10,000.           This work     having
passed    out of print, and a decided opinion being entertained by some
discriminating     authorities of the practical usefulness of its chief con
tents, the tables, so far as indicated above, the factors excepted, were
republished     in stereotype under the sanction of the Useful Know
ledge Society in 1840.
   In    1817   Mr. Barlow published       a work on the Strength         of Ma
terials,   based on extended experimental inquiries carried on by him
self.    In  this way he was brought         into friendly relation with the
leading engineers and architects of his time, was much consulted in
reference to important        works of construction,      and served on more
than one Government Commission              on great engineering      questions.
He next turned his attention to the subject of magnetism in general,
and especially to the deviations          of the compass-needle       caused   by
local attraction, and the best means of correcting it.           His researches
                              '
form the subject of his Essay on Magnetic Attractions,' published
in 1820, and of        seven  papers communicated        to the Royal Society
from 1822 to 1833.          These labours of     Mr. Barlow     were   so highly
esteemed,     and the method he devised for correcting compass-errors,
although confessedly not perfect, was at the time deemed of so great
practical value, that in 1825 he received the Copley Medal from the
Royal Society     "  for his Various   Communications        on the Subjects of
 Magnetism."
   vol. xii.                                                         c

                                    XXXIV
    Mr. Barlow also applied himself to the improvement of achro
 matic object-glasses,    and in 1827 communicated          a paper on      that
 subject to the Royal Society.       In the further course of his inquiries
 he was led to try the effect   of substituting, for the flint-glass lens of
 the usual achromatic combination, a concave         lens formed of trans
 parent fluid enclosed in a glass capsule having surfaces of appropriate
 curvature.     The idea of employing fluid lenses, it may be observed,
 was not new : it had occurred to Newton and David Gregory, and
 had even been practically applied by Dr. Blair of Edinburgh.               Mr.
 Barlow made choice of sulphuret of carbon        as the   fluid, which, with
 a refractive   power about equal, has a dispersive power more than
 double that of flint-glass.    He demonstrated the practicability of his
 method     by constructing   two telescopes on that principle, with a
 result sufficiently promising    to obtain for him the support           of the
 Board of Longitude in the further prosecution of his experiments.
The Council of the Royal Society also, sensible of the important
 scientific bearing of Mr. Barlow's proposal, engaged Mr. Dollond to
 construct a fluid-lens telescope   under  Mr. Barlow's superintendence,
and submitted the instrument        to be practically tested by competent
judges in order to decide on the expediency     of constructing     a telescope
of much larger dimensions on the        same principle.      The trial instru
ment is described by      Mr. Barlow in the Philosophical Transactions
for 1833;     and Reports     on its performance,      by Sir    J.  Herschel,
Mr. Airy, and Captain (now Admiral) Smyth, will              be found     in the
 Proceedings for December of the following          year.     From the trials
made,     it appeared that Mr. Barlow's principle might be advan
tageously applied to the construction of a great refracting telescope
to be employed in the observation of nebulae          and for certain other
astronomical     purposes  ; but the project     seems    not to have been
 further proceeded with.
    Besides publishing the memoirs and treatises mentioned above,
Mr. Barlow during his active career was         a large contributor      to the
 ' Encyclopaedia
                   Metropolitana.' He retired from the duties of his
Professorship     in 1847.     In May 1823 he was elected into the
Royal Society.      He  was one  of the original Fellows of the Astrono
mical Society, and a member of several        of the leading Societies in
Europe and America.

                                      XXXV
    Jean-Baptiste Biot,         the last of that powerful school of science
which     grew up during the first French revolution, cannot here be
the subject of a detailed scientific biography.          The wide extent of
his labours would alone render this difficult        ; and when    it is added
that a large part of this extent contains matters in which the position
of Biot and of others could not        be discriminated   in few words, diffi
culty merges in practical impossibility.          And this is rendered still
more obvious when we state that we do not so much refer to actual
points of disagreement commenced and continuing,              as to matters  in
which anything short of        a minute and cautious handling       would pro
bably create     new discussions which had better find a natural origin
in the statements of professed historians.           Of these matters some
 are of very old date, and may therefore be said to have passed into
 history   ; while this very circumstance makes it more desirable to
 dwell especially upon the personal life of one who was born under
 Louis XV. and lived to the        age of eighty-eight in the full enjoyment
 of high faculties.      Of this personal life    we are able to give some
 account from documents on which we can rely.
     Biot was born    at Paris,  April  21, 1774.    His father, Joseph Biot,
 was an employ £ at the Treasury, whose ancestors had been farmers in
 Lorraine.     The   son, after a classical education at the college     Louis-
 le-Grand,    and some instruction      in mathematics from Mauduit, was
  placed, against his wish, with a merchant at Havre, who employed
  him in copying letters by the thousand.          Disgusted with this occu
  pation, he volunteered for the army as soon as the legal age                of
  eighteen was attained, and served as an artilleryman          in the army of
 the North at the battle of Hondschoote             in 1793.     Declining the
 promotion     offered on condition of permanently engaging himself, he
  remained a few months, at the end of which a severe illness made
  him desirous of returning       to his parents.    The military authorities
  were very slow about the dismissal of volunteers who were likely to
 be   useful, so Biot took his departure for Paris, with nothing but
  his Serjeant's certificate, in September 1793.        Walking feebly along
  the   road, he was      overtaken by a smartly dressed person in a
  cabriolet, who invited him into his carriage, and entered into con
  versation with him.         Finding    that  he was   going    to Paris, the
  stranger pointed out the danger of his purpose, a recent ordinance
  having made      it death for soldiers to approach the capital.          Biot
                                                                  c2

                                      XXXY1
persisted, and his companion then offered to take him all the way.
This stranger, whoever he        was,   gained their free passage       through
military posts, and sent patrols about their business               by   a mere
whisper.     At Compiegne,     the young volunteer was summoned before
a revolutionary     committee, then and there sitting, on the evidence
of his uniform.      But his examination had hardly commenced when
his companion entered the room in violent anger and addressed strong
reproaches     to   the Committee,      which    were  answered by       humble
apologies.     When they arrived at Paris, Biot desired to know the
name and address of his protector, and was answered St. Just, Rue
de la Michodiere,      Hotel X            .   The story,  one would suppose,
ends   here with full explanation       of all that had taken place. But
when Biot, after an illness of several weeks, presented himself at the
address given, he was told that no such person had ever lived there.
In later years Biot made many efforts to clear up the mystery, but
never could get beyond a doubt.              So far the notes from which we
write.     We add that it is notorious that the formidable leader of
the revolution was on his way to Paris about the time in question,
having been commissioner         to the army of the North       ;  and he was
the iUgant which Biot describes his friend to have been              ;  but this
was,  of course, known to Biot.         It  may be surmised that the person
really was    the colleague of Robespierre,          who, knowing      that the
power he had shown would necessitate              the inference that he was
very high in the state, and render his detection easy, chose to give
his real name, but also to hint that further acquaintance would be
inconvenient,     by giving   a wrong address.        He was guillotined       in
July    1794, so    that Biot, enfeebled by illness, probably          had    no
opportunity    of  seeing him  in public.
   Biot   was admitted into the school       of Ponts et Chaussies, and into
the Polytechnic School at its opening.              He formed the acquaint
ance   of Poisson, and the two     became the favourite pupils      of Monge.
But Biot, Malus, and       some others who had smelt powder, took part
in the insurrection      of October    1795, the suppression      of which by
grape-shot was the first very notorious            achievement of Napoleon
Bonaparte.      Biot found refuge      at   Melun  ; but the names of the in
surgent students were known, and they would have been expelled
from the Polytechnic School         if   Monge had not interfered        by the
declaration that they were among his best pupils, and that               if they

were dismissed he would retire with them.                  Monge was more than
once    the protector   of the school.        The Emperor,        when he gained
this title, felt strongly that the students were his enemies, and seems
to have meditated their dispersion.             "We     had work enough,"        said
Monge to      him, " to make them republicans           ;  give us a little time to
form them into monarchists         :   you yourself must agree that              you
have turned that corner rather sharply."                  Napoleon   did nothing     :
and he lived to call the school the goose which laid him the golden
eggs-
    Biot's next step in life  was to a chair      of mathematics at Beauvais.
At this place he gained the acquaintance and correspondence of
                                                             '
Laplace by an offer to correct the sheets of the               Mecanique Celeste.'
He has given, in the Journal         des Savans, an anecdote         which   is very
honourable to Laplace.        While at Beauvais he married the sister of
his friend Brisson,     whose family resided there.              Neither had any
money, either in possession or reversion           ;  so that   all except lawyers
will   share   Biot's wonder when he found that the notary had con
trived a   contract of marriage twelve pages long.              Madame Biot had
been very well educated, and the          little stories and dramas which she
wrote for her children       were celebrated in her circle.              She learnt
German       in order that her husband, at the desire of Berthollet,
might publish a French edition of Fischer's work on physics ; but
the actual translation,     watched of course          by her husband, was her
own.      The first edition was published in 1805. In 1799 Biot was
 appointed an examiner of the Polytechnic School ; in 1 800 he was
removed to Paris as Professor         of Physics at the College de France,
 and was made an associate        of the Institute, of which he became a
 member in 1803.        The other     dates   which we ought to give          are as
follows.      He  was appointed,   with Arago, to the continuation of the
 measure of the meridian, in August 1806; with Mathieu, to de
 termine    the   pendulum    at Bordeaux,        August 1808.         He   became
 editor of the Journal des Savants, May 1816.                   He went to Scot
land and the Shetland        Islands for the measurement of the pendu
lum in 1817;        to Dunkirk, with Arago,          to act in concert with an
 English commission for the determination of the latitude, in 1818;
 to  Illyria and the Balearic         Islands,    for the pendulum, and to
 Spain for the repetition of measures         connected with the great survey,
 in 1824-25.       He  was  made     a  Foreign Member of this Society in

                                         XXXV1U
1815, and obtained the Copley Medal in 1840.                                He died at Paris,
February       3, 1862.
   The other        dates, &c.   of his life will         be found, given       by M. Lefort
                                             '
(the son of his daughter's daughter), in the Nouvelles Annales de
Mathematiques,' 2nd series, vol. i.  The list of his writings, asso
ciated and separate,         is under 477 heads              ;    and   this list, says the
collector, is certainly incomplete.             Of his           separate    works should be
especially mentioned          the 'Astronomie               Physique,'        1st   ed., 1805   ;
2nd, in 3 vols., 1810-11          ;   3rd, in   5   vols., 1841-57;            the 'Traite- de
Physique Experimentale,' 4 vols., 1816; the 'Precis' of the same,
1st ed., 1817 ; 3rd, in 2 vols., 1824 ; 'Recueil d' Observations Geo-
desiques' (vol. iv. of the 'Base du Systeme Me*trique'), 4to, 1821 ;
the edition (in conjunction with M. Lefort) of the ' Commercium
Epistolicum,' &c., with additions, 4to, 1856.                        The works on Indian
and Chinese         astronomy      can hardly         be     given apart, without the
writings on the same subject in the journals.
  How completely Biot was devoted to his occupations sufficiently
appears. The indomitable energy of his character was associated
with    a strong feeling     of personal independence.                      With the pride of
a republican he refused, before his election to the Academy of Sci
ences, to pay the usual visits   of ceremony to his future colleagues.
This he afterwards regretted ; and, as a kind of expiation, he made
it a rule, until at last his friends insisted that he should spare his
extreme old age the fatigue, to pay a visit to every new member                             of
the Academy,         so soon as his election was made certain.
   In   1803, his son Edward was born.                     This    son, after a respectable
career in science         and engineering, took a dislike to such pursuits,
and applied         himself to literature,          and especially to the study of
Chinese.          He died in 1850,     of the Academy of Inscrip
                                        a member
tions, in which he found himself the colleague of his father ; for it
should be noted, as a thing which                   is,   we believe, unique, that        Biot
died    a   member of three of the four academies,                    being also elected to
the Academie          Francaise in 1856.             The mother survived her son
two years     ;   and these losses were the great misfortunes of the father's
life.
   The name of Arago will always                    be associated           with that of Biot.
Arago in his early youth (he was but twenty-four years old when
he gained his place at the Institute, after his return from captivity

                                        xxxix
at Algiers) had distinguished           himself to an extent which induced
Biot to make it almost          a condition   that the young man should be
appointed his assistant, before he would                undertake the conduct of
the survey.        When    a place   in the astronomical        section of the    In
stitute   became      vacant, Poisson     was    thought of      as a successor to
Lalande,     with every chance of       success.       Biot protested, and urged
strongly to both Lagrange          and Laplace, that the astronomer ought
to be a person conversant with astronomy, and that Poisson's future
chair ought to be one of geometry.                Lagrange gave way at once —
" Vous    avez  raison," he said,     " c'est la  lunette qui fait l'astronome."
Laplace was harder to convince, but yielded at last.
    In  1809   Biot obtained those apartments in the College de France
which he occupied with hardly any intermission until his death.
We have heard it said that he never left Paris for                 one single night
during    fifty years : this is probably not literally true, but is cer
tainly very near it.         In the same year (April) an imperial decree
named him professor of astronomy in the new University then
founded.       Biot had not been       an  Imperialist    ; and the appointment
was a free testimony to his merit.           In    1804 he had endeavoured to
prevent the Institute from expressing an opinion                  in favour of the
new regime, on the ground that a scientific body should not meddle
with politics    :  this opinion he always maintained.             The police were
well aware that he had assisted Benjamin                  Constant, Andrieu, and
perhaps other frequenters of the house of Madame de Stael, in the
composition      of   a satirical   piece which       had great success     in such
private circulation       as could   be safely given.       Fouche     had charged
 Laplace to tell his young friend to be a little less witty and a little
more prudent.          Biot,  as might   be expected, obtained no very great
patronage from the Emperor.              He had     a  turn for dry satire, which,
under very effective restraint, is visible in his controversial writings             ;
 and he had the mode of delivering a sarcasm which tells.                  In  1800,
 Roederer,    then high in the direction of public             instruction,   paid a
 visit to the College de France, and, surrounded               by the professors,
 read them a lecture on their functions, recommended practice in pre
 ference  to theory, and pointed out geometry and algebra as not good
 for much.       " Cependant,"      quietly remarked Biot,         "la  geométrie a
 du bon      pour    l'arpentage,"    to which the        other was     unfortunate
 enough to assent in a manner which showed he did not understand

                                        xl
 the answer.       The amusement which this excited led Laplace to tell
 the story to    the First Consul, among whose few objects of reverence
 the mathematics         stood very high.     Roederer      accordingly    had  to
 encounter one of those bourrasques by which Napoleon                   is so well
known.       "You      are a pretty ignoramus       not to know that mathe
 matics is the root of human knowledge.               The young man served
you right when he turned you into ridicule               ;  and you could not
even see what he was         at."
    If  such anecdotes      appear to be unusual in our notices, it may be
remembered that these accompaniments would, in most cases, be                   of
too recent a character.          We insert nothing but what is more than
half  a century old, and we proceed to a few words on           Biot's scientific
life.
    Over and above separate        works, fifteen in number, the scientific
life  of Biot  is recorded in 6O articles    of the Journal Philomathique,
 119   of the Comptes Rendus, 3 of the Journal of the Polytechnic
School, 8 of the Connaissance des Terns, 41 of the Annales de
 Chimie, &c., 22 of the Memoirs           of the Academy, 1 of the Savans
 Etrangers,    83 of the Journal     des Savans    ; and of accounts and cri
ticisms, 37 in the Moniteur Universel, 35 in the^Mercure de France,
 1 in the Journal        des Delmts* 5 in the Journal des Mines, with
23 articles in the Biographie         Universellc,    9 in the Memoires,       &c.
d'Arcueil,     1   in the Academy       of Inscriptions,      2   in  the   Revue
Britannique,      6 in the Revue ou    decade Philosophique,        &c., and 8 in
the Nouvelles Annales           du Museum    d'Histoire Naturelle.         In this
large mass of results the author appears as an observer and experi
menter, as a critic and historian, and as a teacher and elementary
writer.
    As  an astronomical and geodetical observer,          Biot has long had his
 place in history    ;  to discuss that place would require the discussion
of critics, historians, and subsequent observers.          As an experimenter,
 we cannot undertake to describe that long train of which Professor
                                                                 '
 Forbes,    in  his    elaborate sixth  dissertation    of the     Encyclopaedia
 Britannica,'    says
                        " the  number and variety of his experiments and
 writings almost baffles      enumeration."     There is no part of physics
 into which he did not carry his        researches   ;  but of all he was most
 devoted to optics.         Here the point which has been most signalized
 by historical writers is the effect of the rotatory action of fluids, to

                                           ill
which he attended for forty years.               All acknowledge the sagacity,
perseverance,        and honesty which are conspicuous in this prominent
part of Biot's life, as in others.
   As      a critic   and historian,   Biot's field of labour     was even wider
than that of his life as an experimenter and observer.                Had  he pub
lished nothing whatever except his papers on Egyptian, Hindoo,                 and
Chinese astronomy, he would have been known as an inquirer                     the
amount of whose labours was fully equal to that of several whose
reputation       is entirely   founded upon oriental astronomy.            Had he
produced nothing except the long series of articles on contemporary
science and history of science which adorns the Journal des Savans,
he would have been remarkable as the most continuous                    and varied
scientific    critic of his time.       And in all     these  articles there is a
close     and discriminating      production     of the whole subject, relieved
by legitimate satire, and by a tone of occasional pleasantry which is
the true vehicle of certain parts of good criticism.                Three volumes
     '                                               '
of     Melanges Scientifiques        et Litteraires    were published    in 1858;
but    it may   be hoped that this     will  be superseded by a more complete
reprint.
    It   is natural that a notice in these pages should          make allusion to
Biot's part in         a controversy   which, more than any other, concerns
this Society      :  we mean the never-ending question        of Newton and his
opponents.          From the time when the life of Newton appeared in the
*
  Biographie        Universelle,' its author was what we may here call the
chief of the opposite party.            His views were strong, and ably sup
ported ; his mode of opposition was fair and downright.                   Biot was
one    of those disputants who cannot fail         to forward sound conclusion,
take which side they may.
   As     an elementary writer, this country is under especial obligations
to Biot.       In 1816, just after the termination of the long struggle
which had isolated Great Britain from the continent, he produced
those treatises on physics, full and abridged, which laid all the re
cent physical improvements before those who could not have sought
them in scattered organs of announcement.                   Very many of those
whose youth belongs to this period will remember Biot's 'Traite'
and especially his ' Precis,' as the first sources of their acquaintance
with modern experimental methods and results.                    The treatise on
astronomy, not so much known in this country,                    filled up  a void

                                         xlii
which had       been   left    open in the large      mathematical        work of
Delambre.
    It   is not often that a death at the age of eighty-eight              leaves    a
blank in the scientific world       ;   but this must    be said    of Biot.        To
the end of his long life he was in perpetual activity.              A    volume on
Indian and Chinese astronomy appeared in 1861, closing the list
which began with "Elements of Arithmetic," prefixed to Clairaut's
'Algebra,' in 1797.
v
    William Borrer,           Esq., the eldest of the three    sons      of William
Borrer, Esq., of Parkyns-manor, Hurstpierpoint, was born at Hen-
field in Sussex on the 13th of June 1781. He passed his long life
in the country, discharging the duties incident to         a landed      proprietor
and county magistrate, and earning the respect and attachment                       of
his neighbourhood      for his well-considered acts of local beneficence.
Amidst his rural occupations Mr. Borrer found ample                 scope for the
pursuit of botany, to which he was enthusiastically devoted, and earned
for himself a considerable reputation among British botanists for his
extensive and accurate knowledge of indigenous plants. To the great
                                              '
repertory of that species of knowledge, the English Botany,' and
especially to the Supplement of that work, he contributed                  valuable
materials ; and, in association with his friend Mr. Dawson Turner,
commenced a ' History of British Lichens,' which, however, was
stopped in its progress by the death of the printer and other unto
ward circumstances.           After lying dormant for   a quarter   of   a century,
the fragment of this work actually printed was brought out by                    Mr.
Turner for private circulation, and mainly,           as he expresses      himself,
that it might serve as a monument of            Mr. Borrer's industry, ability,
and profound knowledge of the family of plants to which it refers.
    Mr. Borrer was elected into the Royal Society in 1835.                  He was
also a Fellow of the Linnean Society and of the Wernerian                  Natural
History Society of Edinburgh.             He died on the 10th of January
1862.
    The life of our late President,      Sir Benjamin Collins Brodie,
Baronet,    Serjeant-Surgeon       to the Queen, has not been ended              long
enough to allow even those who are best acquainted with                    it,   fully
or, perhaps, correctly to estimate its precise value.

                                       xliii
   There is no profession where           a man may      in his lifetime     be so
distinguished,    and leave behind so slight record of his life, as the
profession of Medicine       or of Surgery.       With the death of the man
there perishes in such case a vast amount of personal skill                    and
observation,    which,    being   unwritten,     and indeed      not   capable of
being written,     can be amassed        again only by the combination           of
similar talent, opportunity,     and  industry in another individual.          Nor
is even this always possible.       There are epochs in human knowledge
as  in human affairs     ; and a man may so turn to account the pecu
liar circumstances of his epoch         as to attain not only      just celebrity,
but a certain masterly power which he           could not have attained with
out such a combination of events.
    Such considerations must be present to our minds                 if  we would
form a correct estimate of Sir Benjamin Brodie.              He furnishes    a rare
instance of a man who, having in early life had no particular advan
tages on the one hand, nor any great drawbacks                 on the other, ob
tained the highest       place in a learned        profession,   as well    as the
greatest honour      which English Science can bestow on               a scientific
 man — the Presidency of the Royal Society.
    A  brief record of his progress, considered not only as that of an
 adept in science and a master in the noblest of arts, but as a man,
                                          '               '
 will be well worthy    a place  in the     Proceedings     of the Royal Society
 —a    Society which is not only directly concerned in advancing human
 knowledge for its own sake, but indirectly also in interesting the most
 complete minds in the advancement of that knowledge.                  It must set
 a special value    on the example of one who proved to demonstration,
 by a long and admirable career, that devotion to purely scientific
 pursuits, and a deep interest in all that concerns scientific progress,
 may coexist with eminent professional skill, with a philanthropic
 spirit, and an enlarged religious mind.
    Benjamin Collins Brodie was born in the year            1 783, at Winterslow,
 in the county of Wilts.        His father     was Rector    of the parish.     He
 had three brothers and two sisters, being himself the fourth child.
 His father was a man of energy and ability, and brought both to
 bear on the education of his children, in whose well-being he took
 the deepest     interest.    He instructed       them himself;       by his own
 example he trained up his children           in habits of industry ; above all
  he taught them in many ways from their earliest years to think and

                                     xliv
 act for themselves.      Sir Benjamin would often           state the great ad
 vantage he had derived from being called upon at the age               of sixteen
 to join in managing a volunteer corps at the period of the first anti
 cipated French invasion in 1798.         The difficulties of communication,
 and the whole condition        of the country,       made such a task more
 arduous, and therefore more instructive,           than a young man would
find it at this day.
     But this occupation      did   not   distract    him   from   those studies
which     there has been a tendency of late years to decry.               In after
 life he often looked     back with satisfaction         to the labour    he had
 bestowed on committing          to memory passages           of the Greek and
 Latin authors, and of our own chief poets             ;  he would   tell how, in
long professional journeys, before the days of railroads, he had been
cheered by the recital of them          ; and he would point out how he
believed the imaginative faculty, so essential to any great artist, be
his art what    it may, had   been disciplined     as well as fostered by early
industry in ordinary classical studies.
     Being naturally, or from a sense of duty, a studious boy, he, of his
own accord, amassed,       in leisure hours spent in his father's library,
 a  great variety of knowledge ; and he even then acquired a taste for
those psychological      speculations which      shed a genial glow ever his
later days, when the labour of life was over and when his mind dwelt
with    serene   delight on the contemplation of those higher qualities
which are the peculiar property of man, and which are strengthened
 or impaired according to the use made of them by each possessor.
     Thus prepared, in the autumn of 1801 our future President en
tered such a school of medicine as sixty years ago London afforded.
He had no special predilection for either medicine or physical
science.    The arrangements of his family, rather than an active choice,
led him to adopt his father's suggestions as to his future profession.
 He had already acquired a taste for work as such, he knew that he
had to strive for his own maintenance, and forthwith betook himself
with rational    zeal to the selected study.        Had his lot    engaged    him
in the study of     some other    subject-matter than medicine, that other
subject would      assuredly have been       equally mastered by the same
steady grasp, and elucidated by the same clear mind.
    It is not easy for one conversant only with the existing appliances
for medical instruction to appreciate the circumstances of a lad who

                                            xlv
was sent to walk the hospitals             in 1801.       At present the work of          a
student is regulated, or over-regulated                — is divided into many       sub
jects, so many lectures being assigned to each.               There is the first year's
work and the second year's work, under an arrangement so systematic
that the young student, whatever be his capacities or his previous
training, is allowed only to join the stream, and therein is hurried
on too fast   if slow
                   of apprehension, or wearied by useless attendances
if   quick beyond the average.   The freest scope was then given to
the able and well-disposed        — too     free by far for the careless       or disso
lute. Brodie, nurtured hitherto only by his father's polished care, the
companion of the Rector's walks, the popular subaltern of a volunteer
corps in a county far from the metropolis,                   reaches   London, and is
thrown    at once upon opportunities              so ruinous to some, so good        for
him.     He       without good advice as to his future course. Dr.
              was not
Denman, Dr. Baillie, and Sir Richard Croft, eminent and admirable
men, were connected with his family by marriage.                       He    was sent to
Abernethy's lectures on anatomy.                  If   in these lectures details were
absent, the deficiency was compensated for tenfold by the genius and
heart of the man.          Abernethy        gave    to his pupils what the living
teacher can best give, a living interest in their work.                     The Student
was fascinated. He determined on following the profession recom
mended by the example of that popular Surgeon ; for he found that
he could not be a Physician without a university degree                 ;   and this had
not been provided for him.
     Brodie's character and training               must    have made parts of his
early medical studies irksome,              and some    of his companions dis
tasteful to him — though in this            he only shared the lot of other right-
minded     youths   who     come        from virtuous homes.      Nor can it be
doubted that the shock which he must have experienced sixty years
ago at the low education and unformed habits of mind of some of
his   class companions, helped to implant                 in him that strong,    it may
be said parental        concern in all       that affects      the best interests of
medical students, which characterized him up to the last days of his
long and active life.       It   is,   however, true that, devoted, as his subse
quent career proves, to his purely professional studies, he was not
dependent on the medical school for his companions.                His literary
tastes did not desert him.              He studied in this year the writings of
various masters in mental philosophy               —of Dugald      Stewart, Berkeley,

                                     xlri
Locke.       He belonged     to a literary    debating     Society,    of which
Lord Campbell, then young, was also a member ; and as                 evidence of
the subjects there occupying his mind, it may be stated that he read
essays on the advantages to be derived from metaphysical inquiries, and
on the supposed modern discoveries which are to be found forestalled
in Pliny's ' Natural History.'       This comprehensive view of the sub
jects, both proper and useful in the formation of a large professional
 mind, was never altered.       In the most active period of his life he is
 known to have examined, with care and interest, the scientific papers
 in the early volumes of the ' Transactions
                                                  '
                                                    of this Society    ; and still
 later to have increased his acquaintance with the older medical and
 surgical writers.
     In this year and the following he dissected at Wilson's School of
 Anatomy,     worked at pharmacy in the open shop of an apothecary,
 and did not enter St. George's Hospital       till 1803.
     At  the Hospital the     youth immediately ripened into the man.
  Though    he would   even then look   wistfully    at literary pursuits, and
  kept up constant intercourse with literary men, he here first learned
  to apply the mental instrument, which hitherto he had only whetted,
  to the material on which for half a century it was henceforward                to
  work.    He first watched his teachers     as they played before him the
  solemn and weighty game of Therapeutics,          " life                        "
                                                           being the stakes     ;
  and then, unceasingly in the wards, he studied by himself with avidity
  the accidents and injuries to the human frame which he had pledged
  himself henceforward to strive to alleviate or avert.            He wrote full
  notes of what he observed.        They who know his          terse mode   of ex
  pression, know how clearly he thought, how exactly, how simply he
  recorded what is essential,    and how he discarded everything           that is
  irrelevant.
      Though   so intent on clinical  study, his well-poised mind did not
  relax its hold on scientific work.      He  seized now the opportunity          of
  teaching    anatomy, and     continued   for many years to employ his
  powers in this manner.      He attended few lectures       ;   there were, hap
  pily for him, few to attend.      He read few professional books ; there
   were not    many worth     study.    He dissected, observed, recorded,
   taught.    He worked at anatomy for and with Sir Everard Home, not
  only as it bore on surgical practice, but as a science, pursuing it (as
  Hunter had done) into higher physiological questions, and into the

                                      xlvii
comparison      of organ and function        throughout    the animal     series.
Here he received much help from Mr. Clift, the faithful and excellent
Conservator of Hunter's preparations.
    It  was about 1806     that his connexion with the Fellows            of the
Royal Society may be said to have begun. Through Home he made
the acquaintance of Sir Joseph Banks, and (as the few who remember
the liberality and kindness of that illustrious and useful man will well
understand) met in his society the galaxy of scientific persons who
early in this century flocked daily to his residence in Soho Square.
In after days he used to refer to the advantage he had derived from
his early acquaintance with Davy, Hatchett, Wollaston, Brown (the
botanist), Dryander, Dr. Young, and others.              He had been always
shy, and was still nervous     ; modest, yet not without ambition       :  as he
listened to the discourse of these men, and admired the consummate
fitness of Sir Joseph Banks for his high station, he probably little
thought that he would himself be called upon at a future day to occupy
the same distinguished       post.  J
    By these   several means he thus early gained a complete apprecia
tion of what was needed        to understand     the nature of the diseases
which oppress mankind, of the relative importance of clinical obser
vation, pure science, and philosophical culture, in procuring allevia
tion of physical    suffering.    One can imagine the sadness, the almost
bitterness of spirit which a man so disciplined          in youth must have
felt when, full of years and rich in vast experience, he felt himself
 called upon to leave as one of his last legacies to his countrymen
 his manly answer* to some of the ill- grounded fallacies which fashion
supports under the guise of medicine improved and reformed.
     In 1808, at the   age  of not quite twenty-five, he     became Assistant
 Surgeon to St. George's Hospital        ;  and he continued in the direct
 service  of the hospital for full thirty years. The absence of one of
 his seniors at once threw the charge of many in-patients on his
 hands.     On these he bestowed the most assiduous         care, and lectured
 on the most important cases.         He had declined on     a former occasion
 to give lectures on surgery, because he could have only given second
 hand, or book knowledge.          But he now      was able to draw his pic
 tures from the life     ; he began    not only to lecture in the hospital

clinically,   but,    with Mr. Wilson,              in Windmill      Street,   to teach
systematic surgery         ;   and he continued to do so for nearly twenty
years.      His mode of instruction               was   then more peculiar       than it
would be now.          His object        was,    as  Abernethy's had been, not to
gain applause, but to           teach the pupils.        He found this could not be
done by reading out his lectures               ;  and he soon accustomed himself,
as  all great teachers           do,  to pour     forth his knowledge, previously
arranged and digested it is true, but flowing at the moment sponta
neously and unconstrained.
    At this time (1810) his Anatomical                   Lectures   became     more fre
quent   ;   and he was engaged              in preparing      his  work    for the day
following till three or four in the morning. When not so engaged,
he sought instruction and recreation with his literary and other
friends   ;  and,   strange as it may seem to those who do not see the
bearing of scientific           study on practical       work, he continued his re
searches     on philosophical          anatomy with Clift and Home.              He also
undertook some original physiological                  investigations,   the results   of
which were communicated                  to   the Royal Society, he having been
elected a Fellow in 1810.                   The object of these communications
deserves consideration.              It has been remarked that it is an instinct of
genius not only to suggest what work can, but what work cannot be
attempted with advantage, — in other words, that intellectual efforts
are not made by great minds except in cases when they                      will succeed.
Brodie's physiological            researches     "On   the Influence of the Brain on
the Action of the Heart, and on the Generation of Animal Heat,"
were made in      1 8 1 1,   fifty  years before his death.       His mind    was keenly
alive, as we have seen, to the value of purely scientific research, without
any regard to the immediate utility (so called) of the inquiry.                       On
the other hand, the relief of suffering and the prevention of disease
were    the cynosure of his life.                The four important       essays   which
appear in our Transactions — viz., the                 one  just alluded to, with its
sequel    (published in 1812), and two on the                "Mode in which Death
is produced by certain Poisons" (one printed in                    181 1 and the other
in 1812) — all give a clue to the large views of the young surgeon.
He goes straight to the cardinal points to be noted in the apparatus
for the maintenance of life, and inquires into some of the crucial
instances in which death is rapidly produced. The mutual relation
between the nervous system, which                     is the    organic   differentia  of

                                             xlix
  animals, and the circulatory            apparatus which gives the basic condi
 tions of nutrition in the higher animals, occupy his mind in the first
 two Essays.          In the    second    he was aiming at the solution of one
 part of the question of questions for physiologists,               how poisons ope
 rate on vital organs so as to produce death.                 These, his first papers,
 were composed with great clearness,              and based on well-devised expe
 riments.      They do not exhaust subjects then only opening                 ;   for they
 have both been carried forward by various able inquirers in the half
 century     that has now elapsed since he wrote them.                      But Brodie
 proved the correctness of the opinion advanced by Bichat and Cruick-
 shank, that the cessation of the heart's action depends,                  not directly
 on abstraction of the influence of the brain, but on the cessation                      of
 respiration    ;   and he showed that, to some extent (though                    to what
 extent and in what way is not even now certain), the maintenance
 of animal heat is under the influence of the nervous system.                         The
 most important         of his experiments        on poisons were those which he
 made     with the Woorara.         They showed that the poison       is first absorbed
 through the blood-vessels, and so acts on the nervous system                   ;  that in
 consequence of the paralysis thence ensuing, the respiratory organs
 cease to act     ;  and that the failure of respiration leads to cessation of
the heart's action, and suppression of the circulation.                Accordingly it
was further shown that          if respiration  be artificiallyperformed,       the heart
will continue       to act, and the blood to circulate ; and that        if the process
be carried on for a sufficient           length of time, in some instances the
brain will recover, and life will be maintained without perceptible
impairment.
    Brodie appears         also   to have    been    the   first to  show that         the
Antiar poison of Java operates by primarily arresting the action of
the heart, and that it thus offers a remarkable contrast to the class
of poisons to which the Woorara belongs.
   The Copley Medal was awarded to Mr. Brodie for the former                           set
of observations in the year 1811.
    It  is noteworthy       that at this period he was an active member of
two small societies,          to one of which,      the Animal Chemistry Club,
Humphry Davy belonged, while of the other, the Society for the
Promotion of Medical and Chirurgical Knowledge, John Hunter had
been one     of the original members. He began about this period to
be a   frequent visitor at Holland House; and he has often been heard to
   vol. xii.                                                                d

speak   of the benefit he had derived from the society of the great
statesmen, literary men, artists, and other eminent persons whom he
there met.
   In the year 1813 he delivered the Croonian Lecture             on the effect
of the Nerves    on the  Heart and on the involuntary         Muscles.     With
characteristic   modesty and his usual thoroughness             of purpose, he
requested that, as the subject required further inquiry, it might not
be printed.      His mind was still bent on the significance of the
higher vital phenomena in animals         ; for in the following year (1814)
another paper was printed in our Transactions, " On the Influence of
the Nerves    of the Eighth Pair on the Secretions of the Stomach."
   In 1816 he instituted experiments on animals to determine the
effect of the bile on chylification.      His conclusion, that it is essential
to that process, has been since disputed ; but it is still probable
that the earlier investigator     was as near to the truth as his critics.
He afterwards lectured on Comparative Anatomy for four years at
the College of Surgeons,       from 1819 to 1823, bringing to bear the
stores  of knowledge he had previously acquired when working with
Mr. Clift and Sir Everard Home.
   With these last lectures his active physiological studies must              be
considered to have closed.        But   so trained was he     in scientific pur
suits, that his eager interest in anatomical and physiological         questions,
and in the philosophy     of his art, never left him.
   Henceforward      not only his duties at St. George's Hospital, and to
private patients, but also his inclination      led him to devote his whole
powers of investigation to those alterations in the living body which
constitute disease.     The unsatisfactory      state of surgical knowledge,
and therefore of practice, in regard to affections of the joints, attracted
his attention, and he at once hit on a principle which was a guiding
maxim to him in after life.        Finding how little could be made out
of  a disease  by dissection of the parts where organic alteration was
far advanced, he used to examine the joints of those who had died
of other   diseases,  in order to find the first traces of future injury.
At the end of two years' assiduous inquiry, for which he had great
opportunities,    he felt at liberty     to communicate       to the Medico-
Chirurgical Society some observations on the question*.                 To these
he added in the following year +. These papers form the basis of
           * Med. Chir. Trans, vol. iv.                f Ibid. vol. v.

                                        li
 his invaluable work on Diseases of the Joints.               His nice discrimi
nation of the tissues affected,       and of the exact value of pain in the
joints as evidence of organic disease, has altogether altered the prac
 tice in such cases, and has tended greatly to reduce the number of
 amputations.        What  a reflection for a man at the close     of life !
    To pursue further the details of his active professional life belongs
 to the purely Medical biographer.             Here it need only be said that
 he published, besides the work on Diseases of the Joints, three other
                                                                         '
 surgical volumes, and contributed numerous papers to the Trans
 actions of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society,' and that he
 did not     cease to lecture on surgery at St. George's         Hospital, with
 more or less frequency,       till 1843, his instruction    being sought with
 avidity, for it was simple and drawn from the life.            None who heard
 him can forget the graphic, yet artless, manner in which, sitting at his
 ease, he used to describe minutely what he had himself seen and done
 under circumstances of difficulty,        and what under like circumstances
 he would again do, or would avoid.           His instructions were illustrated
 by valuable pathological         dissections which during many years he
 had amassed,      and which he gave during his lifetime to his Hospital.
    The threefold character of scientific man, author, and surgeon,
 thus early formed, was maintained          till his sight failed shortly before
 his death.      A  few words must be said on his qualities in each respect.
     As  a scientific man his several works were marked by distinctness
 of purpose, adaptation of        means to end, and      rigid determination to
 conclude no more than observation completely justified.               His rela
 tions to other scientific men may be best understood by recalling the
 just, courteous,    and candid manner     in which   he conducted the business
 of the various societies whenever he was called upon to preside, and
 the lucidity with which he kept the main points before a meeting.
 He always advocated and supported open discussion, and in this way
 did good service to the Royal Society.
     As  an author, he was not voluminous          ; nor did he speak much in
 public.      He discarded all arts of style, aiming solely at precision and
 brevity   :  he wrote as he spoke, only when duty called, or when there
 was something which he believed he could write or say well.                  He
 was    well versed in the literature        of his profession and of those
 sciences    which interested him     ; but he had not much love for books
  as instructors   in his calling,  because    he knew that observation and
                                                                   dl

                                      lii
reflection were of more service than reading for the formation         of the
scientific mind, and original knowledge more valuable than that which
is secondhand.     He himself    used books and so advised younger men
to use them rather to gain the knowledge        of what had   been done, and
as an aid towards actual observation       and reflection, than thereby to
educate themselves.    His belief that observation, practice, and thought
are  the chiefest means for self-training in science partly accounts for
the brevity of his published works, and greatly enhances their value.
   As  a surgeon, he was remarkable from early life for the scrupulous
care which he bestowed on the investigation        of the cases entrusted to
him.     This obtained for him in   a few years rare quickness as well as
precision in the formation of his opinion.       When Sir Astley Cooper's
practice declined, he was for many years extensively called upon to
act as an operator.      He excelled in that department of his art            ;
for he had every requisite for success     — knowledge,   coolness,   and the
quick imagination which prepares for almost all possible emergencies
that can occur, and suggests at once expedients when any come             un
foreseen.    He did not, however, give the highest place to this part
of his professional duties ; for, in an occupation in which intellectual
power and practical     skill are combined, he valued those parts the
most in which the most intellectual power is evoked.            At the  same
time he was ready and ingenious in mechanical contrivances, and had
the neatness and the method so requisite for a good surgeon.           It was
characteristic of his mind, that, among     a few valuable lectures on some
important subjects which he collected into a volume, he has given a
place to one on Corns and Bunions         — showing that in his judgment
a small evil which    can produce    great annoyance requires as much
consideration in its turn as more serious disorders.        In truth,  as the
great aim of his life was to prevent or to cure disease, that which was
curable, though trifling, would in one sense attract his notice more
than that which was already irremediable.        At the same   time his diffi
culty in coming to the conclusion that there was nothing to be done,
in even the gravest case, was a marked feature in his hopeful mind.
   But the character of Brodie can        be only properly   considered as a
whole.     Neither  as scientific  man, nor as surgeon, nor as author
was he so remarkable as he appears when viewed as he was — a com
plete man necessarily engaged in various callings.        It  was impossible
to see him acting in any capacity without instinctively          feeling that

                                          liii
  there he would do his duty,           and do      it well.      Nor could he be
  imagined in a false position.         A    gentleman, according to his own
  definition of that word,     " he  did to others that which he would desire
  to be done to him, respecting them as he respected              himself."      Simple
  in his manners, he gained confidence at once               ;  accustomed to mix
  with the poorest in the hospital and with the noblest in their private
  abodes, he sympathized with the better qualities of each — valued all,
 and despised nothing but moral meanness.                Though      as a  boy he was
  retiring and modest, he was happy in the company of older persons,
 and, as he grew older, loved in his turn to help the young.                   " I hear
 you are ill," he wrote once in the zenith of his life to a hospital
 student of whom he did not then know much                    ;
                                                                 " no   one   will take
 better care of you than       I;  come    to my country         house    till you are
 well
          "  aud the student stayed there two months.               He
        ;                                                                was   thought
  by some      reserved — he   was   modest;      by others hasty — he valued
 time, and could not give to trifles that which belonged to real suffer
 ing  ;   he was sometimes thought impatient, when his quick glance had
already told him more than the patient could either describe or under
 stand.      Unconscious of self, of strong common sense, confident of his
 ground or not entering thereon, seeing             in every direction, modest,
just, sympathetic, he lived for      one  great end — the lessening of disease.
 For this object no labour        was   too    great, no patience too long, no
 science    too difficult.    He felt indeed (to      use his own words on the
 day of his election as President)
                                            " his  happiness to be in a life of
 Exertion."         As a professional man he valued science because it so
often points the way to that which is practically useful to man                   ; but
as a scientific man his one object was the            Truth, which he pursued
for its own sake wholly irrespective of any other reward which might
or might not follow on discovery.              He had not the common faults of
common men, for he had not their objects, nor their instinct for ease,
nor their prejudices       : though he became         rich, he had not unduly
sought      riches   ; though  he was greatly        distinguished,      he had not
desired fame      ;  he was beloved, not having courted popularity.              What
he was himself, that he allowed other men to be,                till he found them
otherwise.        He   saw weak points in his profession, but he saw them
as the debris from the mountains             of knowledge and of wisdom, of
benevolence and of self-denial, of old traditional              skill  ever growing
and always purifying, — those eternal structures on which are founded

                                       liv
true Surgery and Medicine.        If  ever he was bitter     in society, it  was
when they were undervalued ;       if  ever sarcastic,  it was when the igno
rant dared assume to judge them.
   A light   is thus thrown     on his even career      of uniform progress.
Training his powers from youth upwards, by linguistic and literary
studies, by scientific pursuits, by the diligent practice of his art, by
mixing with men, he brought to bear on the multifarious questions
which come before a great master of healing, a mind alike accus
tomed to acquire and to communicate,              a temper made gentle        by
considerate    kindness,   a tact  that became       all but unerring      from
his perfect integrity.     He  saw that every material science        conduces
to the well-being    of man  ; he would countenance all, and yet be dis
tracted by none.      He knew the value of worldly influence, of rank,
of station when rightly used ; he sought none, deferred excessively
to none ; but he respected all who, having them, used them wisely,
and accepted what came to himself unasked, gave his own freely
to all who needed, and sought help from no one but for public ends.
 . A  few words only may be added on the inner life of his later days.
Those who       knew   him   only   as   a   man   of business would       little
 suspect the playful humour which sparkled by his fireside — the
fund of anecdote, the harmless wit— the simple pleasures of his
 country walk.      Some, who knew these,         might not have imagined
another and deeper current which          flowed unheard when neither the
care of his patients nor his literary pursuits         or memories engaged
his mind.      He who from his early professional life sat down every
night, his work ended, his notes entered, his next day ordered, to
ask what could have been better done today and what case other
wise managed, was not one to reach threescore years and ten with
 out a keen onward gaze on the entire destiny         of man.     Yet   he who
realized in his profession the answer of Trophilus the Ephesian to the
 question, Who is a perfect physician?     — "he who distinguishes between
 what can and what cannot be
                                            "
                                     done — such a man would not           dog
 matize on what cannot be known, nor would he, so humble, attempt
to scan the Infinite.     But his nature yearned for some better thing
to come  ;  and yearning, it became satisfied.        He had for many years
thought    and conversed among his friends on facts he had noted in
relation to our mental organization.          In the year 1854, he published
anonymously       a  volume    on   Psychological     Inquiries.     This    was

                                          lv
followed   by a second, with his name, in 1862.                  These volumes
contain little that is actually new to professed psychologists ; but
they are the conclusions of one who had thought and worked                         —
variously,   consistently,     practically.     Living not in the closet, but
hearing the     opinions of every party and of every kind                of men —
liberal in all his views — without prejudice,           and ever open to con
viction, yet tinged with a general dislike to change as such, — he tells
in  these volumes what he had concluded concerning the mind                  of man
— its laws, its discipline, its future       state.   They therefore who value
such a character will prize these writings for qualities               other than
the novelties they may contain.              It  will  be remembered that         the
scientific inquiries     of his early life related to the influence of the
nervous system on certain parts of the animal economy.                      To the
ordinary   physiologist      this may    be a purely      material question     ;  to
him it was not     so.    In  middle life he said to a friend, speaking of his
lectures on the Comparative Anatomy of the Brain,               " the   complexity
of the mechanism of the higher brains is enough to make                  one  giddy
to think of   it."     A fortnight    before his death he talked to the same
person of this mysterious         link between our consciousness and our
visible material organization,        descanting with keen interest on the
relations between mind         and body, and the mutual reactions of one
on the other.      As   he then lay on his sofa almost        for the last time,
in great pain, having scarce for many months               seen the outer world
which had    been so much to him, and to which he had been so much,
he spoke freely of our ignorance as to many things which               it would    be
a joy to know — of the existence of evil— of the             too  little attention
which philosophers had paid to the terrible nature of physical pain —
of the future     state.    So gathering up the teachings of his useful
life, and still, as ever, looking forward, he waited its close.                 Not
many days after this he breathed his last, at Broome                     Park, on
October 21, 1862, in possession of the full calm power of his dis
ciplined mind to within a few hours of his death.
    Such was our late President.          They who knew and honoured him
may excuse, while they accept, a delineation             too feeble for so com
plete a man.        In the quality of his miud he was not unlike the
most eminent of his contemporaries,               Arthur Duke of Wellington.
Those    who    did not     know     him,   and who      do not appreciate the
power requisite to make such a master in medicine as he was, may

                                         lvi
   be surprised at the comparison.        Yet our great soldier might have
   accepted the illustration without dissatisfaction.               Whatever    art
   Brodie undertook,     if  he has been     correctly    drawn, he would have
   entirely   mastered.     The self-discipline of the strongest man can
   effect no more.     The care with which the two men compassed every
   detail and surveyed every bearing of       a  large question, the quiet good
   sense, the steadiness    of purpose, the readiness of wide professional
   knowledge in critical emergencies, were in each mind alike.                 The
   public and his profession esteemed Brodie as the first in his art.
   He advised three successive Sovereigns, and from one had the only
   other mark of esteem which a Sovereign can bestow — a Title.                 He
   was made a Corresponding       Member of the French Institute in 1844,
   and received the Honorary Diploma in Civil Law from the University
   of Oxford in 1855.       He   was elected the President      of the Royal So
   ciety in 1858, and became the first President of the Medical Council
   under the Act for regulating the Education and Registration of the
   Medical Profession    ;  but he resigned both offices in two years, on
  account of the advancing failure of his eyes.
      It remains to be recorded that in 1816           Mr. Brodie married the
   daughter of Serjeant Sellon, and survived her two years.              By her he
  had issue two sons and a daughter.          Of   these, the eldest, the present
  possessor of the Baronetcy, like his father, received early in life one
  of the Medals of the Royal Society, and is now the distinguished
  Professor of Chemistry in the University of Oxford.
N
      Francesco Carlini         was born in     Milan on the 7th of January
   1783.     His father, Carlo Giuseppe Carlini, a native of Cremona, was
  one of the librarians of the Brera, and was eminent as a Bibliographer.
  He died in    1 789. His ancestors   came,   it is said, from Linz in Austria.
     At   an early age   Francesco Carlini manifested a taste for astro
  nomy,     and was in     the habit   of making        calculations   for Oriani,
  Reggio, and Cesaris, the astronomers of the Brera.              In 1 799 he was
  admitted to the Observatory as a pupil, was appointed one of the
  commissioners of weights        and weasures      for the kingdom       of Italy
  soon afterwards, and in 1804 was promoted               to the rank of super
  numerary astronomer.         In  1803 he made       observations of Pallas in
  opposition,     and continued    his observations of this and the other
  small planets up to 1816.        Between    1814    and 1818 he constructed

                                        lvii
tables of the equation of the centre, and the reduction to the ecliptic,
of all the small planets then discovered. In 1804 he undertook the
sole charge of calculating the Effemeridi Astronomiche, pronounced
by Lindcnau and Bohnenberger, in 1816, to be the best ephemeris in
existence at that time.        From    1802   to 1807 he took a share in the
geodesic operations required for the construction of a map of Lom-
bardy.     These were carried on from        1 788  to  1 807 by the astronomers
of the Brcra, and afterwards by the French engineers.
   A careful examination of the solar tables of Delambre,                 made in
order to   ascertain their fitness for    use    in calculating the Effemeridi,
having revealed some        serious errors, Carlini was induced to under
take a revision of them.          Retaining the constants which Delambre
had deduced from the observations of Bradley and Maskelyne, he
recalculated the tables by a method of his own.                 In  1832 he pub
lished a new edition of the tables, based upon newer and more accu
rate elements.      These tables were used           till very recently for the
calculation of the sun's place in the most celebrated Ephemerides.
   Laplace, dissatisfied with the semiempirical              basis on which the
                                                                     '
lunar   theory rested, even after the publication of the Mecanique
Celeste,' suggested to the Institute, as the subject of the prize for
1820, the formation        of lunar tables, by theory alone,         as exact as
those which    up to that time had been constructed by theory and
observation combined.         As far back       as  in  18 13 Plana and Carlini
had resolved to construct       a  complete theory of the moon, subjecting
all the inequalities to the laws of geometry, and had made consider
able progress in their task, when the announcement of the programme
of the Institute induced them        to compete for the prize by sending       in
the results they had already obtained.              By the decision of     a com
mission, consisting      of Laplace,    Burkhardt, and Poisson, the prize
was  divided between Plana and Carlini, and Damoiseau.                  The prin
ciple on which their joint memoir rested,                and which    rendered  it
superior to all researches     of earlier and many of later date, was this        :
— never   to take from observation any constants that were not indis
pensably necessary      for the solution of the problem.           They adhered
most rigorously      to   this   condition,    without which       the analytical
solution   cannot be      perfect.    In the development of the various
expressions in series,      they retained      the literal notation, giving an
algebraical, not a numerical solution.         This memoir     was not published

                                      lviii
at the time  :   afterwards  Plana resumed it        alone,  developed    it more
completely, and published        it in 1832, under the title        " Theorie   du
Mouvement       de la   Lune," in three volumes quarto,           a work    which
forms an epoch in the history       of astronomy. In       1820 they published
a joint memoir in reply to some objections to their theory raised by
Laplace — and another on the lunar equation, having for its argument
twice the difference between the longitude of the node and that of
the   perigee.     Carlini next undertook        the    construction    of lunar
tables.    These have been used up to the present time in computing
the places of the moon for the Effemeridi         di Milano.       He afterwards
investigated     various  points   of the lunar         theory,   especially   the
remarkable     inequality of the moon's mean motion, indicated                by a
comparison     of ancient and modern observations, and produced,                as
Hansen proved in 1847, by the disturbing action of Venus.                  Of his
" Algoritmo     del calcolo delle perturbazioni      lunari," intended      as the
commencement of a complete lunar theory, only the first chapter ap
peared in the 5th volume of the memoirs of the Istituto Lombardo.
   Carlini's principal contributions to practical astronomy are: —
"Tables of astronomical         refraction"     (1807);      "Computation of
occultation of stars by the moon" (1808) ;             "Tables for the reduc
tion of circummeridian altitudes," (1809); "Tables                for calculating
the coefficient of the square of the time in the precession of stars"
(1819). He invented a method of finding the time and latitude by
means of a telescope provided with a level and a micrometer, and
applied  it in Spain, where      he went by order        of the Government to
observe   the eclipse of the sun on the 18th of         July, 1860.
   Between 1821 and 1827 Carlini assisted             in the measurement of
the Italian portion of an arc of longitude extending from Bordeaux
to the Adriatic.      He made the requisite astronomical observations
on the summit       of Mont Colombier       ; determined the length of the
seconds' pendulum on Mont Cenis           ;  observed from Parma the gun
powder signals fired on Monte Cimone, and from Milan those fired
on the summit of Monte Baldo.               He also determined        anew,   with
the aid of better instruments and improved methods of calculation,
the latitudes    of Mondovi and Andrate, the extremities of the arc
measured by Beccaria.        He found the sum of the deviations of the
plumb-line    to be about 48", and thus           confirmed     the accuracy     of
Beccaria' s observations.

                                       lix
    On the death of Angelo de Cesaris in 1832, Carlini was appointed
Director of the Observatory of the Brera.            He was a good analyst,
understood     five   modern    languages,     was  the    author    of various
scientific biographies, and was one of the editors of the Biblioteca'
Italiana' from 1826 to 1840.
    The list of his writings appended         to the notice   of his life read
before the Istituto Lombardo contains one hundred               and forty-four
titles.   Most of    these, exclusive   of separate works, are to be found
                                                                            '

Bohnenberger.
    Carlini presided     for  many years      over the Istituto     Lombardo-
Veneto, afterwards the Istituto Lombardo,          and was a member of the
principal Italian Academies.        He was foreign member of the Insti
tute, of the Astronomical Society, and of the Academies of Vienna,
Gottingen, and Berlin.        The  date  of his election   as foreign member
of the Royal Society is 1832.
    In 1832 Carlini married Gabriella          Sabatelli, the daughter of an
eminent artist.      She survives him.      He was amiable in private life,
and of spotless character.        He remained free from infirmity, either
bodily or mental, up to the age of nearly eighty years, and was able
to compute the elements of the second comet of 1862 only a month
before his death, which occurred, after a short but painful                 illness,
at Crodo    in Ossola, on the 29th of August 1862.              The foregoing
particulars of his life and labours are extracted from a biographical
notice read before the R. Istituto Lombardo,           on the 8th December
1862, by his successor as Director of the Observatory of the Brera,
G. V. Schiaparelli.
    James Ormiston M 'William, M.D.,               was a native    of Dalkeith
in Scotland, and     was   educated in Edinburgh, where he obtained his
medical degree      from the University, and the diploma of Licentiate
from the Royal College of Surgeons.           In 1829 he entered the          Navy,
and, after serving for a time on a foreign station, attained the rank

    of Surgeon, and     was   appointed    to   H. M.S. 'Scout,' stationed on
    the west coast of Africa.       On that unhealthy station,       so trying to
    young    naval surgeons, he devoted himself most earnestly to his
    duties, and obtained the distinction of the Gold Medal instituted by
    the late Sir Gilbert Blanc for special merit in the medical service of
   the navy.
       On returning    to  England, after the ship's term of service had
   expired, Dr.    M'William took advantage of his temporary liberation
   from duty to improve himself in professional            and scientific know
   ledge, and more especially to make himself well acquainted with the
   principles   and practical   methods of ventilation, heating, and other
  arrangements for the preservation of health.           This   species of know
  ledge, together with the information         he had acquired on the coast     of
  Africa, peculiarly qualified him to superintend the fitting up of the
  three ships which       were destined to proceed on a voyage up the
 Niger.       His sound judgment,      intrepid    character,  and medical ex
 perience of a tropical African climate, had already led to his being
 appointed chief medical officer of the Expedition.
      This Expedition was undertaken by benevolent individuals, sup
 ported by a considerable Government             grant,   to plant   an  English
 colony in Central Africa, and to promote              agriculture   and honest
 trade among the natives, in the hope thereby to reclaim them from
 trafficking in slaves.     The chief incidents of the ill-fated voyage are
 well known.        In the summer of 1841 the three ships proceeded to
 the African coast,       under   the command of Captain           Trotter, and,
 ascending one of the mouths of the Niger, reached the confluence of
 that river with the Chadda,         270 miles from the sea; but in the
 mean     time malignant    fever had broken       out in the ships, and in a
 short time had prostrated both officers and crews to such an extent
 that first one of the vessels, and soon afterwards another, had to be
 sent back freighted with the sick       of the expedition.      The remaining
              '
ship, the Albert,' of which Dr. M'William was surgeon, continued
her voyage fifty or sixty miles higher up the river, in the hope              of
reaching some less unhealthy region          ; but the sickness did not abate,
some     of the ship's company had died, and many more, including the
commander and most of the officers, were lying helpless under the
malady     ;  so that Captain   Trotter, confirmed     as he was in his    judg
ment by Dr. M'William,          determined to abandon the enterprise, and

                                       hi
the  'Albert' followed her consorts back to the sea. By this time
only two officers, Dr. M'William and Dr. Stanger, and one of the
European seamen were left able for service.              In this plight the
return voyage was commenced, and, the one remaining sailor having
also fallen ill, the navigation of the ship was left to the two medical
officers, Stanger acting as engineer and         M'William     as steersman   ;
and by their good management and gallant perseverance             she reached
the sea in safety.
   After his return home, in 1842, Dr. M'William published the
' Medical
             History of the Niger Expedition,' which was well re
ceived  ;  and some time afterwards he was sent on a special mission
to the Cape de Verde        Islands,   to inquire   into the origin     of the
yellow fever which       had   broken   out  at Boa Vista soon       after the
arrival of the    'Eclair.'    After  a most laborious     investigation,  Dr.
M'William      gave in to the authorities     an able Report,    in which   he
clearly established that the disease was communicable by infection,
and had been imported by the ' Eclair.' This report was printed by
order of Parliament.
   In rather tardy recognition of his public services, Dr. M'William
was in 1846 appointed Medical Officer to the Custom House, and in
 1858 was made a Companion           of the Civil Order of the Bath.       He
was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1848, and a Fellow of
the Royal College of Physicians          in 1861.    He   was a most active
member and promoter of the Epidemiological              Society, of which he
 was Secretary, and to which he contributed          many valuable papers.
As   a naval medical   officer he was highly esteemed        by his brethren,
not only for his professional merit, but for his unceasing efforts to
secure    for them, and particularly for the junior members of the
service, a rank and       position   more in accordance with the social
standing of the medical profession in civil life.
   Dr. M'William's     active and useful career was terminated on the
4th of May 1862, in consequence          of an  injury of the brain, caused
by a fall down a steep stair a few days before.
    Rear-Admiral    Sir James Clark          Ross   was   born in 1800, and
died in   April 1862. The incidents in the life of this great navigator
and excellent man would doubtless furnish           abundant    matter for an
interesting narrative  ;  but here we must be contented with little more

                                        brii
than a bare indication      of dates.     In 1812 James Ross entered      as a
                on board the   '
midshipman                       Briseis,' commanded by his uncle, Cap
tain (afterwards Sir   John) Ross.       In 1818 he accompanied his uncle
in his first polar voyage, and between 1819 and 1827 he returned
four times to the same seas under Parry. Again he accompanied
his uncle in his Arctic voyages performed between             1829 and 1833.
He conducted the scientific observations in these last-named expedi
tions; and it was while thus employed that he determined the
situation of the North Magnetic Pole, in latitude 70° 5' 17" and west
longitude     96° 45' 48".     In   1834     he was raised to the rank       of
Captain, and in 1835 was sent out to Baffin's           Bay to succour     ice
bound whalers.
    Captain James Ross's skill and experience as a magnetic observer
led to his being employed, between 1836             and 1838, in a series    of
determinations of the magnetic declination and dip, and the intensity
of the magnetic force over Great Britain and Ireland.
    In  1839 he set out on his memorable          Antarctic Expedition ; and
after making three voyages within the Antarctic Circle, reaching
 78° 10' of south latitude, greatly widening the known geography of
the south polar regions, and gathering a rich harvest of observations
in magnetism and other branches of terrestrial physics, he returned
home after an absence of four years.           In 1848 he sailed on the last
of his many arduous voyages. It is well known that the direct
purpose of this voyage — the discovery and relief of Franklin and his
fellow    sufferers — was unhappily not         accomplished,   but its Com
mander did not fail to render it profitable to science.
    Sir James Ross received his knighthood in 1844. King Louis
Philippe nominated him to the Legion of Honour. He was elected
a  Fellow of the Linnean Society in 1824, and of the Royal Society
in 1848.       He was also a Corresponding Member of the French
Academy of Sciences, and belonged to various other foreign societies
of note.
    To this brief notice of the leading          events of Sir James Ross's
professional life,  it will be incumbent      on us to add a larger comment
on his labours and achievements as a man of science             ; but as these
have not yet been fully made known               in their proper place, it is
deemed     advisable that such reference to them as it will be requisite
to make should       be postponed      for the present.     The great work

                                     lxiii
which especially deserves to have its merits prominently           set forth is
his magnetic survey of the Antarctic regions.          This is justly held to
he the greatest work    of the kind     ever   performed, and it was under
taken at the special desire of the Royal Society and the British
Association.    An account of the magnetic observations made by Sir
James Ross in the first and second of the three Antarctic voyages
                           '                                '
was published in the         Philosophical Transactions        by his friend
General Sabine    ;  and it is hoped that the labours of the third voyage
and the coordination of the three years' work will be laid before the
Society in the next session.       The completeness with which the great
and hazardous enterprise was carried out renders a full exposition of
what was accomplished         all the more requisite for a just apprecia
tion of the merits of its gallant and skilful conductor       ;  and the pro
priety of waiting until this has been given will, it is conceived, be
 generally recognized.
    Edward Stanley, Esq.,           Surgeon Extraordinary to the Queen,
 and Surgeon to St. Bartholomew's        Hospital, died suddenly, in one of

 of seventy.
     Mr. Stanley, after receiving his general education at Merchant
Taylors' School, was, in 1808, apprenticed to Mr. Ramsden, at
 that time one of the Surgeons of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, on
 whose death he was transferred         to Mr. Abernethy.       To this great
 master the pupil soon recommended             himself by his   earnestness  in
 study, and especially by his devotion to anatomy and pathology                ;
 and through their joint labours was created the Hospital Museum of
 Morbid Anatomy, to which Mr. Stanley especially contributed many
 preparations illustrative of diseases of the bones and joints.            This
 important   collection  they afterwards liberally presented, as a gift,
 to the Hospital.      Mr. Stanley's acquirements in anatomy, and his
 well-directed zeal in its pursuit,     led to his appointment as Demon
 strator,  and, after holding      that office   for some  years,    he joined
 Mr. Abernethy in     1826 in lecturing    on anatomy and physiology,       and
 continued   to   discharge this duty after the death of his eminent
 colleague, until 1843.       In  the mean time he had been, in 1816,
  elected Assistant   Surgeon,    and twenty-two     years later, Surgeon to
 the Hospital;      and he continued in that office until         1861, when,

                                         lxiv
 although     in good health      and full possession of his faculties,        he
 considerately retired to make way for his juniors, and accepted the
 title of Honorary Consulting           Surgeon offered him as an acknow-
 legment of his past services        and a mark of respect for his honour
 able   motives in resigning      his duties.      In 1858 he     was   appointed
 Surgeon Extraordinary to the Queen.
     Mr. Stanley    entered   the Royal College of Surgeons in 1816;           he
 became an active and industrious           member of the Council and Court
 of Examiners,     served the office   of Hunterian Lecturer,-and       was twice
 elected President.       He    was  of old standing among the Fellows of
 the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society, and successively filled
 the offices of Secretary, Treasurer, and President.            His election into
 the Royal Society was in 1840.
     Mr. Stanley's principal work         is his ' Treatise  on Diseases   of the
 Bones,' which      appeared in 1849.        While Demonstrator of Anatomy
 he published a 'Manual of Practical             Anatomy,' which in its time
 was extensively used in the Anatomical Schools                of this country   ;
 and in 1829 an 'Account           of the Mode of performing the Lateral
 Operation     of Lithotomy.'       He also contributed twelve papers to
 the ' Medico-Chirurgical Transactions.'
     Mr.   James     Walker      was   born in 1781, at Falkirk,        where he
passed    his childhood      and received the rudiments of his education.
He     was   afterwards     sent to    Glasgow,     where    he studied    at the
University and obtained           distinction    in Natural     Philosophy and
Mathematics.         From that University he, in later years, received
the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws.
     In the year 1800 he came to London, and commenced the
profession of Civil Engineer,          under his uncle,      Mr. Ralph Walker,
at that time engaged in the construction             of the West India Docks.
He continued assistant         to his uncle      during    the progress of that
undertaking      and during     the completion       of the East India Docks.
In    1803   he was appointed       Engineer     of the Commercial      and East
India Roads, undertaken in order to open a more direct commu
nication with the Docks and the eastern parts of London.                    These
works were successfully carried out under               his direction,   and now
form    the great route to the extensive suburbs which                 have risen
between London and Blackball.

                                       lxv
    The successful completion        of the East and West India Docks,
and of the communications          leading to these important       depots, ob
tained for  Mr. Walker the appointment of Engineer for the Commer
cial Docks,    which, with all improvements          and enlargements up to
the present time, have been executed from the designs and under
the direction of himself and his partner,         Mr. Burges.
    The satisfactory manner in which these works            were accomplished
led to other appointments        under the public Boards, who, from that
time to the day of his           death,   consulted    Mr. Walker on every
engineering      work    of importance.       His numerous      and   important
labours as a    Civil Engineer, for the last forty years, are well known.
Among the great works with which he was connected, we may
indicate, as especially worthy of note, Vauxhall Bridge, the
 Victoria Bridge over the Clyde             at Glasgow,     the  improvements
 of the river Clyde (which from the death of Mr. Telford up to a
recent date were under Mr. Walker's direction), the great repairs
 of the Caledonian and Crinan Canals, the drainage of the Middle
 Level   by a cut      of thirty miles in length, the coffer-dams and
 river-wall  of the new Houses of Parliament, the Netherton Tunnel
 and other important works carried out by the Birmingham Canal
 Navigation    Company,      the Pier and Harbour of Granton,            the im
 provements     of the Harbour        at   Belfast,  and the Harbour works
 at Dover.      All   these and many others, such as the designs and
 execution    of the Harbours of Refuge             at  Alderney,   Dover,    and
 Harwich, the Tyne Piers,          and the completion        of the Plymouth
 Breakwater,      were   under    the    direction   and   superintendence      of
 Mr. Walker.       To them may       be added, what is perhaps         the most
 lasting   monument       of his skill, the various       Lighthouses      of the
 Corporation     of the Trinity House.        The Bishop Rock Lighthouse,
 on   the   Scilly Islands,    the erection of which was attended with
 peculiar   difficulties   successfully    overcome    by   Mr. Walker, will
 rank with the foremost of the great structures of that class reared
 by Smeaton and by Stevenson.
     Mr. Walker's sound judgment and high character             as an Engineer
 caused him to be frequently consulted by the Corporation                  of the
  City of London on the various engineering works under their
 jurisdiction ; among which may be named the City Sewers, the
  Navigation    of the Thames, and the Thames Embankment.                     The
     vol. xn.                                                        e

                                     lxvi
last-mentioned   work was laid out by        Mr. Walker, and his design
has now been adopted under the designation of        " Walker's line."
   Thus, for more than half    a century, did   Mr. Walker indefatigably
exercise his professional   skill in works of public utility in all parts
of the kingdom — works which have had no mean influence on the
social and commercial progress of the country.
   Mr. Walker    was   elected into    the  Royal Society in 1828 ; he
cooperated with Mr. Telford in establishing the Institution of Civil
Engineers, and succeeded him as President ; and on the institution
of the University of London,        he   was  nominated  in the Charter
among the original members of the Senate .
   In private life  he   was  much     respected ; he died   on the   8th
of October 1862.
