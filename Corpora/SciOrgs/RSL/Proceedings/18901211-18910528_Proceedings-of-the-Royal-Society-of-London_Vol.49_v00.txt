     I. “ On Ellipsoidal Harmonics.”                                  By W. D. NIVEN, F.R.S.
                      Received October 23, 1890.
                                         (Abstract)
   In   the paper, of which the following is an abstract containing
statements    of the principal results arrived at, an attempt has been
made to     develop the subject of ellipsoidal harmonics from their
expressions in Cartesian coordinates.
   The harmonics of the ellipsoid of three unequal axes are <U+FB01>rst
investigated,   as being the most readily dealt with on account of
symmetry and, afterwards, those of the prolate and oblate spheroids
are deduced as particular cases.
   1. It has been found convenient                          to discuss           separately   the forms
which are respectively suitable to the inside and outside                                          of  the
ellipsoid, the former being taken <U+FB01>rst—

    7. The expansion of the reciprocal of the distance between two
points plays an important part in the application of these investiga
tions.      It has therefore been found in ellipsoidal harmonics and
thence, by reduction, in harmonics of the spheroid, circular cylinder,
and paraboloid of revolution, and its application has been brie<U+FB02>y
illustrated in <U+FB01>nding the general term in the expansion of the
potential due to the magnetism induced in an ellipsoid placed in any
<U+FB01>eld of force, and in <U+FB01>nding the electrical capacities of surfaces
inverted from ellipsoids. In the same connexion,          I have also found
the expansion for the potential due to a thin shell bounded by similar
and similarly situated ellipsoids, the density of which varies inversely
as the cube of the distance from a <U+FB01>xed point.

 II.    “Photometric Observations of the Sun and Sky.” By
        WILLIAM BREYNAND.           Communicated       by C. B. CLARKE,
         F.R.S. Received October 30, 1890.
                                  (Abstract)
     1.  The paper begins with a short account of the various papers
 communicated by Sir H. Roscoe, and published in the Transactions
 of the Royal Society.
     2. My observations were made at Dacca, East Bengal, in 1861-66,
 repeated at Milverton, in Somersetshire, during the last two years.
  My <U+FB01>rst experiments were directed to ascertaining the action of the
  sun on sensitised paper exposed at right angles to the solar rays for
  di<U+FB01>erent altitudes of the sun, and largely to ascertaining the laws of
  distribution of the actinic power in the sky.
     I  take no observations except when the sky is quite clear.
     3. The method of measurement I adopted is the darkening pro
  duced in sensitised paper.       I cut strips from one uniform sheet of'
  ordinary photographic paper.          My observations being relative,     I
  obtain the same results (ratios) with any paper.           I compare ulti
  mately the eifects of the sun and of a candle on this same paper.
     4.   I  assume that, in burning a. stearine candle, the chemical action
  is proportional to the material consumed; I have taken as my unit (1')

l890.]       Photometric Observations    of the Sun and Sky.             5
of measure of chemical action the darkening produced at a distance
of 1 inch from the wick of the candle when 100 grains were con
sumed, which in the candle I used in India occupied about forty
seven minutes.      My observations, being almost entirely relative, are
independent of these assumptions, which a<U+FB01>ect hardly any of my

 H. Roscoe.
    5. Explains the method by which     I obtain  a standard strip for the
-candle unit.
    7. Describes  the water motion actinometer, with which observations
of the action of   sun. and sky were made.
    8. Shows how it may be proved experimentally that the intensity
of the action of light emanating from a physical point varies in
 versely as the square of the distance from the origin.
    9. For obtaining the eifects of the sun and sky,    I have always ex
 perimented mainly by exposing the paper at right angles to the sun's
 rays.   Sir H. Roscoe, on the other hand, exposes his paper on a
 horizontal plane.     Theoretic considerations have led me to another
                                              ”
 method of observation (with the “ octant actinometer below) which
 gives directly the measure of the effect really desired.

    A table is given of the <U+FB01>rst observations made, which afterwardis
 led to the formation of Table B (see next page).
    11. The method of observing the action of the sun alone.
    12. Observations taken near the horizon not to be depended upon.
    13. Refers to the construction of Table B, and the extension of the
 table for altitudes of the sun beyond those observed.
    14. Shows how the numbers of the table were obtained, by taking
 the inverse of the times required at each altitude for producing the
 darkening of the candle unit.
    17. I found the chemical action of the sun, as far as my experiments
 went, the same at all hours of the day and at all seasons of the year.
 And in Somerset-shire
                         '
                           I got exactly the same chemical action of the
 sun as at Dacca.
    18. Various observations    had led me to suspect that the chemical
 action of the sky at the same moment was diverse in diiferent parts
 of it. To investigate this suspicion, I designed an instrument which
 I  call the Mitrailleuse Actinometer (<U+FB01>g. 2).      I mount a number of
 similar cylindrical tubes in one plane in a semicircle, to the centre of
 which the axis of each tube is directed : one extremity of each tube
 lies in the circumference of the circle; the other extremities lie on
a concentric circle of about one-half the radius. In the circumference
 of this smaller circle is a semicircular series of holes, against which
 a semicircular block carrying the sensitised paper is pressed by a
 screw.    Each cylinder cuts out of the sky a circle of 8° 28' angular
 diameter.    One of the tubes near its top carries a. small plate of wood

I have been careful to verify it by numerous observations      both at
Dacca and in Somersetshire, and also to vary the observations  in every
way I could devise.    Thus the mitrailleuse   has  been placed in the
plane of minimum intensity.      In this case all the barrels give the
same reading for points  not too near the horizon.
   Next the mitraillcuse was placed in planes of great circles through
the sun at various angles with the plane of symmetry, by turning it
round the line joining one of its tubes with the sun the observed
chemical actions agree well with

this mitrailleuse being exposed, the barrel 0 sin 0 being directed to
the sun, the circular darkened spots were found to be very accurately
of the same depth.
   Further, I calculated the times of exposure for a. (particular)

law in cosec 0, to give a. uniform tint.                             I

   The relations existing between the heat of fusion of a substance
and its heat capacity in the liquid and solid condition were demon
strated    Person, in 18417

between the heat capacities of the liquid and solid, and that, therefore,

perature a liquid could not freeze, since there would be no di<U+FB01>erence
 between   it and the solid, and Person argued that there would then be
 no heat at all in    it,
                       and that this temperature was the absolute zero.
 He then made determinations with various substances, which tended
 to show that this temperature was the same for all bodies, and was
situated at — 160° C.                                                   '

has de<U+FB01>ned the critical point of the solid-liquid states as that at which
the volumes of the liquid and solid are identical, and at which the
 heat of fusion       nil, a certain pressure, as well as a certain tem

 however, that the question of pressure may practically be left out of
consideration; pressure will, of course, a<U+FB01>ect the temperature in
 question, but to such       asmall extent that the ordinary atmospheric
pressure,   under    which the data necessary for the calculations are
obtained, may be regarded as nil, and             also appears to me that the

of equal volumes, for       itseems hardly possible to conceive two con

any other property.

mediate      state appears possible; on the other hand, when we start
with a liquid and cool it, it becomes in many cases (see ‘ Chem. Soc.
Trans.,’ 1890, p. 340) so viscous that even at —80° to —-100° it can
scarcely     be termed a liquid, and by further cooling it would probably
become so <U+FB01>rm that it would be regarded as a solid. This affords a
striking illustration of What may be meant by the gradual passage of
a liquid into a solid, but the solid thus obtained would evidently not
be identical with the crystallised solid, nor could it be obtained by
heating the crystals from a lower temperature ; as the data on
which the calculations are based do not refer to this solid but to the

     For the purpose of extending the applications of a law governing
the freezing points of solutions which                            I   have lately propounded
 (‘ Chem. Soc.       Proc.,’    1889,      p. 149),        it   was     necessary to determine
this temperature in certain cases.                      The present communication con
tains the details of these determinations, and they aiford evidence
that it is not a constant for all bodies, as Person imagined.
     The values which Person obtained with various substances were as
follows :—""

     The concordance of these values is certainly very striking, espe
 cially when the diversity of the substance examined and the dif<U+FB01>culties
 of the determinations are considered; but a closer examination of the
 results cannot fail to suggest that the concordance must in some
 instances have been accidental.                      The di<U+FB01>erence between the heat
 capacities of the liquid and solid, C—c, is often very small, and even
 ordinary experimental errors in either of the quantities would make a
 large difference in the results, while in some of Person's determina
 tions the experimental errors must have been of more than ordinary
 magnitude, for these determinations occasionallylasted between one and
 two hours, during which time the loss by cooling must have been very

  in each particular case (except that of water, perhaps), but there is one
 fatal objection to all Person's results, namely, that the heat capacity
 of both solids and liquids varies considerably with the temperature,
 and that he made his determinations at any temperature which hap
  pened to be most convenient, that, for instance, at which the heat
 capacity of the solid was determined varying between 11° and 280°

     One case will be su<U+FB02>icient to illustrate the e<U+FB01>eot of this.                   With

 mand as much con<U+FB01>dence as Person's (indeed Person adopts some of
 Regnault’s determinations with this substance); these results are—

 show     that no value can be attached to Person’s <U+FB01>gure, —]52°.
 Person's and Regnault’s results lie in a fairly straight line which
 gives 0 = 0'l979 at the fusing point, and -719" as the temperature
of no crystallisation, but it is impossible to accept even this value,
 as there are not su<U+FB02>icient data for calculating the heat capacity of
 the liquid at the fusing point.
     C, c, and Z should evidently be determined           at the same temperature,
and this temperature must necessarily be that of fusion (t), but, inas
 much as the heat capacities near this temperature may be abnormally
 high owing to the fusion or solidi<U+FB01>cation being sometimes a gradual
 process, the determinations should not be made too near the fusing
 p0int,‘l‘ and the only means of ascertaining their true value at this
point is to determine them at several different temperatures, and
from the rate of change thus obtained to calculate their value at the
fusing point itself. This method has been adopted in the present
work.
    * C = 02045    (98° to 48°), l

    1- The values obtained  by  Person   for beeswax a<U+FB01>ord a striking instance in point ;
from —9°to + 50° the heat capacity of this solid increases from 0'4-3 to 1'72, exceed
ing at this latter temperature that of the liquid (_()'50) by a very large amount. Ice
shows a similar increase, but in a. much smaller degree (see Person, ‘Ann. Cliim.
Phys.’ (3), vol. 30, p.

                            Substances Investigated.
   The substances investigated were sulphuric acid, the monohydrate
of sulphuric acid, the tetrahydrate of calcium nitrate, benzene, and
naphthalene, the last mentioned being the only one in which C, 0, and
Z had been determined by previous investigators.           The sulphuric acid
was the same as that used in my determinations of the freezing points
of this substance (‘ Chem. Soc. Trans,’ 1890, p. 337), the stock acid
having been diluted by the addition of ice so as to contain exactly
 100, and, for the monohydrate, 84!‘/1188, per cent. HQSO4.
   The calcium nitrate was prepared by repeated crystallisation; the
percentage of anhydrous salt in the fused crystals having been de
termined by evaporation and heating at 250°, the excess of water
which the fused salt was found to contain was driven off by a gentle
heat.   The melted salt will remain liquid at ordinary temperatures
for many days, although its solidifying point is 412°'4.
   The naphthalene and benzene were special preparations made by
Messrs. Kahlbaum : repeated crystallisation was not found to alter
the melting point of either to any appreciable extent.
                               Method Employed.
   The substance was placed in a cylindrical platinum bottle measur
ing 9 x 2 cm., and holding about 30 c.c. Its mouth was closed by a
caoutchouc stopper, through which passed a thermometer with a very
narrow bulb, long enough to extend from the top to the bottom of
the bottle,    thereby  giving the mean temperature           of the contents
more    accurately than an instrument with a short bulb would
have   done.     The bottle was placed in a double test tube, and the
latter in a double bath containing warm water or a freezing
mixture, as the case might be. After the bottle had attained the
required temperature, and this had ‘remained constant for some
time, it was removed from the test tubes and plunged into the calori
m.eter, an operation which occupied only two or three seconds.             To
prevent the deposition of hoar-frost on the bottle while it was being
cooled, the inner test tube in which it was placed had a bulb blown at
the bottom, in which was kept some sulphuric acid.            The calorimeter
contained   either  600 or  1800 c.c.  of water, the quantity being adjusted
so that the rise or fall of the temperature           in it was about 1°, the
smallness   of  the change being     favourable   to the accuracy of the de
termination by rendering the loss of cooling, or gain by heating, very
small. This loss or gain was estimated by determining the rate of
cooling at the initial and <U+FB01>nal temperatures, both thermometers being
read at intervals of one minute, and having been compared with each
other before the determinations.        The rate of cooling during the time
when the temperature was rising or falling was taken to be the mean of

 16         Prof. S. U. Pickering.    Determinatiom      to teat  [Dec. 11,
that at the initial and <U+FB01>nal temperatures; it was generally very small,
since the temperature of the air was kept at a point such that there
was heating at the initial temperature, and Cooling at the <U+FB01>nal tem
perature, or vice versd. The time occupied in obtaining almost
identical temperatures in the bottle and calorimeter varied between
two and twenty minutes, the whole determinations, including the
interval allowed for determining the two rates of cooling, occupying
 <U+FB01>fteen to forty-<U+FB01>ve minutes.    Such a duration militates very much
against the accuracy of the results.
    The calorimetric thermometer read by estimation (O‘O5 mm.) to
0°'OO05 ; the stirring apparatus and other appliances were the same as
those described elsewhere (‘Chem. Soc. Trans.,’ 1887, p. 293).          The
 water equivalent of the platinum bottle and its thermometer was
ascertained by direct experiment to be 2'223 grams.           The last men
tioned thermometer possessed a range       of 30°,   one  estimation <U+FB01>gure
being equivalent to O°'Ol, and, as the rise or fall measured sometimes
 exceeded 30°, it was in such cases set so as to register the initial
 temperatures of the bottle, the <U+FB01>nal temperature of this being taken
 to be the same as that of the calorimetric water, previous determina
tions having shown that the two temperatures were identical within
 the reading error of the instruments when this rate of cooling
became constant. The temperature of the calorimeter was generally
about 18°.
    The determinations were all made in duplicate. The mean error
of  a single observation was found to be about 0'8 per cent. of the total
rise or fall measured; this corresponds to an error of O°'OO75 in the
alteration of temperature registered in the calorimeter, or O°'22 in
that registered in the bottle; considering the long duration of the
determinations and the magnitude of the total correction for cooling
which had to be applied, such an error must,       I think, be regarded as
small.    In many cases the error in the heat capacity found is the
same asthat in the rise or fall measured, i.e., ()‘8 per cent., of its
value, or, on the average, O'OO32 of the heat capacitv per gram; in
other cases it is much greater, for the heat evolved sometimes in
cluded the heat of fusion, and, after subtracting this, the whole error
remained concentrated in the smaller quantity, which represented the
heat capacity.     In some cases, again, the heat capacity for a given
interval had to be found by taking the di<U+FB02>erence between two di<U+FB01>erent
determinations, and in such cases the error was greater.

from the determinations at the two higher and two lower temperatures
respectively. Where the determinations include the heat of fusion
the differences between the individual experiments (not the means)
are used in calculating the heat capacity; those ‘determinations      are
divided into two series, A and        (see
                                          BTable II), each of   which      is

together alternately,   and the two other series thus obtained give
another series of mean results, the mean of these two means being
<U+FB01>nally taken.    The heat of fusion was determined from those experi
ments in which the initial temperature was nearest to the temperature
of fusion.
   The general results are collected in Table A, where those in the

                                         Details.
   Before discussing the general results, the following details may be
noticed :—
   Sulphuric Acid.—The value found for the liquid at l9°'53 seems to
be rather too high, and this makes the value deduced for 26°74 too
high, and that for 41°'25 too low. The value for 0° has here been
deduced diagrammatically, the probable error (Table A) being deter
mined from the errors of the duplicate determinations.  Both the values
for the solid at the initial temperature of —16°‘8 appeared somewhat
anomalous, and they were consequently omitted in the calculations.
In taking the mean value for -r = 0°, a double weight has been assigned
to the value deduced from the determinations at the two higher tem
peratures.   The probable error (given in Table A) in this, and most
other     cases, has been   deduced      in the ordinary way from those two
values.  The heat capacities of neither the solid nor the liquid show
any signs of an abnormal increase as we approach the melting point.

    One of the determinations,           it will   be noticed,    applied to tempera
 tures   entirely below the freezing point.                The heat of fusion was
 determined      by placing the bottle with the superfused liquid in the
 calorimeter till the temperature of the latter had been attained,
 raising the stopper of the bottle, and inserting a minute crystal of the
 solid salt; crystallisation then took place at the temperature of the
 calorimeter, 25° below the normal freezing point, and its value at this
 latter was calculated by adding to the observed value 2-5(C—c) cal.,
 C-—c being 0'14.-81 at an average temperature                     of —12°'5.       This
method, where practicable,              is more accurate than that usually
adopted.      In the case of the solid salt the rate of increase of the heat
capacity   is  rather greater near the melting point, but the di<U+FB01>erence is
scarcely greater than the experimental error, and would not affect the
results to any appreciable extent.
    Naphthalene.—The determinations with the liquid applied to one
interval of temperature only. The probable error is calculated from
the variation of the mean values deduced from the determinations

bining each of the determinations with those marked 1, B, and q. In
the case of the solid the determinations extended over two intervals
of temperature, the probable error in the value at 0° being calculated
from the difference between the various duplicates.                     This substance
was less fully examined than the others, owing to its having already

the average increase being large in comparison with the other sub
stances examined.      The values for the solid are somewhat irregular,
but, on plotting them out, they are found to be evenly distributed above
and below a straight line ; the value at 0° and the rate of increase have
been deduced from this line, and the probable error was calculated by
noting the di<U+FB01>erence which would be caused by taking the values
above or below it.

   The results here obtained are compared in Table B with those
given by other observers.        Except where it is stated otherwise, they
refer to the temperatures at which the substances melt under normal
conditions.      The concordance exhibited by this table is in most
cases fairly good, though Berthelot's values for the heat of fusion of
sulphuric acid and its mouohydrate seem wholly inexplicable.
   My value for the heat capacity of liquid calcium nitrate receives
con<U+FB01>rmation from some determinations which I made some time ago
at 18°, with various solutions of salt up to a strength of 6l'4.- per
cent. Ca(NO_-,)2 by an electrical method ; the results obtained formed
a fairly uniform curve, and, on extending this up to 69‘5 per cent.
(the composition of the tetrahydrate). I got 0517 as the heat capacity
of such a solution, while the present results give O'5185 at 42°'4-, or
015283 at 18°.
                                General Results.
    From Table A (p. 18) it will be seen that the heat capacity of solid
benzene is greater than that of the liquid, so that C-0 becomes a nega
tive quantity.     This is somewhat remarkable, for in other known in
stances, such as that of beeswax, where fusion is a gradual process, and
the heat capacity of the solid becomes abnormally great as the melting
point is reached, this abnormality makes itself evident in the augment
ing rate at which the increase occurs, whereas with benzene no such
abnormal increase is noticed, although the determinations extend as
far as 36° below the melting point: the only sign of anything
unusual is that the rate of increase is considerably greater than that
in the other cases investigated.      This observation with benzene must
throw some doubt on conclusions drawn from the heat capacity of any
 solids, unless the determinations extend through a very long range of
 temperature.     It must be noted that the heat of fusion given here for
 benzene will be too small if part of that heat of fusion appears as the
heat capacity of the solid.

and give 04757 for its value at 0°; this brings the temperature of
no crystallisation to —167°, a value di<U+FB01>ering but little from Person's,
—-160°.       Regnault's determinations                       with bromine (‘ Ann. Chim.
Phys.’ (3), vol 9, p. 34-4) give a result of doubtful value.                                He gives
the fusing point as —7°'32, the heat of fusion as 16185, and su<U+FB01>icient
data to calculate the heat capacity of the liquid as O'l(05 + 0'00028t,
but for that of the solid his data are insu<U+FB02>icicnt ; they may be taken as
indicating, though very doubtfully, 01038 + 0‘00047t, a value which
gives C—c negative; or, if we take the mean of them, we get 00843
as the heat capacity at -4-8°'96 C., a value which gives —992° for
the temperature of no crystallisation: as the heat capacity at the
temperature of fusion must be greater than at —48°'96, we may
safely say that a temperature lower than —992° is indicated as that
of no crystallisation.                 Some determinations with pentahydrated
sodium thiosulphate were made by Trentimaglia (‘ Wien. Akad. Ber.,'
vol. 72, Abth. II, p. 669), with the express object of testing the
validity of Person’s conclusion, but as the values for the heat capa
cities were determined at one temperature only, and that not very
close to the melting point, I do not think that any conclusions can be
drawn from them. The probable error of my own results was calcu
lated by taking half that which would be caused by taking such of the
extreme values for C, c, and 1 given in Tables                           I to X as would affect
the result in the same direction.

        Received November 25, 1890.
   In 1867 MM. Wolf and Rayet discovered at the Paris Observatory
three small stars in Cygnus, which in the spectroscope showed several
bright lines upon a continuous spectrum.‘                     All three stars have a
very bright band        in  the blue part of the spectrum.
   These stars are       :—
                                   B.D. +35“, No.      4.001.
                                   13.13. +35“, N0. 4013.
                                   B.D. +36°, No. 3956.
   Their spectra were described in 1873, by Vogel, whose observations
agree substantially with the original description given by Wolf and
Rayet.‘|'      A    more complete account of their spectra was given by
Vogel       in    1883, from observations            at Vienna with the 27-inch
ref!-actor made by        Sir Howard Grubb.I
   Vogel’s measures of the bright blue band place it in the star
No. 3956 at from K 468 to 7» 461, with a maximum at A 464; in the
star No. 4013 with a maximum at the same place in the spectrum;
 while the corresponding blue band in the star No. 4001 has a con
siderably less refrangible position, commencing at X 470, reaching a
maximum at 7» 468, and ending about 7t 465.
   These later measures, though they di<U+FB01>er from his earlier ones, in
so far as they show that the blue band has not an identical position
in all three stars, nevertheless support substantially his earlier obser
vations, which Vogel considered to show, contrary to the statements
of Secchi, that the bright lines, including the blue band, were not
due to carbon.
   In the diagram, Nos. 1, 2, and 3 show the positions of the bright
bands in the three stars, according to V0gel’s measures, relatively to
the blue band of the hydrocarbon <U+FB02>ame.

stars is the carbon band in the blue, commencing near )\ 4741;‘ and

   * Professor Lockyer, in the Bakerian Lecture for 1888 (‘ Roy. Soc. Proc.,’ vol. 44,
p. 37), says of the star No. 4001 :—“ The bright band with its maximum at A 468 is
the bright carbon <U+FB02>uting commencing at A 474 and extending towards the blue,
with its maximum at 468, as photographed at Kensington.”
   Of the star 4013 z—‘‘ The bright band in the blue at 473 is most probably the
carbon band bright upon a faint continuous spectrum, this producing the absorp

   Of the star N 0. 3956 :—“ The bright band at 470 is the carbon band in the blue,.
commencing at 474, with its maximum at about 4-68, as observed and photographed
 at Kensington” (I00. 0%., p. 43). See Vogel’s measures for the band in this star,
which are given in the text.
    Diagrams of the spectra of these stars are given at pp. 38, 40, and 41, based on
Vogel’s observations and his curves, which, on a slightly reduced scale, are placed at
the bottom of the diagrams. The maximum of Vogel‘s curves is placed in all three
diagrams at A 468, and agrees in the diagrams with the carbon band, whereas Vogel’s
original curves and his measures place the maximum in the case of two of the stars
at A 464, beyond the carbon band.

 an absolute coincidence of the band in all three stars with the blue
 band of a spirit-lamp <U+FB01>ame.*
     As the presence or absence of carbon in these stars, as shown by
 the coincidence or otherwise of the blue band with that of the hydro
 carbon <U+FB02>ame, was of great importance to us in connexion with a
 wider investigation on which we are at work, we thought it necessary,
 after these recent statements as to the position of the band, to make
 direct comparisons of the spectra of these stars with that of the hydro
 carbon <U+FB02>ame under su<U+FB01>iciently large dispersion to enable us to deter
*mine whether Vog-e1’s measures are substantially correct, or whether
they are so largely in error as the absolute coincidence of the band
with the blue band of a spirit-lamp <U+FB02>ame in the case of all three
stars would show them to be.
     The obvious importance of making the observations with su<U+FB02>icient
dispersion is supported by Vogel’s own experience.                        With the small
dispersion which he employed in his earlier observations in 1873, he
did not detect the large di<U+FB02>erence of position, about 7t 0040, of the
band in No. 4001, as compared with its position in the other two
stars.       On this point Vogel says, in his memoir of 1883:—“ Etwas
 abweichend ist nur die Auffassung der Lage der breiten hellen Bande
im Blau, die bei den friiheren Messungen bei allen drei Sternen
iibereinstimmt. . . . Bei den verhaltnissmassig geringen optischen
 Hiilfsmitteln, mit denen jene Messungen ausgefiihrt wurden, ist die
                                                                     ”
Uebereinstimmung aber cine ganz iiberraschende                         (loo. cit., p. 21).
     We observed the spectra of the stars successively, <U+FB01>rst with a direct
vision prism of small dispersion, then with a spectroscope (A) con
taining one prism of 60°, and <U+FB01>nally with a spectroscope (B) with
 two compound prisms, equal to about four prisms of 60°; with the
 last-named instrument the comparisons with the hydrocarbon <U+FB02>ame
were made.
     A rapid preliminary              comparison in the spectroscope (B) of the
 spectra      of the three         stars with the blue base of a Bunsen <U+FB02>ame
    "‘  Professor Lockyer, in a signed article in ‘Nature’ (August 7, 1890, vol. 4-2,
p. 344), writes ;—
    “ In the Bakerian Lecture for 1888        I gave a complete discussion of the spectra of
 bright-lined stars,    as far as  the  observations went, and the conclusion arrived at was
 that they    were  nothing  more    than swarms of meteorites a little more condensed than
 those   which   we  know   as nebulae.    The main argument in favour of this conclusion
 was the presence     of the bright <U+FB02>uting of carbon which extends from 4-68 to 4741.
 This standing out bright beyond their short continuous spectrum gives rise to an
 apparent absorption band in the blue. . . . Direct comparisons of the spectrum
of all the three stars in Cygnus with the <U+FB02>ame of a spirit-lamp have been made by
 Mr. Fowler, and these showed an absolute coincidence of the bright band in the
 stars with the blue band of carbon seen in the <U+FB02>ame.           It was found quite easy to

showed at once the substantial accuracy of Vogel’s measures, and the
striking difference of position of the band in the star No. 4001 from
that which it holds in the other two stars.
   The obvious want of agreement of the star bands with the blue
band of the Bunsen <U+FB02>ame was seen at once. Their relative positions
appeared to agree substantially with the positions represented in No. 2
and No. 3 of the diagram, which are based on Vogel’s measures.
More careful and repeated observations brought out clearly, as is
indeed shown by Vogel's curve, that the star bands di<U+FB02>'er in character
as well as in position from the blue band of the hydrocarbon <U+FB02>ame,
and also in some respects from each other.
    Before giving in more detail the results of our observation on each of
the three stars,   it should be stated that in all the stars the continuous
spectrum is not in our instruments a short one, ending before the
position of the bright blue band is reached.          On the contrary, an
examination     with  all three spectroscopes  showed   that the continuous
spectrum, though enfeebled by absorption a little before reaching the
blue band, can be traced, as is shown in Vogel’s curves, quite up to
the band, and indeed extends for a long distance into the violet beyond
the blue band. The blue hand does not in our instruments stand out
bright beyond the end of a short continuous spectrum, but falls upon
a fairly luminous continuous spectrum, which can be traced past the
 blue band into the violet, apparently as far as the eye could be expected
 to follow it.
    We suspected bright lines or bands in the region more refrangible
 than the blue band, but in such faint objects this is a point which
 should be determined by photography.
    Professor E. C. Pickering has since kindly informed us that his
 photographs of the star N o. 4001, which extend into the ultra-violet
 region, show beyond the blue band the bright hydrogen lines at 434,
 410, 397, and 389; and also other bright lines at 462, 455, 420, 406,
 402, 395, and 388.
    In his photographs of the stars 4013 and 3956, however, the only
 well-marked line is in the blue at 470.
    Star 4001.—In this star, as is shown by Vogel’s measures and
 curve, the    bright blue band is less refrangible than in the other
 two stars, and approaches therefore nearer to the position of the blue
 band of the hydrocarbon <U+FB02>ame.         The appearance and position of the
 band in the star as contrasted with that of carbon, when observed in
 spectroscope B, are represented in spectrum N o. 4 of the diagram.
    The brightest part of the band, from about It 468 to X 469, falls o<U+FB01>
 rather suddenly in brightness at about these wave-lengths, but can be
 traced towards the red as far as about 7» 4715, and as far in the blue
 as about X 4655.

    In our     observations      of this and the other stars we did not attempt
 micrometric measures of the blue band, but we estimated their positions
 by means of the intervals between the <U+FB01>ve <U+FB01>utings of the band of the
 Bunsen <U+FB02>ame. In the case of objects so faint in our instrument
when viewed           under the dispersion of spectroscope B, we did not
 consider there would be any real gain of accuracy by attempting to
take measures.
    Though the wave-lengths assigned to our positions must therefore
 be regarded as not more than approximately correct, we have no hesi
 tation in considering them fully accurate enough for the purpose of
 our investigation.
     The star band is not split up into well-separated maxima, as is the
  Bunsen <U+FB02>ame band., but we have little doubt that the brightest part
 of the band, from R468 to R469, which is much, and rather suddenly,
 brighter than its beginning and termination, consists of bright lines.
 Lines appear to <U+FB02>ash out at moments, but in our instruments they
 cannot be seen with sufficient steadiness for us to be sure of their
 number and position.
    Under certain conditions of the electric discharge, the normal rela
 tive brightness of the component <U+FB02>utings of the blue hydrocarbon band
 has been observed to be so far changed that the position of maximum
 intensity is moved from the less refrangible end of the band towards
 the blue end; but the <U+FB01>ve <U+FB02>utings remain without any change of
 their position in the spectrum?‘
    Dr. Hasselberg, by means of feeble disruptive discharges from tin
 foil terminals placed outside an exhausted tube containing vapour of
 benzole, obtained a nearly pure spectrum of the order of that in a
 hydrocarbon <U+FB02>ame mixed only with faint lines of hydrogen.                          He
          “ Es war aber hier die violette
 says:                                             Gruppe sehr schwach. Dagegen
 schien mir die blaue Gruppe relativ heller als im Flammenspectrum,
 und sie hatte ausserdem entschieden ihre grosste Intensitiit nicht an
 der weniger brechbaren Kante, sondern mehr nach dem Violetten
 hin.     Dasselbe schien mir auch mit der gelben Gruppe der Fall zu
 sein.    In Bezug auf die griine Gruppe konnte ich aber keine Ver
 schiebung des Intensitiitsmaximums bemerken.”
    Dr. Hasselberg gives curves to show the amount of this change of
intensity in the blue group and in the orange group.                      In the blue
 group the maximum is moved from the <U+FB01>rst to the third line, that
   *  “It  is necessary  to state that the maximum luminosity of the blue band, under
some conditions, is about 468.       .  .  . The conditions under which this band has
its maximum luminosity at 468 in Geissler tubes seem to be those of maximum
conductivity.      If the pressure be high, all the members of the group are sharp, and
the luminosity of the band is almost uniform throughout.            This always occurs
when the pressure is very low. AI; intermediate stages of pressure, however, the
luminosity has a very decided maximum at about 4.68” (Appendix to the Bakerian
 Lecture for 1888, ‘Roy. Soc. Proc.,’ vol. 45, pp. 167, 168).

is, to about     7t 4698.    His curve gives the brightness of the maximum
over that of the <U+FB01>rst line as about 7 to 6, whereas the normal relative
intensity of these two lines is in the inverse direction and as about
                     ‘
2   to 4 (Watts,       Index of Spectra,’ p. 30).‘
     A    similar change from the normal relation of brightness of the
<U+FB02>utings within the hand, even if removed to X 468, does not seem to
us to bring the star band su<U+FB01>iciently into accordance in character and
position with those of the band of the hydrocarbon <U+FB02>ame to justify
 us in attributing the blue band in the star to carbon.                  Though we
traced the band a little further towards the red, than the position of
 the beginning of the band given by Vogel's measures, yet it is very
 faint, and without any increase in brightness at the place of the second
 <U+FB01>uting of the carbon band, beyond which we were unable to see it.
     According to Hasselberg’s curve, the second bright <U+FB02>uting, where
 in our instruments the star band ends, still retains a brightness of
about 11/12 of that of the maximum, and the <U+FB01>rst line, at the position
 of which no brightening of the feeble continuous spectrum of the
star could be detected, a brightness of about 6/7 of that of the
,maximum.           That the <U+FB01>utings of the band were not obscured by the
 absorption band at this part of the spectrum appears clear from the
 circumstance that we could trace the faint continuous spectrum up to
 the bright band.
     V0gel’s and our observations agree in making the band run on
 some distance beyond the visible termination of the blue hand of the
 Bunsen <U+FB02>ame.            Piazzi Smyth, under some conditions, observed a
                             “         ”               “              ”
 large number of faint linelets beyond the 5th leader of the band,
 where its visibility usually ends ; and in the brilliant light of the arc
 the band can be traced further in the blue.                The extension of the
 band under such circumstances              does not seem to us to a<U+FB01>ect our
 present argument; for in the very feeble light of the star we may
 surely take it that the carbon band, if present, could not be seen to
 extend further than its usual visible limit in a Bunsen <U+FB02>ame, namely,
 about 7t 468.
     Perhaps it should be stated in connexion with the circumstance
 that we saw the band extend a little further towards the red than
 Vogel did, that at the time of our observations the hydrogen line at
 F was not visible in our instruments, whereas it was bright at the
 time when Vogel observed the star. In the spectrum of a similar
  star, D.M. +37° 3821, in which the hydrogen line at F at the time
 was bright, the blue band was seen by us to stop near the place given
 by Vogel in his measures of the star No. 4001.
      Not only is there no coincidence, so far as Vogel and we have
 observed, of the position of the band in the star with that of the blue

band of the Bunsen <U+FB01>ame ; but, further, the want of accordance of its
general characters is so great as to make the view that its origin is
carbon very improbable.          This improbability is very greatly in
creased when we <U+FB01>nd, as will be shown presently, that no traces
whatever of the very bright beginnings of the more brilliant green
and orange bands could be detected by 11s in any of the stars.
Further, Professor E. C. Pickering has kindly sent to us an account of
his photographs of this star, which, though they show the hydrogen
line at X 434, do not exhibit any brightness at the positions of the
indigo hydrocarbon bands, beginning near 4312, and X 4382.
    This star, however, can scarcely be taken by itself; in the case
of the other two stars, in the spectra of which, according to Vogel’s,
Cope1and’s, and our own observations, the brightest part of the blue
band is from X 464 to X 465, but nearer X 465, quite outside the
ordinary visible limit of the carbon band, the evidence seems very
strong indeed that the band does not owe its origin to carbon.
    We satis<U+FB01>ed ourselves that when the spectrum of the star is
examined under the dispersion of spectroscope          B, none of the
brighter parts of its spectrum fell at, or very near, the green,
orange, and indigo <U+FB02>utings of the hydrocarbon <U+FB02>ame spectrum; at
these positions we were unable to detect any sensible brightening of
the star’s spectrum.      Professor C0peland’s measure of the blue band
in 1884 was X 4695.
    N0. 40l3.—V0gel does not give measures of the beginning and the
ending of the band in this star, but only of the brightest part :—
“ Hellste
            Stelle, nahezu Mitte, einer breiten verwaschenen Bande,
X 464.”    He gives, however, a diagram of the spectrum in which the
bright blue band is represented as substantially coincident in position
and in general character with that in the spectrum of No. 3956.
    Our observations agree substantially with those of Vogel, but they
make the band to consist of two parts—a very bright part, from
about X 466 to 7x 464, but brightest near X 465, and a very faint
band, apparently detached from the bright one from about X 4685 to
about X 4705. This faint band is brightest near where it ends rather
abruptly at the more refrangible end. The very bright band has not
the character of a <U+FB01>nting, nor is it broken up into maxima widely
separated like those of the Bunsen <U+FB02>ame band, but appears to be a
group of bright lines. The lines were only glimpsed at moments ; it
is therefore difficult to make a drawing which truly represents the
character of the band as seen in our instruments. The band, which
 is shown at No. 5 of the diagram, is left un<U+FB01>nished at the more
 refrangible end, as we were not certain how far we ought to consider
 it to extend.

 great body of bright radiation lies far beyond the ordinary visible
 limit of the blue carbon band, and no connexion                        whatever     with
 carbon     is  even suggested          to us by the          star's   spectrum.       Dr.
  Copeland’s    measure of the band in 1884 was             A 4-65'-t.
      The continuous spectrum of the star is unequally bright from the
 presence of bright groups and also apparently of absorption bands or
  lines, and therefore with small dispersion it might be easily supposed
  that the spectrum is brighter at the position of the green carbon
 band.      We examined the continuous spectrum repeatedly with great
 care, and we were able to satisfy ourselves that, under the consider
 able dispersion of our instruments, there was no sensible brightening
 of the spectrum at the positions of the green and of the orange bands
 of the Bunsen <U+FB02>ame.
      No. 39-56.—Vogel places the brightest part of the band in this star
 at the same position in the spectrum as in the star last considered,
 No. 4013, namely, at X 464, a position beyond the carbon band.                      The
 position of the band as it appeared in spectroscope B with the third
 eye-piece, is represented at No. 6 in the diagram.                    The position of
the band relatively to that of the Bunsen <U+FB02>ame was determined. by
 estimations     made     by means of the intervals between the bright
 <U+FB02>utings of the Bunsen band.              The position agrees substantially with
 that given by Vogel, but places the maximum brightness nearer to
 465. This bright part probably consists of a group of bright lines
and falls o<U+FB01> rather suddenly at both ends.                    We were not certain if
 the light beyond this bright part was due to a continuation of the
band or to the continuous spectrum, more or less dimmed by absorp
 tion; we have, therefore, left the ends of the band incompleted in the
 diagram. Copeland’s measure of this band in 1884 was X 4649.
     The sub-band seen in the star N 0. 4013 is very much fainter in this
star, but we have little doubt that there is a very faint band present
 at about the same place       in the spectrum.

 position of the band in the stars No. 4013 and No. 3956, but less
 refrangible, corresponding to the position of the band in the star
 No. 4001.
     The bright band begins about 7t 467 and runs on to nearly it 4705.
 It is clearly not made up of <U+FB02>utings similar to those of the Bunsen
 <U+FB02>ame, but is a. group of lines nearly uniformly bright throughout
 thelength of the band.             The band did not appear to extend in our
 instruments towards the red quite so far as the band of No. 4001;
 it stops near the place assigned by Vogel to the beginning of the
 band of No. 4001.
     The band is represented in spectrum No. 7 in the diagram.           Direct
 comparison with hydrogen showed that the line at F is brilliant in
 this star.
     After some scrutiny of this part of the star’s spectrum, we became
 conscious of a very feeble brightening of the spectrum beyond the
bright band towards the violet, and as far as we could estimate its
position, at about from X 464 to 7t 467, that is to say, about the posi
tion assigned to the band by Dr. Copeland in 1884.                          '
     We then re-examined the spectrum of N0. 4001, and were able to
feel pretty sure that a similar faint brightening of the spectrum
occurs in this star also at the same place, namely, about the more
refrangible position of the blue band in the stars No. 4013 and
N0. 3956.                                                                       .

to the same class as the three Wolf-Rayet stars in the Swan, to which
Professor Pickering has since added a fourth outlying member.”’*
     Dr. Copeland gives the position of the bright blue band in =1 Argus
as 7t 4646.
    Among the stars in the great cluster G.C. 4245, near § Scorpii,
Dr. Copeland found a star, P. XVI 204 = Stone 9168, which has a
similar spectrum, namely, with a bright band in the blue and two in
the yellow. He found the position of the blue band to be X 4651.
     In the case of two other small stars with similar spectra, he found
respectively for the blue band the approximate measures X 463'?» and
X 463'6.
    These four stars were similar, therefore, at the time of the observa
tions to N 0. 4013 and No. 3956, in which the maximum of the blue
band is not far from 7t 464, and therefore outside and beyond the
ordinary visible limit of the blue carbon band.

42               Dr. and Mrs. Huggins.       ()1: Wolf and     [Dec. 11,
   Professor Vogel observed two other stars with similar spectra, of_
which the main feature is the very bright band in the blue region,
namely, Arg. Oeltzen 17681 and Lal. 13412.        These stars are too low
in southern declination to be reached from our observatory.
   Vogel places the blue band in La]. 13412 at 7x 469, which shows
that it has a position similar to that of No. 4001 and of Dr. Copeland’s
star.   In the case of Arg. Oeltzen 17681, Vogel makes the band to
extend through about the entire range of refrangibility occupied by
the two positions of the blue band in the Wolf-Rayet stars according
to his measures of them, namely, from 71 461 to X 470, with a maximum
at the place where they would overlap, namely, A 466.
   Let us consider the four stars with an intensely brilliant blue band
which we have examined; in two of them the band extends from
about it 464 to X 467, and in the other pair the band has a less
refrangible position, from about X 466 to A 471, but there is also in
the case of each pair a very faint band visible, or suspected, at the
position of the blue band in the other pair. Further, in Arg. Oeltzen
17681, Vogel found the bright band su<U+FB01>iciently long to include both
positions of the band.
   One suggestion which presents itself is whether these bands, or,
more correctly, these groups of bright lines, may be variable, so that,
under certain conditions, one or other of them becomes brilliant.
Such a state of things would reconcile our observations of +37° 3821
with the earlier measures of Dr. Copeland, and, indeed, might pos
sibly explain, if this variability should be established, the circum
stance that so accurate an observer as Professor Vogel did not detect,
even with his smaller instrument in 1873, the very large difference of
position of the band in 4001 from that of the corresponding band in
the stars 4013 and 3956, which was so conspicuous in 1883, and is so
still at the present time. In the broad characters of their spectra,
and in their magnitudes, the Wolf-Rayet stars have remained un
changed since the discovery of their remarkable spectra in 1867.
   As the only direct evidence of such a variability rests upon the
change of position of the band in Dr. Copeland’s star since his
observation of it in 1884,    I  wrote to Dr. Copeland to ask if his
position  rested upon su<U+FB01>icicntly accurate measures or was arrived at
by estimation only. In reply he says :—“ The place of the blue line
(rather band) in D.M. +37° 3821, given in the ‘Monthly Notices,’ is
a mere estimate to show the character of the star.”
   Whether any change of position of the band has taken place must
therefore remain at present uncertain ; but, independently of any such
direct evidence of variability, the two positions of the very bright
blue band, with the suspicion of faint bands at the alternate positions,
appear to us suggestive of possible variation, especially when we

consider that the spectra of these stars consist of numerous absorp
tion bands and groups of bright lines upon a feeble continuous
-spectrum, a character of spectrum which seems to point to :3, probably
unstable condition of the atmospheres of these stars.
   The large difference of position of the bands in the two groups of
stars is much too great to admit of an explanation founded upon a
possible orbital motion of the stars.    Besides, the near coincidence of
 Dr. Copeland's measures of two bright lines common to the stars
4001 and 4013 shows that the difference of position of the blue band
is not due to motion in the line of sight.*
   If future observations should show that the bright blue groups are
variable, we must look, it would seem, to causes of a physical or a
                                                      '
chemical nature.
   If the two bright groups, differing in position by about 7t 0040,
belong to different substances‘, or, less probably, perhaps, to different
molecular conditions of the same substance, it is conceivable that one
or other substance, or molecular state, may predominate and appear
brilliant, according to certain unknown conditions which may prevail
in the stars’ atmospheres.                 -
   It might be suggested that both bands are due to a long group of
bright lines, extending from about X 461 to X 471, and that this long
group is cut down by absorption bands; in one pair of stars an
absorption from the green cuts off the less refrangible part of the
long group down to about 7t 467, while in the other two stars the
more refrangible part is eclipsed, and the bright group appears as
in 4001.
   The appearance of the spectra in our instruments scarcely seems to
us to be in accordance with such a view, because, though we did
suspect brightenings in the alternate places, the appearance of the
spectrum was not such as to suggest a bright group dimmed by
absorption, for in that case the amount of absorption needed to all but
obliterate a group, as bright as it appears in the other pair of stars,
would have blotted out completely the relatively feeble continuous
spectrum.     This continuous spectrum, though faint, was still dis
tinctly    seen.
   More observations               are needed, but          it appeared to us desirable by
these suggestions to invite the attention of observers to the points in
question.

44                Dr. and Mrs. Huggins.           On Wolf and            [Dec. 11,
    As the main object of our examination of these stars was to deter
mine whether the bright band in the blue was to be regarded as
showing the presence of carbon by its coincidence with the blue band
of the hydrocarbon <U+FB02>ame, we were not able, from the pressing claims
of other work, to extend our examination to many other points in con
nexion with the spectrum of these faint stars, for an exhaustive exami
nation of which, indeed, our instruments are not su<U+FB02>iciently powerful.
    We have stated already that the fairly luminous continuous
spectrum reaches up to the bright band in all three stars, and extends
beyond into the violet, as far as the eye could be expected to follow it.
    The spectra are weakened at many points by what appear to be
absorption bands, and are crossed by several brilliant lines, the
positions of some of which have been given by Vogel and by Copeland.
    An examination with spectroscope B of some of these bright lines,
as they appear under small dispersion, showed them to be really not
single lines, but short groups of closely-adjacent bright lines.
    One of the brightest of these lines is found in the star N 0. 4013, at
the position, according to Vogel, of X 570.
    Dr. Copeland’s measure for this line is X 5689 in star 4013, and
X 5704 in the star 3956.
    As this position is not very far from that of the green pair of
sodium lines at X 5687 and 7t 5681, it has been suggested that the line
in the star is due to sodium, though there is no line of comparable
brightness in the star's spectrum at the position of the dominant pair
of the sodium spectrum at D.‘I
    On confronting in spectroscope B the star line with the green
sodium lines, the bright space in the star’s spectrum was seen to con
 sist of a short group of several bright lines close together, and nearly
 equally bright.      This group appeared to extend through about four
 times the interval of the sodium pair, which would make the length
 of the group about X 0024. The green sodium lines cross the group
at about one-fourth to one-third of the length of the group from its
more refrangible end.         The group in the star is rather less bright at
the two ends, but there is no gradual shading off in either direction,
as in the case of a <U+FB01>uting.
    When we examined this part of the spectrum with the small disper
sion of a prism of 45", we were pretty sure of a feeble bright line, less
 refrangible than the pair of bright groups in the yellow, and not far
from the position of D. We were not able to see this line in spectro
scope B with su<U+FB01>icient clearness to enable us to <U+FB01>x its position.                 It
 may be D, or, perhaps more probably D3.
   ‘' The 570 line is most probably the green sodium line 569, the absence of the
yellow sodium being explained by the half-and-half absorption and radiation men

   In No.       4001, Vogel saw a line at the position of the F line of
hydrogen. It is probable that this line, as is the case in so many
stars in which it appears bright, is variable, as we were not able
to  see   it when the      HB line from a vacuum-tube was thrown in. In
the similar star         D.M. +37° 3821, as we have stated already, the F
line of hydrogen was very bright.
    We were unable to detect in any of the stars              a   brightening of the
spectrum at the position of the chief line of the bright-line nebulae.
For this examination the lead line at 7x 5004.-'5 was thrown in, and
the continuous spectrum of the star near to this position carefully
scrutinised.
    In their original paper, Wolf and Rayet state that they were not
able to detect any nebulosity about the stars. They say: “Elles ne
                                                            ”
présentent non plus aucune trace de nébulosité                  (loo. cit., p. 292).
    In a recent paper, Mr. Keeler, of the Lick Observatory, con<U+FB01>rms
 this view. He says : “ At my request, Mr. Burnham and Mr. Barnard
 examined the Wolf-Rayet stars in Cygnus for traces of surrounding
 nebulosity, but with only negative result.”*
    Notwithstanding these negative results, it appeared to us of great
 interest to ascertain further if any nebulosity would come out in a,
 photograph of the stars taken with a long exposure.
    Mr. Roberts responded at once to our wish when we asked his in
 valuable assistance, and on November‘ 1st, of this year, he took a
 photograph of this region of Cygnus, with an exposure of two hours.
    The three stars come out strongly upon the plate, but there is no
 nebulosity to be seen near any of them. There are faint stars in close
 proximity to the three stars, and apparently surrounding them, and,
 in the case of No. 3956, six of these faint stars are seen close to it,
 in an apparent spiral arrangement.
    Though this surrounding of faint stars should be pointed out,
 it should, at the same time, be stated that the whole neighbouring
 region is so densely studded with similar faint stars that it would be
 rash, perhaps, at present to suggest that this apparent connexion of
 the bright-line stars with faint ones near them may be other than
 accidentalif

 they appear on his photograph :—

                   appears as a multiple star made up of one bright, two fainter, and
 one very faint star partly behind the others; there is also a fourth bright star close
 to the multiple star. The group is surrounded by at least eight faint stars within
 a radial distance of $86" of are from centre to centre.
    “No. 4013.—The photo-image of this star is made up of three stellar images

 there are indications of two other faint stars behind the two bright ones.          This

    Professor E. C. Pickering informs me “ that photographs have been
obtained at the Harvard College Observatory of all the stars hitherto
discovered whose spectra consist mainly of bright lines and are of the
class discovered by Rayet.          Part of these have been photographed at
 Cambridge, and the remainder in Peru."               He states that they may be
divided     into  three   sub-classes,   according to the characters of their
<U+FB01>fteen bright lines.        He says, further: “Photographs of the spec
trum    of   planetary   nebula:  have also been obtained.         They resemble
closely the spectra described above, except that the line 500 is
strongly marked; 470 is seen in most of them, while the lines due to
 hydrogen are also bright."
    It would seem that Professor Pickering’s photographs do not permit
him to distinguish the di<U+FB01>erent positions of the bright blue band in
 some of these stars, for he gives for all the stars the same position,
 namely, X 470.
    We regret that the insu<U+FB02>icieucy of our instrumental means has left
our examination of the spectra of these stars less complete than we
could wish. Our observations appear to us, however, to be conclusive
 on the main object of our enquiry, namely, that the bright blue band
 in the three Wolf-Rayet stars in Cygnus, and in D.M. +3’/'° 3821,
 is not coincident with the blue band of the Bunsen <U+FB02>ame.

    In Maxwell’s ‘Electricity and Magnetism," a view is put for
 ward, in accordance with which we may regard any irrotational
 motion in a perfect liquid, for which the velocity potential is a solid
zonal harmonic, as due to the juxtaposition at the origin, and upon
the axis of symmetry, of sinks and sources.
    But, in a liquid, any irrotational motion which is symmetrical
with respect to an axis gives a velocity potential which may be
expressed as a sum of a series of solid zonal harmonics, their common
axis being the axis of symmetry, and their origin arbitrary, provided

it is excluded from the region to which the expressions     apply.    The
position of the origin upon   the axis  is arbitrary, since  by  a trans
ference formula we may pass from one origin to another.
   Let us now consider the system formed by a line source and a line
sink, of equal strengths, extending along the axis from an arbitrary
origin to in<U+FB01>nity in opposite directions.   Such a system       shall call  I
an extended doublet, of strength m, where m is the strength per unit
length of that part which lies on the positive side of the origin.
  By the superposition of two extended                        equal but

opposite   strengths,   we can produce a sink or a source upon the axis.
Hence, in a liquid, any irrotational motion which is symmetrical
with respect to an axis, may be produced by superposition of extended
doublets, whose origins depart but little from an arbitrary point on
the axis of symmetry.
   Now for an extended doublet of strength m, Stokes’s current func

   Reverting now to the expression (1), it will be seen that the direct
distance of any point from a point on the axis of symmetry plays
the same part in the theory of Stokes’s current function that is played
by its reciprocal in the theory of the potential function belonging to
symmetrical distributions of matter.

    The applications to hydrodynamics which I here give are of
 mathematical interest rather than physical. They are chie<U+FB02>y in con
 nexion with the motion of viscous liquids.              In ‘Crelle-Borchardtf
 vol. 81, l876, Oberbcck has given the velocities produced in an in<U+FB01>nite
 viscous liquid by the steady motion of an ellipsoid through               in the it,
 direction of one of its axes, and from these Mr. Herman‘ has found
 the equation of a family of surfaces containing the stream lines
 relative to the rllipsoid.       In chapter vi, Stokcs’s current function
is  obtained by   a   direct process for the <U+FB02>ux of a viscous liquid past a
 spheroid, and  it   is  shown that the result di<U+FB01>ers only by a constant
 multiple   from   the  particular case of Mr. Herman’s integral.
    Some minor applications are also given, namely, the solutions are
 obtained for <U+FB02>ux past an approximate sphere, and past an approxi
 mate spheroid.       The solution         also obtained for flux through a
                                             is
h  yperboloid   of  one  sheet,  where      appears that the stream surfaces
                                             it
 are hyperboloids of the confocal system.            A particular case      that   is
 of <U+FB02>ux through a circular hole in a wall, and this                  interesting
                                                                            is
 because we see that, by supposing internal friction to take place in
the liquid, we <U+FB01>nd an expression which gives zero velocity at the
sharp edge, and thus avoids the di<U+FB01>culty which                  always present
                                                                      _is
in the solution of such problems on the supposition that the liquid
isperfect. A comparison may be instituted between this problem,
and that of the effect of a disturbing periodic force upon a.
dynamical system capable of vibrating alone with a period equal
to that of the force.         It     well known that the amplitude of the
                                       is
vibration induced appears in<U+FB01>nite,               we totally disregard friction,
                                                       if
and this di<U+FB02>iculty     is  met by the fact that the damping e<U+FB01>ect of even
slight friction  is    rendered considerable by high velocities.         Now a
viscous liquid can move irrotationally, and, if there were no friction
at the boundaries, this          the class of motion
                                  is                       would take in cases
                                                                 it
of <U+FB02>ux past or through obstacles.          But      the obstacle terminated in
                                                            if
a sharp edge,      this  would    make   the   velocity there in<U+FB01>nite, and the
friction, however inconsiderable elsewhere, would here become of
account.      The boundary conditions which were necessary for the
existence of ix-rotational       motion throughout the liquid would no
longer apply,      and   the   whole  character of the solution would be
changed.      This would at any rate seem to apply to cases in which
the  whole   motion   is  slow, and when, consequently, the boundary con
ditions which must hold are pretty well understood.
   The paper concludes with an attempt to discuss the <U+FB02>ux past a
spheroid, or through a hyperboloid at whose boundary there may be
slipping. The current function                not obtained, all that appears
                                                  is
being that it probably differs from the parallel case of the sphere in
being far more complicated than when there                 no slipping.
                                                                 is       From

 1890.]     Determination    of the Boiling Point of Sulphur,  4&0.      57
 found most suitable for standardising platinum thermometers by
 means of it.
    The paper is divided into three parts.
    Part  I  contains a description of the method and apparatus em
 ployed in comparing the platinum thermometers used in this investi
 gation with the air thermometer at a temperature very near the
 boiling point of sulphur.
    Part  II  contains the determination of the actual boiling point of
 sulphur by means of the thermometers thus standardised,             and a
 description   of  the  method   and apparatus to be used in standardising
 other platinum thermometers.        A table is also given reduced from a
 previous   series   of observations  of other <U+FB01>xed points which may be
 used for the same purpose.
   Part  III  contains a comparison of the platinum and air thermo
 meters between 0° and 100°, and shows that the 8-formula holds
accurately between those limits.
   The determination of the boiling point of sulphur was made by
means of three platinum thermometers, L, M1, and M2, constructed
 out of the wire used in the experiments of 1887, before referred to.
   Full descriptions of these thermometers are given in the paper.
 They were furnished with double electrodes for measuring the resist
ance of the connecting wires at each observation, their insulation
was carefully tested, and all due precautions were taken to guard
against thermal effects and other sources of error.
   Thermometers       M1 and M2 were standardised by direct comparison
with an air thermometer at the boiling point of sulphur. Full
particulars are given of the details of the observations and calcula
tions, showing the limits of error of the experiments.
   The expansion of the glass forming the bulb of the air thermo
meter was determined both by the method of linear expansion, and
also by using the bulb itself as a mercury weight thermometer.         The
values found by the two methods agreed very closely.
   The small changes of the volume of the bulb were determined
from time to time during the progress of the experiments.         The <U+FB01>nal
observations were not taken till the thermometer had reached a fairly
steady state.
   The limit of accuracy attainable with this air thermometer was
found to depend chie<U+FB02>y on that of the barometric readings.            The
barometer used was therefore veri<U+FB01>ed by a careful comparison with
the standard metre scale.
   The iron-tube apparatus in which the platinum and air thermo
meters were compared was so constructed as to be capable of being
maintained at a constant temperature by a steady <U+FB02>ow of sulphur
vapour for any length of time.
   Observations were taken with it on two separate days. On each

 58         Messrs.   H. L. Callendar and E. H. Griffiths.          [Dec. 18,
occasion the temperature was kept steady to O°'l for about two hours.
Allowing for the difference of the atmospheric pressure, the tempera
ture attained was the same on both days.
    The results of the comparison      were in perfect agreement with the
experiments    of 1887, and showed that the 5-coo<U+FB02>icient of the wire
had not altered appreciably in the interval.
    The apparatus which we have found most convenient for standard
ising platinum thermometers by means of the boiling point of sulphur
consists of a wide glass tube, 40 cm. long and 4 cm. in diameter,
 with a spherical bulb at the end.            Tubes of this kind are com
monly used to heat Victor Meyer’s vapour-density apparatus.                For
                                           ”
brevity we have called it a “ Meyer tube.
    The outside of the tube is thickly padded with asbestos wool, with
 the exception of the lower half of the bulb, and of a. short length of
3-5 cm. at the top, which serves as a condenser. The tube is <U+FB01>lled
with sulphur to a level of 3 or 4 cm. above the bulb, and is heated by
a Bunsen burner. The gas is adjusted so as to keep the level of the
vapour near the top of the tube, which is covered with asbestos card
to prevent the sulphur catching <U+FB01>re.
   Our experiments have shown that a thermometer inserted in an
apparatus of this kind will not attain the actual temperature of the
vapour, unless it is protected from radiation to the sides of the tube,
and from the condensed liquid which runs down the stem. The
lowering of temperature due to radiation, &c., may readily amount
to upwards of 2“ at the boiling point of sulphur.
    The method which we have adopted for screening the thermometer
is to bind an umbrella of asbestos card on to its stem 2. short distance
above the bulb. Two coaxial tubes are hung on to this umbrella to
screen the thermometer from radiation.             ‘We have found that glass is
not sufficiently opaque to heat radiation at this temperature.             The
inner tube at least should be of metal.
   To avoid superheating of the vapour, it is necessary to make sure
that the level of the liquid sulphur stands well above that part of the
bulb which is exposed to the <U+FB02>ame.
   Using these precautions, we have found that the temperature by
normal air thermometer at constant pressure of the saturated vapour
     sulphur boiling freely under a pressure, of 760 mm. of mercury at
0° C., and g = 980'6l C.G.S. (sea level in lat. 45°), is
                               t =   4~4.~4°'53 C.
   The value given by Regnault* is nearly 4° higher than this; but
in the account which he gives of his experiments he has pointed out
several sources of error, and it is evident that he did not place much
con<U+FB01>dence in his results.

   1890.]        Determination of               the     Boiling Point of Sulphur,                 <§'c.        59
      The close agreement between the air thermometer experiments of
   1887 and the present series, leads us to conclude that the number
  above given is probably correct to a tenth of a degree, and that it may
   be  safely used for standardising platinum thermometers.
      The method which we recommend for standardising platinum ther
   mometers is brie<U+FB01>y as follows :———Observe the value R, of the resist
   ance in sulphur vapour in an apparatus such as we have described.
   Calculate the value of pt, by the formula
                              Pi: = 100 (R-*"Ro)/(R100_R0l
   Find the temperature                t  of the sulphur vapour, corresponding to the
  corrected barometric pressure H0, from the formula
                               t   = 444'53+O'O82                     (Ho—760).
  The appropriate value of                 8  is then given by the equation
                                   t—pt =             5

      We have made use of this method to reduce the results given in a
  previous communication, “On the Determination of some Boiling
 and Freezing Points by means of the Platinum Tl1ermometer,”*                                                and
 we <U+FB01>nd that the values of t deduced from the observations with
several thermometers of different patterns and with very di<U+FB02>erent
coefficients, are in remarkably close agreement.                                      The results found
 with the three best thermometers are given in the following table :———

assumption of the accuracy of the E-formula, and have not been
directly referred to the air thermometer.               We believe, however, that
they are probably correct to 0°'1 C., and that they may be safely used
to standardise thermometers of limited range, in cases where it may
happen to be inconvenient to make use of the sulphur point.
   In comparing        the platinum and air thermometers between 0° and
100° C. observations         were taken at intervals of 5" all the way up.
The mean deviation of the observations from the                   parabolic formula
(d) is only O“'006.         This corresponds to the limit        of accuracy of the
barometric readings, and there is no reason to                    suppose that the
6-formula may not represent the difference even                   more closely than
this.
   The same platinum thermometer has been compared with several
mercury thermometers standardised at Kew."' The result seems to
show that the Kew standard reads 0°'l C. lower than our air-ther
momcter at 30°.

  Phi]. Trans/1' two imperfect lower jaws of a large extinct Wombat,
from the Pleistocene of Queensland, under the name of Phascolomys
(Phuscolonus) gigas, the term Phascolonus being employed in a sub
generic sense.       The species Phascolomys gigas, it should be observed,
was founded by thevsame writer}; at an earlier date, upon the evidence
of a detached cheek-tooth.              Subsequently Sir Richard Owon§ de

and South Australia, characterised by their peculiarly <U+FB02>attened and
chisel-like shape, under the new generic name Scepamodon, which
was suggested from their contour.
   In cataloguing the fossil Mammalia in the collection of the British
Museum,|| I was at once struck by the circumstance that, while the
upper incisors of the so-called Phascolomys gigas were unknown, there
were no cheek-teeth which could be referred to Scepamodon, and it
accordingly occurred to me that the two might prove to be identical.
Support was aiforded to this conjecture by the following circumstances:

sors of Sqeparnodon were decidedly of a Wombat-like type, di<U+FB01>ering
mainly from those of existing Wombats by their large size and
excessive <U+FB02>attening and expansion.              3rd. One of the incisors of
Scepamodon agreed        so closely in  the structure  of the enamel, and the
reddish stains upon the same, with an upper premolar of Plzascolomys
gigas, that I even suggested both teeth might have belonged to the
same individual animal.
   As the result of the above it was concluded that the teeth described
as S'ce_pa/r'nodo'n Ramsayi were probably the upper incisors of Phascolomys
gigas, and on this supposition it was considered that the latter was
generically distinct from existing Wombats, and it was accordingly
entered as Phascolonus gigas in the Museum catalogue.
   Thus the matter stood till a short time ago, when I visited the
Exhibition of the Mineralogical Products of New South Wales, recently
held at the Crystal Palace.           Among the specimens exhibited was a
small collection of Mammalian remains, obtained from clay beds,
near Miall Creek, in the neighbourhood of Bingera, a station lying
close to the northern border of New South Wales. These deposits,
which have only recently been brought to notice, and appear to be full
of Mammalian remains, have been described by Mr. W. Anderson, in
the
      ‘
        Records of the Geological Survey of New South Wales.“ All
the bones from these beds are of a characteristic pale-brown colour,
by which they can be distinguished at a glance from those of all other
Australian deposits. The following account is taken from Mr. Ander
son’s report, in order to give an idea of the richness of these ossiferous
deposits.      This writer observes that “several tons of bones were
recovered, but the majority of them were more or less broken,
although many perfect specimens were procured.                   Those which
occurred most frequently in the deposit were the long bones of the
limbs, the small bones of their distal extremities, and vertebrae, and,
as a rule, these were also the most perfect, and in the best state of
preservation.        Rib bones were rather common, but were mostly
broken into short fragments.            Of the vertebrae, specimens of the
axis and atlas were usually found entire, both in the case of those
which had belonged to the smaller animals,. such as the Kangaroo
(Macropus), &c., and also to the larger forms, such as Diprotodon, &c.
Generally, however, only the bodies of the other vertebrae remained,
the spines and the various processes having been broken 01'1". Jaws,
both large and small, occurred frequently, while isolated teeth were
very abundant. The lower jaws of the larger forms were more fre
quently met with than the upper; indeed, the latter were rather rare.
When they did occur, however, they never formed part of an entire
cranium, but always consisted of the upper maxillary and palatal

bones only, the rest of the cranium being absent.         So far as  I saw,
there was no specimen that could be demonstrated to be a portion of
the cranium proper of one of the larger animals, although there are
 undoubtedly small fragments of the cranial bones among the collection,
which has, however, not yet been thoroughly examined.             The bones
of the pelvis were of rare occurrence, fragments of the thickest part
of the os innominatum, about the rim of the aeetabulum, being the
part generally met with. In one instance, however, a very large
portion of the pelvis of one of the larger animals was found, consisting
of the greater part of one os innominatum, and the sacrum.           Nearly
perfect specimens of large scapulte were in a few cases obtained,
while fragments of the scapula: of smaller animals, generally con‘
 sisting of the articular head of the bone, with a portion of the neck
and the coracoid process, the blade being wanting, were of frequent
occurrence.     The remains of birds, although by no means common,
were often met with.
    “ There can be little doubt as to the
                                             comparative age of this ossi
ferous deposit.    From the presence of pebbles of Tertiary basalt and
tachylite, and the fact that the whole series rests upon the Tertiary
basalt of the district, its origin is certainly of post-Tertiary date. The
thickness of the series, the occurrence in the deposit of angular, as
well as rounded water-worn pebbles, together with the relation which
the whole series bears to the general level of the country, all point to
the supposition that it more probably belongs to the Pleistocene than
to the Recent period.”
    The series of specimens from those deposits shown in the Exhibition,
which may be taken as a fair sample of the whole, comprises various
remains of Procoptodon the Macropus of Mr. Anderson), Diprotcdcn,
Nototherium, molars and jaws of Phascolonus, and a large number of
the incisors described as Sccparnodon.       It will thus be apparent that
if Scepamodon were a distinct genus, it would be represented only by
upper incisors, while Phascolonus would be equally de<U+FB01>cient in these
teeth.    It is further noteworthy that all the Mammalian remains in
the collection appear to belong to extinct genera, there being no evi
dence of the numerous species of Macropus and Phascolomys, which are
so common in the Pleistocene of Queensland.           This feature suggests
that the Bingera deposits are somewhat older than those of the area
last named.
    Seeing what an important bearing the remains from Bingera have
on the question of the identity of Sceparnodon and Phascolonus,            I
requested permission from the Commissioners           of the Exhibition to
borrow some of the specimens so named, a request which was at
once most courteously acceded to.
    In due course I received from the Commissioners part of the right
 ramus of the mandible of Phascolonus, together with three imperfect

]_.890._|      Identity of Sceparnodon and Phascolonus.                 63
incisors of the so-called Soeprvmoclon.     Of these, the lower jaw and
the best preserved of the upper incisors are <U+FB01>gured in the accompany
ing Plate.
    The lower jaw (Plate 1, <U+FB01>gs. 2, 2a) has been much crushed,
and appears to have belonged to an individual just attaining maturity.
It contains the third and fourth molars in a perfect condition, the
second molar somewhat damaged, part of the root of the <U+FB01>rst molar,
and the base of the incisor.     The fragment agrees in all respects with
the nearly complete ramus <U+FB01>gured in the ‘ Phil. Trans.’ for 1872,
P1. 36, 37, and, like the latter, shows that Phascolzmus differs from
living Wombats in the relatively smaller size of the last molar, more
especially as regards its second lobe.    The Queensland specimen also
shows that the mandibular symphysis of the extinct form wasmuch
larger, and also relatively wider at its anterior extremity, than in
Phascolomys.      These features alone would, perhaps, be sufficient to
justify   the generic separation of the extinct form as Phascolonus, and
the great width of the anterior part of the symphysis is especially
signi<U+FB01>cant, as being apparently adapted to <U+FB01>t with the wide upper
incisors described as Sceparnodon.
    The fragment of the upper incisor represented in <U+FB01>gs. 1, 1a., belongs
to the right side, and accords closely with the specimens <U+FB01>gured in
the ‘ Phil. Trans.’ for 1884, P1. 12, as the types of Sceparnodon,
although it is still wider than either of those examples.    The cutting
edge is entire, and exhibits the same oblique bevelling on the posterior
surface that is shown in two of the specimens <U+FB01>gured by Sir R. Owen.
Both the anterior and posterior surfaces are covered by a coating of
cement, and while there is a well-marked layer of enamel on the ante
rior surface, on the opposite aspect this element is either totally
wanting, or reduced to a rudiment. The structure and colour of the
cement, enamel, and dentine agree in all respects with those of the
molars in the lower jaw of Phascolonus, and, allowing for their
greater relative width and <U+FB02>attening, the upper incisors accord in
proportionate size with the lower molars, as deduced from a compari
son with a recent Wombat.
    With the foregoing circumstantial evidence before us,     I  therefore
venture to consider that we are now justi<U+FB01>ed in de<U+FB01>nitely regarding
the so-called genus Scepamodon as based upon the upper incisors
of the gigantic extinct Wombat known as Phascolonus.            From the
great width of the upper incisors as compared      with the lower  ones, it
is pretty evident that the former must have worked somewhat
obliquely against the latter. An interesting question arises as to the
nature of the food which these excessively wide, and apparently fragile,
chisel-like, upper incisors were adapted to cut; but the answer to this
question    I must leave to those intimately acquainted with the recent
 and Pleistocene <U+FB02>ora of Australia.

 the end of last year in the course of an investigation touching the
 action    drugs on cellular structure carried out by Dr. Lauder Brunton
           of
 and myself, for the Royal Society.
     Arrangement     the Hepatic Columns in a Classical Liver Lobule.—
                          of
 The following arrangement         visible in a plane perpendicular to the
                                              is
 direction of the terminal vessels occupying the centre and the peri
 phery of such    lobule.
                      a      The columns of cells extend radially round
 the hepatic veins only in the direction of the portal veins, that        in                  is,
 three, four, or <U+FB01>ve directions    at  most.    In the intermediate region
the columns present a typical feathery arrangement.           The line from
which the columns diverge        will  be  called hereafter hepatic line of
divergence. A similar arrangement               found around the terminal
                                                          is
portal veins, giving  rise  to what     call portal lines
                                                   I,      divergence.       of
    Towards the portal lines      divergence the columns of cells become
                                         of
smaller in diameter, and join each other, becoming continuous with
narrow tubes lined with <U+FB01>at epithelium and having the character of
intermerliafe tubes.   These narrow channels open into more distinct
terminal bile ducts.
   Arrangement    the Bile Oanaliculi.-—The liver columns branch from
                      of
the portal lines of divergence      towards the hepatic lines.     This
branching       is,
               however,   generally  obscured by  lateral anastomoses,
but it becomes more evident when the bile canaliculi are distinct.
   Two sets of bile canaliculi may be recognised:
  1. The main canaliculi, occupying the axis of the columns of cells
and becoming comparatively wide in the portal zone       the branch          ;   it   is
ing of these which renders that of the columns so evident in some
specimens.
  2.  The lateral canaliculi, which pass between the cells forming the
walls of the main canaliculi.

1890. 1             Study   of   the   Vertebrate   Law.               65
  In addition  to these two sets of passages an intracellular branched
system of lacuna: may be described as forming the rootlets of the
canaliculi. These spaces open directly into the canaliculi, and have
been previously partly described by P<U+FB02>iiger and Kupffer. }
  Description of a True, Secretory, or Primary Lobu_le'.—-From what
precedes it follows that the liver tubes, instead of being grouped
round the terminal hepatic veins, are distinctly arranged in small,
pyramidal masses, which correspond to the lobules of other glands. These
lobules are composed of the tubules diverging from the intermediate
tubes found in the portal line of divergence, each set of intermediate
tubes opening into a terminal bile duct. An arrangement somewhat
analogous had already (in 1882) been supposed to exist by Sabourin,
but he had been unable to discover in healthy livers what he believed
to exist and had been obliged to fall back upon diagrammatic repre
sentations which are not altogether correct.
    Development of the Liver.-—Eberth and other observers since have
 recognised that the embryonic liver is composed of hypoblastic tubes
branching in a mass of mesoblast.      This being common to the liver
and all other glands does not explain the differences between these
 organs.    Between the third and sixth weeks of embryonic life (in
man)    nearly the whole of the mesoblastic tissue separating the hypo
 blastic columns becomes transformed into embryonic veins full of
 blood.    In other glands only a small part of that tissue becomes
 transformed into veins, the greater part remaining in the shape of
 interlobular and interlobar tissue.      In the liver, therefore, the
hepatic veins take the place of the greater part of the stroma of
 other glands.
    It is only around the oldest hypoblastic tubes which become ulti
 mately ducts, and at the periphery of the organ, that a little meso
 blastic tissue becomes transformed into <U+FB01>brous connective tissue
 (Glisson’s capsule).
    Structure of the Hepatic (7ells.——The mitoma gives unmistakable
  evidence of a further differentiation of parts of the trabeculae com
 posing it. These trabeculaa are contractile.
    The paramitoma is enclosed in the meshes formed by the mitoma,
 and is the chief seat of the anabolic and katabolic changes taking
 place in protoplasma.    The products thus formed probably under the
 in<U+FB02>uence of the mitoma accumulate in the midst of the paramitoma;
 when soluble, they permeate it; when insoluble, they are precipitated
 in the shape of drops or vacuoles, globules, granules, crystals. For
 these products only the name of Paraplasma should be reserved.
      In the paraplasma two kinds of elements may be recognised,
  namcly:—(1) those resulting from the katabolic process of the cell
  or other tissues (kataplasma), e.g., bile pigment; (2) those result
 ing from the anabolic processes (anaplasma), e.g., glycogen.      In the

       is to be remembered that, soon after the discovery of lobules in

the pig's liver by Wepfer (1664), Malpighi (1666) described these
lobules as being appended to the extremities of the vessels contained
in Glisson’s capsule. Ferrein (1749) showed that the liver, like other
glands of the body, had a tubular structure; but, as he included the
spleen among the tubular glands, it may be doubted whether he did
more than generalise on the basis of his observations on the kidney.
Three years before the publication of Kiernan’s paper, Miiller seems
to have noticed the pinnate arrangement to which I have given the
name of “portal lines of divergence ;” but there can be little doubt as
to the general acceptance of Kiernan’s views after the publication of
his observations in 1833 (‘ Philosophical Transactions     ’).The work
of Kiernan was in great part based on the result of injections through
the vessels.

IV. “On certain Conditions that modify          the Virulence      of the
       Bacillus of Tubercle.” By        ARTHUR RANSOME, M.D.,     F .R.S.
       Received November 29, 1890.
   It  isacknowledged by most pathologists that tubercular sputum,
dried up and broken into dust, IS the most common vehicle by which
the bacillus of tubercle isconveyed into the body.
   But its power for evil     isobviously modi<U+FB01>ed by a multitude of
conditions, some of them inherent in the animal body exposed to
infection, others due to external in<U+FB02>uences.  Judging from the facts
relating to the distribution of tubercular disease, its incidence in
certain localities, and especially its prevalence in badly drained,
badly ventilated, and imperfectly lighted dwellings,        has been
                                                            it
surmised that the three chief external conditions that mitigate the
virulence of the bacillus are: (1) a dry soil (2) abundance of fresh
air, and (3) light.
   But hitherto, few,  if any, direct experiments have been made to
 determine    the extent'to which these several in<U+FB02>uences      possess
mitigating powers.
    It true that Dr. Candler, in his work on the Prevention of Con
       is
 sumption, a<U+FB01>irms that light       the chief agent in destroying the

 bacillary virus, and Professor Koch, in his address to the Inter
 national Congress at Berlin this year, lends the weight of his great
 authorityto the same opinion; but, in neither case, is any proof given
 of the truth of this view.*
     It was in order to test the in<U+FB02>uence of light, air, and dry soils upon
 the virulence of the bacillus of tubercle that the following series of
 experiments were devised.
     It was decided to expose tuberculous sputum :—
     (a) In a locality (Bowdon) where the soil was                dry and sandy
  (about   100 feet   in thickness) and where very few cases of phthisis
 were known to have originated. It was to be placed in full daylight
 or sunlight, and exposed to abundant streams of fresh country air.
     (b) A portion of the same sputum would be exposed under similar
 conditions, in the same place, with the exception that it would be put
 into a darkened chamber.
     (0) A third portion would be taken to a small four-roomed tene
 ment in Manchester‘, on a clay soil, without cellarage—and badly
  ventilated, but it would be placed on the window ledge, with as much
  light  as could there be obtained.
     (d) A portion would be placed in the same cottage, but in a dark
  corner of a sleeping room in which it was known that three deaths
 from phthisis had occurred within the space of six or seven years.
     (e) Finally, a port-ion would be exposed to used air coming from
.a ward in a Consumption Hospital, in Bowdon, in darkness.                    These
 intentions were fully carried out.
     Two collections of sputum were obtained :—
     A. From a woman dying of phthisis, collected on April 25. This
  specimen contained comparatively few bacilli.
     B. Also from a. woman in an advanced stage of phthisis, collected
  on April 27.      This sputum contained abundance of bacilli.
     Sputum (A) was not considered to be very suitable for the purpose
  owing to the sparseness of bacilli; but it was decided to use it by
 way of control experiment ; owing to an accident, the portions exposed
 under conditions (0) and (d) were lost.
     These collections of sputum were divided into portions and placed
 in watch glasses marked A. 1, A. 2, A. 3, B. 1, .' . . ,B 10. Some
 of these watch glasses were exposed without further arrangement,
 but others, where there might be a possibility of infection, were
 enclosed in cages, so arranged that air could reach them through a,
    * [Since this   was written, I have learnt that Savitzky has ascertained that
 phthisieal sputum, exposed “at the ordinary room temperature, and generally under
 all common life conditions,” retains its infectiousness not longer than 2% months,
 and, other conditions being equal, a sputum dried in darkness loses its infectious
                                                                   ‘

conditions already noted, commencing on April 29, 1890, with the
exception of B. 9 and 10, which were started on May 2.             Most of
the specimens were withdrawn on June 3; but one, B.                10,  was
divided   on   May 13,   and  a   portion, B.  10a, was  introduced  into   a
glass bulb and exposed for several minutes each day to a current of
ozonised oxygen.                        .
   All the specimens     were then enclosed in a box and forwarded to
the Pathological Laboratory, Owens College, where Dr. Dreschfeld,
the Professor of Pathology, had kindly undertaken to carry out the
necessary inoculations.        Owing to various causes, some of these
operations were not commenced until June 27, l890, others until
July 10.      The animals used were rabbits, kept under favourable
hygienic conditions.       The dried sputum was mixed with sterilised
water,  to  form   a  pasty mass, and this was inserted into the sub
cutaneous tissue of the back.         All the instruments used were made
thoroughly aseptic.

    It will be seen that none of the four specimens of sputum exposed
to fresh air and light ‘on a dry soil conveyed the disease, but one of
the three portions exposed under similar conditions in darkness pro

    Of the two   exposed_ in the cottage in Ancoats in the light one
produced tubercle,     and of the two specimens exposed in the same
place,   in  comparative darkness, one causedtubercle, the other did
not.                                                         .       .
    Lastly, the specimen placed in the ventilating shaft from a ward. in
the Consumption Hospital, Bowdon, on a dry soil, conveyed the
disease, and the portion removed from it after ten days.and exposed
to the action of ozonised oxygen did not produce tubercle.
 ,  These experiments are toofew in number to justify the statement
of positive conclusions, but, so far as they extend, they go to prove
that fresh air and light and a dry sandy soil have a distinct in
<U+FB02>uence in arresting the virulence of the tubercle bacillus‘; that
 darkness somewhat interferes with this disinfectant action; but that
 the mere exposure to light in otherwise bad sanitary conditions does
 not destroy the _virus. There are also some indications that the
 presence of a cotton wool envelope may interfere somewhat with the
 action for good or evil of both good and bad air respectively.
     Further observations are now being made with sputum exposed by
 Professor Tyndall at Bel Alp, Switzerland, in light and darkness,
 each kind for 10 days and 14 days respectively, and compared with
 the same sputum exposed in the same cottage in Ancoats.
     The pathological results of these specimens have not yet been made
  out.   The results will be given in a future note.

    The object of the present paper is to endeavour to ascertain how
far the electromagnetic       theory of light, as at present developed, is
capable of giving a theoretical explanation of Dr. Kerr’s expe1_"iments"‘
on the effect of magnetism on light.
    In the <U+FB01>rst series of experiments, polarised light was re<U+FB02>ected from
the polished pole of an electromagnet, so that the lines of magnetic
force were perpendicular to the re<U+FB02>ecting surface; and in the second

1891.]        of Light      at the Surface      of a   Magizetised      ltledium.           77
series, the   light was re<U+FB02>ected from a polished plate of soft iron laid
upon   the poles of a horseshoe electromagnet, so that the lines of
magnetic force were parallel to the re<U+FB02>ecting surface.       In both
series of experiments, it was found that, when the circuit was closed,
so  that the re<U+FB02>ector became magnetised, the re<U+FB02>ected light exhibited
certain peculiarities, which disappeared when the current was off. It
was also found that the effects of maguetisation were, in most cases,
reversed when the direction of the magnetising current was reversed ;
that is to say, if the intensity of the re<U+FB02>ected light was strengthened
by a right-handed current, it was weakened by a left-handed one.
   In these experiments, a metallic re<U+FB02>ector was employed, and con
sequently the results were complicated by the in<U+FB02>uence of metallic
re<U+FB02>ection; it therefore seems hopeless to attempt to give a complete
theoretical explanation of these experiments until a satisfactory
electromagnetic theory of metallic re<U+FB02>ection has been discovered; and
this,   I believe,
                has not yet been done.
  There are,  however,  several non-metallic substances (such as strong
solutions of certain chemical compounds of iron), which are capable,
when magnetised, of producing an effect upon                      light; and the theore
tical explanation of the magnetic action of                       such substances        upon
light is accordingly free from the di<U+FB02>iculties surrounding metallic
re<U+FB02>ection.         I
                have accordingly, in the present paper, attempted to
develop   a theory which is applicable to such media.
   The theory, which is due to Professor Rowland, is founded upon the
following considerations :—
   It was proved by Hall* that, when a current passes through a con
ductor which is placed in a strong magnetic <U+FB01>eld, an electromotive
force is produced, whose intensity is proportional to the product of
the current and the magnetic force, and whose direction is at right
angles to the plane containing the current and the magnetic force.
Professor Rowland? has assumed that this result holds good in a
dielectric which is under the action of a strong magnetic force;
accordingly the general equations of electromotive force become
                            1#=

where d,      are the components of the external magnetic force, and

medium.                                                           .
  Writing         p1   = Ca, &c.,    it   follows that,   if   the medium      is   isotropic,
the equations of electric displacement are of the form

       The boundary conditions are : continuity of magnetic induction and
    electric displacement perpendicular to the re<U+FB02>ecting surface, the
    latter of which is equivalent to continuity of magnetic force perpen
    dicular to the plane of incidence; continuity of magnetic force along
    the line of intersection of the plane of incidence with the re<U+FB02>ecting
    surface ; continuity of the rate at which energy <U+FB02>ows across the
    re<U+FB02>ecting surface.     Now the refracted light consists of two waves,
    circularly polarised in opposite directions, and the re<U+FB02>ected light is
    elliptically polarised; we have, therefore, four equations to determine
    the amplitudes of the two refracted waves, and the amplitudes of the
    two components of the re<U+FB02>ected wave.
       The results of the paper agree with Dr. Kerr's experiments in the
    following particulars :—
       (i.) The re<U+FB02>ected light is elliptically polarised.
        (ii.) When the magnetisation is parallel to the re<U+FB02>ecting surface,
    no effect is produced when the incidence is normal, or when the plane
    of incidence is perpendicular to the direction of mngnetisation.
l
       (iii.) When the plane of incidence is parallel to the direction of
    magnetisation, and the light is polarised in the plane of incidence,
    the magnetic term increases from grazing incidence to a maximum
    value, and then decreases to normal incidence.
       The principal point of disagreement                is,
                                                   that in all cases the inten
    sity of the re<U+FB02>ected light       unchanged when the direction of the
                                           is
    magnetising current      reversed.
                               is
     I     do not think that the results of the theory can be considered
    altogether unsatisfactory, since they certainly explain some of Dr.
    Kerr's experimental results; and          am disposed to think that the
                                                 I
    disagreement    isdue to the disturbing in<U+FB02>uence of metallic re<U+FB02>ection.
    At the same time, the question         one which can only be decided by
                                                is
    experiment, and       it therefore most desirable that experiments on
                               is
    magnetised    solutions should  be made.
    IV.    “ Further Contributions to the Metallurgy of Bismuth."

           Mines.  Communicated by Sir G. G. STOKES, Bart,  .R.S.                      F
           Received December 22, 1890.
         In October, 1837,   I read a paper before the Royal Society‘ upon
    a    new method      which  I incidentally discovered while working with
    a  view to separate copper from bismuth, by fusion with bismuth
    sulphide.

 1891.]               to the Metallua-gy   of Bismuth.
    I  stated in this paper that bismuth “frequently contains a small
proportion of copper, an element most detrimental even in small
traces, and hitherto only eliminated by a wet process, costly in prac
tice and tedious in operation.        It is necessary by such method to
dissolve up the whole of the alloy, and precipitate the bismuth in the
usual manner—a bulky operation, and one requiring a considerable
amount of time. It became therefore advisable, in order to treat
cupriferous bismuth rapidly and upon a commercial scale, to effect
this separation, if possible, by means of a dry process.”
    In further researches in the metallurgy of this interesting metal,
a case was found in which bismuth contained a very small proportion
of copper, under 0'5 per cent., but sufficient to render the metal use
less, and in fact, to destroy those characteristic properties upon which
its industrial applications depend.
    Instead of treating this cupriferous bismuth by fusion with bis
muth sulphide, which necessitates a temperature suf<U+FB01>ciently elevated
to bring about a complete fusion of the bismuth sulphide, and conse
quently, unless very great care be taken, great loss by volatilisation
of bismuth, it occurred to me to fuse the alloy, and, at a temperature
a little above its melting point, to add a small proportion of sodium
monosulphide.      The mass was then stirred well, so as to bring every
portion of the fused alloy into contact with the fused sulphide.
    After about one hour’s stirring, a test was made of the molten
metal, and it was found that the amount of copper in it was very
considerably decreased.          .
    By skimming off the <U+FB01>lm of scoria which had risen to the surface,
adding a further small proportion of the sodium monosulphide, and
continuing the operation of stirring, every trace of copper was
 eliminated, and the bismuth so freed from copper rendered in every
 way suitable for industrial use.
    The <U+FB01>rst experiment was made upon a quantity of 105 kilograms,
 which yielded 94 kilograms of bismuth free from copper, and about
 11 kilograms of skimmings containing the whole of the copper, their
 bismuth contents of course being available for reduction with further
 and larger quantities of skimmings as they accumulated.
     This process has been repeated upon very considerable quantities
 of cupriferous bismuth, and has proved to be successful.
    This question of keeping the temperature low is of much import
 ance, for the lower the temperature the less tendency there is for the
 bismuth to volatilise, and as it is necessary to obtain the bismuth
 free from traces of impurity, which entirely change its nature, it will
 be seen that any improvement in manipulation, or in the process
 itself, which enables pure metal to be obtained possesses much
interest.

I. “On the Rate of Propagation of the Luminous Discharge
         of Electricity through a Rare<U+FB01>ed Gas.” By J. J. THOM
         SON, M.A., F.R.S., Cavendish Professor of Experimental
         Physics, Cambridge.          Received January 2, 1891.
   Though the determination of the velocity of propagation of the
luminosity which accompanies the electric discharge through gases
might well be expected to throw considerable light on the means by
which the discharge is e<U+FB01>ected, as far as            I can <U+FB01>nd, no attempts
seem to have been made in this direction since Wbeatstone, in 1835,
observed the appearance presented in a rotating mirror of the dis
charge through a vacuum tube 6 feet long; he concluded from his
observations that the velocity with which the <U+FB02>ash went through the
tube could not have been less than 2x107 cm. per second.                  This
very great velocity does       not  seem   to be accompanied by a corre
spondingly large velocity       of the luminous molecules, for von Jahn
(Wiede-n1ann’s ‘Annalen,’      vol. 8, 1879,   p. 675)  has shown that the
lines of the spectrum of        the gas in the discharge tube are not dis
placed  by as much as 1/410      of the distance between the D lines when

 1891.]    Luminous Discharge     of Electricity through a Gas.        85
the line of sight is in the direction of the discharge tube.   It follows
from this, by D6ppler’s principle, that the particles when emitting
light are not travelling in the direction of the discharge at the rate of
more than a mile a second, proving at any rate that the luminosity
 does not consist of a. wind of luminous particles travelling with the
 velocity of the discharge.
    Wheatstone’s observations only give an inferior limit to the velocity
 of the discharge.    Nothing was observed in these which indicated
 that the velocity of discharge was <U+FB01>nite. A method which would
 enable us to measure this velocity would also at the same time show
 whether the discharge always started from the positive or negative
 end of the tube, and so enable us to trace the course of the dis
 charge.
    In the following experiments     I have endeavoured to measure this
 velocity, and also to ascertain whether the main discharge starts from
 the anode or the cathode.      The long tubes used in my experiments
 were practically <U+FB01>lled by the positive column ; thus in the tube 50 feet
 long the positive column extends to within an inch or two of the
 cathode. All the experiments described below relate to the behaviour
of the positive column.
    Pliicker (Poggendor<U+FB02>"s ‘ Annalen,’ vol. 107, l859, p. 89) concludes
from the action of a magnet on the discharge that it starts from the
anode. This conclusion does not seem to have met with much accept
 ance; my experiments, however, fully bear it out, as I <U+FB01>nd that, except
 under exceptional circumstances, which will be described later, the
-luminosity of the positive column begins close to the anode and
 travels away from it.
    The experiments for measuring the velocity of the luminous column
 were after several preliminary trials <U+FB01>nally arranged in the following
way.     ABCDEFG . . . . L (<U+FB01>g. 1) is a glass tube about 15 metres long
and    5  mm. in diameter, which, with the exception of two horizontal
pieces of BC and GH, is covered with lamp black; this tube is ex
hausted, and a current sent through it from a coil giving sparks 6 or
7 inches long in air; the light from the uncovered portions falls on a
rotating mirror MN, placed at a distance of about 6 metres from BC ;
the light from GH falls on the rotating mirror directly, that from BC
after re<U+FB02>ection from the plain mirror P. The images of the bright
portions of the tube after re<U+FB02>ection from the revolving mirror are
viewed through a telescope, and the mirrors are so arranged that when
the revolving mirror is stationary the images of the bright por
tions of the tube appear as portions of the same horizontal straight
line. The terminals of the long vacuum tube are pushed through
mercury up the vertical tubes AB, KL. This arrangement was adopted
because by running sulphuric acid up these tubes the terminals could
readily be changed from pointed platinum wires to <U+FB01>at liquid sur

faces, and the effect of very different terminals on the velocity and
direction of the discharge readily investigated.    The bulbs in these
vertical tubes were also found very useful as receptacles for sulphuric
acid for drying the gas left in the tube.
   The revolving mirror was driven at a speed varying from 400 to
500 per second by a Gramme machine through which the current
from twelve large storage cells was sent. The mirror <U+FB01>rst used was
mounted on ball bearings such as are used for bicycles; the axle had,
however, too much play, and it was eventually discarded for one made
by the Cambridge Scienti<U+FB01>c Instrument Company, and designed by
Mr. Bartlett, the assistant at the Cavendish Laboratory. It is repre
sented full size in <U+FB01>g. 2. The spindle carrying the mirror M runs on
parallel bearings in the uprights A, A. The ends of the spindle are
 rounded, hardened, and polished, and are in line with but just do not

touch two set screws, S, S, whose ends are also rounded, hardened, and
polished. Directly beneath the end of each axle is a cavity, C, which
serves to hold the oil running down from oil cups placed immediately
above.     This arrangement was found to lubricate so well that there
was no appreciable heating even after long runs. The spindle is
made from square steel, the ends being turned down, and against two
opposite sides of the square centre portion, clutches E, E, for holding
the mirror M, are fastened.       The whole is accurately balanced.         The
bearings are attached to a heavy iron casting, which is <U+FB01>rmly bolted
down to a heavy piece of masonry.
    In order to get a su<U+FB02>iciently rapid rotation of the revolving mirror
the Gramme had to be geared up.          This was done by means of pulleys
mounted on ball bearings.
    A great many arrangements were tried in order to break the
 primary circuit of the coil, when the mirror was in such a position
 that the images of the luminous part of the tube would be re<U+FB02>ected by
 it into the telescope; after a great deal of time had beenspent over
 these they were all given up.       The reason why they will not work is
 pretty clear. The coil will not work when the primary circuit is
 broken anything like so often as 500 times a second, so that if the
 primary is to be broken by the mirror there must be very considerable
 gearing down between the mirror and the break, in other words, the
 mirror can -be moved through a very considerable angle without
 moving the break through more than a very small distance, but almost
  the smallest possible movement of the mirror is sufficient to send the
 images out of the <U+FB01>eld of view ; and it was found impossible to
 diminish the play between the mirror and the break to such an extent
 as to ensure that at a high rate of rotation the break took place syn
 chronously with the requisite position of the mirror.             The method
 <U+FB01>nally adopted was the primitive one of using an independent mercury
 break driven by a small Thirlmere water motor, and patiently looking
  through the telescope until the break happened to occur just at the
  1-ight moment.      This, though a. somewhat lengthy proceeding, was
  not found in practice to be any longer than when synchronism be

 tween    the break of the coil and the position of the mirror was
 attempted by arti<U+FB01>cial means.
     When the observations were made in this way, the observer at the
 telescope saw, on an average about once in four minutes, sharp bright
 images     of the portions BC and GH of the tube, not sensibly
 broadened, but no longer quite in the same straight line; the relative
 displacement of these lines was reversed on reversing the coil, and also
 on reversing the direction of rotation of the mirror.      These bright
 images are not the only      ones observed through the telescope; ill
 de<U+FB01>ned and widened images were much more frequent; sometimes
 these were widened out so as to <U+FB01>ll the whole <U+FB01>eld of view with a
 luminous haze, at others, the images appeared as broad bands, the
 boundaries of these bands not being in the same straight line; these
 images indicate a discharge lasting for a very much longer time than
 that which produced the bright sharp images which were the object
 of our attention. When these sharp images were very bright, it
 could be distinctly seen that they were striated.
    The displacement of the images from the same straight line is due
 to the finite velocity with which the luminosity is propagated; for if
 the mirror can turn through an appreciable angle while the luminosity
 travels from BC to GH, or vice versd, these images of BC and GH, as
 seen in the telescope after re<U+FB02>ection from the revolving mirror, will
 no longer be in the same straight line, but if the mirror is turning so
 that, on looking through the telescope, the images seem to come in at
 the top and go out at the botton of the <U+FB01>eld of view, the image of
 that part of the tube at which the luminosity appears first will be
 raised above that of the other. If we know the rate of rotation of the
 mirror, the vertical displacement of the images and the distance
 between BC and GH, the rate of propagation of the luminosity may be
 calculated.    The observations were made in the following way :——The
tube having previously been properly dried and exhausted, so that the
discharge would pass freely through it, one observer took his seat at the
telescope, the room was then darkened, and the coil set in action by
another observer, the observer at the telescope not knowing which of
the electrodes was positive and which negative; the mirror was then
set in rotation, and about once in four minutes, on an average, the
observer at the telescope saw the bright sharp images alluded to
above. When the observer had seen two or three of these, he stated
whether they were very bright, fairly bright, or indistinct; which
image was the higher, and by how much.        The distance between the
images was estimated in terms of the apparent distance between the
divisions of a vertical millimetre scale placed at GH when seen
through the telescope; the scale was not seen at the same time as the
image of the tube, so that the observation cannot claim any great
accuracy; different observers agree, however, under the same circum.

stances to within 25 per cent, and it is probable that, in our present
state of knowledge about the discharge of electricity through gases,
the points of most importance can be settled by a somewhat rough
determination of the velocity of propagation.
    Some hundreds     of observations     were made, and in every case in
which the observer declared        the images to be very bright, and in
every case but one in which the images were declared to be fairly
bright, the displacements      if there was not a very large air break in
the circuit) corresponded        to the luminosity travelling from the
positive to the negative electrode.           When AB was the negative
electrode, the luminous discharge arrived at GH, a place about
25 feet from the positive electrode, before it reached BC, which is
only a few inches from the cathode, and as the interval between its
appearance at these places was about the same as when the current
 was reversed, we may conclude that, when AB is the cathode, the
 luminosity, which is found only a few inches from it at BC, has
 started from the positive electrode, and traversed a path enormously
 longer than its distance from the cathode.           We thus arrive at the
 conclusion that the positive column, which in a long tube like the one
 under consideration practically <U+FB01>lls the tube, since it extends to
 within an inch or two of the anode, starts from the positive elec
 trode.
     In view of the probability that    the passage of the current from the
 electrodes to the gas might be largely in<U+FB02>uenced by chemical action
 between the electrode and the gas,        I repeated the experiments with
 electrodes of very diiferent kinds ; the result, however, was the same,
 whether the electrodes were pointed platinum wires, carbon <U+FB01>laments,
 <U+FB02>at surfaces    of sulphuric acid, or the one electrode a flat liquid
 surface and the other a sharp pointed wire.            Tne positive column
 starts from the positive electrode, even though this is a <U+FB01>at liquid
 surface while the negative is a sharp-pointed wire.
                  Velocity of Propagation of the Discharge.
     The -displacement   of the images of the two luminous portions of
  the  tube caused by the rotation of the mirror was equal to the
  distance between the images of divisions 1'5 mm. apart on a vertical
  scale placed at GH.      Thus, if T is the time the luminosity takes to
 travel from BC to GH, since the distance of the mirror from the
  luminous part of the tube is 6 metres, the circular measure of the
 angle turned through in the time T is 1'5/12,000.         If n is the number

   When the mirror was running at full speed, its rate was pretty
constant and, as determined by the note given out in a telephone
(taken for the sake of avoiding the noise made by the Gramme and
mirror to an adjoining room) when the circuit was broken once in
each revolution of the mirror, and also by the velocity of the band
driving the mirror, was about 490 per second. The distance between
the places BC and GH is 7 metres, so that if v is the rate at which
the luminosity of the positive column travels,

or rather more than half the velocity of light; but, as explained
before, this must be regarded as an approximation, rather than as an
accurate determination.       It is su<U+FB01>icient_ however, to show that the
luminosity of the positive column travels through a vacuum tube
with a velocity comparable to that of light.
   The preceding results hold when there is a short air break in the
circuit, but, if the air break is increased until the coil can only spark
through the tube with di<U+FB02>iculty, the luminosity seems inclined to
start from the air-break electrode, and the direction in which it
travels is not always reversed by reversing the coil.
   The fact that the main portion of the luminous discharge in a long
vacuum tube has its origin at the positive electrode may appear at
<U+FB01>rst sight inconsistent with the result that glow discharge takes
place more easily, that is, with a smaller value of the electromotive
intensity, at the negative than at the positive electrode.            Thus
 Faraday  states   that  the discharge   from  a sphere takes   place more
easily when the sphere is negatively than when it is positively elec
tri<U+FB01>ed.
   Again. ultra-violet light can produce a discharge from a nega
tively but not from a positively electri<U+FB01>ed piece of metal.           Thus
 Lenard and Wolf (Wiedemann's ‘Annalen,’ vol. 37, 1889, p. 4-43)
have proved that we can produce a cathode by allowing ultra-violet
light to fall on a negatively electri<U+FB01>ed plate, while no discharge
 occurs if the plate is positively electri<U+FB01>ed, and Hallwachs (Wiede
 mann’s ‘Annalen,’ vol. 34, 1888, p. 731) and Righi have shown that
 when ultra-violet light falls on an unelectri<U+FB01>ed piece of metal the
 metal becomes positively charged, 'i.e., the light converts it into a
 cathode.
    These considerations do not, however, seem to affect the question
 we are considering when the electromotive force is sufficiently great

to produce a discharge from the positive electrode; a much more im
portant consideration in this case is the relative time required by the
two electricities to leave their respective electrodes.        1f the time
taken by the positive electricity to leave the anode is very much less
than that taken by the negative to leave the cathode, and especially
if this second time is greater than the time taken by the luminosity to
pass over a considerable length of the tube, thereicould be no di<U+FB02>iculty
in understanding how the luminosity of the positive column, which
in these experiments practically <U+FB01>lls the tube, should have its origin
at the anode.
    Now, Spottiswoode and Moulton, in their very remarkable paper
                                                         ”
on the “ Sensitive State of the Electric Discharge         (‘ Phil. Trans.,’
 1879, p. 165), investigated the relative magnitudes of the times
occupied by the various processes which go to make up the electric
discharge, and by means of the phenomena which are observed in the
revocation of what are called by them relief e<U+FB02>fects, show (1) that the
time taken by the negative electricity to leave the cathode is so much
longer than the time taken by the positive electricity to leave the
anode, that the two times may be considered to belong to diiferent
orders of small quantities; and             that the time taken by the       .
negative electricity to leave the cathode is greater than the time
taken by the luminosity to travel over the length of the tube (in their
 case the tube was not very long) ; remembering these facts, the result
which we have obtained by the use of the revolving mirror need
occasion us no surprise.
    These experiments lead us to regard the discharge as the sweeping
 down of the positive electricity from the anode with an enormous
velocity (about half that of light in our experiments), accompanied
by what is comparatively a very slow discharge from the cathode.
    The fact that the positive electricity leaves the anode more quickly
than the negative does the cathode, explains a very prominent feature
of the electric discharge: the accumulation of positive electricity in
 the neighbourhood of the cathode.        The positive electricity arrives
at the region surrounding the cathode before the discharge from this
terminal is completed; thus there will, during the greater part of the
discharge from the cathode, be an excess of free positive electricity
in the neighbourhood of the electrode, and, if the discharges succeed
each other with su<U+FB02>icient rapidity, the positive electricity will
accumulate until the effect of its attraction is su<U+FB02>iciently great to
cause the negative electricity to leave the cathode as fast as the posi
tive electricity arrives.
    The explanation of the exceedingly rapid rate of propagation of
the positive column is of primary importance in any theory of the
mechanism of the electric discharge.       The theory which seems to me
the most probable is that the passage of electricity (or, from another

Mag,’ vol. 15, 1883, p. 432). Free atoms must, on this view, exist
in the path of the discharge to serve as the ends of the tubes of force
as they shorten.       If, however, we take this view of the discharge of
electricity,   the  chemical    decomposition attendant on the discharge
along the positive column cannot consist of the consecutive inter
change of atoms between adjacent molecules, for, since on this view
each atom would have to move up to the one in the adjacent mole
cule, the velocity of the atoms would have to be that of the discharge
of the positive column, viz., about half that of light. The existence
of a wind in the tube of this velocity is, a prion’, unlikely, and the
following calculation will show that it would require the expenditure
of more energy than we have at our disposal.
    Let us take the case of the discharge of a parallel plate condenser,
the distance between the plates being 1 cm.            Let F be the electro
motive intensity between the plates, K the speci<U+FB01>c inductive capacity

     Now, at atmospheric pressure, F for air is about 3 X 1012 ; we have
 seen   that v = 1'6 X 1010; hence, in this case, the kinetic energy of the
 atoms is about 8000 times that of the electric <U+FB01>eld.          If we had taken
 the case of a. gas at a lower pressure, the disproportion would have
 been   still greater.
     For this reason, the discharge along the positive column cannot be
 carried by atoms travelling at the same rate as the discharge; the
 same argument would also be fatal to -the view that the discharge
 takes place by the consecutive interchange of atoms between adjacent
 molecules.     If, therefore, we are to retain the view (which seems to
 me to be almost established by the results of recent experiments)
 that the passage of electricity is effected by the dissociation of the
 molecules in the path of the discharge, we are precluded from sup
 posing that in the positive column the discharge takes place by the
 molecules dissociating one after another, as the discharge comes up
to them. In a. paper in the ‘Philosophical Magazine’ for August,
 1890,   I  suggested that we could reconcile the dissociation theory
 with the observed velocity of propagation of the discharge (of which
 I  had, at that time, only obtained an inferior limit, and did not know
 that it started from the anode), by supposing that the molecules of
 the dielectric in the path of the discharge, before the discharge takes
 place, form themselves into a series of Grotthus chains, and that for
 the molecules which constitute any one of these chains, the dissocia
tion and recombination go on simultaneously. This may, perhaps, be
made clearer by a somewhat crude illustration.

     If A, B, C, D       represent  consecutive polarised molecules, the
simplest view of the discharge      would   be to suppose A to split up into
atoms, its positive atom going up to B and combining with the
negative atom of that molecule-; the positive atom of B is driven off’,
and travels to C and combines with the -negative atom, and so on. On
this view the velocity of the atoms would be very nearly that of the
discharge which other preceding experiments have shown to be
inadmissible for the positive column.         If, however, we suppose that
the molecules A, B, C, D, constituting a Grotthus chain, are split up
simultaneously, and that while the positive atom of A combines with
the negative of B, the positive atom of B is combining with the
negative of C, and so on, then, in the time which elapses between

   the commencement of the dissociation of a molecule to the end of the
   recombination    of its atom with those of neighbouring molecules. a.
   positive atom will have disappeared from one end of the chain and
   appeared at the other. Thus in this case, since the time taken for the
   decomposition and recombination of the molecules is independent of
   the length of the chain, whatever the length of the chain may be, the
   positive charge will travel from one and of the chain to the other in the
   same time, and thus the velocity of the discharge will be proportional
   to the length of the chain.     In the paper referred to above, it is sug
   gested that the high velocity of the discharge of the positive column
    is attained by the formation of Grotthus chains of suitable length,
   the column thus consisting of a series of separate discharges, the
   length of each discharge being that of the Grotthus chain; these
   separate discharges are made manifest in the stratification which is so
   striking a feature of the positive column, the space between the
   bright portions of two 8lZI‘ilB corresponding to the length of the
   Grotthus chain; thus, on this view, the strnti<U+FB01>cations are the mani
   festations  of the machinery which enable the positive discharge to
   travel at such a rate.    In the paper in the ' Philosophical Magazine ’
   it is shown that this view of the discharge agrees well with what is
   known as to the behaviour of strise.
       The preceding experiments show that the tubes of force which we
   imagine as stretching round the circuit, and contracting when the
  discharge takes place, are anchored almost completely to the negative
  electrode.    When the discharge begins to pass, the ends of these
  tubes near the positive electrode will be agitated in an approxi
  mately periodic way, electrical vibrations will travel along the tubes
  with the velocity of light, and, as one end of the tube is <U+FB01>xed, these
  will form stationary vibrations; these stationary vibrations may be
  conceived to give the molecules of the gas in the tube a certain
  periodicity of arrangement, and lead to the formation of the Grotthus
  chains of de<U+FB01>nite lengths, required by the preceding explanation.         It
  will be seen that this would make the position      of the striae depend on
  that of the negative electrode, so that when the latter is moved the
  striaa ought to be displaced; this effect has been observed by Gold
  stein.
      As an alternative to the preceding view, it might perhaps be
  urged that the luminosity of the positive column outruns the positive
  discharge.     This view, however, seems to be quite untenable in the
  face of Spottiswoode’s      and Moulton’s experiments on the sensitive
  state of the electric discharge (‘ Phil. Trans.’), for the relief e<U+FB01>ects
  observed in their experiments seem to show, without ambiguity,
  that the positive luminosity is coincident with free positive elec
  tricity.
      We have also no evidence that a gas can be made luminous by

 sudden alterations in the electric or magnetic intensity of the <U+FB01>eld in
 which it is placed, unless these are accompanied by the passage of
 free electricity through the gas.
    In order to get some further information about the laws which govern
 the propagation of the positive column, some experiments were made
 in which the discharge had to pass from the gas to mercury and out
 again from the mercury to the glass several times in its passage from
 B to Gr (<U+FB01>g. 1). The arrangement by which this was done is shown
 in <U+FB01>g. 3. Pieces of glass tubing, bent as in the <U+FB01>gure, with baro

metric tubes <U+FB01>lled with mercury attached to their lowest points,
were inserted in the circuit between B and G.        By raising or lower
ing the vessels into which the ends of the barometer tubes dipped,
mercury could be poured into or taken out of the bends in the tube.
There were in all six of these mercury electrodes introduced between
B and G. The displacement of the images, as seen through the tele
scopes, was observed         when the mercury was below the level of
the tops of the barometer tubes, and (2) when the mercury <U+FB01>lled the
bends of the tube, blocking it up completely in six places.            No
appreciable diiference could be observed between the displacements
of the images in the two cases.     When, however, the mercury was in
the tube, the discharge had very much greater di<U+FB02>iculty in getting
through than when its path was not interrupted by the columns of
mercury ; this was shown by the luminosity in the main circuit being
very much fainter, and that in a branch circuit leading to the air
pump much brighter, when the mercury was in the tubes than when
it was not.
   It  seems,  I think, pretty clear that what takes place when       the

'96       Prof.   J. J. Thomson. On    the Propagation   of the  [Jan. 15,
  mercury is in the tube is something of the following kind. The
  positive electricity rushes from the anode down the tube until it
  reaches the <U+FB01>rst mercury plug; it attracts the negative electricity to
  the nearer end of this plug, and repels the positive to the other end ;
  this positive electricity begins to leave the mercury immediately and
  travels down to the next mercury plug.
     The positive electricity which travels up to the <U+FB01>rst mercury plug
  and the negative electri<U+FB01>cation it produces on the mercury form an
 electrical double layer which takes some time to disappear, longer
 probably than the time taken by the electricity to travel from one
 end of the tube to the other.     The time the luminosity takes to travel
  from B to G will thus not be much affected by the mercury plugs;
  but, as the discharge leaves behind it a series of electrical double
  layers on the sides of the mercury columns nearest the positive
 electrode, the ditiiculty of forcing electricity through the tube will
 be temporarily increased.
     It is,.I think, worthy of remark that the e<U+FB02>bcts produced by dis
 placement currents render it impossible to predict the velocity of the
 discharge of electricity through a rarefied gas. For, if we consider
 the processes which accompany this discharge, we have, <U+FB01>rst, the
 production of the electric <U+FB01>eld ;. this causes an increase in the electric
 displacement, and in consequence produces magnetic e<U+FB01>'ects ; and the
 displacement current behaves as if it had inertia, travelling through
 the medium with the velocity of light.        When the intensity of the
 <U+FB01>eld is increased su<U+FB02>iciently to cause discharge, the electricity passes
 through the gas, and the electric <U+FB01>eld disappears.        The convective
 current formed by the passage of the free electricity is balanced by
 the displacement current in the opposite direction, due to the dis
 appearance of the electric displacement.       The discharge, therefore,
 does not produce a magnetic <U+FB01>eld, and has, therefore, no inertia.
 The velocity of propagation of this discharge will, therefore, be
 governed by di<U+FB01>erent laws from those which control currents pro
 ducing a magnetic <U+FB01>eld, and need not, therefore, have anything
 to do with the velocity of propagation of light through the
 medium.
    By adjusting the circumstances         under which the preliminary
 charging takes place, we can separate the magnetic force due to the
 charging by as long an interval as we please from the discharge.      We
 can also, by charging su<U+FB01>iciently slowly, make the magnetic force at
 any instant as small as we please; thus it is conceivable that we
 might have a copious discharge of electricity through a gas prac
tically unaccompanied by mngnetic force.
    The very remarkable action of a magnet on the electric dis
charge is not inconsistent with this view, as on it the discharge
 consists of two equal and opposite currents, of which only one is

189l.]    Luminous Discharge      of Electricity   through a Gas.       97
visible:   we  see the  action on     the   visible current, but not the
opposite one on the other.
    The most obvious explanation     of the remarkable difference in the
behaviour of the discharges from the anode and cathode is that it
arises from some difference in the chemical action between the gas
and the two electrodes.      I  have made ,a series of experimentsin
order to test this view, and have been led to the conclusion that
an explanation of this effect by purely chemical action is delusive.
At the same time I think that the necessity for the existence of
some action between the gas and the electrodeis shown by, the fol
lowing experiment.     In the ‘ Philosophical Magazine,’ vol-. 29, 1890,
p. 441 (On the Passage of Electricity through Hot Gases), Ldescribed
an experiment in which. cold electrodes were plunged into a hot
gas, such as iodine, heated until it dissociated, wheniitwas found
that no current passed through the gas until the electrode got hot,
when it passed freely.     The effect produced by the cold electrodes
seemed too abrupt to be altogether due to the cooling of the adja
cent gas by the electrodes.     I. therefore made the following experi
ment in order to test this point. If the effect is due to the cooling
of the gas, the temperature of the electrodes when the system begins
to conduct ought not to vary much, whatever may be the material of
which they are made; while if the effect were due to. chemical
action between the gas and the electrodes, we shouldvexpect con
siderable variation with different electrodes in the temperature at
which conduction begins.      I therefore attempted to measure roughly
the temperature at which conduction began (a) when the electrodes
were iron, (12) when they were platinum. -This was done by making
one of the electrodes into a thermopile placed in circuit with a
dead-beat galvanometer; in case (a) the thermopile consisted of an
iron plate with a German-silver wire, in case (b) of platinum foil
and a German-silver wire.         The electrode used as the thermopile
was dropped cold into the hot gases and connected up with the
main circuit. When the galvanometer in the main circuit <U+FB01>rst began
to show decided indications of the passage of ‘a current, the ob
server who was watching this galvanometer called to the observer
at the dead-beat galvanometer in the thermopile circuit, and this.
observer read the de<U+FB02>ection of this galvanometer.         From this reading
 the temperature of the hot junction could approximately be determined..
'.l1;e experiment was repeated, using, instead of the iron-German
silver couple, a platinum-German one, the platinum foil being
wound round an iron plate to make it heat up at approximately
the same rate as the <U+FB01>rst couple.        It was found that the conduction
began at a much lower temperature           when the electrode was iron
 than when it was platinum, indicating that some action between the
electricity and the gas was necessary for conduction.          I could not,

however,       detect     any di<U+FB02>erence     betweenthe positive and negative
electrodes in this respect.          The gases in which this effect was found
were I, HCl, and HI.
     I next   endeavoured    to see if I could detect any difference in the
chemical       action of chlorine on a metal positively or negatively elec
tri<U+FB01>ed.       This was done in the following way :—A and B (<U+FB01>g.         are

two coils of copper wire, of the same length, made from the same
hank of wire, and as nearly as possible alike in all respects: tliese
are <U+FB01>lled into two equal vessels which are connected by a U-tube

 1891.]    Lzmzinous    Disc/large of Electricity  through a Gas.        99
 <U+FB01>lled with   sulphuric    acid, which serves to indicate any di<U+FB01>erence
in the absorption of the chlorine by the two coils of wire.            The
vessel was exhausted and then <U+FB01>lled with chlorine, and A and B
were placed      in parallel with the electrodes of an induction coil,
giving sparks about an inch and a half long. In this way one coil
was positively and the other negatively electri<U+FB01>ed, and any dif
ference in the rate of combination of the chlorine with the metal
would show itself by the motion of the sulphuric acid in the gauge.
 Only a very small motion of the sulphuric acid occurred, and this
seemed to be accidental, as it was not reversed on reversing the
coil.    The difference between the rate of combination of chlorine
with a positively and negatively electri<U+FB01>ed metal must therefore be
small.
    Again, if the difference between the behaviour of the positive and
negative discharge were due to purely chemical action between the
gas and the electrode, we should expect this difference to be absent
in the case where the electrodes consisted of a volatile liquid or
solid, and the gas was the vapour of the electrode.          I tried three
cases of this kind: one in which the electrodes were water and the
gas water vapour; a glass tube was completely <U+FB01>lled with water,
then placed on the pump, and the water boiled away until only just
enough was left to serve as electrodes; the tube was then sealed o<U+FB01>
and cooled down until the vapour pressure was low enough to allow
the electric discharge to pass without di<U+FB02>iculty ; this tube, however,
had all the usual characteristics of the discharge through vacuum
tubes, including the negative dark spaces and the striations. In the
next experiment a similar tube was taken, the water being replaced
by bromine ; this, too, showed the usual di<U+FB01>erences between the dis
charge at the two electrodes, and similar appearances were presented
by a tube in which the electrodes were re-distilled arsenic and the gas
arsenic vapour.
   Another di<U+FB01>iculty in the way of explaining the di<U+FB01>erence at the
two electrodes by chemical action is that no diiference seems to be
made in the appearance when a strongly electronegative gas, such as
chlorine, is substituted for a strongly electropositive one, such as
hydrogen.                                        .
   I next endeavoured    to get rid of the electrodes altogether by trying
to get a circular discharge in an exhausted re-entrant tube without
any electrodes.    For this purpose the primary was generally a piece
of copper rod bent into a horse-shoe shape; the secondary circuit
was an endless circular glass tube from which the air had been ex
hausted.    A Leyden jar, charged by a Wimshurst machine, was dis
charged through the primary, and produced by induction an electro
motive   force round    the exhausted    tube.   When the secondary was
not shielded   from the electrostatic induction of the primary, it was

  could be observed, though the wet blotting paper is not a su<U+FB01>icicntl y
'
  good conductor to shield o<U+FB01> electromagnetic induction.
      The maximum integral electromotive force-round the secondary is
  shown to be VM/L, where V is the difference between the potentials
  of the coatings of the jar before discharge, L the coefficient of self-in
  duction of the primary circuit, and M the coe<U+FB02>icient of mutual induc
  tion between the circuits.            Though in- my experiments this was
  greater than the electromotive force requisite for a. discharge through
  gas at the same density between terminals separated by the length of
  the tube, not the faintest glow could be detected.                  All my e<U+FB01>orts to
  get a discharge through the secondary have so far been unsuccessful,‘
  and I feel sure that the ease of getting a discharge without electrodes,
  say by the motion of the upper regions of the earth's atmosphere
  across the lines of magnetic force, has been much over-estimated.
  Until, however, we have got a discharge without electrodes through
   nothing but the gas itself, we are unable to say whether the passage
   of the discharge from the positive to the negative electrode which
   occurs in gases is a consequence of having matter in two states in the

   II.  “  Note'on the Present State of the Theory of Thin Elastic
          Shells.”    By A. E. H. LOVE, M.A., St. John's College,
          Cambridge.       Communicated by LORD RAYLEIGH, Sec. R.S.
          Received January 3, 1891.
      In a paper read before the Royal Society in February, 1888, and
   published in Phil. Trans,’ A, of that year, I advanced a theory of
                    ‘
   the mode of deformation that takes place when a thin shell is vibrat
   ing. The theory was founded on the form of the potential energy
   function, obtained by a method adapted from that of Kirchhoff for
   plates.    It appears that, in case there are no surface-stresses on the
   faces of the shell, this function consists of two terms, of which one
   contains a certain function \V2 and the thickness 2h as factors, and
      * Since this paper was sent in to the Royal Society,    I  have succeeded in getting
   a discharge without electrodes  through a tube about 45 cm. in circumference.      The
   discharge did not exhibit any signs of stratificati0n.~——Jun. 23, 1891.

the other contains a function W1 and h3 as factors.                   The term W,
depends entirely      on   quantities a1, a2,  10',   expressing  the   extension of
the middle surface, while the form given for W1 contained only
quantities expressing the changes             of curvature.         Some previous
theories‘ proceeded as. if VV1 alone occurred, and, in fact, this was
the case with a, paper by Lord Rayleigh in ‘ Proceedings of the
London Mathematical Society,’ vel-13, 1882, on the “In<U+FB01>nitesimal
Bending of Surfaces of Revolution.”               In the latter paper, a theory
of the- vibrations of bells- was founded on an assumed type, viz.,
it was assumed that the middle surface remains uustretched.                       In
my paper it was shown that this solution of Lord Rayleigh’s
fails to. satisfy the boundary conditions which hold at the free
edges of the bell, and further that it is, in general, impossible to
satisfy these conditions, except by taking account of the extension.
I, therefore, proposed to substitute for the theory of Lord Rayleigh
one in which extension of the middle surface of the bell is re
cognised as taking place, and         I   did not see how to avoid the con
clusion that the term VV1 must be rejected, and the term W2 retained,
for the purpose of forming the di<U+FB02>ierential equations and boundary
conditions that govern the motion, in other words, that the exten
sion practically determines ev.erything—the‘ mode of vibration and
the pitch.
   Since that paper was written the subject has been investigated by
Lord Rayleigh, Mr. Basset, and Professor Lamb, and the results of
their work make it necessary to abandon the theory proposed.                        I
had overlooked a circumstance which shews that my theory of exten
sional vibrations is incapable of giving the gravest modes of vibration
of which the shell is capable, viz., the period given by Lord
 Rayleigh’s solution, founded on the assumed type, is,. in the limiting
case of vanishing thickness, in<U+FB01>nitely long in comparison                   with the
gravest extensional period.         Now it is a general dynamical theorem
that the tone obtained by assuming the type cannot be graver than
the gravest tone natural to the system, and it follows that the mode
of deformation corresponding to the gravest tone is not included
among the extensional modes.               This was pointed out by Lord
 Rayleigh in a paper read before the Society in December, 1888, and
published in the ‘Proceedings.’           It had still to be shown, however,
that vibrations mainly dependent on the bending could take place,
 and the boundary conditions be satis<U+FB01>ed.               Although this has not yet
 been done in any particular case, the suggestion thrown out by Mr.
 Basset* and Professor Lamb,1' probably contains the solution of the

 Shells,” ‘Phil. Trans.,’ A, 1890.

di<U+FB01>culty. Each of these writers has shown that, in pnrlicular statical
problems relating to cylinders, the quantities expressing the exten
sion csn be very small everywhere except in the neighbourhood of an
edge, and there they may increase with such rapidity as to secure the
satisfaction of the boundary conditions, the total potential energy due
to extension, which varies as the surface integral of hW2 over the
middle surface, being, nevertheless, negligible in comparison with
that due to bending, which varies as the surface integ-al of h3W,.
Mr. Basset and Professor Lamb both suggest that this may be the
solution of the di<U+FB02>iculty in the case of vibrations also, and their
results point to    method of approximation which might be applied
                   a.
to the general case, and such that it could be veri<U+FB01>ed by mathematical
analysis that Lord Raylcigh's solution, founded on an assumed type,
is actually a very close approximation to the state of things in any
part of a vibrating bell not very close to s free edge.
   It may be as well to point out what parts of the theory put forward
in my paper specially require revision. (1.) On p. 500 the alteration
suggested in Kirchhnff’s theory is erroneous ; the quantities u’, v’, w’
are functions of as,      and their di<U+FB01>sren<U+FB01>al coefficients must be intro
                        /8,

makes no di<U+FB01>erence to any of the results.            (2.) On   503, Art.

potential energy which            multiplied by h3 would have contained
                                 is
terms depending on the extension as well as terms depending on the
bending.     Mr. Basset has obtained, by a different method, the form
of this function for cylindrical and spherical shells, with these terms
expressed.     It follows that the form given for the potential energy
in equation (12), p. 505,     is only correct in case either (a.) the shell
is unextended, when its second line vanishes, or (b) the extension
the important thing, when its <U+FB01>rst line may be neglected; but
                                                                            it is
would most probably be su<U+FB02>iciently exact for the application of a

Wgh.     It appears,   on the contrary, that the values of 0,, 412, or can be
very small indeed everywhere except close to the edges, in such a
way that the integral of Wgh, taken over the middle surface,         is   very
small in comparison with that of Wlha.
   The remainder of the paper must be understood as giving a theory
of the extensional vibrations of the shell. Such vibrations undoubtedly
can exist, but they would be di<U+FB01>icult to excite, and the theory of
them has no application to vibrating bells under ordinary conditions.

            On the Chemical Phenomena of Human Respiration while
          Air is being re-breathed in a closed Vessel.” By WILLIAM
          MARCET, M.D., F.R.S.             Received January 3, 1891.
      In June,     1889, I had the honour of communicating a paper to the
   '
  Royal Society, which appeared subsequently in the ‘ Philosophical
                     ’
  Transactions for 18903‘ In this paper it was shown that the volumes
  of air breathed to form in the body and expire a given weight of
  carbonic acid exhibited a distinct tendency to fall with a local sub
  sidence of atmospheric pressure, and rice ccrsd.                   Since then an
  additional series of experiments, to which my present assistant,
  Mr. E. Russell, kindly submitted, con<U+FB01>rmed this result.                     Fifteen
  experiments       were    made    from  O to  2 hours   after  a meal, and <U+FB01>fteen
  also from 2 to 4 hours after a meal.                The results are disposed as
  follows, in the form of a chart (see next page), in which the curves
  for the volumes of air breathed to expire 1 gram C0,, are seen to fall
  most distinctly from nearly 767 mm. pressure to 742 mm.
      The object of the present investigation was to ascertain the effects
  produced on the chemical phenomena of respiration by re-breathing a.
  given volume of air for a given time, and I gladly acknowledge the
  valuable aid of my assistant, Mr. Edward Russell, F.C.S., in the
  course of this inquiry.             It was obvious that I could not risk the
  health‘ of those who, together with myself, submitted to experiment;
-
  hence the necessity of limiting the duration of the time for re-breath
  ing air, and      I  selected for this purpose a period of <U+FB01>ve minutes.           A
  certain volume of air to be re-breathed was settled upon from the
  beginning, and it was decided to take 35 litres, measured under atmo
  spheric pressure with every care. This air was held in a bell-jar of a
  capacity of 40 litres, and supplied with a scale, a thermometer, and an
  oil-gauge; it was maintained in suspension by a counter-poise, while
  immersed in a trough full of salt water. The bell-jar was, moreover,
  possessed of a regulating apparatus, keeping it in perfect equilibrium
  in every position, as it rose or fell in the tank.
      Four persons submitted to these experiments.              I head the list, with
  six complete experiments.              Next, my assistant, Mr. Russell, had ten
  complete experiments made upon himself; a former assistant, Mr.
  Hoskins, F.C.S., in accordance with my request, kindly submitted to
  eleven experiments,            and, <U+FB01>nally, W. Alderwood,          my laboratory
  attendant, who has been in my service for seven years, and is well
  quali<U+FB01>ed for this kind of work, had ten experiments made upon him.

The results from all these experiments will be found disposed in the
form of tables (pp. 1l3—1l6).
    I shall <U+FB01>rst give a short ‘account of the method adopted in the pre
sent inquiry, then describe the experiments, and <U+FB01>nally state the
results with which they have beenattended.        Two bell-jars were made
use of.                                                  _
    The air, in every one of the experiments quoted in this paper, was
inspired through the nose and expired through the mouth, a mode of
breathing easy to acquire, and soon becoming perfectly natural; the
person under experiment assumed the recumbent position in a deck
 chair, with the feet resting on a stool.
    It was necessary to begin by determining the volumes of air and
weights of carbonic acid expired normally, or in ordinary breathing,
 with the object of using these <U+FB01>gures as standards for comparison.       I
 need not say that every precaution was taken to obtain correct data
 on ordinary breathing.      Next, the other bell-jar was supplied with
 atmospheric air to be re-breathed.       ‘A correction might have been
 introduced for the CO2 naturally present, but from its small propor
 tion this correction was thought unnecessary.        On no occasion was
 the laboratory used for the evolution of acids or alkalis, and its
 ventilation was kept up by one or two open windows.
    After re-breathing 35 litres of air during <U+FB01>ve minutes, the person
 under experiment was placed in communication with the other bell
 jar, in such a manner that no air whatever was lost, or, in other
 words, while fresh air was inspired, the ewpimtion following imme
 diately the last expiration of re-breathed air was collected in the other
 bell-jar, now emptied of the expired air it formerly contained.     While
 this bell-jar was being <U+FB01>lled, the re- breathed air, from the other bell
 jar (after its volume had been read, and "temperature taken), was
 driven into an india-rubber bag faced with oil-skin, to prevent any loss
 of any CO2 by diffusion. This bag had been kept <U+FB02>attened down
 between boards weighted with a piece of iron weighing 20 lbs., a
 precaution taken to -empty perfectly the bag before it was used for
 storing the re-breathed air. The bell-jar, having thus discharged its
 contents, was ready to be used afresh.
     The person expired from 34 to 38 litres of air immediately after the
 re-breathing stage of the experiment, and he was now placed in com
 munication with the empty bell-jar; there was no loss of expired air
 through this passage from one bell-jar to another, and while fresh air
 was inhaled, the air expired was entirely collected, to the extent of
 from 34 to 38 litres, for subsequent analysis.    A chronograph showed,
 to a second, the time required in the various stages of the experi
 ment.
     Thus the whole history of the e<U+FB01>ects of re-breathing air was obtained,
  being divided ‘into four stages :——lst, natural respiration; 2ndly, air

 re-breathed; 31-dly, air expired immediately after re-breathing and
  with the inspiration of fresh air; 4thly, air breathed while no longer
  under the direct in<U+FB02>uence of re-breathing.
    The above is a general sketch of the investigation.        I must now
  beg leave to go into the details of the work.        The diagram on the
  next page illustrates  the  disposition of the instrument.
    The person under experiment, in the recumbent position in a. deck
  chair, held in his right hand an india-rubber tube connected with the
  bell-jar through a double-way cock, as I have explained in my last
 paper to the Royal Society. The cock was turned in such a
 position that the air inspired through the nose was expired into
 the open air, a little <U+FB02>ag showing the movement of the expired air
 through the tube. The experiment begins with the operator expiring
 through this tube into the external air.           When respiration has
 become perfectly ‘quiet and regular, the double-way cock is turned
 during an inspiration, and the air of the next expiration is collected
 in the hell-jar, which begins its ascending course. At the same time
 the hands of a chronograph are set in motion. After about 36 litres
 of air have been expired, the tube leading into the bell-jar is closed
 at the end of an expiration, and the chronograph is stopped.
    Some trouble was experienced in obtaining similar volumes of air
 expired in a given time, say, about every seven minutes.             I have
 come to the conclusion that most people do not breathe, even when
 perfectly still, exactly the same volume of air in a given time, and
 after an experience of many years, it was found that the best plan
 was to repeat the breathing two or three times, or more, in succes
sion, and to take, according to circumstances, either the mean of the
different experiments, or the result of the last made. Any experiment
di<U+FB02>"ering widely from the others was rejected.           The air collected
<U+FB01>nally was read off on the scale attached to the bell-jar, its tempera
ture was taken, the barometer read, and the air was analysed for the
determination of its carbonic acid, by the same method as that which
                                              ‘                            ’
has been described in the paper in the Philosophical Transactions
already referred to. The air left in the bell-jar was then driven out,
and the jar made ready for further use.
   The next part of the work is the re-breathing. Perhaps half an
hour has elapsed ‘since air was <U+FB01>rst collected for the determination of
CO2 in normal breathing; during that time the person under experi
ment has remained perfectly still in the deck-chair.          The bell-jar,
which has not yet been used, is now thoroughly rinsed with common
air and <U+FB01>lled with air to the extent of 35 litres. It carries an india
rubber tube, connected with the dome of the jar and supplied at the
end with a fork-shaped nose-piece (see diagram).           This nose-piece
has been ascertained to      <U+FB01>t  the nostrils of the operator, air-tight; a
second india-rubber tube, with a. mouth-piece at one end, is COIll1OCi-kd

at the other with a. U-shaped pipe, opening under the bell-jar in the
ordinary way. The bell-jar holding 35 litres of air is perfectly counter
poised, so that the operator moves it up and down unconsciously in
the act of respiration, while the oil-gauge on the bell-jar registers

   Placing the nose-piece in his nostrils. the operator breathes through
his mouth for a few seconds, then he takes the mouth-piece in his
mouth, and inhales the air of the bell-jar through the nose-piece, the
bell-jar falling; at that very instant the chronograph is started.   The
next expiration is from the mouth through the U-tube into the bell
jar, and so on, the air re-breathed circulating through the bell-jar.
After <U+FB01>ve minutes have elapsed, every attention is given to stop the
 inspiratory tube and arrest the chronograph at the very end of an
e:rp'i'rat'i0'n, while another assistant opens the double-way cock, con
nected through tubing with the operator. and disposed so as to lead
the air now expired into the other bell-jar; the operator drops the
nose-piece and takes an inspiration of fresh air, through the nose, then
he expires out of the mouth into the empty bell-jar. He was, perhaps,
beginning to feel a little uncomfortable ; sometimes a slight sensation
of want of air was experienced, but not always, and one of my subjects
hardly noticed any e<U+FB02>"ect. I think I was affected most of the four
who submitted to experiment, although it repeatedly happened that I
felt no discomfort of any kind, beyond perhaps a slight want of air.
   Fresh air is inhaled with an undoubted sensation of comfort, and
the volume of this air is in marked excess of the volume inhaled in
ordinary breathing. During the <U+FB01>rst two or three minutes, large
volumes of fresh air are inspired, then the breathing quickly subsides,
and before 36 or 37 litres have been expired it has apparently resumed
its usual rate, with the disappearance of all feeling of discomfort.
   I have stated above that the air re-breathed had been transferred
from the bell-jar into an india-rubber bag, allowing the bell-jar to be
utilised for collecting the air expired in the last stage of the experi
ment.         The india-rubber tube and double-way cock were so arranged
that by turning the cook the operator was placed in connexion with
the empty bell-jar, and during an inspiration of fresh air the cock
was turned, when the expired air was directed into that bell-jar.
   The rate of breathing had now become all but natural, or the
same as at the beginning of the experiment, giving indications that
the effects of re-breathing had apparently passed away; this question
was to be settled by the analyses.
    There were consequently four different samples of expired air to be
submitted to analysis for the determination of the carbonic acid they
contained.         The <U+FB01>rst sample was from air expired normally, the
second from air re-breathed, the third from air expired immediately
after re-breathing, the fourth from air expired after apparent recovery
from the eifects of breathing impure air.
   By the time breathing in the closed vessel had commenced, the air
expired normally had already been shaken with barium hydrate -,

samples from the bag and other two bell-jars were treated in the same
way.   The next day the barium carbonate had subsided, and the clear
<U+FB02>uid was titrated according to Pettenkofer’s method.     The reductions
to dryness, to 0° and 760 mm., were speedily made with ‘the help of
the table   Ihave given in the paper previously referred to.
   Let us now follow the changes occasioned by the re-breathing of
35 litres of air for a period of 5 minutes ; there were a few additional
seconds included, as the re-breathing had to be stopped at the end of
an expiration, which of course might not exactly correspond with a
lapse of <U+FB01>ve minutes. The following are the mean percentages of
CO2 contained in the bell-jar after its air had been re-breathed :—

consequently   in every case the air was becoming considerably
vitiated; yet it was only in the last minute that an unpleasant sensa
tion, if any, was felt.
   If we compare the amount of carbonic acid expired by re-breathing
35 litres of air for <U+FB01>ve minutes with the amount of carbonic acid
which would have been expired in the same time in ordinary breath
ing, we <U+FB01>nd invariably less CO2 in the re-breathed air than in normal
respiration ; this is shown clearly in the following table, in which the
CO2 expired in ordinary breathing has been calculated for the time
taken in the re-breathing stage of the experiment.

  It follows  that there is always less carbonic acid expired in a given
time when air is re-breathed than in ordinary breathing.          In the
present experiments the mean proportions varied for four di<U+FB01>erent
persons between 1 to 1041 and 1 to 1221; or, in other words, a
mean of 9'3 per cent. carbonic acid which would have been expired

    Thus it is seen that the CO2 in re-breathed air and in ordinary
breathing increase together from the lowest to the highest <U+FB01>gures.
This might have been expected, as the whole experiment must be con
trolled more or less by the phenomena of ordinary breathing for each
of the persons under experiment.
    There is another point of interest to he noticed with reference
 to the re-breathed air in the present experiment—the volume of this
 air, which originally was 35 litres, is no longer 35 litres at the con
 clusion of the experiment, but has undergone a slight reduction. The
 enquiry into this portion of the subject was not found so simple as it
 appeared to be at <U+FB01>rst, and, as the work progressed, precautions
 against errors had to be taken which had not been apparent until a,
 late period of the investigation. I, therefore, prefer to leave this
 part of the subject for future consideration.
    It has been stated that after re-breathing for <U+FB01>ve minutes the air
 of the bell-jar, and then admitting fresh air into the lungs, an in
 creased volume of air was inhaled attended with the expiration of a.
 greater amount of carbonic acid than in ordinary breathing.                              This
 will be seen in the following table, showing, for the same lapse of
 time, the mean results obtained on four different persons for ordinary
 respiration and while inhaling fresh air, immediately after the re
 breathing stage of the experiment.
     A consideration of these tables shows, with reference to the CO2
 expired, that there was invariably an excess, after re-breathing air
 for <U+FB01>ve minutes, over the weight expired in the same time in normal
  respiration; the mean relation being I to I237. In the case of

of air expired; they are invariably increased after re-breathing, or
while the person under experiment is still under the in<U+FB02>uence of the
want of air; the mean relation is 1 to 1307 ; again, in the case of
W. Alderwood the increase is the smallest, the proportion amounting
to  1  to 1'17 7.
   The excess of CO2 and of air expired when fresh air is breathed
immediately after the re-breathing stage of the experiment must be
due in a great measure to the increased amount of carbonic acid
retained in the blood, together with an instinctive desire of taking
into the lungs increased volumes of air, in order to rid the blood of
the carbonic acid it has retained.
   We now have to deal with the air expired <U+FB01>nally or in the bell-jar
<U+FB01>lled at the termination of the experiment.                               The mean volumes of
air and weights of CO2 expired per minute will be seen to approxi
mate to the corresponding volumes and weights expired in ordinary
breathing to such an extent that respiration may be considered as
 having returned to the normal condition.

   This table shows                unmistakably that the respiration had again
become normal before or by the end of the last stage of the ex
periment; the CO2 is all but exactly the same, while there is a very
slight increase by 3'6 per cent. in the volume of air expired, indicat
ing that there was perhaps an instinctive tendency to continue
breathing a volume of air slightly larger than usual, although the
CO2 expired was the same as in normal respiration.
   The following are the results obtained from the present inquiry :—
   1. On re-breathing air in a closed vessel less carbonic acid is expired
within a given time than in ordinary breathing.
   2. Those persons who emit most CO, in re-breathed air are those
who expire most air and CO2 in the same time in ordinary breathing,
and mce versoi
   3. On re-breathing 35 litres of air in a closed vessel for a period
of <U+FB01>ve minutes, the volume of this air undergoes a slight reduction.
   4. When fresh air is taken into the lungs immediately after re
breathing air in a. closed vessel, the volumes of air breathed and
weights of CO2 expired are greater than in ordinary breathing.
   5. The effects produced on the chemical phenomena of respiration
by re-breathing 35 litres of air in a closed vessel for a period of
<U+FB01>ve minutes have passed away in less than six minutes after the
breathing of fresh air has been resumed.
   It may be added that the number of experiments is insu<U+FB02>icient to
admit of any inquiry into the in<U+FB02>uence of barometric pressure on
respiration.

   The foregoing tables suggest the following remark :—“ The volumes
of air expired for 1 gram CO2 immediately after re-breathing air vary
but slightly from the corresponding volumes of air emitted in
-ordinary breathing; in every case except one, the volumes of air are
a little higher immediately after re-breathing.”

   In Part of this research (‘ Roy. Soc. Proc.,’ vol. 48, p. 116), the
author showed the in<U+FB02>uence of magnetisation on the passive state of
iron and steel, and he has now the pleasure of communicating to the
Royal Society the results of a further study of certain temperature
and other conditions a<U+FB01>ecting the passivity of these metals in con
centrated nitric acid.    The experiments of Series III, in this paper,
relate to the effect of temperature, and the observations of Series IV
refer to the in<U+FB02>uence exerted by nitric acids, of varied concentration,
on the passive condition of iron and steel.
                                 SERIES    III.
         Effect of Temperature on the Passivity of Iron and Steel.
   The bars selected for these observations were unmagnetised polished
rods, which had been previously drawn cold through a wortle; a pair
of bars of each metal were cut adjacently from one longer bar, and
then placed securely in the wooden stand, W; each bar was 8} inches
long, 0'26l diameter.     The U-tube containing 1} <U+FB02>uid oz. of nitric
acid, sp. gr. 1'42, was rigidly placed in an arrangement as shown on
<U+FB01>g. 3.    One limb, A, was surrounded by a tank containing water, the
other limb, B, by a tank of the same capacity, containing powdered ice;
the arrangement was such that the water-tank could be heated by a

Bunsen burner, and its tem-perature slowly raised, whilst the ice-tank
was kept full of powdered ice. A non-conductor of wood was put
between the ends of the two tanks so as to prevent the melting of
the ice; the bottom or bent portion of the U-tube was also enclosed
in a thick non-conductor of wood. A thermometer, T, was placed in
the water-tank. The bars we1'e in circuit with the galvanometer, and
soon after immersing them in the nitric acid heat was applied to the
water-tank, and the temperature of the nitric acid in that limb of the
 U-tube slowly raised to the temperatures required, whilst the acid in
the other limb of the U-tube was meanwhile maintained at a tem
perature of 32° F.
   The arrangement will be understood on reference to <U+FB01>g. 3, and
the electro-chemical results obtained are graphically recorded on
 Diagram 1.

   Curve      A gives the E.M.F between two wrought iron bars, and Curve B gives
the  E.M.F.     between two cast steel bars under the conditions recorded.
   The above experiments indicate that the wrought iron was less passive in the
warm nitric acid than the soft cast steel; the average E.M.F. of, 94 observations
with wrought iron was 0'030 volt       ; whereas,  in the case of the 94 observations on
cast steel, the average   E.M.F.  was only  0'0l0 volt.
   It will be seen from the above diagram that the behaviour of the steel, under the
conditions stated, was more irregular than that of the wrought iron.
     In the whole of the above series of experiments on Diagram the                I
nitric acid was raised to a temperature of 175° F. ; the cold nitric acid
in the limb of the U-tube A remained perfectly colourless, and the
steel or iron therein absolutely passive; but the steel or iron in the
warm nitric acid in tube A commenced to be gradually acted upon as
the temperature increased, a pale yellow tint beginning to appear in

the solution in the tube A shortly after commencement.          When the
temperature of about 170° to 175” F. was reached a faint evolution of
gas in the form of bubbles was manifest, adhering to the steel, in the
 warm tube only.      No powerful solvent action or violent evolution of
 nitric oxide gas, however, occurred in any of these experiments even
 up to the temperature of 175° F., and these experiments were not
 continued beyond this temperature.        These results show that iron or
 steel does not fully lose its passivity up to a temperature even of
 175° F., though the passivity is shown to have been considerably
 modi<U+FB01>ed by temperature only. The critical point of temperature of
 transition from the passive to the active state is therefore higher than
 175° F., and is shown in the experiments of Part 1, Series II, Table II,
 to have been about 195° F.
                                  Smuns   IV.
 The Passivity of Iron and various Steels increases with the Concentration
                              of the Nitric Acid.
     Schiinbein considered that, “ by immersing an iron wire in nitric
 acid 1'50 sp. gr., it became likewise indiiferent to the same acid of
  1'35 sp. gr.,” and to all outward appearance this is so.
     Scheurer-Kestner considered that the passivity of iron was not de
 pendent on the greater or less degree of saturation of the acid.      The
 author, however, ascertained by the delicate electro-chemical mode of
  experimentation employed, and hereafter referred to, that the pas
  sivity is materially in<U+FB02>uenced according to the concentration of the
  nitric acid.
     The following experiments indicate that the property of passivity
  in iron is not absolutely <U+FB01>xed or static, but that its passivity is modi
  <U+FB01>ed to a certain extent in relation to the strength of the nitric acid
  used.    The general modus operandi was generally similar to that pre
  viously employed.     Pairs of unmagnetised polished steel bars 6 inches
  long, and 0310 inch diameter, each pair being of the same kind of
  steel, and cut adjacently from one longer bar, were placed as before
  in the wooden frame W, <U+FB01>g. 4, and then instantly and simultaneously
  immersed in nitric acids, of two different degrees of concentration,
  contained in the U-tube arrangement, one limb of the U-tube con
  taining red fuming nitric acid of sp. gr. 1'50, the other containing
   nitric acid of sp. gr. 1'42, circuit being made through the galvano
   meter in the usual manner.        The results, the average of repeated
   experiments in each case, are given on Table III, and show that the
   passivity of iron increases considerably with the strength of the nitric
   acid.

  The steel rods selected for this set of experiments were of the kinds .
given on Table IV; they were drawn cold through a wortle, and were
of the general physical properties and chemical composition given on
Tables IV and V.
   The reduction of E.M.F. towards the close was probably‘ owing to
partial di<U+FB02>usion between the two acids of different concentration.
   The above results show that wrought iron was less passive in the
weaker acid than most of the steels, the soft Bessemer steel being
found similar in passivity to tho wrought iron.
   The average E.M.F. was as follows :—With wrought iron, O'O5'l
volt; soft cast steel, O'O28 volt; hard cast steel, (T036 volt; soft
Bessemer steel, ()‘059 volt; tungsten    st-eel, O'039 volt.

Bxxmnmu      LECTUR1~l.——“_On
                                 Tidal Prediction." By G. H. Danwm,
       F.R.S., Plumian Professor and Fellow of Trinity College,
       Cambridge.     Received December        16. 1890.
                                (Abstract)
   At most places in the North Atlantic the prediction of high and
low water is fairly easy, because there is hardly any diurnal tide.
This abnormality makes it su<U+FB01>icient to have a table of the mean
fortnightly inequality in the height and interval after lunar transit,
supplemented     by tables of corrections       for the dcclinations and
parallaxes of the disturbing bodies.        But when there is a large
diurnal inequality, as is commonly the case in other seas, the heights
and intervals, after the upper and lower lunar transits, are widely
different; the two halves of each lunation di<U+FB01>er much in their cha
ractcrs, and the season of the year has great in<U+FB02>uence.      Thus simple
tables, such as are applicable in the absence of diurnal tide, are of no
avail.
   The tidal information supplied by the Admiralty for such places
consists of rough means of the rise and interval at spring and neap,
modi<U+FB01>ed by the important warning that the tide is affected by diurnal
inequality. Information of this kind affords scarcely any indication
of the time and height of high and low water on any given day, and
must,   I should think, be almost useless.
   This is the present state of affairs at many ports of some importance,
but at others a specially constructed tide-table for each day of each
year is published in advance.     A special tide-table is clearly the best
sort of information for the sailor, but the heavy expense of prediction
and publication is rarely incurred except at ports of <U+FB01>rst-rate commer
cial importance.
   There is not, to my knowledge, any arithmetical method in use

Government renders the prediction comparatively cheap, yet the
instrument can hardly be deemed available for the whole world, and
the cost of publication is so considerable that the instrument cannot,
or at least will not, be used for many ports at remote places. It is
not impossible, too, that national pride may deter the naval authorities
of other nations from sending to London for their predictions,
 although the instrument may,      I   believe, be used on the payment of
 certain fees.
    The object, then, of the present paper is to show how a. general
tide table, applicable for all time, may be given in such a form that
any one with an elementary knowledge of the Nautical Almanac
may, in a few minutes, compute two or three tides for the days on
which they are required.      The tables are also such that a special tide
table for any year may be computed with comparatively little trouble.
    Any tide-table necessarily depends on the tidal constants of the
particular port for which it is designed, and it is supposed in the
paper that the constants are given in the harmonic system, and are
derived from the reduction of tidal observations.              Where the obser
vation has been by tide-gauge, the process of reduction is that
explained in the Report to the British Association for 1883, but where
the observations are only taken at high and low Water, a di<U+FB01>erent
process becomes necessary.      Ihave given in a previous papera scheme
of reduction   in these cases.*
    At ports not of <U+FB01>rst-rate commercial importance observation has
rarely been by tide-gauge, and thus it is exactly at those ports, where
the method of this paper may prove most useful, that we are deprived
of the ordinary method of harmonic analysis.                  On this account  I
regard the previous paper as preliminary to the present one, although
the two are logically independent of one another.
    In the harmonic method the complete expression for the height of
water at any time consists of a number of terms, each of which
involves some or all of the mean longitudes of moon, sun, lunar and
 solar perigees; there are also certain corrections, depending on the
longitude of the moon’s node. The variability of the height of water
depends principally on the mean longitudes of the moon and the sun
and to a subordinate degree on the longitude of lunar perigee and
node, for the solar perigee is sensibly <U+FB01>xed.             There are, therefore,
two principal variables, and two subordinate ones. This statement
suggests the construction of a table of double entry for the varia
bility of tide due to the principal variables, and of correctional
tables for the subordinate ones ; and this is the plan developed in the
paper.
   The mean longitudes of the moon and sun are not, however, con
venient as variables, and accordingly the principal variables in the
                   * ‘Roy. Soc. Proc.,’ 1890, vol. 48, p. 278.

  132                       On  Tidal Prediction.                [J an. 29,
  tables are the time of moon's transit and the     time of year; whilst
  the subordinate  variables are the moon's parallax and the longitude of
  her node.
     The tide-table, then, consists of the interval after moon's transit
  and height of high and low water, together with nodal and parallactic
  corrections, computed for every 20'" of moon’s transit, and for about
  every ten days in the year.     Each table serves for the two times of
 year at which the sun’s longitude di<U+FB01>ers by 180°, and they may be
  used without interpolation.    The nodal correctional terms consist of
  two times and of two heights, which are to be multiplied by the
 cosine and sine of the longitude of the moon’s node, to give the total
 nodal corrections to the interval and height. The parallactic correc
 tional terms consist of a time and a height, which are to be multi
 plied by the excess above, or defect. below 57' of the moon's parallax
 at moon’s transit to give the total parallactic corrections to the inter
 val and height.
    I had hoped that less elaborate tables might have su<U+FB01>iced, but it
 appeared that, at a station with very large diurnal inequality, the
 changes during the lunatiou, and with the time of year, in the interval
 and height are so abrupt and so great, that short tables would give
 very inaccurate results, unless used with elaborate interpolations.     It
 is out of the question to suppose that a ship’s captain would or could
 carry out these interpolations, and it is therefore proposed to throw
 the whole of that work on to the computer of the table.
    Such apaper as this can only be deemed complete when an example
 has been worked out to test the accuracy of the tidal prediction,
 and when rules for the arithmetical processes have been drawn up,
forming a complete code of instructions to the computer.
    The port of Aden was chosen for the example, because its tides
are more complex and apparently irregular than those of any other
place which, as far as  I  know, has been thoroughly treated.
    The arithmetic of the example was long, and was re-arranged many
times.     An ordinary computer is said to work best when he is igno
rant of the meaning of his work, but in this kind of tentative work
a satisfactory arrangement cannot be attained without a full compre
hension of the reason of the method.        I was therefore fortunate in
securing the enthusiastic assistance of Mr. J. W. F. Allnutt, and        I
owe him my warm thanks for the laborious computations              he has
carried out. After computing fully half the original table, he made a
comparison for the whole of 1889 of our predictions with those of
the Indian Government.       Without going into the details of this com
parison, it may be  mentioned  that the probable error of the discrepancy
between the two tables was 9"‘ in time, and 1'2' inches in the height
of high water; that there were reasons to expect some systematic
difference between the two calculations, and that all the considerable

1 891                            Presen ts-.                           1 33'
errors of time fall on those very small_ri'ses of water which are of
frequent occurrence at Aden.
     I have
          made two other comparisons, one with the Indian predictions
of 1887, and the other with actuality of 1884. In the latter case, when
a few very small -tides were omitted, the probable error was 7'“ in the
time, and 14 inches in height. It is concluded from these compari
sons that, with good values for the tidal constants, the tables lead to
excellent predictions, even better than are required for nautical pur
poses.
   It is probable that this method may be applied to ports of second
rate importance, where there are not sufficient data for very accurate
determination of the tidal constants. Suggestions are made for very
large abridgment of the tables in such cases, accompanied, of course,
by loss of accuracy.
   The question of how far to go in each case must depend on a
variety of circumstances.      The most important consideration is, I
fear, likely to be the amount of money which can be expended on
computation and printing; and after this will come the trustworthi
ness of the tidal constants, and the degree of desirability of an accu
rate tide-table.  The aim of the paper has been to give the tables in
a simple form, and     if,
                         as seems certain, the mathematical capacity of
an ordinary ship’s captain will su<U+FB02>ice for the use of the tables, whether
in full or abridged,I  have attained the principal object in view.

to  it,lies immediately against the posterior layer of the lens capsule,
and at the canal of Petit may, perhaps, in part occupy the interstices
of the suspensory <U+FB01>bres, which are said to pass from the zonula to the
periphery of the lens capsule. Thus the whole anterior surface of
the vitreous    isbare, that is,   isnot invested by any membrane.
I     cannot agree with this view, for, in the eye of the ox,             Ihave
demonstrated to the satisfaction of large numbers of my students and
many members of the medical profession in Sydney, and at the Inter
colonial Medical Congress in Melbourne, 1889, that there                     un

doubt of its general occurrence, notwithstanding that Schwalbe, in

non-existence of the membrane.             This view was more explicitly set
 forth by Schwalbe in the anatomical part of De Wecker and Landolt’s
  Traité complet d’Ophthalmologie (Paris, 1886). Here, at p. 519,

 138                     Prof. Anderson Stuart.                     [Feb. 5,
differs from those formcrly given by me, in that I now consider the
 membrane limiting the canal of Petit posterior-ly as an arti<U+FB01>cial
 product, the result of the action of reagents (by precipitation or con
 densation). There     I agree with Iwano<U+FB01>.       I am bound, however, to
 maintain, in opposition to Meckel, the existence of the canal of Petit,
 such as    I have described it; that the zonula and the vitreous body
appear to touch each other is but the result of the compression which
they undergo during section.        And so a cleavage of the hyaloid near
the ora serrata does not take place.”       Iwano<U+FB01> says, “ In the vicinity
 of the ciliary processes the vitreous separates itself from the zonnla,
so that its entire anterior surface, or that which is turned towards
 the canal of Petit and the lens, is not covered by any special mem
 brane; neither by a prolongation of the limitans, as stated by Henle,
 nor by a. special membrane hyaloidea, as was formerly supposed.”
 Then, “At the ore serrate. the several concentric layers of the cortex
 (of the vitreous) are so crowded together that the surface of the
nucleus is separated from the limitans only by a. very thin but plainly
 <U+FB01>brous layer.    The <U+FB01>bres of this layer run parallel to the surface of
 the viheons in wavy bundles, and are not unlike bundles of connective
 tissues.   The entire layer, thus changed, <U+FB01>nally turns and passes
 towards the axis of the eye, thus completely covering the anterior
 surface of the vitreous. Since we here, in fact, have not a single but
 several layers crowded together, and only loosely united with one
 another, it is easy to see how one might suppose that behind the lens
 there lay a special membrane covering the corpus vitreum, especially
 since the most super<U+FB01>cial of these layers is perfcctl y smooth.” Finally,
“ The tissue of the vitreous is here condensed to form a
                                                             limiting layer,
in the same manner as Bowman‘s membrane is formed bye. condense.
tion of the substantia propria of the cornea ; an independent membrane
—the hynloidea—does not exist at this place.”
    What occurs to me then, considering the eminence of the authori
ties on each side of the question, is that the methods of demonstration
have not been su<U+FB01>iciently conclusive.                           I
                                             After seeing it as ha\'e seen
                             I
it, and shown it to others, cannot for one moment doubt its existence,
for the proof of its existence could not possibly be more conclusive—
it can even be dissected oil’ and examined in any perfectly fresh
unaltered ox eye.
    As Aeby has already,    I  find, published, the eyeball is best left to
decompose for some twenty-four hours or longer, according to the
external temperature, and then, on opening the sclerotic and choroid
tissues carefully with <U+FB01>ne blunt-pointed scissors, the vitreous and lens,
united by the suspensnry ligament, drop out in a mass, or at least
are very easily expressed.     The suspensory ligament is now snipped
all round, and the lens in its capsule removed.
    When this has been done, according to the one side, the bed of the

  1891.]      On  the Fossa Patellaris  of the Corpus  Vitreum.        139
 lens—the fossa patellaris—and the posterior wall of the canal of
 Petit (now opened up) would be bounded or lined immediately by
 the substance of the corpus vitreum. According to the other side—
 with which     I  entirely agree—there stretches from side to side a
 distinct membrane, so that in no part of its extent does the substance
 of the corpus vitreum reach the surface.      Let me now proceed to the
 proofs, which are of various kinds——chemical, optical, and mechanical.
     Chemical P'igmem‘s.—Aniline dyes and picrocarmine stain the
 capsule of the lens, the hyaloid, and other such elastic membranes.
 When the fresh corpus vitreum is so stained—and           I prefer strong
 picrocarmine for some three minutes, then washing in copious water—
 the hyaloid is perfectly well seen <U+FB02>oating in water, with its wrinkles
 on distortion and its well-de<U+FB01>ned free edge at a puncture. Exactly
 the same appearance is seen on the front of the corpus vitreum—here
 there is something that stains deeply and that wrinkles.        Moreover
 picrocarmine stains the hyaloid membrane and the vitreous substance
 differently: the former is red and the latter is yellow. The same
 difference is seen at the edge of a puncture in the <U+FB02>oor of the patellar
 fossa: the red membrane is quite distinct from the yellow vitreous
 substance.
    Optioal.—If', by means of a lens, the sun’s rays be concentrated
upon the hyaloid membrane, it is seen to have a <U+FB02>uorescent appear
ance, somewhat as if the surface had been bathed in a solution of
quinine sulphate.       That this <U+FB02>uorescent appearance is due to the
 hyaloid  is obvious  when  the concentrated rays are made to fall on a
 puncture in the hyaloid membrane.           The vitreous substance itself
 has no such appearance, but is clear and glassy, so that the puncture
is beautifully seen, and the edge of the hole is sharp and well de<U+FB01>ned.
Exactly the same appearances are obtained when we examine the
front of the vitreous ; the <U+FB02>uorescence is here too, and the difference
 between this appearance and that of the vitreous substance showing
through the puncture is very marked.
    Meclzan£cal.—When      a blunt-pointed instrument is gently pressed
upon the hyaloid membrane and then removed, the substance -recoils
simply, perhaps leaving a dimple for a little time; but, on pressing
more <U+FB01>rmly, there comes an instant when the instrument suddenly
sinks; one has the impression that a membrane has been punctured,
and that behind the membrane the substance is soft and inelastic. This
impression is at once supported on squeezing the mass of the vitreous
between the <U+FB01>ngers; a little elevation of the vitreous substance is
projected like a pimple through the opening in the membrane, and
recedes when the pressure is withdrawn.         When this is repeated in
the front of the vitreous, the results are identical.
    So far, I have not mentioned anything which might not be equally
well explained by supposing the existence of a dense super<U+FB01>cial layer

140         On the Fossa     Patellaris of  the  Corpus   Vii-1-eum.   [Feb. 5.
of the vitreous substance, but the membrane is no such thing; it is
a. true membrane;       it can readily be isolated, stained, submitted to
microscopical    examination,    &c.
    Even with the unstained vitreous, it is quite easy to introduce a
blunt instrument through a puncture in the membrane and, by working
the instrument about under the surface, to detach the membrane
from the surface of the vitreous substance.
    \Vhen this has been done, a. bell of air blown under it displays the
membrane to good advantage as a delicate, elastic, smooth, apparently
structureless, perfectly transparent sheet of tissue, answering most
                            “
completely to the term        hyaloid."    Though delicate, it is yet strong
enough to support the whole weight of the vitreous when a blunt in
strument is put into it.
    When, the bounding membrane remaining intact, the vitreous is
squeezed so as to bulge its anterior face, that face does not bulge
equally all over its extent.      The centre of the anterior face projects
more than the peripheral ring.          The central projected part corre
sponds to the fossa patellaris, where, as I shall show, the patellar mem
brane is thin, while the peripheral ring forms the back wall of the
canal of Petit, and here the membrane is comparatively thick.                The
transition from the peripheral to the central parts is fairly sudden,
for the central elevation rises from a distinct line corresponding to the
inner margin of the peripheral ring. The canal of Petit is, therefore,
a true canal.
    If the vitreous be inverted over the mouth of atest-tube (with a hole
in the bottom of it) of about -§ inch diameter, and tied over it with a
thick silk thread, and afterwards with a rubber band, the super<U+FB01>cial
part of the hyaloid and greater mass of the vitreous is out through.
It‘ now the vitreous substance be carefully pulled ofl’ by forceps, or if
the test-tube be set upright in a beaker, and water poured into the
beaker, the water rising in the tube will bulge the membrane so that
the vitreous substance will drain off it in an hour or so.                   The
membrane       thus isolated  is toughened    by  exposure   over  night, so that
such a membrane, though it looks like a mere <U+FB01>lm, yet sustained no
less a pressure than 40 inches of water; others sustained 22, 28,
34 inches, and so on, even after having been dead for days.
    If the membrane be snipped all round its periphery, it can be
detached as a whole from the subjacent vitreous substance.
    When it has been removed, little tags of deeply-staining material
are sometimes seen projecting from its deep face ; these,                 I  have
thought might be vestiges of the hyaloid artery; but, whether these
are there or not, there is little or no adhesion between the membrane
and the vitreous substance.
    When removed, and its deep surface brushed under water to
remove any adherent vitreous substance, it is seen to be a hyaloid

1891.]      Suspensory Ligament       of the Crystalline Lens,    <§-c.    141
membrane with a thin centre and thick periphery. Under the micro
scope it is structureless. On removal        it,
                                       of course, stains deeply, and
thus can be readily examined.
     When one attempts to raise   it  outwards towards the hyaloid mem
brane and suspensory ligament, one may succeed as far as the origin
of the suspensory ligament, but behind this point           it    so <U+FB01>rmly
                                                                  is
adherent to the vitreous substance that      it cannot be raised.
   The notion of membrane in front of the vitreous
                    a                                       issupported by
the behaviour of the vitreous body with its investing membranes
intact in water;    itwill remain many days with its form quite un
changed, and during all this time       it may be handled without injur
ing it. But    if the membranes be cut so as to expose the vitreous
substance to the action of the water, this substance protrudes and has
a cloud-like outline very different from the sharp, de<U+FB01>nite outline or
surface at the uninjured anterior face of the vitreous body where still
covered by membrane.         Now there     isnever any of this cloud-like
inde<U+FB01>nite outline or surface at      the   uninjured anterior face of the
vitreous body.    I  infer, therefore, that     it  not vitreous substance
                                                       is
that here comes into contact with        the water,  but that    it a mem

brane that   isnot notably acted on by water.
   After all these facts and considerations, cannot doubt that there
                                                   I
is in the perfectly fresh unaltered eye a membranous structure
behind the posterior layer of the lens capsule, and that this structure
has all the properties of a distinct membrane resembling the hyaloid,
but di<U+FB01>'ering in many respects from vitreous substance.
 I   need say nothing here as to the immense importance in many
questions of ophthalmological practice of         de<U+FB01>nite knowledge of the
                                                   a
existence or non-existence of a membrane limiting the vitreous body
anteriorly.

IV. “On    the Connexion between the $uspensory Ligament of
       the Crystalline Lens and the Lens Capsule.”  By T. P.
       ANDERSON STUART, M.D., Professor of Physiology in the
       University of Sydney, N.S.W. Communicated by Professor
       SCHAFER,     F.R.S.   Received January 12, 1891.
 I   have not been able to get too precise statement as to the nature
                                  a
of this connexion, but Quain (9th ed.) says the suspensory ligament
   “
is   <U+FB01>rmly attached” to the capsule; in another place Quain says             it
        ”                  “
“joins it. Speaking of suspensory <U+FB01>bres of the lens,” Quain says

142     Suspensory   Ligament   of the Crystalline Lens,  <§-c.    [Feb. 5,
that some of these “ pass into continuity with the posterior capsule."
Thus “attachment," “joining,” and “passing into continuity " are
the expressions used to indicate the connexion.        It is true that the
last is employed with regard to the suspensory <U+FB01>bres, but since these,
as described, are, like the suspensory ligament, derived from the
hyaloid membrane and pass like it to the lens capsule, I think we
                                     “
may assume that the author in          Quain" regards thcm—<U+FB01>brcs and
ligament—as of like nature and mode of union with the lens capsule.
    Schwalbc (‘ Anatomic der Sinnesorgane’) says the capsule is <U+FB01>rmly
united (verwachsen) with the zonula.        Later, he speaks of the outer
or zonular layer of the lens capsule being joined (in Verbindung) to the
zonula; then again of its <U+FB01>rm connexion (fesier Zuaammenhang) with
the zonula when he uses this intimate union as an argument in
favour of the zonular layer of the capsule being of connective tissue
origin. In describing the zonula he says that its parts fuse (ver
svhmelzrm) with the capsule without any perceptible line of demarcation,
and probably form the above-mentioned zonular layer.            Finally, the
mode of fusion is as follows: The coarser bundles break up into 1].
network of <U+FB01>ner <U+FB01>brils, which spread out on the surface of the capsule
and, becoming pointed, lose themselves (sich verlieren) in the sub
stance of the capsule.
    From the various statements, I think it is clear that the general
notion is that there is a direct continuity of substance between the
suspensory ligament and the capsule.        Now the observation which I
 am about to describe seems rather to indicate that the suspensory
 ligament is only cemented to the capsule.
    Upon opening some ox eyes that were in an advanced state of
 decomposition, I found that the lens was quite free in the interior of
 the eyeball; and, on examining it, Ifound that it was still enclosed in
 its capsule. This freeing of the lens I <U+FB01>nd to be the rule in such cases.
 On opening the capsule, the lens substance escaped, and on washing
 and staining the capsule with picrocarmine and other dyes, and on
 examining it in various ways, I have failed to <U+FB01>nd any roughness ct
  surface, difference of thickness, or, in short, any indication of a rup
  ture of tissue. The zonula seems to come away intact: is not broken
  or torn away. In fact, the decomposition seems to weaken the
  cohesion of some cement substance by which the zonula adheres to
  the surface of the lens capsule.
     This observation seems to weaken the argument for an outer layer
  of the capsule being of connective tissue origin, and it may throw
  some light on cases of solution and atrophy of the suspensory liga
  ment, on cases of detachment of the ligament from its insertions, and
  on cases of luxation of the lens.     In any case it has a. very direct
  bearing on the still unsettled question of the development of the lens
 capsule.

V.   “A   simple   Mode of Demonstrating how the Form of the
       Thorax is partly determined by Gravitation.” By T. P.

       University of Sydney, N.S.W. Communicated by Professor
       SOHAFER, F.R.S. Received January 12, 1891.
   It  is a well-known fact that the quadrupeds have the transverse
section of the thorax elliptical with the long axis vertical. This form
of thorax, more or less, is possessed also by the human fcetus. As
the erect posture is gradually assumed in the development of species
and of the human individual            the ventro-dorsal and transverse
diameters approximate to each other, and then, the process continuing,
in the adult the transverse diameter exceeds the antero-posterior.
   That these are the forms proper to the thorax when under the
in<U+FB02>uence of gravitation alone is seen by holding a hoop made of a
strip of ordinary crinoline steel é inch wide and about 6 feet long, so
that its plane is vertical ; its form is that of an ellipse.   Now grasp
the hoop <U+FB01>rmly between the fore-<U+FB01>nger and thumb of one hand, and
gradually turn the internal face of the portion grasped till it looks
straight forwards. The front part of the hoop will, of course, be
lower, corresponding in some measure to the slope of the ribs, (be.
At the same time the diameters approximate to each other. Con
tinue the turning till the face that looked straight forwards looks
upwards and forwards, so that in fact the plane of the grasped
portion corresponds to that in which the lower dorsal region of the
vertebral column of man lies.       The slope of the ribs is lessened, but
the interesting points are that the transverse diameter exceeds the
antero-posterior, and the exact curve and direction of the surface of
the lower ribs are reproduced.       Then are seen the twist in the long
axis of the rib and likewise that great hollow on each side of the
vertebral column which is so marked a feature in the human thorax.
   I  do not overlook the fact that the conditions in the organism are
not just the same as they are in this simple hoop ; but I think it will
be conceded that where there is a force so constant and so potent in
its action as is that of gravitation it will be yielded to by the
organism unless there be some good reason to the contrary.            Now
there does not seem to me to be any such reason here, and it is
interesting to observe how closely the thorax of the animal follows
the lines of the hoop of steel when the conditions as to gravitation
are the same.
   I  am thus led to suspect that gravitation has had a larger share
than is usually thought in moulding the form of the vertebrate thorax
both in health and disease.

VI. “ On the Physiology of Asphyxia, and on the Anaesthetic
       Action of Pure Nitrogen.”          By GEORGE JOHNSON, M.D.,
       F.R.S. Received January 26, 1891.
                                (Abstract. )
    The main object of this paper is to bring forward additional evidence
in support of the theory that the immediate cause of death in cases
of asphyxia is the arrest of the pulmonary circulation.         I have to
express my obligation to my friend Mr. Charles James Martin, M.B.,
B.Sc., Demonstrator of Physiology in King's College, for the time and
labour which, by my request, he has bestowed in the performance of
numerous and various experiments, the results of which will, I think,
throw much light upon the complex phenomena of asphyxia.             It is
right to mention that Mr. Martin is not responsible for my interpreta
tion of the results of his experiments.
    All the experiments were performed on animals under the in<U+FB02>uence
of anaesthetics, and every animal was <U+FB01>nally killed by deprivation of
air.
    Animals—rabbits, cats, and, in a few cases, dogs-—were asphyxiated
either by ligature of the trachea, by the paralysing in<U+FB02>uence of curara,
or by causing them to inhale a gas containing no free oxygen, viz.,
nitrous oxide, pure nitrogen, hydrogen, and carbonic acid gas. In
all these experiments, re-inspiration of the gases was avoided by
allowing the expired gas to escape through a T-tube <U+FB01>xed in the
trachea.
    During the performance of the experiments, in most cases, the
chest and pericardium of the animals were opened so that the relative
fulness of the cavities might be readily observed.      In all the experi
ments, the results, as regards distension of the heart’s cavities, were
essentially the same, no matter whether the air was simply excluded
or whether an azotic gas (i.e., a gas, not in itself poisonous, but
 unable to support life) was substituted for atmospheric air; the only
 difference being that when an azotic gas is inhaled the phenomena
 are far more rapidly produced, in consequence of the more speedy
 displacement of oxygen from the lungs.
    The principal changes in the heart’s cavities were, <U+FB01>rst, distension
 of the left cavities ; second, enormous distension of the right cavities
 with diminished distension of the left, the circulation being apparently
 arrested by the inability of the right cavities to empty themselves, in

consequence of obstruction in front.      That the arrest of the circula
 tion is not due to paralysis of the heart’s walls, by the circulation
of venous blood through its tissues, seems to be proved by the follow
ing experiment.           .
    Into the trachea of a small dog, with the chest and pericardium
opened and kept alive by arti<U+FB01>cial respiration, a glass T-tube was
introduced, through which pure nitrous oxide was passed into the
lungs, whilst the expired gases escaped into the air. As usual, <U+FB01>rst
the left then the right cavities became distended, and in one minute the
heart’s action had nearly ceased, with over-distension of the right side.
Then inhalation of nitrous oxide, impregnated with the vapour of m't'n'te
of amyl, was substituted for pure N20, by means of a two- way stopcock,
and the result was that almost immediately the distension of the right
cavities began to subside, and in two minutes they had nearly re
gained their normal size.
    The explanation is, that the circulation, having been arrested by
the contraction of the arterioles, was, for a time, restored by the
paralysing in<U+FB02>uence of nitrite of amyl upon those vessels, while
atmospheric air was strictly excluded.
    Additional evidence of the in<U+FB02>uence of the arterioles in arresting
the circulation during the progress of asphyxia is derived from the
fact that a su<U+FB02>icient dose of such agents as are known to paralyse the
arterioles, e.g., curara and atropine, prevents over-distension of the
heart’s cavities, and considerably prolongs the life of the animal.
    This is conclusively shown by experiments performed by Mr.
Martin, the details of which are given in the paper of which this is
an abstract.                                               ,
    It has been suggested that the distension <U+FB01>rst of the left then of
the right side of the heart in asphyxia is the result solely of systemic
arterial contraction, the impediment acting backwards from the left
side of the heart, through the lungs, to the right cavities and the
systemic veins.     The main objection to this theory is the fact that,
when the chest is opened immediately after death from asphyxia, the
 lungs are found extremely pale, from anaemia of their minute vessels,
and in a corresponding degree collapsed.       Backward pressure from
the left side of the heart, su<U+FB02>icient to greatly distend the right
cavities, must of necessity involve engorgement of the pulmonary
capillaries.
    That there is a certain amount of backward pressure from the
primary distension of the left heart, extending as far as the pulmonary
veins, would seem to be proved by observations made by Mr. Martin
to the e<U+FB01>ect that a manometer in a branch of a pulmonary vein
indicates an early and continuous increase of pressure during the
progress of asphyxia; but that this backward pressure does not
extend to the right side of the heart is shown by the fact that in the

 146                Dr. Johnson.       On   Asphyzia and the            [Feb. 5,
 last stage of asphyxia, while the right cavities are in a. state of
extreme distension, the left are, as a rule, <U+FB02>accid and comparatively
empty, the lungs themselves, as before mentioned, being extremely
anaemic and collapsed.        The condition of the heart's cavities in the
successive stages of asphyxia was clearly shown by an experiment
which Dr. Rutherford performed in my presence in 1873. The
details of this experiment are given in my paper (see diagram with
tmcing).
    The true explanation of these facts appears to be that, during the
latter stages of asphyxia, the pulmonary arterioles contract, and
cause the extreme distension of the right cavities with anaemia of the
pulmonary capillaries, and a corresponding defective supply to the
left cavities of the heart.
    The continued increase of pressure in the pulmonary vein, observed
by Mr. Martin, may perhaps be accounted for by the fact that in the
last stage of asphyxia the suction power of the left auricle is im
paired, partly by anaemia of the cardiac tissue, consequent on the
contraction of the artci-ioles—both             pulmonary and systemic, the
coronary    included—and      partly by   the  fact  that the small amount of
blood with which it is supplied is more or less completely de
oxidised.
    [I  venture    further   to suggest     the following explanation of the
increased     blood   pressure   which    has   been observed to occur in the
pulmonary veins during the successive stages of asphyxia. During
the <U+FB01>rst stage, when the left cavities of the heart are over-distended,
as seen in Dr. Rutherford’s experiment, there would be a backward
pressure extending through the pulmonary veins and capillaries,
even, perhaps, to the branches of the pulmonary artery; but this
backward pressure from the left side of the heart must obviously
cease when, in the last stage of asphyxia, those cavities are nearly
empty of blood.        When, however, portions of the ribs are removed
in order to introduce a manometer into one of the pulmonary veins, a
new and arti<U+FB01>cial cause of obstruction to the pulmonary venous
circulation is introduced.
    The collapse of the lung, which results from the breach in the chest
wall, compresses the thin-walled pulmonary veins more than the
corresponding arteries, and so increases the intra-venous pulmonary
pressure.     It is an acknowledged fact that the comparatively slight
compression of the pulmonary veins which occurs towards the end of
a normal expiration lessens the <U+FB02>ow of blood into the left side of the
heart.“"   It is obvious, however, that the pulmonary venous obstruc
tion thus eaused must be very much less than that occasioned by the
extreme collapse of the lung which results from an opening in the
wall of the chest.-—March 3, 1891.]

   Drs. Bradford and Dean have proved not only the existence of
pulmonary vaso-motor nerves, but also that they leave the cord
higher up than the systemic vaso-motor nerves (vide ‘Roy. Soc.
Proc.,’ vol. 45).
   These authors remark that “it is probable that the pulmonary
vaso-motor mechanism is but poorly developed, compared with that
regulating the systemic arteries.”
   It would indeed be an incredible physiological anomaly if the
vessels of an organ, through which the entire blood of the body has
constantly to pass, had not the same regulating and resisting power,
compared with the force of the right ventricle, as that possessed by the
                        '
systemic arterioles.
   Mr. Martin has found by introducing a manometer into a branch of
the pulmonary artery of a moderate sized cat, while the remaining
branches were suddenly obliterated, that the blood pressure was
rather more than doubled, rising from 17 mm. to 36 mm. of mercury.
   Mr. Martin also found that, during the last stages of asphyxia, the
pressure in the pulmonary artery is nearly doubled, while that in the
carotid is rapidly falling.
   No experiment that has hitherto been devised can accurately
measure the resisting power of the pulmonary arterioles or the actual
force of the right ventricle, for the reason that the arrest or great
diminution of the pulmonary circulation weakens the muscular walls
of the heart by cutting o<U+FB01> the blood supply through the coronary
arteries?‘
   The increase of systemic arterial blood pressure, which instantane
ously follows re-admission of air into the lungs, after the circulation
had been almost completely arrested by exclusion of air, seems to
prove that the heart’s walls are not paralysed by venous blood. On
the other hand, such a speedy restoration of the circulation is at once
explained by the sudden removal of the obstruction which had been
caused by the contracted           pulmonary arterioles.

Dr. Knoll endeavours to measure the normal blood pressure in the pulmonary

blood pressure is observed while normal respiration   carried on.

   That the immediate cause of death is the arrest of the pulmonary
circulation appears to be proved by the following facts :—
   1. When the chest of an animal is opened immediately after death
caused by a ligature on the trachea, the right cavities of the heart
are found enormously distended, while the left are comparatively
empty.
   2. When the heart of an animal is exposed during the progress of
asphyxia, the right cavities are seen to become distended, while the
left, which had been previously gorged, are found to be collapsed and
nearly empty.
   3. In the last stage of asphyxia there is a continuous            increase of
pressure   in the  pulmonary artery      while  the systemic arterial pressure
is falling.
   4. That the arrest of the circulation through the lungs is due to
the contraction of the pulmonary arterioles appears to be proved by
the in<U+FB02>uence of agents which paralyse the arterioles, namely, nitrite
of amyl, atropine, and an excessive dose of curara; the e<U+FB01>ect of
which is that deprivation of air is unattended by distension of the
right cavities of the heart and other evidence of obstructed pulmonary
circulation, the life of the animal is prolonged for several minutes,
and death ultimately results from the in<U+FB02>uence of venous blood upon
the cardiac and nervous tissues.
   The anlrsthetic action of nitrogen alone or with a small proportion of
oxygen.     The phenomena which result from the inhalation of nitrous
oxide as an anaesthetic are strictly analogous with those observed in
the early stages of asphyxia."
   Some writers maintain that the anaesthetic action of nitrous oxide
is due to its preventing access of free oxygen to the system, others
believe that it has a speci<U+FB01>c anaesthetic action.            It occurred to me
that light might be thrown upon this subject by the administration
of pure nitrogen. Accordingly I obtained from the Scotch and Irish
Oxygen Company, of Glasgow, a cylinder containing 100 cubic feet of
compressed nitrogen in which the proportion of oxygen was only
0'5 per cent. by vol., whilst that of the CO2 present was 0'3 per cent.
As a preliminary trial, Mr. F. W. Braine was good enough to admin
ister this gas in <U+FB01>ve instances to members of the staff of King’s
College, who volunteered to inhale it.
   The result was, in each case, the production of’ complete anaesthesia
and of general phenomena precisely similar to those observed from
the inhalation of nitrous oxide.          Encouraged by these results, Mr.

Brains felt justi<U+FB01>ed in administering the gas to patients at the Dental
Hospital. Nine patients took the gas. In every case, the result was the
production of complete anaasthesia, with general phenomena precisely
similar to those observed during nitrous oxide inhalation. The pulse
was <U+FB01>rst full and throbbing, then feeble; in the advanced stage
respiration was deep and rapid, with lividity of the surface, dilated
pupils, and more or less jactitation of the limbs; the only difference,
in the opinion of some of those present, being that the anaasthesia was
less rapidly produced, and somewhat less durable than that from
nitrous oxide, though in each case the tooth was extracted without
pain.
    On a subsequent occasion, the same gas was administered by
Dr. Frederic Hewitt at the Dental Hospital. Nine patients took
the gas. The maximum period required to produce anaesthesia
was 70 seconds, the minimum 50 seconds, and the mean time
583 seconds.
    In one case, two teeth were extracted without pain; in one only
was pain experienced, and in that case, the tooth having been broken
and not extracted, the patient said she felt a “ smashing up.”
    I subsequently obtained from the same Company a cylinder con
taining compressed nitrogen with 3 per cent. of oxygen, and a second
cylinder containing nitrogen with 5 per cent. of oxygen. These gases
were also administered by Dr. Hewitt to patients at the Dental
 Hospital, with the following results.
    Five patients took the 3 per cent. gas. Anaesthesia was complete in
 75 seconds (max.), and in 60 seconds (min.), the average time
 required being 67'-5 second.     In each case, the tooth was extracted
 without pain, the duration of anaesthesia being somewhat longer than
 with pure nitrogen. In each case there was lividity, dilatation of
 pupils, and more or less jactitation.
    Four patients took the nitrogen containing 5 per cent. of omygen.
 With this mixture, the time required for the production of anaesthesia
 ranged from 75 to 95 seconds, the average time being 87'5 seconds.
     In each case there was complete anaesthesia, during which one
 patient had three molars extracted.     Although she said she felt the
 last two, the sensation appeared to be that of a pull, and not of acute
 pain.
     In most of these four cases there was slight lividity before the
 removal of the face-piece.   In only one case was there slight jactita
 tion of the limbs; the other three patients were perfectly quiescent.
     For the information of those who may be disposed to investigate
 the anaesthetic action of nitrogen with a small proportion of oxygen,
 I  may mention that Brin’s Oxygen Company (69, Horseferry Road,
  Westminster) are prepared to supply nitrogen containing from 4 to 7
  per cent. of oxygen at the same rate as they charge for pure oxygen.

       F.R.S., Professor of Botany in the Owens College,
        Manchester.      Received January 22, 1891.
                                  (Abstract.)
    On three preceding occasions the author has directed attention to
the existence in the older Carboniferous rocks of a remarkable form
of fructi<U+FB01>cation which seemed to belong to the Calamarian family of
plants, though presenting features distinct from any that had hitherto
been described.       In the <U+FB01>rst instance, in 1871, he placed this fructi
<U+FB01>cation in Sternberg's provisional genus Volkmannia, under the name
of V. Dawsoni.       Some small fragments of the same type, obtained at
a later period by the late Professor Weiss, of Berlin, led him to
identify    the    plant with Binney’s hitherto very obscure genus
Bowmamltes, an identi<U+FB01>cation which is accepted by Professor Wil
liamson.      Still more recently, a number of additional specimens have
been obtained from the Ganister Carboniferous beds of Lancashire
and Yorkshire, which not only throw further light upon the plant,
but have made it possible to re-write its history in an almost complete
form.
     Like all the other Calamariaa, Bowmawites was a plant with a dis
 tinctly articulated stem, each node of which bore a verticil of lateral
 appendages. In the vegetative organs each of these nodal appendages
consisted of a verticil of the linear, uninerved leaves characteristic of
the old, ill-de<U+FB01>ned genus Asterophyllites.       In the fructi<U+FB01>cation these
foliar verticils are replaced by a. broad circular disk, the margin of
 which sustained a. verticil of leaf-like “disk-rays.”       These rays can
 scarcely,  at present,   he identi<U+FB01>ed with    true leaves, since they have

not only no midrib, but they seem to contain no traces whatever of a
vascular bundle.
    The centre of the axis of the strobilus is occupied by a conspicuous
bundle of barred and reticulated tracheids of the scalariform type, the
transverse section of which bundle is triangular, with concave sides.
 Each of the three prominent angles is abruptly and broadly truncated.
A thin inner cortex seems to have originally surrounded this bundle,
but all traces of its tissues have disappeared.    The thick outer cortex
 is composed of a mixture of rather coarse, strongly de<U+FB01>ned parenchy
matous and prosenchymatous cells. At each node this cortex expands
into the lenticular disk already referred to. This disk is thickest at
its inner border, thinning gradually towards its outer margin, where
it subdivides into the verticil of elongated disk-rays already men
tioned. Though no vascular bundles can be discovered connecting
 the central axial one with the surrounding disk, some such must
 have once existed, since we <U+FB01>nd them both in the cortex of the inter
                                                          ‘
 nodes and in the nodal disks.
    The entire upper surface of each disk has given o<U+FB02>’ numerous very
 slender sporangiophores, destined to reach three or four concentric
circles of sporangia, which were arranged in a single plane in the
 internodal interval between each two disks.        Each sporangiophore,
 unlike what is usual amongst the Calamariaa, only sustained a single
 sporangium.    In order to reach the more external ranges of the latter
 organs, the sporangiophores     were prolonged outwards in a distinct
 layer between the upper surface of the disk and the sporangia which
 rested upon it. Not only was this the case, but when each sporangio
‘phore reached the sporangium with which it was destined to become
 organically united, it did not at once do so; but it passed under, and
even beyond that organ, when it bent back upon itself and became
 united to the sporangium on its distal side. The outer, or epidermal,
 layer of the sporangium was merely an extension of that of the
sporangiophore.
    The numerous spores of Bowmanites have also a distinctive form.
 Each has a rather thin exosporium, but this is thickened along a few
reticulate lines, and from each junction of these reticulations a strong
radiating spine is projected.    It is in the very distinctive features of
 these reproductive organs that the marked generic individuality of
 Bowmanites chie<U+FB02>y resides.
    The second plant described      in the _memoir, under the name of
Rachiopteris ramosa, is one of the several Fern-like organisms which
the author has included in his provisional group of Rachiopterides.
Considerable doubt exists respecting the true a<U+FB02>inities of at least
some of these plants.     The one now described may prove to be a less
 hirsute, more fully developed condition of the Rachiopteris hirsute
described by the author in his Memoir      XV.

       C. THOMPSON, F.I.C., F.C.S.               Received January 24, 1891.
     The general methods adopted in carrying out the experiments
detailed below were identical with those described in Part II,* the
weighed metals being fused together under cyanide of potassium,
well intermixed by continued vigorous stirring, and poured into red
hot narrow clay test-tubes, which were then inserted inside thin iron
protecting tubes, closed at‘ the lower end, and immersed in a bath of
molten lead, maintained at as nearly as possible a constant tempera
ture by means of a series of Bunsen <U+FB02>ames playing into the inter
space between the cylindrical iron vessel containing the lead and an
outer concentric clay jacket.               Fluctuations of temperature, to a
greater or lesser extent, being unavoidable during long periods of
heating, notwithstanding all care, some of the <U+FB01>gures ultimately
deduced were less concordant than those obtained in the experiments
previously described, the mode of separation of a given mass into
two diiferent alloys being apparently more affected by temperature
variations with mixtures containing bismuth than with correspond
ing mixtures containing lead instead of bismuth.
     Our <U+FB01>rst experiments were made with the object of determining
the mutual solubilties of bismuth and zinc at different temperatures.
Matthiessen and v. Bose found (‘ Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vol. 11, p. 430) that
melted bismuth could dissolve zinc, forming an alloy containing 1293
to 1630 per cent. of zinc (excluding two determinations of 8'65
and 8'80 per cent. respectively,             presumably erroneous from some
undetected source of error); and that zinc could dissolve bismuth,
forming an alloy containing 2'38 to 248 per cent. of bismuth; no
record of temperature was made in these observations further than
that the molten metals were ultimately poured into “a porous cell
which had been previously heated to redness in a large crucible <U+FB01>lled
with sand.”
     We obtained the following <U+FB01>gures, approximately equal weights of
bismuth and zinc being melted together and well stirred up, the
mixtures being then poured into red-hot narrow clay test-tubes, and
heated in the lead-bath for periods of eight hours and upwards.

in a much more marked fashion.               The    formula     Zn,l3i.,    requires
Zn = 15'l, and Bi = 84.9 per cent.
                    Mixtures of Bismuth, Zinc, and Tin.
    Two series of experiments were made, one at a temperature rang
ing between 600° and 700°, and averaging near to 650‘; the other
ranging between 700° and 800°, and averaging near to 750°. The
results indicate that in presence of tin the solubility of zinc in bismuth
and that of bismuth in zinc are both materially increased by incre
ment of temperature.       A few experiments at a somewhat higher
temperature, averaging near 800°, were also made, the results of which
indicated a notable further increment in solubility ; but, as considerable
di<U+FB02>iculty was experienced in getting even moderately concordant
<U+FB01>gures at this higher temperature,          these observations were not
carried far enough to enable average curves to be deduced.         In every
case the mixture of metals employed contained equal quantities of
 bismuth and zinc with varying proportions of tin; as in the case of
the lead-zinc-tin alloys previously described, the e<U+FB01>ect of volatilisation
 and oxidation caused a small decrement in the proportion of zinc
 present in the compound ingots ultimately obtained relatively to the
 other two metals contained therein, especially in the experiments at
 the higher temperatures.
    In analysing the alloys prepared, we found that the method of
 analysis used for lead-zinc-tin alloys could not be adopted without
 modi<U+FB01>cation, because the stannic oxide formed by the action of nitric
 acid on the alloys retained variable amounts of bismuth in such a condi
 tion as not to be removed by copious washing with dilute nitric acid, or
 even by boiling therewith.‘     In some instances we weighed the crude
 stannic oxide retaining bismuth, and then fused it with sodium carbon
 ate and sulphur, whereby sodium sulphostannate was formed, soluble
 in water, and bismuth sulphide insoluble therein. By precipitating the
 stannic sulphide by means of hydrochloric acid from the aqueous solu
 tion, and cautiously roasting      the corrected weight of stannic oxide
                                    it,
 was obtained; this we found always concorded sensibly with the weight
 deduced by converting the undissolved bismuth sulphide into oxide
  (by dissolving in nitric acid, precipitating boiling with ammonium
 carbonate, and igniting the precipitate), and subtracting the weight
  of this from that of the crude stannic oxide.         In other cases, we
  dissolved the alloy in hydrochloric  acid  containing a little nitric acid,
  diluted and treated with sulphuretted hydrogen, separating the tin
  *   It   noteworthy that no trace of lead appears to be thus retained by stannic
           is
oxide when  alloys containing tin and lead are treated with nitric acid on the other
                                                                      ;
hand, when alloys containing antimony and lead are similarly treated, the undis
solved antimony oxide retains a notable amount of lead, just as stannic oxide retains
bismuth.

and bismuth     thus precipitated with ammonium sulphide.        Check
experiments made by both methods yielded sensibly the same tin
percentages.   In order to determine the zinc after removal of bismuth
and tin, we <U+FB01>rst precipitated it as sulphide, then dissolved in hydro
chloric acid, and precipitated as carbonate, <U+FB01>nally igniting and weigh
ing as oxide; this method of treatment being adopted to prevent
lime, &e., derived from the vessels used being weighed with the zinc,
as would have been the case had the precipitation as sulphide been
omitted.    Any traces of oxide of iron contained in the zinc oxide
were subsequently                      estimated and subtracted.
   The following <U+FB01>gures were derived from the examination of twenty
one compound ingots, the percentages being reckoned upon the sum
of the weights of tin, bismuth, and zinc found as 100. With some of
the lighter alloys, where zinc was the main constituent, only the tin
and bismuth were determined, and the zinc taken by di<U+FB01>erence.

   On comparing these mean curves with those described in Parts                       I
and 11, obtained with lead-zinc-tin alloys, it is evident that the solu
bility of zinc in bismuth is always greater than that in lead, whether tin
be absent or present to a given extent in each case; and that, in the
latter case, the rate of increment in the solubility of zinc in bismuth
as the proportion of tin present increases is more rapid than the
corresponding rate of increment in the solubility of zinc in lead.
Precisely similar remarks apply to the solubility of bismuth in zinc.
                   Mixtures of Bismuth, Zinc, and        S1.'Zz;e'r.
   It has already been mentioned in Part        II  that mixtures of bismuth,
zinc, and silver show the same remarkable behaviour as analogous
mixtures of lead, zinc, and silver, leading to the conclusion that two
de<U+FB01>nite compounds of zinc and silver are formed under appropriate
conditions, indicated respectively by the formulae AgZn5 and Ag,,Zn5 ;
of which the <U+FB01>rst is characterised by being capable of dissolving more
lead (or bismuth) than can either pure zinc or the second compound,
and of being more soluble in lead (or bismuth) than either of these;
also of being somewhat unstable, so that when a solution of lead (or
bismuth) in AgZn5 is kept molten for a long time it breaks up forming
zinc and Ag,,Zn5, which being unable to dissolve all the lead originally
present, causes the separation of lead from the liquid metal as a. heavier
alloy containing a little zinc and silver in solution. The second com
pound Ag4Zn5 is characterised by the peculiar red colour assumed by
a recently cut or <U+FB01>led surface exposed to the air for awhile, and by

to the zinc present, than either pure zinc or a mixture of zinc and silver

case the temperature    was  as near 750° as  could be managed, ranging
between 700° and 800°.      The analysis of the alloys was made by dis
solving in nitric acid, diluting, precipitating silver by hydrochloric
acid, and washing the precipitate by decantation with hot dilute hydro
chloric acid, in case any bismuth oxychloride might have separated.
'l‘h0 <U+FB01>ltrate was evaporated to a small bulk and treated with water, and
the <U+FB01>ltrate from the bismuth oxychloride formed treated with sulphur
i-tied hydrogen; the bismuth in the sulphide and oxychloride thus
obtained was determined by converting the joint precipitates into
oxide by dissolving in nitric acid, precipitating boiling with ammonium
carbonate, and igniting.     The zinc was determined as in the former
alloys,  and  corrected  for small   quantities of iron derived from the
crucibles,         dzc.

another eight hours. In this way a further separation was brought
about in the case of the alloys prepared with smaller proportions of
silver, but no material alteration in the case of those made with
larger proportions, just as with the lead-silver-zinc alloys.         On
plotting the results, a curve was obtained (No. 2, <U+FB01>g. 5) from which
the <U+FB01>rst maximum, at approximately the point representing the com
pound AgZn5, had completely disappeared, as had also the subsequent
fall, the curve exhibiting a progressive rise from beginning to end.
   Series       III
               was similarly made with the heavier alloys thus sepa
rated from the lighter ones ; the results, when plotted (curve No. 2,
<U+FB01>g. 6), showed that the abnormally large percentages of zinc observed
in the earlier part of the series had disappeared, whilst the diminution
in amount of zinc dissolved relatively to the bismuth present down to
a minimum and subsequent          rise again was still well marked, the
position of the minimum corresponding, as before, with a ratio of
zinc to silver not far from that indicated by the formula Ag4Zn5.

    On comparing together the relative eiiects on the solubility of
bismuth in zinc and of zinc in bismuth produced by the simultaneous
 presence of tin or of silver the same general result is deduced as in
 the case of lead-silver-zinc and lead-tin-zinc alloys, viz., that in each
 instance the solubility is considerably more increased by the presence
 of a given proportion of tin than by that of the same amount of silver.
 If 100 parts of zinc can take up 171. parts of bismuth in presence of
 a- parts of tin (or silver), and if 100 parts of bismuth can take up
 in parts of zinc       in presence of as parts of tin (or silver), then the
 following tables give the correlated values of m, n, and :0, these values
 being minima. in the case of alloys containing silver, 'i.e., being deduced
from those experiments where the in<U+FB02>uence of the presence of the com
 pound AgZn5 in increasing solubility was eliminated.

                             Suppose        three liquids such as water, ether, and alcohol, of which
                           the third    is   miscible in all proportions with either of the others, are
                           mixed together, the temperature being kept constant.   According to
                           circumstances, the mixture forms    single liquid mass, or separates
                                                                      a
                           into two. In the latter case,  we suppose that the liquids had been
                                                             if
                           merely gently poured together, and imagine the upper and under
                           portions separately to be homogeneous to start with, this state of
                           things would not remain; an alteration of composition would take
                           place close to the surface -of separation on both sides, depending on
                           the relative solubilities, &c., of the ingredients.   If now the two
                           altered strata were mixed up with the rest of the portions to which
                           they respectively belong, the same thing would go on again, and so
                           on till a condition was reached in which what we may call an
                           equilibrium of composition on the two sides of the surface of separation
                           had been attained.  As this equilibrium depends only on the molecular
                           forces, which are insensible                           evident that
                                                             at sensible distances,   it   is
                           the equilibrium would not be disturbed by removing a part of either
                           the upper or the under liquid, or by adding to liquid of exactly the

same composition as itself.       This <U+FB01>nal state would take place only
very slowly in the manner conceived above; but if the mixture be
well agitated the total surface of separation, where alone the Change
of composition can go on, is greatly increased, and, moreover, the
altered strata are mixed up with the rest of the liquids to which they
respectively belong, so that the <U+FB01>nal state is reached comparatively
quickly.    I  think  I   have seen an experimental veri<U+FB01>cation of this
anticipation, namely, that equilibrium depends only on the composi
tions of the upper and lower mixtures, and not on their quantities, in
a French serial, but    I  have not the reference.
   The same principles would apply to ternary alloys, which form a
homogeneous mass, or separate into two, as the case may be; but of
course the di<U+FB01>iculty of preserving a constant temperature is much
greater, as well as that of giving su<U+FB01>icient agitation to bring about
the <U+FB01>nal condition.
   It seemed to me that, for giving an insight into the results of
experiments with ternary alloys, a mode of graphical representation
might be usefully employed which is already well known. It is the
same as that which Maxwell used for the composition of colours, at
least with one slight addition.      In this way the whole of the circum
stances of the experiment, so far as they are material, would be
exhibited to the eye.
    Let A, B, C be three liquids, such as water, ether, alcohol, or else
lead, zinc, tin, in fusion, of which the third (which for distinction may
be called the solvent) may he mi.xed in all proportions with either the
<U+FB01>rst or the second. Take a triangle, ABC (<U+FB01>g. l), which may be of
                                     FIG. 1.

any form, but is most conveniently chosen equilateral; and, to repre
sent the composition of any mixture of the three, imagine weights
equal to those of the substances A, B, C placed at the points A, B, C.
and <U+FB01>nd their centre of gravity, P.     To each di<U+FB01>erent set of propor
tions A : B : C (the letters here denoting weights) will correspond a
di<U+FB01>erent position of P, which point will serve to represent to the eye
the composition of an actual or ideal alloy (supposing the substances
to be metals) formed of the three metals in the given proportions.
If  the quantity of the solvent be sufficient,   P will  represent on the
diagram the composition of an actual alloy.      If it be insu<U+FB02>icient, the
alloy represented as to composition by P will be ideal only; and on
attempting to form it the mass will separate into two layers.       If we
suppose the agitation to have been su<U+FB02>icient, there will be equilibrium
of solution at the surface of junction, and the mass will have reached
its <U+FB01>nal state. Supposing this condition to have been attained, let
the two portions be analysed, and the points Q, R representing their
compositions be laid down on the diagram, and joined by a straight
line.   From the construction, this line must pass through the point
P if there has been no loss by volatilisation or oxidation. Let the
same thing be done for several other proportions of the ingredients.
Then the points Q, R will lie in a curve aQLRb, cutting AB in two
points a, b, which represent, the <U+FB01>rst, a saturated solution of B in A,
the second, a saturated solution of A in B.          Call this curve the
critical curve, and the lines such as QR tie-lines, or simply ties. Then
the critical curve and the system of ties will represent the complete
result of the experiments, supposing them to have been exactly made.
Alloys of a pair may conveniently be called conjugate. Intermediate
tie-lines may be interpolated by eye; or if we prefer we may substi
tute for the system of ties their envelope, on which plan the result
of the experiments would be completely represented by two curves,
the critical curve and the envelope.
   The critical curve separates mixtures of which alloys can actually
be formed from those on attempting to form an alloy of which the
mass separates into two layers.     In the latter case, if through P we
draw a tangent to the envelope, cutting the critical curve in Q, R,
the points Q, R will represent the compositions of the portions into
which the mass separates, while their weights will be as PR to PQ.
   If L be the limiting position of the chord QR, or, in other words,
the point of contact with the critical curve of a common tangent to it
and the envelope, as P tends to coincide with L, the two strata into
which the mass separates tend to become identical in nature.        If we
take a mixture of A and B, represented by a point 0 in ab, and con
tinually increase the quantity of C from 0, the point P will ascend
from 0 towards C until it reaches the critical curve. At this stage‘
the quantity of the second alloy has just dwindled away to nothing,

its nature,   solong as there was any of it left, differing from that of
the other alloy.     If, however, the point 0 lies in the line CL, on
increasing the quantity of C the two alloys merge into one.
   On communicating to Dr. Alder Wright this mode of graphical
representation, he tried it on a large scale on the results of two pairs
of series from the former experiments.      In one pair the temperature
was 650°, and    the  proportion by weight of zinc to lead was 2 to 1
in the <U+FB01>rst case, and 1 to 2 in the second. In the other pair the
weights of zinc and lead were equal, and the temperature 650° in
one case and 800° in the other.      In the <U+FB01>rst pair the agreement of
the critical  curves  was very good, but the agreement in the direction
of the ties was not by any means equally good. In the upper part
of the <U+FB01>gure, corresponding to the case in which there was a con
siderable quantity of tin, though not enough by any means to pre
vent the formation of two layers in the entire mass, the di<U+FB01>erence of
inclination ranged to about 5“, the ties in the <U+FB01>rst case being inclined
to those in the second as if they had been turned round in the direc
tion of a line passing through the lead corner of the triangle, and
turning round in the direction from lead-zinc to lead-tin. In the
second pair of series in which the weights of lead and zinc were equal,
and the temperature was 650" in the <U+FB01>rst case and 800° in the second,
the critical curve for 800° was of the same general character as that
for 650°, but lay a little inside     it,
                                        which  is just what was to be
expected, on account of the increase of solubility attending the higher
temperature. Moreover, the critical curve for 650° agreed very fairly
with those for the same temperature in the <U+FB01>rst pair, notwith
 standing the diiference in the proportion of lead to zinc in the three
cases.
I    had not anticipated the greater accordance existing between the
critical curves in di<U+FB01>erent cases for the same temperature than that
shown in the direction of the ties. But, when the plottings revealed
it, it seemed to me that the cause was not far to seek. When the
molten mass has as yet been but slightly stirred, the superposed
alloys, supposed to be severally homogeneous, will most likely be
represented on the diagram by points, one or both of which lie out
side the critical curve.   In this condition an alloy represented by an
external point, having the metal      C  to spare, will be capable of dis
solving bodily     aportion of   the other.   This process accordingly,
being something analogous to the solution of a salt till saturation    is
obtained,   will
              go on as the stirring proceeds, and be sensibly complete
in a moderate time. The two alloys will then be represented by two
points lying on the critical   curve.   Such alloys may be said to be
associated. But the passage from merely associated to truly conjugate
alloys, as the stirring proceeds,islikely to be decidedly slower. For
now neither alloy can bodily dissolve any portion, however small, of

 the other; there can only be an interchange of constituents across
the surface of separation.
    The critical curve may be otherwise de<U+FB01>ned as the curve expressing
 the saturation of the solvent C with a mixture in given variable pro
 portion of the remaining substances A, B. That it is really such, a
 little consideration su<U+FB01>ices to show.    The determination accordingly
of the critical curve furnishes us with de<U+FB01>nite information, even
 though we do not go into the ulterior question of the condition of
conjugation.
    Perhaps the attainment of true conjugation might involve more
stirring than would be practically feasible with molten metallic mix
 tures.     The most hopeful way would seem to be to fuse the
 mass at a higher temperature than that intended for the experi
 ment, stirring it well, and then let down the temperature to that
 intended, stirring all the time, and avoiding too rapid a fall of the
 temperature.
    If  truly conjugate alloys were obtained, and portions of each were
taken     and fused together at the temperature at which the alloys
were made, the compositions ought to be the same as before.         But if
the alloys were merely associated, then, even if the stirring in the
 second part of the experiment were sufficient to ensure conjugation,
 the compositions would not be the same as the original, nor would
 they be independent of the proportion of the two alloys which the
operator took for fusing together.
    The triangular method of representation described by Sir G. G.
 Stokes in the above note obviously possesses several advantages, inas
 much as it represents in one diagram simultaneously a number of
results which the ordinary curves drawn with abscissa: and ordinates
can only partially       indicate, consequently     necessitating several
di<U+FB01>erent curves being drawn in order to represent graphically the
entire set of results; thus the two branches of the “ critical curve,”
obtained by directly plotting the <U+FB01>gures yielded on analysis of the
lowest and uppermost portions respectively of the compound ingot
formed (in the case of a mixture separating into two different ternary
alloys), represent the two solubility curves (e.g., of zinc in lead-tin
and of lead in zinc-tin), whilst the “ties” or “tie-lines” indicate,
according as they slope to one side or the other, the relative propor

so that, when (as in the case of mixtures of lead, zinc, and tin) with
certain proportions of “ solvent ” the heavier alloy, and with other pro
portions the lighter one, contains the larger percentage, this variation
is at once indicated to the eye by the change in direction of slope of the
tie-lines (compare fig. 3). Further, when once the critical curve for

(not separating into two di<U+FB01>erent ternary mixtures), or only an “ideal”
alloy (i.e., one not capable of existence, and consequently separating
into two different ternary alloys) ; for, in the one case, the centre of
gravity of the weights of the three metals respectively placed at the
angles of the triangle will fall outside, and, in the other case, inside,
the space enclosed between the critical curve and the base of the
triangle.
    Again, any abnormal results due to the formation of de<U+FB01>nite
chemical compounds (such as the silver-zinc compounds AgZn5 and
 Ag4Zn5, shown to exist by the experiments described in Parts             II   and
 III)   are  equally indicated   by  the   irregularity  of the  outline  of    the
 critical curve deduced: thus <U+FB01>g. 2 indicates on Sir G. G. Stokes’s

 the critical curve corresponding with the lighter alloys obviously
 indicates the <U+FB01>rst maximum of dissolved lead (at a point near to that
 corresponding with AgZn), the subsequent fall, and the point where
 marked increment again becomes apparent (near that corresponding

  shown in <U+FB01>g. 5, Part II, p. 35.                    It is noteworthy, however, that
  whilst the direction of the slope of the ties indicates that throughout
  the lighter alloy contains more silver than the heavier one, the
  triangular graphical representation does not clearly indicate that the
  di<U+FB01>erence in silver percentage between the lighter and heavier alloys
  rises to a maximum and then diminishes again, as is distinctly shown
  by the ordinary method with abscissae and ordinates, as depicted in
  <U+FB01>g. 4, Part II, p. 35.‘              Precisely the same remarks apply if the
  analogous results obtained with bismuth-zinc-silver alloys described
  in Part     lII  are similarly plotted.
      in addition, however, to the employment of this improved method
  of graphical representation, Sir G. G. Stokes deduces from a priori
  considerations an important general principle, viz., that when a
  su<U+FB01>icient amount of inter-mixture of the constituent metals has taken
  place a state of equilibrium is arrived at (the temperature being
  constant throughout), such that the presence of one ternary alloy in
  no way affects the composition of the other; so that the addition or
  subtraction of a further quantity of either alloy, or of any mixture
  of the two, does notaifect the compositions, but only the relative
  quantities present, of the two alloys; whence, if any given weights
  of the two fused alloys be intermixed, the same weights of the same
  alloys will separate again from one another by gravitation on standing.
  if, therefore, two given alloys, A and B, be thus related (truly con
jugate), and in any particular experiment carried out until equilibrium
 is reached one of these alloys, A, be formed, the other alloy, B, must
  necessarily be also produced; and this must be the case no matter
  what may have been the relative proportions subsisting between the
 three metals in the mixture originally employed.
      It appeared to us of considerable interest to examine from the
 experimental point of view whether this general principle can be
        [Sir G. G. Stokes    has pointed out to me that the diagram, <U+FB01>g. 1, shows at once
     "’
 that, inasmuch as the difference between        the percentages of the solvent in two con
 jugate alloys     vanishes   for  the  pair, a,  6, being nil for each, and again for the
 pair   which   merge  into  one, represented by the point L, it must necessarily be a
 maximum       for some   intermediate   pair; and also that, in order to preserve the con
 tinuity   of  conditions,  we  must,  in crossing L, pass from the upper alloy to the
 lower, and vice versd.       Hence, if the entire system of ties could be determined, so
 as to obtain every possible pair of conjugate points lying, one on one side, the
other on the other side, of L, and if these values were plotted on the abscissa and
 ordinate system, the curve representing the difference between the percentages of
the solvent, after having ascended and attained a maximum elevation, must
descend again to the base line at a point corresponding with L.          If we wish to con
tinue the curve beyond that point, we must now take the ordinates negative instead
of positive, the same in magnitude as before, and the curve having crossed the base
line, and attained a minimum elevation, will ultimately ascend again to the <U+FB01>nal
point on the base line.—C. R. A. W., February 25, 1891.]

veri<U+FB01>ed in practice, or whether interfering causes prevent anything
more than demonstrations of approximate correctness being obtained;
the more so that some of the results previously obtained by two of us
do not appear to he in harmony with Sir G. G. Stokes’s proposition.
In Part I (‘ Roy. Soc. Proc.,’ vol. 45, p. 461) three series of experi
ments were described, made with lead, tin, and zinc, where the ratio
of lead to zinc was 2 to 1, 1 to 1, and 1 to 2, in the three series
respectively; and the <U+FB01>gures obtained led us to the conclusion that
“ whilst an inde<U+FB01>nite number of different mixtures may be prepared,
each one of which will give the same heavier alloy, the lighter alloy
                                                                         ”
simultaneously formed will be di<U+FB01>erent in each case; and conversely:
a deduction obviously incompatible with Sir G. G. St0kes’s proposition.
 On the other hand, it is argued by Sir G. G. Stokes that these experi
ments do not necessarily prove anything more than the extreme
dii<U+FB01>culty experienced whilst making experiments with fused metals
in obtaining such an intimate intermixture as to bring about the
condition of perfect equilibrium between the two alloys formed in
any given instance; and that, in point of fact, the di<U+FB01>erences
observed in the compositions of the various lighter alloys associated
with a given heavier one, or vice versri, are not greater than might
reasonably be expected were equilibrium not perfectly attained in
some or all of the observations.    Further, the fact that the di<U+FB01>erences
are always in the sa/me general direction tends to indicate that some
constant interfering cause is at work ; thus, when curves were
 plotted (Part I, <U+FB01>g. 5, p. $76) with the tin percentages in the heavier
 alloys as abscissae, and the excesses of tin percentage in the lighter
 alloys over those in the heavier ones as ordinates, the curve deduced
 from the series of experiments where the ratio of lead to zinc in the
 original mixture of metals was 2 to 1 underlay that similarly obtained
 in the second series, where the ratio was 1 to 1, which again underlay
 that deduced from the third series, where the ratio was 1 to 2;
 whereas all three curves should have coincided were Sir G. G. Stokes’s
 proposition correct, and all interfering causes completely eliminated.
     An analogous result is obtained when the analytical <U+FB01>gures are
 plotted on Sir G. G. Stokes’s triangular system.       Fig. 3 represents
  the plottings thus obtained of the two series where the ratio of zinc
  to lead was 2 to 1 and 1 to 2 respectively (Part 1, ‘Roy. Soc. Proc.,’
  vol. 45, Series IV, p. 41744, and Series VI, p. 475) the temperature
  throughout being near to 650°. The ties in the <U+FB01>rst case are indi
  cated by dotted lines, and in the second by continuous ones.
  Obviously the critical curves deduced from the two sets of observa
  tions respectively do not differ very markedly; but the angles of
  slope of the ties are not identical, so that a given heavier alloy is not
  conjoined with the same lighter one (nor vice versd) in the two cases;
  whilst the direction of the variation is the same throughout.

   ln order, if  possible, to obtain experimental evidence of the truth
or otherwise   of the general proposition arrived at by Sir G. G. Stokes,
as well as some explanation of the deviation         therefrom of these
previous results, we <U+FB01>rst of all carried out various further experi
ments with mixtures of lead, zinc, and tin, employing additional
precautions to minimise errors due to imperfect intermixture, more
especially by continuing for much longer periods of time the process
of agitation of the fused metals by vigorous stirring; the results,
however, did not differ materially from the previous ones, and
indicated generally that the composition of the heavier alloy
practically obtained associated with a given lighter one, or vice versd,
was subject to <U+FB02>uctuation within certain not very wide limits,
according to the proportion subsisting between lead and zinc in the
original mixture employed; but whether this result was brought
about by interfering causes, or was possibly due to the not absolute
correctness of Sir G. G. Stokes’s principle, the experiments did not
enable us to decide.     In the hope of eliminating disturbing causes,
we next endeavoured to carry out analogous observations           at the
ordinary temperature with liquids not metallic in their nature, but
resembling the metals tin, lead, and zinc from the point of view of

their relative solubilities, i.e., two of the liquids being only
miscible together to limited extents (like lead and zinc), whilst the
third was miscible in all proportions with either of the others
separately.   The di<U+FB02>iculty of making su<U+FB02>iciently accurate analyses
of the ternary mixtures thus obtained prevented our using several
such groups of liquids, which at <U+FB01>rst sight suggested themselves,
more particularly mixtures of alcohol, water, and ether; but we found
that chloroform, water, and glacial acetic acid ful<U+FB01>lled all the necessary
conditions; so that, when a mixture of equal weights of the <U+FB01>rst two
with not too large a proportion of the third was well agitated and
allowed to tand, it separated into two ternary solutions exactly
correlative with the ternary alloys previously examined; the heavier
one consisting chie<U+FB02>y of chloroform with some of the acetic acid and
an amount of water proportionate to the acetic acid present; the
other consisting mainly of water with the rest of the acetic acid,
and more or less chloroform dissolved therein.          Calling any given
such pair of conjugate mixtures A and B respectively, we found that
the general principle deduced by Sir G. G. Stokes could be veri<U+FB01>ed with
sensible accuracy with these liquids; on agitating together A and B in
various proportions, each liquid separated out again unchanged in each
case, no matter whether A was used in large eaccess of B, or vice versd.
On the other hand, when two di<U+FB02>erent alloys, A and B, were made of
lead, tin, and zinc in such proportions that one was approximately
conjugate to the other as indicated by the previously recorded
observations, we did not succeed in getting anything like such sharp
results; experiments where 2 parts of A to 1 of ‘B were mixed
together, and treated side by side with a mixture of 1 part of A to
 2 of B, did not give quite the same results in the two cases, the

errors of analysis and such like sources of inaccuracy.

 with water, and titrated with a fresh caustic soda solution accurately
 standardised, using phenolphthalein as indicator.       Another portion,
 weighed in a <U+FB02>ask or bulb tube containing a little water, was then

    acetic acid deduced from the previous titration.                        A number of pre
    liminary experiments showed that the sulphuric acid drying tube
    sufficed to retain all traces of acetic acid carried away by the current

general features, rising upwards at an accelerating rate, so that the
curves are somewhat concave upwards.

 Experiments with Approximately           Conjugate Alloys of Lead, Tin, and
                                        Zinc.
   The experiments above described most strongly suggest that when
interfering causes are removed, so that the mixtures of liquids dealt
with can sensibly attain a condition of equilibrium, truly conjugate
pairs of mixtures are formed, as supposed by Sir G. G. Stokes, of
such a nature that the two may he intermixed in any proportions
without any alteration in composition being thereby caused. Pre
sumably the chief interfering cause in the former experiments with
lead, zinc, and tin lay in the di<U+FB02>iculty of obtaining thorough inter
mixture by simply stirring vigorously in a hot crucible; it might,
therefore, be expected that       if,
                                  instead of stirring together the three
metals melted en masse, they were divided into two fractions and
separately melted in such proportions as to produce two masses of
approximately the composition of a pair of conjugate alloys, and these
alloys were then mixed together and well stirred, a nearer approxima
tion to truly conjugate compositions might be attained.        We tried
several experiments in this     direction, but the results were far less
sharp and well de<U+FB01>ned than those obtained with chloroform, water,
and acetic acid, where a much more thorough intermixture by agita
tion in a. closed vessel could be readily effected.
   Thus, in one set of experiments we <U+FB01>rst prepared two alloys of
approximately conjugate composition for a temperature of about 800°
(Part II, ‘Roy. Soc. Proc.,’ vol. 48, p. 29), viz. :—

    Two parts of the <U+FB01>rst and one of the second were then melted in
two separate crucibles, and the contents of one crucible poured into
the other, and well intermixed by vigorous stirring for some
minutes; the whole was then poured into a red-hot narrow clay
crucible, and maintained at near 800° for 8 hours in the lead bath.
Simultaneously, a second clay test-tube was heated, containing a
similarly prepared mixture of one part of the <U+FB01>rst alloy to two of the
second.         The compound ingots ultimately obtained were analysed
with the following results, obviously showing much less close agree

    In every case the same general result is noticed, that when the
two approximately conjugate alloys are intermixed in such proportions
that lead predominates over zinc in the total mass, or vice cersri, the
differences in tin percentage between the two ends of the compound
ingots formed are of the same kind as those observed in Part                  I  with
original masses containing lead and zinc in different ratios: viz.,
 that when lead predominates a point is obtained belonging to a
 curve underlying that pertaining to cases where zinc predominates:
whence it appears pretty certain that, whatever the causes may be
that prevent truly conjugate alloys from being obtained under the
conditions of the one set of experiments (whether incomplete inter
mixture, or something else), they also operate in the other series of
observations.
    Taking into account, however, the fact that in the experiments
with chloroform, water, and acetic acid truly conjugate mixtures were
obtained when a su<U+FB01>icient amount of intermixture by agitation had
occurred, but not till then, the <U+FB01>nal conclusion appears to be warranted
that the proposition set forth by Sir G. G. Stokes is a perfectly correct one,
and that the divergences noticed in certain of the alloy experiments
are due to the inherent nature of the ease as regards the di<U+FB02>iculties
in the way of obtaining su<U+FB02>iciently complete intermixture: possibly
these di<U+FB02>icnlties might be overcome by enclosing the fused mixtures
of metals in a stoppered vessel or crucible-<U+FB02>ask of clay, and agitating
this by long continued shaking about, whilst keeping it su<U+FB02>iciently
hot in some kind of mu<U+FB02>ie furnace; but the appliances at our dis
posal have not permitted us actually to decide this point experi
mentally.       The di<U+FB02>iculty of carrying out .such experiments is further
enhanced by the circumstance that metallic alloys, when intermixed
by vigorous agitation, do not appear to separate again from one
another anything like so readily as such substances as chloroform and
water or ether and water; small vesicles or droplets of the heavier
alloy remain suspended in the lighter one (and vice versi) for long

temperature, and the remaining at rest for many hours, before the

of the heavier alloy, and the bottom part from similar portions of
lighter alloy. The analytical numbers obtained on examining diiferent
layers of the compound ingots prepared in the experiments described
in the earlier parts of these researches long ago convinced us of this ;
but, in addition, an actual visible presence of suspended particles of
one alloy in the midst of another, even after 8 hours tranquil fusion,
may be often observed in the case of silver-lead-zinc and silver-bismuth
alloys where the proportions of metals used are such as to form
mixtures containing considerable amounts of Ag4Zn5: by the aid of
a lens, or even with the naked eye, red particles disseminated through
a much lighter coloured matrix can often be distinguished on
examining the central portions of an ingot that has been <U+FB01>led smooth
and bright, and then kept for awhile so as to allow the red tinge to
develop.                ~
IV. “On the Structure of         Amoeboid Protoplasm, with :1 Com
      parison  between     the  Nature    of the Contractile Process in
      Amoeboid Cells and in Muscular Tissue, and a Suggestion
      regarding the Mechanism of Ciliary Action.”              By E. A.
      SOHAFER, F.R.S.       Received January 26, 1891.
   It has been shown by the researches of numerous histologists, of
 whom Heitzmann and Frommann, and, in this country, Klein, must be
reckoned the pioneers, that the protoplasm of many cells exhibits the
appearance of a network containing an apparently homogeneous
material in its meshes.      The network is known as the reticulum or
spougioplasm,  the  clear material  in its meshes as euchylema (Carnoy)
or hyaloplasm.      In many cells it is not di<U+FB02>icult to observe this
structure even without the addition of reagents, but in amoeboid cells
such as the white blood corpuscle and the amoeba it is less obvious,
and its presence has not been generally conceded.               Recently,
Professor Stricker* has published a photograph of an amoeboid white
blood corpuscle, taken instantaneously by aid of the electric light,
which shows the reticular appearance in quite an unmistakable
manner; it must be granted, therefore, that the amoeboid white
blood corpuscle also has this tructure.
   Previously to the appearance of Professor Stricker’s photograph, I
had myself for some time been engaged in investigating the structure
of amoeboid cells with the aid of photography. Being unprovided

     194                             Prof. E. A. Schiifer.                      [Feb. 12,
     with the appliances necessary for photographing by the electric light.
l    1 was unable to obtain instantaneous               photographs,     and could not
     photograph the corpuscles while actually living and moving.                             I
     accordingly adopted a method of suddenly killing the corpuscles
     whilst still in the amwboid condition with their pseudopodia extended.
      lt is well known that with most methods which are employed to <U+FB01>x
     the white blood corpuscles there is time for a contraction                      of the
     protoplasm to be produced, so that the pseudopodia                  are   withdrawn
     and the corpuscle becomes spherical.             The method which I have used
     consists     in  the   instantaneous application of a jet of steam to the
     surface of the cover-glass.          A preparation of blood, preferably from
     the    newt    (T-riton cristatus), is made either in a moist chamber or in
     the usual way on a glass slide.           In a short time the white corpuscles
     become highly amceboid and throw out pseudopodia, which may
     spread themselves in a thin layer upon the cover glass in a manner
     which is perfectly adapted for their being accurately observed.                        It
     the steam be now turned on for an instant, the cells are suddenly
     killed, and remain exactly in the condition in which they happened to
     be when the heat was applied.             They can be examined and photo
     graphed thus, or may <U+FB01>rst be stained by haamatoxylin, with or with
     out being previously treated with alcohol.                In all cases they exhibit
     the same general structural appearances, and these appearances can
     even» be detected, but with greater di<U+FB02>iculty, in the cell whilst still
     living.
         Leaving the nucleus, which beautifully exhibits the karyoplasmic
     network, out of consideration, the most striking point in all amceboid
      white corpuscles thus prepared is the contrast between the proto
     plasm of the body of the cell and that of the pseudopodia.                          For
     whilst the former exhibits, according to focus, either a <U+FB01>nely
      punctated or a reticular aspect, and stains decidedly with ha:mato
     xylin, the pseudopodia exhibit not the faintest trace of structure,
     and remain almost entirely unstained.
         In other words, the protoplasm is composed of two morphologically
     distinct parts, one which exhibits a reticular arrangement and has an
     a<U+FB01>inity for haematoxylin, and another which shows to the best optical
     appliances no structural arrangement, and is also chemically dilferent-,
     as is shown by its behaviour to staining reagents.
         The observation here recorded is not an isolated one.                  Almost all
      observers who have given special attention to the matter have failed
     to detect a reticular structure in pseudopodia, whether of the
   >
     amoaboid cells of higher organisms or of the Rhizopoda. To Biitschli’s
      theory of the structure and activity of protoplasm,* whereby he
      endeavours to show that the reticular appearance and amaaboid
      phenomena may be explained on the assumption that protoplasm is

not an actual network with enchylema, but rather a frothy mixture
of two dissimilar substances, this absence of all apparent structure in
pseudopodia offers an admittedly serious di<U+FB02>iculty, which he en
deavours to surmount by assuming that the same frothy structure is
really present in the pseudopodia as in the body of the cell, but that
owing to thinning out it cannot be detected.                    But apart from the
unlikelihood of our not noticing such structure in the pseudopodia if
it were really present, since they are especially well adapted for
minute observation, the reticular and the homogeneous substances
should, according to this assumption, pass gradually the one into the
other, for the thinning-off of the pseudopodia is frequently gradual.
The contrary is, however, the case.              The line of demarcation of the
reticular substance is always quite sharp, and does not thin off into
the homogeneous substance of the pseudopodia.
    Stricker’s photograph is also really evidence in the same direction.
The corpuscle taken is spherical or nearly so, i.e., is in the contracted
condition. It has, however, one small pseudopodium.                   This is abso
lutely without    structure;    it  is  the    spherical part     of the   cell which
shows the reticulum.
    It is well known that if white corpuscles (and contracted amoeboid
cells generally) are arti<U+FB01>cially stimulated, they are always spherical.
The spherical form is. in fact, the contracted condition; it is only in
the absence of any obvious source of excitation that the corpuscle
throws out pseudopodia.            The spherical condition is immediately
produced by electrical or mechanical stimuli; no doubt, the constant
mechanical stimulation which the cells receive in the circulating
blood maintains them in the spherical                  form which they always
exhibit whilst moving within           the   blood-vessels.      Possibly, also, the
contact of a foreign particle, causing the contraction and with
drawal of" the protoplasm which it touches, and the consequent
inception of the particle, is another instance of mechanical stimula
tion.                                                  -
   Now, in the contracted corpuscle, the whole cell appears reticular,
and the reticulation is even better marked, i.e., coarser, than that
 seen in the spread out corpuscle.            The pseudopodial protoplasm or
hyaloplasm     has, in fact,    been    withdrawn        into the meshes of the
framework or spongi0plaSm
   The protoplasm of such an amoeboid cell as the white blood
corpuscle may, therefore, be regarded as composed of two distinct
substances, spongioplasm and hyaloplasm.                  Spongioplasm has a reti
cular or sponge-like arrangement, an a<U+FB01>inity for staining <U+FB02>uids, is
firmer than the hyaloplasm (but, perhaps, not actually solid), and is,
in all probability, highly extensile and elastic.              Hyaloplasm, on the
 other hand, is  structureless,    has   little  or no   a<U+FB02>inity for stains, and is
 highly labile and <U+FB02>uent.       It is by the active <U+FB02>owing of the hyalo

plasm, not by the contraction of the spougioplasm (as concei ‘ed by
Carney‘), that the movements of cells are producednf                 Of t .e two
substances, the hyaloplasm is the more active, the spongiopla m the
more inert.       The spongioplasm          forms, in fact, a sort of frai ework
supporting the hyaloplasm,             and into which under the in<U+FB01>u‘ [ice of
stimuli the hyaloplasm               becomes wholly withdrawn.         To adopt
 Bi-uecke's well-known terminology, the hyaloplasm is the zor id, the
spongioplasm its aecoizl.
    Whether one or other of these two substances is ever wholly
absent from the protoplasm of cells is a question which car not at
present he decided.           There are cells and unicellular organism i, both
animal and vegetable, in which no reticular structure can be made
 out, and these may be formed of hyaloplasm alone.                  In that case,
 this must be looked upon as the essential part of protoplasm. So far
 as amaaboid phenomena are concerned, it is certainly so; but whether
 the chemical changes which occur in many cells are effected by this
 or by spongioplasm is another question.              Certainly, the reticulum is
 always very well marked in cells in which considerable chemical
 changes are produced, e.g., gland cells.
    The movements within plant cells must also be regarded as due to
 the <U+FB02>owing of hyaloplasm.             It is, indeed, impossible to conceive that
 the contraction of a reticulum could produce the circulation of the
 protoplasm which is seen within a cell of Vallisneria.                  How the
  <U+FB02>owing is produced is an entirely di<U+FB01>erent question, and one which
  must at present remain unanswered.
    If now we compare the structure of protoplasm with that of
 striated muscle, we <U+FB01>nd many points of coincidence.                   As is well
  known, the muscle columns of the wing muscles of insects (“wing
          ”
  <U+FB01>brils of authors) are divided by transverse partitions (membranes
  of Krause) into a series of segments (sarcomeres, Muskel-kiistchen
  of Krause), each of which contains a sarcous element or disk of
  anisotropous sarcous substance (which is really formed of two halves,
  their junction being often visible as the line of Hensen), and a homo
  geneous isotropous substance, which in the extended muscle occupies
  the intervals between the sarcous element and the transverse mem
  brane.      As I have elsewhere recently shown,I the substance of the
  sarcous element is penetrated by pores or canals which extend in each
  half of the element as far as the line or plane of Hansen, and which
  are occupied by clear substance continuous with the homogeneous sub
  stance of the intervals. The substance of the sarcous element stains
  with haematoxylin and similar reagents, while the homogeneous
  substance of the clear intervals remains unstained.                  "When the

 muscle contracts,     the homogeneous       substance  passes from the
intervals into the pores of the sarcous element, and thus enlarges the
latter, while the clear intervals are proportionately shortened, so
that in extreme contraction they may disappear, and the swollen and
 bulged     sarcous element may ‘almost abut against the tranverse
 membranes.       On the other hand, when the contraction passes 0H‘, and
 the muscle becomes extended, the homogeneous substance passes out
 of the pores of the sarcous element into the clear intervals; the
 latter become manifest, and the sarcous element proportionately
 diminished in bulk. It is hardly possible that the resemblance of
 these changes to those which occur in the protoplasm of an amaaboid
 cell is merely accidental—di<U+FB02>icult not to believe that the perforated
 sarcous substance is the spongioplasmic “oecoid,” the clear labile
 substance the hyaloplasmic “ zooid.”

 same category, and thus tending to simplify our ideas regarding con
 tractile phenomena, may also serve to aid in the elucidation of certain
 questions in connection      with those phenomena which have long
 presented di<U+FB02>iculties to the physiologist and pharmacologist.         For
example, with regard to the movements of amoeboid cells, the
question has been frequently discussed, and never satisfactorily
answered, whether we are to regard the withdrawal of the pseudo
podia into the body of the cell as the condition of rest, and the
protrusion of the pseudopodia as the condition of activity, or vice
've'rsé'.. Viewed by the light of the above observations, it is clear that
neither state is to be regarded as a resting condition; both are mani
festations of activity; both are produced by <U+FB02>owing of the h yaloplasm.
 Similarly, in the case of muscle, the passage from the contracted to
the extended condition can no longer, as is so frequently assumed, he
looked upon as a merely passive change of state, but must be
regarded, no less than in the case of the passage from the extended to
the contracted condition, as produced by <U+FB02>owing of hyaloplasm.          In
the one case this <U+FB02>ows into pores        of the spongioplasm—this is the
condition called contraction, and ordinarily regarded as the active
state; in the other case there is a <U+FB02>owing of the hyaloplasm out
of the pores of the spongioplasm, by which movement the condition
of extension is determined.       That di<U+FB01>erent chemical and electrical
changes accompany, perhaps determine, these different directions of
movement is well known.        It is also known that the process of exten
sion is in<U+FB02>uenced by drugs, independently of the action they may
exert upon that of contraction (Brunton, Ringer).        But whether the
chemical and electrical changes, and those produced by drugs, occur
in the hyaloplasm, or in the spongioplasm, or in both substances, is a
question which, as in the analogous case of the amoeboid cell, cannot

at present he decided.    The same remark may be made with respect
to the question of active participation by the spongioplasm in the pro
duction of the movements of the hyaloplasm. It is, however, quite
certain from the observation of the movements of the hyaloplasm of
pseudopodia, which may actively flow in different directions, even
when far removed from the spongioplasm, that it is the hyaloplasm
which is to be regarded as the physically active part of protoplasm,
and therefore also presumably of muscular substance.
   Lastly, there is another form of protoplasmic activity, viz., ciliary
motion, which cannot be left out of consideration in any attempt to
explain the manner in which the contractile manifestations of proto
plasm are produced.     On this matter I have no new facts to record,
and the suggestion therefore that I have to make must be under
stood to be a purely theoretical deduction from analogy, and not
based upon actual observation.       At the same time it does not, so
far as   I  know, stand in contradiction to any known fact. The
suggestion is brie<U+FB02>y this :—If we suppose that a cilium is a hollow
curved extension of the cell, occupied by hyaloplasm, and invested by
a delicate elastic membrane, then it must follow that if there be a
rhythmic <U+FB02>owing of hyaloplasm from the body of the cell, into and
out of the cilium, an alternate extension and flexion of that process
would thereby be brought about.        The movement would in fact be
produced by an action which would be practically the same as that
by which the amoeboid movements of cells and the contraction and
extension of muscle are probably effected.    The same result might be
got, supposing the cilium to be a straight and not a curved extension of
the cell, if the enveloping membrane were thicker (or otherwise less
extensible) along one side than along the other.        This assumption
would also enable one better to account for the spiral direction of
the movement of certain cilia; for this form of movement would be
produced if the line of lessened extensibility in them were to pass in
a corkscrew fashion along the cilium in place of straight along one
side, as might be assumed for ordinary cilia.

                                    (Abstract)
   The discovery of organisms constantly concomitant with manifes
tations of malaria. was made by Laveran in 1880.
   His researches have since been corroborated and ampli<U+FB01>ed by
numerous observers in di<U+FB01>erent parts of the world, among whom
must be mentioned, Marchiafava, Celli, Golgi, and Guarnieri, in Italy ;
Councilman, Osler, and James, in America; and Vandyke Carter, in
India. The foreign structures which all of the above-named inves
tigators agree in <U+FB01>nding in the blood during or after attacks of ague
may be grouped into the following classes :—
           “                                                 in diameter, round, trans

                cystic bodies or spores, possessing the power of amoeboid
              movement, and so closely associated with the red blood
              corpuscle that hitherto the majority of observers have con
              sidered them to be parasites situated within the red blood
                cells.
     4.    Mobile <U+FB01>laments,    21 to 28    ,u   long.
   Despite the general concord of the observations, the subject has not
advanced   beyond the stage of recognition of these structures in the
blood, and that, too, only while in the fresh state.

   It had never been isolated or classi<U+FB01>ed, nor when thus separated
had its pathogenic qualities ever been tested by experiments on lower
animals.
    Itwas thus clear that much remained to be done, and in the paper
are recounted the attempts made to place the subject on   satisfactory       a
footing. The author has    found  that             it
                                            possible to stain

chloride after treatment with bichromate of potash, and after
treatment with dilute sulphuric acid by an anilinised alkalised
solution of Weigert’s acid fuchsin.

    Another method of staining consisted in the saturation of the tissue
 with a copper salt and its reduction by sulphuretted hydrogen pre
 vious to coloration with anilinised alkalised acid fuchsin.
    By these staining methods the organisms have been demonstrated
 in the blood, and also in the tissues.       And some new, hitherto un
 recognised features are described, among which may be mentioned
  what appears to be the germination of the spore in the blood, the
 existence of a comma-shaped body and of mycelium in the spleen and
 Peyei-’s glands, and the localisation of the plasmode, i.e., in relation to
 the blood corpuscles.
    The isolation of the organism and its arti<U+FB01>cial cultivation have
 been successfully carried out, and it is shown that this result entirely
 depends for its success upon the fact that the nutrient media must be
previously treated with living blood, i.e., before rigor mortis has
set in.
   Alteration in the chemical composition of the nutrient medium,
consisting in the addition of glucose, together with iron or haemo
globin or fresh blood, to the non-peptonised beef broth, elicited the
interesting fact that, under these circumstances, the organism can
pass to a more highly developed state, displaying the structure and
fructi<U+FB01>cation of a highly organised fungus, but differing in certain
important features from any fungus hitherto described.
   Inoculation of guinea pigs, monkeys, and rabbits with the growths
in various nutrient media has produced a frequently fatal disease,
which, although not characterised in these animals by the symptoms
of classical intermittent fever, yet displayed in a number of instances
a de<U+FB01>nitely intermittent character.         It was further, whatever its
clinical character, invariably accompanied by the appearance of the
characteristic organisms in the blood drawn after death from the right
ventricle.
   It is accordingly concluded that the malarial fungus is capable of
being cultivated outside the body and has been proved to possess
pathogenic qualities.

    The most favourable        conditions in the ordinary measurement of
resistance have been investigated by Schwendler* and by O. Heavi
sidesf     It is here proposed to treat the problem more generally, so
as to cover the application to conductors endowed with self-induction,

204           Lord Rayleigh.      On   the  Bridge Jlet/zod in its     [Feb. 19,
employed in ordinary testing.         In the conjugate “ battery      " branch a
periodic electromotive force of given frequency is the origin of              the
 currents.
    Special attention will be given to the case where the branches are
 equal    in pairs, e.g., a = c, b = d (<U+FB01>g. 1). The advantages of this
arrangement are important even in ordinary resistance testing, and
 in the generalised application are still more to be insisted upon.           By
mere interchange of a and c and combination of results, the equality
of b and d can be veri<U+FB01>ed independently of the exactitude of the
 re tie a  : c.

    If  any element in the combination, for example a, be a mere re
sistance, the di<U+FB01>erence     of potentials at its terminals (V) is connected
with the current, :0, by the relation
                                    V=a.'u.
    We have, however, to suppose that a is not merely a resistance or
even combination of such.        It may include an electromagnet-,"‘ and it
may be interrupted by          a  condenser.        So long as the current is
strictly harmonic, proportional to e"P‘, the most general possible
relation between V and 0: is expressed by
                                V=    (a,+'ia.-,) 1:,
where a, and     ia, are the real and imaginary parts of          a complex co
efficient a, and are functions of the frequency p/21r.           In the particu
lar case of a simple conductor, endowed with inductance L, a1 repre
sents the resistance, and a-,, is equal to pl}.       In general, alis positive ;
but a-, may be either positive, as in the above example, or negative.
The latter case arises when a resistance, R, is interrupted by a con
denser of capacity C. Here atI = R, a, = -1/pC.                 If there be also
inductance L,
                         a1 = R,         a,  = pL—1/pC.
   * An electrr-magnet here denotes a conductor with sensible inductance. Iron
may be present if the range of magnetisation be small.—‘ Phil. Mag,’ March, 1887.

    Since the parts of a»_. may be either positive or negative, there is
nothing to hinder its evanescence by compensation.         In the above
combination of an electromagnet and condenser compensation occurs
when p"LC = 1, that is, when the natural period with terminals
connected coincides with the forced period.          The combination is
then equivalent to a simple resistance ;* but a variation of fre
qucncy will give rise to a positive or negative az.
   The case of two electromagnets in parallel is treated in my paper
on “ Forced Harmonic Oscillations ;’’f and other combinations have
been discussed by Mr. Heaviside and myself. But the above examples
will su<U+FB02>lce to illustrate the principle that the relation of V to .r is
one of proportionality, and may be expressed by the single complex
symbol a. We fall back at any time upon the case of mere resistance
by supposing a to be real. In like manner                 and    are sym
                                                                       I),   c,   d,   e,   f

if a,    be two complex quantities representing two conductors in

                 is                                                                                    if

so   that                           :v+a:'   = V(1/a+l/a’).
    The investigation of the currents in networks of conductors                                        is
usually treated by “»Kirchho<U+FB01>"’s rules,” and this procedure may of
course be adopted            in the present case to determine the current
through        the    bridge of a Wheatstone combination.      But    will be               it
more instructive to put the argument in the'form applicable to the
forced vibrations of all mechanical systems which oscillate about a
con<U+FB01>guration of equilibrium.
   If p/21r represent the frequency of the vibration, the coordinates
11/1, 3%,, \/'3. . . . determining the condition of the system, and the cor
responding forces *I',, \I»'2, 1'3. . are all proportional to e51", and the

coordinates are linear functions of the forces.1‘            For the present
purpose we suppose that all the forces vanish, except the <U+FB01>rst and
second.         Thus 3b,, 30, are linear functions of 1Ir1 and 1'2, and, con
versely, iq, ‘I’, may be regarded as linear functions of 3/11 and #12. We

If such a force acts, the conditions are, externally, the same as the                              if

   The case that we have to deal with is when iv, acts inf, and there
is no   E.M.F. in e. We are at liberty, however, to suppose that two
opposite forces, each of magnitude Bil,/A. acts in e. One of these.
as we have seen, acting in conjunction with 1?, in f, gives no current
in e; so that, since electromotive               forces act independently of one
another, the actual current in e, closed without internal E.M.F., is
simply that due to the other component.                    The question is thus re
duced to the determination of the current in e due to a given
in that branch.
    So far the argument is rigorous; but we will now suppose that
we have to deal with an approximate balance. In this case an E.M.F.
in e gives rise to very little current in f, and in calculating the cur
                                     f
rent in e we may suppose to be broken. The total resistance to the
force in e is then given simply by C of equation (4'), and the approxi
mate value for 3!», is derived by dividing —B\h/A by C, as we found
in (8).
    A continued application of the foregoing process gives \[/2/ill in the
form of an in<U+FB01>nite geometric series :—
                                             Z      l            _

 This is the rigorous solution already found; but the <U+FB01>rst term of
 the series su<U+FB01>ices for practical purposes.
    The form of (8) enables us at once to compare the effects of incre
ments of resistance and inductance in disturbing a balance.                              For let '
 ad = be, and then change d to d+d' where d’ = d',+id’,.                           The value
of \;»,/1», is proportional to d’, and the amplitude of the vibratory
 current in the bridge is proportional to Mod d’, that is, to
  ~/(d'1’+ elf).    Thus d',, d’, are equally ellicacious when numerically
 equal.
    The next application that we shall make of (8) is to the general
ised form of Schwendler's                problem. When all else is given, how
should the telephone, or other receiving instrument, be wound in
 order to get the greatest e<U+FB01>ect ?

   In this equation e,, 1", are essentially positive, while eq, 1'2 may be
either positive or negative.     It e, and e, are both at disposal, the
minimum of (10), corresponding to the maximum current, is found

     But this is not the practical question.  As in the case of simple
resistances, what we have to aim at is not to render the current in the
bridge a maximum, but rather the eject of the current. Whether
the receiving instrument be a galvanometer or a telephone, we cannot
in practice reduce its resistance to zero without at the same time
nullifying the effect desired.    We must rather regard the space
available for the windings as given, and merely inquire how it may
best be utilised. Now the e<U+FB02>’ect required to be exalted is, caeteris
paribus, proportional to the number of windings (m); and, if the
space occupied by insulation be proportional to that occupied by
copper, the resistance varies as m’. So also does the inductance; and
accordingly, if the instrument be connected to the bridge by leads
sensibly devoid of resistance and inductance,

   The case of the “battery     branch may often be treated in like
manner.    As Mr. Heaviside has shown,          number of cells are   if    a

available for ordinary resistance testing, they should be combined, so
that their resistance is equal to that (s,) of the corresponding com
bination of wires in parallel. Periodic currents may be conceived to
arise from the rotation of a coil in a magnetic <U+FB01>eld of given strength.
If the space occupied by the windings of the coil be supposed to be
given, their number m will be determined by the condition of equal
impedances.         Thus, if
                              (w+v) (b+d)

in analogy with (13).
    The above is the solution of the problem, if the coils of the sending
 and receiving instruments represent the whole of their respective
branches, and are limited to occupy given spaces.                         The inductances
and resistances cannot then be varied independently.                                 But there
would often be no difficulty in escaping from this limitation.                                  The
inclusion of additional resistance, external to the instrument, can
only do harm ; but the case is otherwise with inductance, positive or
 negative.     If the inductance of the instrument added to Tg, or to s,,
 be positive, the total inductance may be reduced to zero by the inser
 tion of a suitable condenser, and this without material increase of
 resistance.     If the inductance be already negative, the remedy is not
 so easily carried out; but, theoretically, it is possible to add the
necessary inductance without sensible increase of resistance.                                   The
greater   the   frequency    of   vibration,     the  more   feasible      does     this    course
 become. We may, therefore, without much violence, suppose that
 the indnctances of two branches can be reduced to zero without
 additional resistance.        Thus,

   The next remark that has to be made is that, even when the con
ductors, b and d, to be compared are endowed with sensible in
ductances (positive or negative), the problem may still, theoretically,
be brought under the above head.        Suppose, for example, that b, d
represent nearly equal elcctromagnets.      Their inductances may be
compensated by the introduction (in series) of suitable equal con
densers into these branches, so that b and d are reduced to b1 and d,.
If then we assume a to be a simple resistance (a, = 0), the solution is
as before.    Two objections way here be raised.        First, on the
theoretical side it has not been proved to be advantageous to assume
w_-=0; and, secondly, the introduction of extraneous condensers,*
even with interchange, into the branches to be accurately compared
may be a complication unfavourable to success.

more space would probably be available for the coils of a transmitting

the transmitter which should have the larger time constant (L/R).

    In the preceding        calculations e and   f  are supposed to be adjusted
to the values most favourable to the effect in the receiving instru

 make the best of given instruments.            The full answer is necessarily
somewhat complicated ; for there could be no objection to the inser
tion of a condenser for example, if the sensitiveness could be im
proved thereby.           In what follows, however, the transmitting and
receiving branches will be supposed to be fully given, so that e and                             f
are known complex quantities; and the only question to be considered
is as to the most suitable value of a, assumed to be equal to c.

  We have already described (‘ Phil. Trans./‘A, 1888) the remarkable
spectrum of the oxy-hydrogen <U+FB02>ame burning at the- ordinary atmo
spheric pi'essure.. Recently we have examined the spectrum of the

used in our experiments      on the absorption spectra of compressed
gases (‘ Phil. Mag,’ September, l888, and ‘Roy. Soc. Proc.,’ vol. 46,

were two tubes,    c  and    connected to the cylinder at the sides, of
                            d,

or to reduce the pressure of the gas in the cylinder            that was     if
desired.  The <U+FB02>ame was observed, nearly end on, through the quartz
stopper.   The whole apparatus was kept cool by          stream of cold
                                                                     a

   The gases were supplied from steel cylinders into which they had
been compressed, and the pressure was registered by a gauge attached
to the tube by which the gas entered the experimental cylinder.
Commercial compressed gases were used, containing a sensible per
centage of air.
   When hydrogen was the gas forming the burning jet, it was
lighted at the end of the tube b before introducing it into the
experimental cylinder. When it was desired to have a jet of oxygen
burning in hydrogen, this could be managed by introducing oxygen
through the second tube and increasing the supply of hydrogen until
the <U+FB02>ame passed over to the oxygen jet.    The same result was some
times attained by  first <U+FB01>lling the experimental cylinder by a gentle
stream of hydrogen through the side tube 0 before the end with the
tube b was screwed on; the hydrogen as it issued was then lighted,
and the jet, with a gentle stream of oxygen issuing, inserted and
screwed down.    The stopcock s was kept open until this was done,
and then by closing a, and admitting more gas from the reservoirs,
the pressure in the _experimental    cylinder oould be increased at
pleasure.

                                    Hydrogen Burning in Oxygen.
   The <U+FB01>rst observations were made with a jet of hydrogen burning
in oxygen.    As the pressure rose, the luminosity of the <U+FB02>ame in
creased, as long ago described        by Frankland     (‘Experimental
Researches,’ p. 905).     The colour of the <U+FB02>ame, viewed end on, was
yellow, as         contained sodium;
                       if   it          but, on examining       with a it
spectroscope,    was found to give
                          it          continuous spectrum intersected
                                                 a
by many shaded bands, and the D lines of sodium were only faintly
present.   The shaded bands were faint at a pressure of          atmo       5
spheres, but at pressures  of 20 atmospheres  and upwards they came
out strongly.   They were evidently the absorption bands of N 02,

    derived from the residue of atmospheric air mixed with the condensed
    gases.    We took a photograph of them, and on comparing this with
    a photograph of the N02 bands, we found the two to be identical.
    Except for the bands, and the bright lines of sodium, the spectrum
    appeared to be continuous, and to extend from about 7t 6200. to 7%4150,
    with the brightest part about X 5150.            It increased in brilliance as
    the pressure      increased, as well as       in   extent, being visible at
    3 atmospheres pressure from about X 6720 to 7\ 404.0.            The greater
    distinctness of the N02 bands at the higher pressures was due both
    to the greater brightness of the continuous spectrum and! to the
    greater quantity of NO2 formed.            A large quantity of water accu
    mulated in the experimental tube, and when this was drawn o<U+FB01> by
    the stopcock s, it effervesced with escape of NO, and was found to be
    strongly acid. A specimen titrated was found to contain very nearly
    3 per cent. of nitric acid.       The observations were continued up to a
    pressure of 410 atmospheres.         There was no indication that the con
    tinuous spectrum       had    any   connexion   with the line spectrum of
    hydrogen. There Wasnoincrease of brilliance in the neighbourhood
    of the C, F, or G lines of hydrogen. The characters of the-spectrum
    were, however, better seen in the absence of N 02, and will be do
  . scribed in the next section.
                            Oxygen Burning in Hydrogen.
     , In this case the   colour of the <U+FB02>ame was very different from that of
    hydrogen burning in oxygen;           Instead of being ye1low,.it appeared,
    to the unaided eye, to have a lavender hue.            In the spectroscope it
    showed a perfectly continuous spectrum, brightest in the green, about
    the region of the Fraunhofer line b, and very gradually fading away on
_
    either side.     On the red side it could be just traced up to about
    X 6150, and on the violet side to about X 4285, at ordinary pressures.
    The sodium lines were absent.            With increase of pressure it in
    creased very much in brightness, and at 8 atmospheres pressure it
    could be traced as low as X 6630 and as high as X 3990.
       The dispersion used was that of a direct-vision spectroscope-(such
                                ‘
    as was described by us, Roy. Soc. Pnoc.,’ vol. 411, p. 449), equivalent
    to three prisms of white <U+FB02>int glass, but the collimator and telescope
    very short, so as to obtain plenty of light. With less dispersion,
    perhaps, the continuous spectrum might hL\'€ been traced further.
    Photographs, however, showed that it scarcely extended into the
    ultra-violet.    There was no indication that this spectrum was due to
    an expansion of the lines of either the <U+FB01>rst, or second, spectrum of
    hydrogen. It is true that the maximum brightness (which could not
    be determined with any great accuracy) was not very far from F, but
    no indication of any second maximum in the neighbourhood of either

 220               Profs. G. D. Liveing and           J. Dewar.       [Feb. 19,
 C or G, or anywhere else, could be detected.                 The pressure was
 carried up to 12 atmospheres, and at this pressure the visible
 spectrum was brilliant, but, in the ultra-violet, photographs showed
 that the spectrum consisted only of what we have called the “ water
-spectrum,” very strong and sharp.                 The lines of this spectrum
 showed no signs of expansion even at a pressure of 12 atmospheres,
 and, though much more intense than at ordinary pressures, remained
-clearly de<U+FB01>ned.
    Observations were continued with the eye up to 25 atmospheres
 pressure, but no trace of emission, or absorption, corresponding to
either spectrum of hydrogen could be detected, and it is doubtful if
either spectrum can be produced in such a <U+FB02>ame. Since the formation
'of steam from its component gases \is attended with a diminution of
 volume, increased pressure will increase the stability of the com
 pound, and the flame will contain a larger proportion of steam, as
 well as have a-higher temperature, than at ordinary pressures.
    The water formed when the <U+FB02>ame was a jet of oxygen burning in
 hydrogen was found to be alkaline, and to contain ammonia.                 But
 the proportion-of ammonia. was much less -than the proportion of
 nitric acid formed when the jet was hydrogen burning in oxygen ; a
 specimen titrated contained 0004 per cent-.~of ammonia.
                 Efects  0f'.PT6881tT€‘O?1/Hie»  Sodium Spectrum.
    In order   ‘to  see  what effect would be produced by increased
 pressure on the spectrum of other substances in the <U+FB02>ame, we
 charged the hydrogen withsodium vapour by making it pass, before
 entering the experimental cylinder, through a small iron cylinder,
 e in the <U+FB01>gure, containing metallic-sodium, heated by a lamp.           As the
 D lines of sodium are veryeasily expanded and self-reversed in a
 <U+FB02>ame at ordinarypressure, some~care was needed to discriminate the
 effects which-were really to be ascribed to pressure.             The gas was
 easily charged    with sodium     vapour,    and  when  burning in oxygen, not
 only the D lines,*but the citron and green pairs, and sometimes the
 blue pair (X 467), and the orange pair (X 616), were well seen ; but
 we could not <U+FB01>nd Ythat they were expanded by increase of pressure.
 A sudden change of pressure generally produced an expansion, but it
did not .last':; the lines <U+FB01>ned down again when the pressure was
steady, whether that pressure was high or low.               These experiments
-were continued up to a          pressure     of 40 atmospheres without any
de<U+FB01>nite e<U+FB01>ect on the width of the lines which could be ascribed to
the pressure.
   It may be said that at the higher pressure the evaporation of the
sodium would be slower, and so the proportion of sodium vapour to
hydrogen be diminished; also, when the lines are diliuse at the

1891.]      In<U+FB02>uence   of Pressure    on the Spectra     of Flames.          221
edges to begin with,    it is extremely difficult      to judge whether there
is any expansion.        At all events, we may          say that there is no
expansion produced by pressure at all comparable with that produced
in a <U+FB02>ame at ordinary pressure by increasing the quantity of sodium
in the <U+FB02>ame.      We noticed, however, that the presence of sodium,
which produces a feeble continuous spectrum in a <U+FB02>ame at an
ordinary pressure, seemed to increase the continuous spectrum of the
<U+FB02>ame under pressure, especially in the orange and green.
                  Owy-h _1/drogen  Jei in Carbonic Acid Gas.
    For this experiment a two-branched tube (the upper one in the
<U+FB01>gure) was used.       The jet of mixed oxygen and hydrogen was <U+FB01>rst
lighted and     introduced     into the experimental cylinder while the
latter was full of air and the stopcock s open.               The air was then
replaced by C02 entering by         the  tube  0.    The   e<U+FB01>ect   of this was at
once to brighten the <U+FB02>ame and change its colour from yellow to blue.
Seen in the spectroscope, the change consisted in an increase of
continuous spectrum, especially towards the more retrangible end.
When the stopcock s was closed so that the pressure rose in the
experimental cylinder, the <U+FB02>ame increased in. brightness, but there
was no other change in the spectrum.            It remained continuous with
no bright or dark lines, or hands, except the D lines of sodium.                It
 resembled an ordinary <U+FB02>ame of CO.            The jet would not burn in CO2
unless there was some excess of oxygen, and even with an excess of
 oxygen we could not get it to continue to burn in CO2 at a pressure
 higher than 2 atmospheres.
                              Ethylene in Oxygen.
    A  jet of ethylene burning in oxygen gave, when the <U+FB02>ame was
 small, the usual candle-<U+FB02>ame        spectrum, together with a band in the
 indigo (X 431) shading towards the violet ; but as the pressure was
 increased the continuous spectrum brightened and completely over
 powered the bands, and at the same time the absorption spectrum of
 NO2 appeared.       We carried the pressure up to 33 atmospheres, and
 at that pressure the <U+FB02>ame seemed to give nothing but a continuous
 spectrum, intersected by the absorption bands of N02.               In our tube,
 the <U+FB02>ame was viewed almost directly end on,          and   it is possible that if
 we had seen the <U+FB02>ame sideways, we might have detected the hydro
 carbon <U+FB02>ame spectrum near the nozzle.             At the high pressure much
 soot separated.    We tried burning a mixture of ethylene and oxygen.
 The mixed jet burnt well in air and, when the supply of oxygen was
 su<U+FB02>icient, gave the hydrocarbon <U+FB02>ame spectrum.                   In the experi
 mental tube in oxygen, the jet burnt well        at the atmospheric pressure,

 222               Profs. G. D. Liveing and     J. Dewar.         [Feb. 19,
 but we failed to get it to continue burning when the pressure was
 increased.    The shaded band, commencing with a sharply-de<U+FB01>ned
 edge about X 4331, seems to be independent of the pressure, and has
 been before observed in a gas <U+FB02>ame (Huggins, ‘Roy. Soc. Proc.,’
 vol. 30, p. 580).   In fact, the only effect of pressure in this, as in the
 former cases, seemed to be the increase of the continuous spectrum.
                            Cyanogen and Oxygen.
    As we could not obtain cyanogen at such pressures      as we had used
in the case of the    other  gases, we were   obliged to content ourselves
with exploding mixtures of cyanogen and oxygen in an iron bottle,
<U+FB01>tted with a quartz stopper like that of the experimental tube above
described.    The bottle, having been exhausted by an air-pump, was
<U+FB01>lled with the mixture of gases, and exploded by an electric spark.
With less than 3 vols. of oxygen to 1 vol. of cyanogen, there was
always a considerable deposit of carbon, which covered the quartz and
impeded vision; but, with 3 vols. of oxygen to 1 of cyanogen, the
carbon was all burnt.     Notwithstanding the brilliant banded spectrum
of a <U+FB02>ame of cyanogen in oxygen at ordinary pressure, nothing but a
continuous spectrum could be seen in the <U+FB02>ash of the exploded gases,
except the ubiquitous D lines of sodium.        The continuous spectrum
was bright.     Photographs     showed a  continuous  spectrum with lines
of iron, calcium, potassium, and sodium, but no cyanogen or carbon
bands, or carbon lines.      When a little hydrogen was added to the
mixture of gases, no trace of the hydrogen red or green line could be
detected in the spectrum of the exploding gas.
   In every case, the prominent feature of the light emitted by
<U+FB02>ames at high pressure appears to be a strong continuous spectrum.
There is not the slightest indication that this continuous spectrum is
produced by the widening of the lines, or obliteration of the in
equalities, of the discontinuous spectra produced by the same gases
at lower pressures.     On the contrary, it seems to be developed inde
pendently.     This is, on the whole, quite in accordance with what
would be expected, considering that under pressure the molecules of
the gases have much less freedom, encounters amongst them are
much more frequent, and they have much less chance of vibrating
independently, and of taking up exclusively, or chie<U+FB02>y, the funda
mental rates of vibration which are natural to them when free.
Their condition, during a large part of any given time, approximates
to that of the molecules of a liquid, and their spectra approximate to
that of a liquid to at least a like extent.       On the other hand, the
higher temperature which, in many <U+FB02>ames, attends an increased
pressure ought to give some intensity to the special radiation which
the molecules emit during their time of free motion ; and this we have

 1891.]      In<U+FB02>uence  of Pressure  on the Spectra   of Flames.            223
noticed to occur in the principal sections of the discontinuous
spectrum of the oxy-hydrogen <U+FB02>ame.               Whether the continuous
spectrum is due to the mutual action        of   the molecules of the com
pressed gases may perhaps be best determined by some photometric
measures of the rate at which the brilliance increases with the
pressure.     Frankland (‘Exp. Researches,’ pp. 892 et seq.) has made
some such measures, but not sufficient to solve the question.              We
have made an attempt to measure, not the total intensity of the light,
but that of rays of de<U+FB01>nite refrangibility.
            Photometry of Org-Hydrogen Flame under Pressure.
   The apparatus used for these measures was a spectre-photometer of
the pattern employed by Crova (‘ Annales de Chimie,’ ser. 5, vol. 29,
p. 556).    In this, the rays of one of the sources of light to be com
pared are passed through two Nicol’s prisms, and then re<U+FB02>ected
into one half of the slit of the spectroscope, while the light from
the other source passes directly into the other half of the slit.
By turning one of the Nicol prisms, the light from the <U+FB01>rst source
can be reduced at pleasure, and any small section of the spectrum
can be separately observed by cutting off the rest by means of a
shutter in the eye-piece.        We found it by no means easy to get
good  concordant    observations.  A much larger vessel was used than
for the earlier experiments, one which contained several litres, and
so we may presume a more uniform pressure was maintained within
it. The results of the best series of observations on the photometric
intensity of the jet of oxygen burning in hydrogen are given in the
following table. The comparison light was a petroleum lamp.

at the respective pressures,          are approximately proportional      to the
squares of the pressures.
   This may be taken to indicate that the brightness of the continuous
spectrum depends mainly on the mutual action of the molecules of
gas.
   A  series of similar observations          on hydrogen burning in oxygen
gave somewhat     different results, tabulated below :—

   The <U+FB02>ame was brighter than that of oxygen burning in hydrogen
at ordinary pressure, but the rate of increase with increased pressure
was not so rapid as in the former case.           It seems as if the continuous
spectrum    were  made      up  of   two   part, one varying as the square of
the pressure, and another according to some other law.              The <U+FB02>ame is
evidently   not the same     in the   two  cases.  The products   of combustion
derived from the small quantity of air are di<U+FB01>erent, and also the
hydrogen jet always showed the presence of sodium, sometimes
calcium.    The appearance of the <U+FB02>ame was also di<U+FB02>erent; the hydro
gen jet being faintly visible and yellowish in the elongated part,
whereas the light from the oxygen jet was concentrated near the
base, the point being invisible.         The measures of which the means are
tabulated above were also less concordant than the corresponding
measures for the oxygen jet. We were unable to carry our measures
beyond a pressure of 95 lbs., because at higher pressures a cloud was
formed in the apparatus which prevented our seeing the <U+FB02>ame
directly. We hope to prosecute these measures with <U+FB02>ames of other
gases, and, if possible, at higher pressures.
   The conclusions to which our experiments have led seem incon
sistent with those which have been drawn from Pliicker and Hittorf’s
well-known observations on the widening of the hydrogen lines in
vacuous tubes with a residue of hydrogen when that residue increases.
That the widening of the lines in a Pliicker’s tube results from
increasing the density of the residue of hydrogen in the tube cannot
be gainsaid, but we are wholly ignorant of the mechanism by which
the gas is lighted up by the electric discharge,                It is sometimes
assumed,    but  without     any su<U+FB02>icient reason, that the energy of the
electric current is <U+FB01>rst converted into heat, and then in turn into

 radiation; but the electric energy may equally well be directly con
 verted into the motion of radiation.         As a fact, we have never yet
 been able to obtain either the emission or the absorption spectrum of
 hydrogen without the aid of an electric current, so that, in reasoning
 on this spectrum, we are much more in a region of speculation than
 when treating of <U+FB02>ames.        Whether the hydrogen lines, bright or
 dark, in the solar spectrum are {produced directly by the high
 temperature of the sun, may even be called in question.        And though
 we may admit that thedensity of the hydrogen in the sun’s atmo
 sphere, outside the photosphere, is but slight, it does not follow that
 the total pressure of all the gases ‘forming that atmosphere is so very
 small as Messrs. Frankland and Lockyer (‘ Roy. Soc. Proc.,’ vol. 17,
 p. 288) have, from the width of the lines, concluded it to be.        After
 all, it is not so easy to connect the temperature, even of a <U+FB02>ame,
 with its radiation, for it is only when the condition of a gas is steady
 that we can assume that there is a de<U+FB01>nite relation between the
 motion of agitation, on which temperature depends, and the vibratory
 motions, on which radiation depends.             In speculating on such
 questions, chemical, as well as electrical, changes must not be lost
 sight of, although the latter may be more directly -concerned in
 radiation.
    Experiments which we have -commenced upon the arc in an
 atmosphere of compressed gas tend to the same conclusion.           It does
 not appear that the metallic lines in the are are sensibly a<U+FB01>ected by
 a steady pressure up to 15 atmospheres.       The details of these observa
 tions, which are complicated by the variation of resistance with
 change of pressure, we -defer until .-the experiments are <U+FB01>nished.

       FOSTER, B.A., B.Sc., -F..R.S.     Receiwed February 4, 1891.
                                \(Abstract.,)
    Few of the accepted methods of focomet-ry take into account the
 distance between the two principal points (or Gauss points) of a lens,
 or afford -the means of measuring this distance, as well as the true
 focal length, and some of them are open to the objection that they
 necessitate troublesome double adjustments.          Of these methods the
 author gives a brief categorical review.
    He has devised a method in which there are no double adjustments,
 no measurements    of the size of optical images, no assumptions      as to

226         Focometry  of Lenses and Lens- Combinations.     [Feb. 19,
the approximate positions or distance apart of the two principal
points, but in which both the true focal length and the width between
the principal points are determined by direct measurements            of
lengths.
   The principle of the method is as follows :—Beyond the principal
focal points on each side of the lens, at distances equal to the true
focal length, are two points which are conjugate to one another
and symmetrically situated at twice the true focal length from the
two principal points.     These may be called the symmetric points:
and the planes drawn through them orthogonally to the principal
axis may be called the symmetric planes. They are planes of unit
magni<U+FB01>cation, and possess the known geometric property that the
ordinate in one of these planes of the point of intersection of any
incident ray is equal in magnitude, but opposite in sign, to the ordin
ate in the other plane of the point of intersection of the emergent
ray.   Let AB be the lens or combination of lenses, F,F2 the principal
foci, H1112 the principal points, SIS2 the symmetric points. Then
the true focal length is FQH2 = FIH1 = F1S1 = FQSQ.
   Suppose a parallel beam to be sent from left to right through AB ;
an image will be formed at F1. Let the light then be sent from right
to left forming an image at F2. Suitable transparent micrometers
are placed to receive these images and to ascertain their precise
position in space. A graduated bench is provided upon which the
lens  and  the micrometers are placed so as to read o<U+FB01> the distances
between these points.     A gearing is provided, namely, a right- and
left-handed screw, by means of which, when the two micrometers
have been placed at F1 and F2 and clamped to the screw, they can be
moved    by the experimenter at exactly equal rates outwards, so that
when one arrives at S1 the other arrives at S2. This is known by
observing in one micrometer the exact image of the other of equal
size. The distance through which the micrometers have each been
displaced is equal to the true focal length; and the distance H1H2
between the two principal points is found by reckoning backwards
from F1 and F2 distances equal to the focal length so found. The
positions of the two principal points can then be marked upon the
outside of the tube of the objective.
   These principles are embodied in an instrument described in the

_   1891.]             The Numerical Registration          of Colour.   _       227
    paper, and called a focometer. It has been constructed to the anthor’s
    designs by Messrs. Nalder Brothers, to whom sundry of the mechani
    cal details are due.
       The paper also describes the results obtained with the focometer
    upon various lenses, some of them being microscope objectives, others
    camera lenses.    The author <U+FB01>nds in several of these lenses that the
    principal planes are crossed : the distance between the symmetric
    points being less than four times the focal length. In some other
    lenses which are achromatic in respect of bringing all rays to a com
    mon principal focus, the positions of the principal planes are di<U+FB01>erent
    for rays of different colours.  In one lens, a microscope objective by
    Reichert, the principal planes are not only crossed but are actually
    at a greater distance apart than the two principal foci. The paper is
    accompanied by a sheet of full-size drawings showing the construc
    tion of the instrument and its details.

         Received February                 6, 1891.
       The Committee of the Royal Society on Colour Vision having put
    into my hands the determination of the colour of certain signal glasses,
    a memorandum was drawn up on the method of the numerical regis
    tration of colours and submitted to them.     They considered that it
    should be submitted to the Royal Society, and having slightly
    modi<U+FB01>ed   it, it  presented as a preliminary note of a part of a paper
                       is
    which will be subsequently submitted by General Festing and myself
    as Part   III of “ Colour Photometry.”                                  ~
       It must be premised that a colour determined when its hue, its
                                                      is
    purity, and its luminosity are known, the last constant being its
    comparison with the white light before its passage through a trans
    parent coloured body, or with white light re<U+FB02>ected from a white
     surface if
              it be an opaque coloured body such as a pigment.
        There has hitherto been a certain amount of di<U+FB01>iculty on the part
     of normal-eyed persons in stating the exact hue of compound colours
     in terms of any standard; in fact, believe, except by the method

     1888), there has been no exact means indicated of reproducing                a.
    colour from measurements made. The method which will be described
    can take the place of the previous plan for certain purposes, more
    particularly when        the impression on the eye which has to be
                            it   is
    considered.    Any colour can be reproduced from the registration
    numbers   with the greatest exactness.

green or the red, the matching of a compound colour with a simple
one in the spectrum should possess no di<U+FB02>iculties. Taking the trichro
matic theory of three sensations for the normal-eyed person, it is
evident that only the following classes of sensations are possible in
the normal-eyed, the green colour-blind, and the red colour-blind :—
             Normal eye.                      Green colour-blind.               Red colour-blind.

       Mixtures of green                      ——    . . . . . . . . . . .    Mixtures of green
         and violet                                                            and violet.
       Mixtures of red,                       —     . . . . . . . . .   ..     —
         green, and violet
  If    we take               of colour-blindness the green colour-blind
                      as a type
person, we see that every colour in the spectrum must be either red,
 violet, or these colours mixed with more or less white light, since
 these two sensations when excited in certain proportions give the
 sensation of white.      At one place, which is commonly called the
 neutral point, these proportions are such that there is the impression
of white light ; it follows that, between this neutral point and each end
of the spectrum, the rays are mixtures of violet and white or red and
white, the dilution of the colours varying from no white to all white.
As every compound colour must be a mixture of the same two colours in
certain proportions, it follows that the green colour-blind person can
match every compound colour with some one ray of the spectrum,
and that every colour must to him be either red or violet, diluted‘
with dilferent proportions of white light.
    In the same way, a person who is colour-blind to the red can
match any colour with a single spectrum colour, and he will see it as
green or violet diluted with more or less white light.        This can be
readily understood, but it is not quite so plain   how  any colour sensa
tion felt by the normal eye can be referred to the spectrum.
    The following is an outline of the reasoning which leads up to the
method of registration employed :—
    If we take three rays in the spectrum—one in the red between C
and the red lithium line, which we will call R, another in the green
between F and b, which we will call G, and a third in the violet near
G, but on the H side of                 it,
                               and which we may call V—then, by vary
ing   their intensities (which    equivalent to varying the luminosities)
                                               is

and mixing them, we can give the same impression to the eye that
any compound colour gives, and that of any intermediate simple
spectrum colour but very slightly diluted with white light. With
these same three colours, but in different proportions, we can also
give the impression of white light to the eye. The intermediate
spectrum colours between the green and the violet rays selected,
when slightly diluted, are imitated by mixing these rays together in
di<U+FB01>ereut proportions, and similarly those lying between the red and
the green by mixing together these rays in di<U+FB01>erent proportions—
and there is some ray present in the spectrum which, when very
slightly diluted with white light, has the same colori<U+FB01>c e<U+FB02>fect on the
eye as the mixtures of the pairs V and G and G and R in any pro
portions whatever.
    Let the luminosities of the rays R, G, and V, which give the im
pression of white light, be a, b, and 0 units respectively, andp, q, and
1" those which give that of the colour which has to be registered and
reproduced.     We then get the following equations—where W is
white, w its luminosity, Z the colour, and z its luminosity—
                                        aR+bG+cV=wW                 . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   .. (i);
                                        pR+gG+rV=zZ ..........                                        (ii).
  Then evidently——
                  (a-I-b+0)             =w,         and       (p+q+r)         ;    z.
  Letp=aa, q=/3b,1'=ryc.
Then we may write (ii) as—
                                        aaR+<U+FB02>bG+¢*/cV=         ZZ     . . . . . . . . . . . .   .. (iii).
Now, either      at,   <U+FB01>, or     'y   must be smaller than the other two.                            As an
example,   if   a be the smallest,            we    multiply (i) by       1, when we            get—
                                      aaR+a7/G+¢cV = 110W              . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
                                                                                                      (iv).
Subtracting (iv) from (iii), we get—
                             (/3-—a.)   bG+ (q—a)         cl’ = zZ—awW.
   Now, it has already been stated that between Vand G there is some
ray which gives the same sensation of colour, mixed with avery small
quantity of white light, as the above mixture of Vand G-—let us call
it X and its luminosity 2:        being evidently equal to (<U+FB02>—a)b+
                                              [:0
(q--a)c], and      the luminosity of the small quantity of white
                        ,u
added.
  We then get zZ = :cX+ (,u+1) W.

230                     Capt.    W. de W. Abney.                 [Feb. 19,
   Here we have the colour Z in terms of a single ray, and of white
light.
   This same holds good when in (ii) q is smaller than an and <U+FB01>; but
it does not do so should it happen that B is the smallest. for there is
no part of the spectrum which contains simple colours giving the
same sensation to the eye as mixtures of red and blue.             There is,
however, a very simple way in which the registration of such a colour
 (which it must be remarked must be of a purple tone) can be effected.
It can be <U+FB01>xed by its complementary. To do this we must add to (ii)
a certain amount of R and V, which will make the whole white.
Thus, suppose in (iii) a to be larger than q and ry than B, then we
must add (/>bG+0cV, and we have——
          ..a1a+(p+¢) bG+(<y+e)        cV= nW=        Z+<;bbG+9aV;
but (}3+¢) and (ry-i-0) each equal 1;          n = aw;
                         .'. Z-I-¢bG+90‘V     = MIJW.
Now, between V and G in the spectrum there is some single colour
which gives the sensation of the mixture of G and V. Let it be X’
with luminosity 12:’, together with white, whose luminosity is ,u', which
equals  ((151) + 90).
                             Z+w,X'+/4'W = awW;
                             Z:    (¢w—-/1.’) W—a:'X';
which again is the colour expressed in terms of white light less the
complementary colour.         We have thus arrived at the very simple
deduction that the hue and luminosity of any colour, however com
pounded, may be registered by a reference to white light and a single
ray of the spectrum.
   In practice this dominant ray is very easy to <U+FB01>nd. Suppose we
wish to determine numerically the colour of a signal-green glass in
the electric light; we should proceed as follows :——
   The colour-patch apparatus described in the Appendix to the
Bakerian Lecture “On Colour Photometry” (‘ Phil. Trans.,’ 1886,
Abney and Festing) is employed, and the coloured glas is placed
between the silvered mirror, which re<U+FB02>ects the beam already re<U+FB02>ected
from the <U+FB01>rst surface of the <U+FB01>rst prism of the spectrum apparatus,
and the screen, and a square image of that surface of the prism,
showing the tint of the glass, is formed on the screen by means of
the lens.      Touching this image is a square patch of white light,
formed by the re-combination of the spectrum by means of another
lens. An opaque slide, containing an adjustable slit, is moved across
the spectrum in the manner described in the paper referred to, until

-'   1891.]           The Numerical Registration     of Colour.            231
     the colour of this last patch is approximately the same hue as that of
     the glass.
         In the path of the re<U+FB02>ected beam, but between the prism and the
     silvered mirror, is inserted a piece of plain glass, which can be made
     to re<U+FB02>ect part of the white beam into the monochromatic patch of
    light, a square patch of this white light being formed by means of a
    third lens. \Ve thus have monochromatic light mixed with white
    light.     The requisite intensity of the added white light can be
    adjusted by means of rotating sectors which open and close at will
    during rotation, and the integrated luminosity of‘ the mixed beams
    can be altered by this, together with the adjustable slit in the slide.
    The slit may probably have to be moved in the spectrum to make the
    hue of these mixed lights the same as that of the glass, but by trial
    the position of the ray, whose colour, when diluted with white light,
    makes the match, is readily found. The position of the slit in the
    spectrum is noted, as also the aperture of the sectors.       The relative
    luminosities of the beam re<U+FB02>ected from the plain glass mirior and of
    the coloured ray are next measured by placing a rod in the path of‘
    the two beams, and equalising by the sectors the luminosity of the
    shadows which are illuminated, the one by the spectral ray, and the
    other by the white light. When the sector aperture is noted the
    registration is complete, as far as hue is concerned, but the luminosity
   of the ray transmitted through the glass should be compared with
   that of the unabsorbed re<U+FB02>ected beam, and then the total luminosity
    is doubly recorded.
        Should the colour of a pigment be in question, the ray re<U+FB02>ected
   from the silvered mirror is made to fall on the pigmented surface,
   and the same procedure      adopted.
        Should a purple glass (say) have to be registered, we proceed in a
   slightly di<U+FB01>erent manner, the patch of colour light passing through
   the purple glass is superposed over the spectrum patch, and the slit
   in the slide is moved till a ray is found which will make white light
   when superposed on the colour of the glass. The luminosities of this
   white light, of the re<U+FB02>ected beam, and of the spectral colour, are
   compared inter se, and there are then sui<U+FB01>cient data on which to
   make numerical registration.      In the paper which will be submitted
   to the Royal Society, and of part of which this is a preliminary note,
   the details of registration will be entered into more fully.
       The signal glasses having to be used at night with oil or gas, their
   hue must be registered in these lights.     As the spectrum colours are
 i
   always    the  same, it is convenient to use  the electric light spectrum,
   and the only alteration in the apparatus is to use two gas lights to
   illuminate two square apertures, in front of one of which the glass,
   whose colour has to be measured, is placed.          The images of these
   apertures are thrown on the screen, the coloured image touching the

   The determination of the colours in Maxwell’s disks by this plan
enables them to be used much more e<U+FB01>ectively than if they are
simply indeterminate colours.         For since the sum of the luminosities
of any colours is equal to the luminosity of the same colours
integrated, it follows that when using the disks the colours of the
dominant wave-lengths are really mixed and the white light inherent
in each case can be deducted.

CROONIAN       LECTURE.—“ On the Mammalian Nervous System;

                                 (Abstract)
                                1.  Introduction.
    In  the ‘
              Proceedings of the Royal Society,’ No. 273 (vol. 45, 1889,
p. 18), we published a preliminary account of some of the experi
 ments of which the results are given in detail in our full paper.
    In that communication we stated that the object of our work then
 was to endeavour to ascertain the character of the excitatory pro
 cesses occurring in nerve <U+FB01>bres when either directly, i.e., arti<U+FB01>cially,
 excited, or when in that state of functional activity which is due to
 the passages of impulses along them from the central apparatus.      The
 most important way in which such a method could be applied was,
 obviously, one which would involve the investigation of the excita
 tory changes occurring in the <U+FB01>bres of the spinal cord when the
 cortex cerebri is stimulated. We must at once assume that the motor
 side of the central nervous system is practically divisible into three
 elements.      (1.) Cortical centres.          Ejferent (pyramidal tract)
fibres, leading down through the internal capsule, corona radiata, and
 spinal cord.         Balbo-spinal centres contained in the medulla and
 the spinal cord, and forming the well-known nuclei of the cranial and
 also of the spinal motor nerves.
    It had already been determined, both by direct observation and by
 the graphic method (1), that certain areas of the cortex were con
 uected with de<U+FB01>nite movements of various parts of the body, and (2)
 that while the complete discharge of the cortical apparatus was

 236             Mr. F. Gotch and Prof. Victor Horsley.          [Feb. 26,
followed by    a very de<U+FB01>nite and characteristic series of contractions of
 the muscles in special relation with the particular point excited, the
 effectual removal of the cortical central mechanism and subsequent
 excitation of the white <U+FB01>bres passing down through the internal cap
 sule, &o., led to the production of only a portion of the e<U+FB01>ect pre
 viously obtained from the uninjured brain.
    This method of observation in no wise showed what processes were
actually occurring in the spinal and other nerve <U+FB01>bres, and although
the ablation of the cortical centre to a certain degree suggested the
extent to wl1 ich the cortex acted, nevertheless it did not atford an
exact demom tration of the same. Moreover, the data which the
graphic method furnished were precluded, through their being muscu
lar records, from determining what share, if any, the lower bulbo
spinal central nerve cells took, either in the production of the charac
teristic sequence of contractions or in the modi<U+FB01>cation, whether in
quality or in force, of the descending nerve impulses during their
-transit.  It seemed to us that the only way to approach this subject
would be to get, as it were, between the cortex and the bulbo-spinal
system of centres.     This would be accomplished if some means were
devised of ascertaining the character of the excitatory processes
occurring in the spinal <U+FB01>bres of the pyramidal tract when, upon exci
tation of the cortex, nervous impulses were discharged from cortical
cells, and travelled down the cord.
    The question as to the extent to which it is possible to obtain
 physical evidence of the actual presence in nerve <U+FB01>bres of excitatory
 processes, and thus to arrive at reliable data for the comparison of their
 amounts, is one which up to the present has been answered only indi
 rectly, and that in two ways: <U+FB01>rst, by the extension of Helmholtz's
 classical experiment of determining the rate of transmission, and,
 secondly, by observing those variations in the electrical state of nerve
 <U+FB01>bres which Du Bois-Reymond discovered to be an invariable con
 comitant of the excitatory state. As will subsequently be shown in
 the historical retrospect, it is well known, through the researches of
 Du Bois-Reymond and others, that the <U+FB01>bres of the spinal cord, just
as nerve <U+FB01>bres in the peripheral trunks, are characterised by showing,
when unexcited, an electrical difference between their longitudinal
surface and cross sections; and, furthermore, that when excited, a
well-marked diminution of this resisting electrical state is produced
in the <U+FB01>bres of the cord, as in those of nerve trunks. Now, since
such excitatory variations in the electrical state are presumably paral
lel in time and amount with the presence in the nerve of the series of
unknown processes, termed excitatory, which a series of stimuli
evokes, it was reasonable to presume that, if the cortex were dis
charging a series of nerve-impulses         at a certain rate down the
 pyramidal tract. there would be a series of parallel changes in the

1891.]               On the Mammaliaiz Nervous System.                                     237
e‘ectrical condition of the <U+FB01>bres in the cord tract, and that, with a
suitable apparatus for responding to such changes, these might be
both ascertained and recorded.                      The accomplishment          of a further
purpose, viz., the localisation of both paths and centres by ascertaining
the excitatory electrical effects in relation with them, was one of the
main objects we had in view. In carrying it out, we found it was
unnecessary to employ the electrometer, and, in fact, that it was ad
vantageous to use the galvanometer,                          the record of which would be
more easily and more accurately noted, since its graduation admits of
far higher magni<U+FB01>cation.                   Moreover, with this instrument it was
possible, by employing               a   series      of stimuli, of known number and
duration, to obtain quantitative results of de<U+FB01>nite comparative value,
as will be shown further on; and thus, to compare both the size of
different central paths and t-he amount of nervous energy discharged
along the same path from different sources.
   The plan upon which the full paper is framed is, <U+FB01>rst, to give an
historical retrospect of the work of authors who have opened up the
study of electrical changes in the central and peripheral nervous
system; second, to describe at length our mode of experimentation,
with special reference to the modi<U+FB01>cations which we have introduced,
then to compare roughly the results we have obtained by our present
method with those which had been previously ascertained by the
graphic method, and so introduce the description of the facts which
we have discovered, elucidating the physiology of the spinal cord, both
in its relation to the higher centres and to the peripheral nerves.
                              2. E:vpe'r'imental           Procedure.
   The observations were in all cases made on etherised animals (cat
and monkey), with due regard to the special in<U+FB02>uence of the anaes
thetic.   The operative procedure was so designed as to provide for
suitable exposure of a particular region of the nervous system for
excitation, and of another part in which the elect-romotive changes
evoked by the stimulation may be observed.                           The relative parts were
as follows :
         Part exposed     for Excitation..                      Part exposed for Observation.

   The excitation was either electrical, chemical (i.e., with absinthe
and strychnine), or mechanical.                     In the former instance the duration

238              Mr. F. Gotch and Prof. Victor Horsley.               [Feb. 26,
and intensity were specially determined.          The records were made by
a Thomson high-resistance re<U+FB02>ecting galvanometer, and a Lippmauu’s
mercurial capillary electrometer.
   The tissue, whether nerve or spinal cord, was so arranged for obser
vation as to be always suspended in the air, one end remaining in
connexion with the animal; consequently any error due to current
deviations from the rest of the body could only have a slight and
unipolar effect.
3. Resting    Electrical Diference between the Cut Surface        of the Tissue
                   and its Uninjnred Longitudinal Surface.
   The average amounts of this di<U+FB01>erence in the tissues observed were
as  follows :—
                       Cat.                               Monkey.
      Nerve (69 cases), 0'01 Daniell ..       .  (12 cases), O'0O5  Daniell.

      Cord (50 cases), O'032         ,,   . . .  (9 cases),  0022      ,,
   We have observed that the cord di<U+FB01>erence is greater when that tissue
is in connexion with the higher centres, and that it rises after each
excitation. An important fall of the difference is to be remarked in
all three tissues    as a  direct result of systemic death.
4. Electrical    Changes in the Spinal Cord evoked by Excitation          of the
                      Cortex Cerebri and Corona Radiata.
   We further discuss in our full paper the following points additional
to those described in our previous communication, and which have
resulted from the observation of the above changes :—
   (a.) Localisation of cortical areas of representation in relation to
         the various regions of the cord.
   ((2.) Bilaterality of representation in the central nervous system, as
         evidenced by the electrical changes in the two halves of the
         spinal cord. consequent upon excitation of the brain or cord.
5.  Electrical Changes in the Spinal Cord when Evoked by Direct Excita
           tion of its Fibres, after Severance from the Encephalon.
   We have by employment of this method ascertained the proportion
ate existence of direct channels in the various columns of the spinal
cord, our design embracing the quantitative comparison of the elec
trical changes (and so indirectly of the nerve impulses) which are
transmitted as a result of minimal excitation of the <U+FB01>bres. To further
control our observations on these points, we have also determined the

1891.]            On   the  Mammalian Nervous System.                         239
extent of interruption in any given channel by intervening sections of
the same.
   As an extension of this subject, we have investigated the concurrent
spread of nervous impulses to collateral paths, and probably to
centres, when this further condition is introduced by increase in the
stimulus.
   The above results have been obtained in the      case   of both ascending
and descending impulses.
   Among other general conclusions from this division of our research
are the following :—
   (l.) High    degree of unilaterality    of representation in the spinal
cord.
   (2.) Spread of impulses from one posterior column to another and
from one posterior column to its neighbouring lateral column through
centres.
6.  The Relation   of the   Paths and of the Bulbo-Spinal Centres in           the
           Spinal Cord   to the Peripheral Nerves and their Roots.
   We have investigated this important relationship in the following
modes :—
   (I.)  The Electrical Changes in the Spinal Cord evoked by Excitation
of a  Mixed  Nerve or its R00ts.—The chief conclusions which have been
deduced from the results of these experiments, by means of minimal
excitation and the employment of the method of blocking by inter
vening sections, include the following :
   (1.) Complete obstruction offered to centripetal impulses reaching
the cord by the central end of the anterior root.                   -
   (2.)  Mode  of  conduction,   direct and indirect, in  the  cord   of centri
petal impulses passing up the posterior root.
   (3.) Localisation of the direct path of afferent impulses in the pos
terior column of the same side as that of the nerve or root excited.
   (4.) Localisation of the indirect path of afferent impulses in the
posterior columns of the same and the opposite side and the lateral
column of the same side as that of the nerve excited.
   (5.) Proportionate development of both systems of paths in the two
sides of the cord.
   Expressed in percentages of the total transmission, this proportion
is as follows :—
    Posterior column of same side as the excited nerve.. .           60 p. c.
    Lateral column of same side as the excited nerve.. . . .          20 97
    Posterior column of opposite side to the excited nerve            15
    Lateral column of opposite side to the excited nerve . .           5   ,,

Excitation of the Spinal Gord.——Whereas in the foregoing series (I)
we dealt only with ascending impulses, we proceeded to investigate
the distribution of descending impulses by observing the above-named
changes when the individual columns of the cord are excited by
minimal and later with more intense stimuli, controlling our results
by the method of intervening sections.
   We can summarise the effects observed as follows :—
   (1.) Marked quantitative diminution su<U+FB01>ered by impulses, leaving
the spinal cord by the anterior roots, whether originating in the
cortex cerebri, corona radiata, or the lateral columns of the cord.
         Localisation of direct transmission of impulses in the posterior
column and passing out into the posterior roots of the same side.
   (3.) Proportionate development of the direct and indirect paths in
the individual columns of the cord, passing out into the mixed nerve
of the one side.
   (4.) E<U+FB01>ects observed in the posterior roots when the bulbo-spinal
centres are excited either by strychnine or electrically (kinaesthesis).
   Finally,  the chief general principles elucidated   by this research may
be stated as follows :—
   (1.) Unilateral character of the representation of function in the
paths of the central nervous system.
   (2.) The physiological characteristics of the regions of a nerve
centre  :—
   (a.) The kinaesthetic activity of the a<U+FB01>erent region of the centre.
   (b.) The obstruction offered by the e<U+FB01>erent region, including the
           <U+FB01>eld of conjunction, to the transmission‘ of impulses through
          the centre.

   In a paper read before the Royal Society on June 16, 1881,
Professor G. H. Darwin stated: “ It is difficult to conceive any mode
in which an elastic solid can rupture except by shearing, and hence
it appears that the greatest shearing stress is a proper measure of
the tendency to break” (‘ Phil. Trans.,’ 1882, p. 99).
   In this paper, I have recorded the results of some experiments
made with a view to throwing light on the question raised by
Professor Darwin.
   The experiments were conducted in the mechanical laboratory at
the Royal Indian Engineering College, Cooper’s Hill, the machine
used being a hundred-ton single lever hydraulic testing machine by
Messrs.Buckton & Co., of Leeds.        This machine is fully described in
          ‘
Unwin’s Testing of Materials of Construction,’ p. 133.
   All tension experiments were performed on circular specimens
<U+FB01>tted with a screw thread at each end, on to which were screwed
steel nuts resting in spherical seatings to ensure directness of pull.
   The shearing experiments were conducted on specimens screwed
throughout their entire length into three steel blocks, and tested in
double shear, 'i.e., the two outside blocks were pulled in the opposite
direction to the inside block—perpendicularly to the axis of the
specimen, and the bar sheared in two places at once.
   The idea of rupture necessarily implies an overcoming of resist
ance.   lf the power of steel to resist rupture under tension were a
constant quantity, the conception of rupture would be simple, for
we should only have to increase the stress up to the required amount,
and the bar would break; but the resistance to rupture appears to
be a function of the amount of <U+FB02>ow that has taken place (see experi
ments described in Table II). If we take two axes, OX, OY, to re
present respectively the elongation per unit of length, and the stress
per unit of area of transverse section of elongated bar, we obtain the

 244                       Prof. Carus-Wilson.
true stress strain curve 0C for the steel of which the bar is com
posed (<U+FB01>g. 3).     We may refer to the same axes the curve AB
showing the increase in the resistance to rupture with elongation
per unit of length—and when AB cuts the curve OC the bar
must break, i.e., when the stress per unit of area of transverse
section becomes greater than the breaking stress corresponding to
that degree of elongation.    If the two curves do not meet, the bar
will continue to draw out—as is the case with lead.
   The method that is ordinarily adopted for estimating the tensile

                The Rupture    of Steel  by  Longitudinal Stress.           245
strength of a metal, viz., by dividing the maximum load by the
original area, is a purely conventional method, and does not repre
sent any real stress whatever; it simply shows what load would
be sustained by a given section before it broke, and though it is no
doubt a useful <U+FB01>gure for engineers to know, it does not tell us
anything about the actual stress at fracture; this can only be arrived
at by dividing the load on the specimen at the point of rupture by
the contracted area measured after the specimen has broken.                  In
this paper, the breaking stress will always be measured in this way,
and will be referred to as the “ true tensile strength
                                                                ”
                                                                  of the metal.
This is what M. Considere in his ‘L’Emploi du Fer et de l’Acier’
(Paris, Dunod, 1885) calls “ résistance de striction.”
    It is well known that when a bar is subjected to tension——the stress
not being uniformly distributed, as, for instance, when the pull is not
eentral——the mean stress borne by the bar at rupture is less than it
would be if the stress had been uniformly distributed.
     It is stated in Thomson and Tait’s ‘Natural Philosophy,’ Part II,
                 “ a solid of
p. 258, that                  any elastic substance, isotropic or aaolotropic
   . . . . . experiences    in<U+FB01>nite stress and strain in the neighbourhood
of a re-entrant edge or angle, when in<U+FB02>uenced by any distribution of
force, exclusive of surface tractions in<U+FB01>nitely near the angles or
edges in question.”
     Three steel bars, numbered 829, 830, and 831, were taken and cut
in three pieces; one piece was tested plain, and the second piece
with a \/-groove turned on it (see <U+FB01>g. 1).                The tool cutting the
 \/-groove was made with its cutting edges at about 90°, and the
point as <U+FB01>ne as possible.        The results are given in Table I. It is
 clear that the \/-groove is very prejudicial.          For the same reason a
 \/-groove with a rounded angle must be prejudicial, though not to such
an extent, since the distribution of stress is more uniform.          Specimen
No. 834 was cut in three pieces and tested, one plain and one with a
groove of the same shape as Nos. 829, 830, 831, but with the point
of the cutting too] just rounded 0E. The strength of the grooved
bar is now 0'95 of the plain.        Similarly, with specimens 822 and 50,
 the grooved pieces have strengths of 84 and 89 respectively.            These
 experiments show that the mean stress            at rupture diminishes as the
angle of the groove becomes more acute.
     When, however, we come to test specimens with a groove as in
<U+FB01>g. 2, we <U+FB01>nd that they are stronger than the plain specimens.
     Table I gives the results of such experiments on seven steel bars
 (including the four already mentioned). Each bar was cut in three
pieces.
     The plain bar was tested <U+FB01>rst, and           the groove then cut in the
 second piece     to the same   diameter  as  the  contracted area in the plain
 piece, so as to secure as much as possible similarity of conditions.

   The e<U+FB01>ect of the U-groove by itself in producing non-uniformity
of stress-—as in the \/-groove—would       tend to make the U-grooved
bar break at lower stress than the plain bar, where the stress must

 be very nearly uniformly distributed, but, in spite of this prejudicial
action, the U-grooved bar        the stronger.   is

         a
reckoned in the conventional manner, viz., maximum load divided by
original area         Unwin,    Testing of Materials of Construction,’
                                                 ‘
p. 82, and   Burr, ‘Elasticity and  Resistance of Materials of Engineer
ing,’ p. 230).
   The reason of this     that the so-called tensile strength depends on
                                       is
the amount of drawing out before local contraction begins, and since
in a  plain barthe general contraction of area may be considerable,
the actual load on the specimen, at the maximum,            much smaller            is
than on a bar of the same metal in which the drawing out       suppressed                is
-—owing   to  the groove.
  In the experiments quoted above,                          I     have discounted altogether the
contraction of area, and considered                               only the actual stress on the
section at rupture.
  It    is    possible that in some cases the metal at the groove                             is   stronger

                  T/ze Rupture     of Steel   by  Longitudinal Stress.                247
  than at any other point in the bar; this would tell in its favour
 against a plain bar which is free to break at the weakest spot. The
  steel on which these experiments were colnducted was very homo
 geneous, and the variation of strength within a short distance on the
 same bar would not be more than 4 or 51 per cent., so this would
 scarcely account for the phenomena.
     On the other hand, a grooved specimen is at a disadvantage when
 compared with a. plain specimen for four reasons ;—
     (i) The stress is much more unevenly distributed over the least
 section in the grooved bar than in the plain.
     (ii) If the pull is not exactly parallel to the axis of the bar, bending
 stresses are induced, which are very prejudicial in the grooved bar,
 whereas their e<U+FB01>ect is largely neutralised in the plain bar by the
 ready <U+FB02>ow of the metal.*
     (iii) The load at rupture can be observed with accuracy in testing
 the grooved bar, for it breaks off short, and the required load is also
 the maximum load.             In testing the plain bar, however, in con
 sequence of the very rapid contraction of area immediately before
 rupture, the load has to be reduced, in order to keep the lever hori
 zontal ; sometimes the load cannot be run back quick enough,and the
 bar may break while the lever is resting on the bottom stop, so that
 too high a load may be observed as the load of rupture; this would
 tend to give a higher breaking stress in the plain bar than was
 actually the case?‘
     (iv) The grooved bar has a crystalline fracture. The plain bar
 has a silky fracture.         Experiments will be quoted later on to show
 that the ultimate resistance to rupture is less, the more crystalline is
the steel at the moment of rupture.
     Careful measurements have been made of the test piece N0. 831
 (the others being very similar), to ascertain the least area of all
planes passing through any point in the narrowest section at 45° to
the axis (i) in the grooved bar, (ii) in the plain bar; the section of
these planes is shown at ab in <U+FB01>g. 4; the diameter at the narrowest
section was the same in both specimens.                  The ratio of the area of
this plane      in the   grooved   bar    to that  in  the  plain was found to be
183    : 100.
    If, now, rupture      is an overcoming of a resistance to shearing, the
grooved       bar ought to be stronger than the plain in the ratio of
183 to 100, other things being the same in both bars.
    For the resistance to shearing, at rupture, will be the resistance of
all the planes similar to those shown in the <U+FB01>gures, equally inclined
to the axis, and if the area of any one of these planes in the grooved

 will  be in the same ratio.*
    In this specimen (N 0. 831), the ratio of the true breaking stresses
 is actually 120 : 100.       But there are four causes tending to reduce
 the strength of the grooved specimen, as has been shown above, viz. :—
 The non-uniformity of stress, the possibility of a pull not perfectly
 longitudinal, the danger of observing too high a load on the plain
 specimen, and, lastly, the crystalline nature of the steel at fracture in
 the grooved specimen.
    "" This assumes that the shearing stress is uniform over both of these oblique
                                                                        “
 planes ; the probability of this supposition is discussed in a paper on The Distri
 bution of Flow in a Strained Elastic Solid,” published in the ‘Philosophical
 Magazine,’ for June, 1890.

   All   these causes tend to reduce the superiority of the grooved bar;
the e<U+FB01>ect of the non-uniformity of stress is, no doubt, the greatest;
in fact, as has been shown, if the groove is of \/-shape, this causes
the plain bar to be the strongest, so that it is quite conceivable
that the non-uniformity of stress in the U-grooved bar, with other
causes mentioned, might reduce the strength from 180 : 100 to
120 : 100 of the plain bar.
   The following are the experiments referred to, in order to prove
that the ultimate resistance of steel to shearing diminishes inversely
with the drawing out :—
   Six pieces of the same steel bar were taken and drawn out under
tension to varying percentages of their length; they were then pre
pared as shearing specimens, as explained above, and tested in double
shear, with the following results :—

   Thus the ultimate resistance to shearing increases with the drawing
out.     Taking the contraction of area as a measure of the <U+FB02>ow, No. 831
specimen contracted 50 per cent. on the plain bar and 28‘l per cent.
on the U-grooved bar, so that the former would be at an advantage,
compared with the latter, in this respect.
   It appears, then, that the load that can be borne by a given section
of steel without rupture can be increased by thickening the bar
above and below the section in question, though, if the angle of the
groove be too acute, the reverse is the effect.                      But the prejudicial
action of a groove, owing to non-uniformity                  of   stress produced, is the
same in a U- or \/-groove, and differs only in amount, so that the
U-groove, by itself, could not strengthen the bar, but must weaken
it; yet in spite of this, the U-grooved bar is stronger than the plain
bar.    The increase of strength, then, must be due to the added
material ; but in no way could such added material strengthen such a
section, and enable it to stand a greater load, if rupture is produced
by a certain intensity of tensile stress; we cannot diminish the mean
stress on the section by thickening the bar above and below; on the
                                                                                s 2

 contrary, we increase the stress over part of the section, and it is the
 maximum stress that we have to reckon with, for the bar will begin
 breaking there and tear across.
     There is no doubt that the added material increases the resistance
 to shearing, and I am, therefore, led to the conclusion that it is this
 increased resistance to shearing that causes the increase in strength ;
 in other words, by adding material above and below the section, the
 shearing stress for elements lying in the section is certainly reduced,
 and, at the same time, the strength is certainly increased, the conclu
 sion drawn being that the true measure of the tendency to break is the
 greatest shearing      stress.
    The fact that longitudinal tension is equivalent to a uniform dilating
 tension and a shearing stress, and that by the means above described
 we can diminish the latter, without altering the former, and thereby
 strengthen the bar, are strong reasons for supposing that Professor
 Darwin’s statement is correct, and that it is the shearing stress pro
 duced by longitudinal stress that causes rupture.
    If  it be   true that the rupture of a steel bar under tension is
 determined      by the greatest shearing stress, we should expect to <U+FB01>nd
 that a de<U+FB01>nite relation existed between the ultimate resistance to
 direct shearing and the same to direct tension.
    Much has been written about the relation of these two resistances,
 but the conclusions drawn are very misleading, since the tensile
 strength considered has been that calculated in the conventional
 manner, which has, as has been shown, no real signi<U+FB01>cance and is no
real stress.
    By a well known theorem, the greatest shearing stress is equal to
one-half the longitudinal stress; we should then expect to <U+FB01>nd that
one-half the true tensile stress at rupture was equal to the stress at
rupture in a shearing experiment on a piece of the same steel.
    If the steel be soft, it will contract locally before breaking; hence
the greatest shearing stress will be less than half the longitudinal
stress in the ratio of the sections of a cylindrical and contracted bar,
 cut by planes parallel to do and ab (<U+FB01>g. 5) respectively, the two bars
having the same cross section at we ,- in other words, in the ratio of
 ~/2 (area across we) to (area across aob), where boe = 45°.       If this
ratio   be  called 0, and the true tensile stress at rupture be p, the
shearing stress at rupture in a shearing experiment should be equal
to  @120.
    Table  III   gives the resuls of some experiments made to investigate
this question.        The tensile and shearing experiments were made
respectively on pieces of steel cut from the same bar; the former were
made on circular specimens screwed at each end, and resting on nuts
bearing on spherical seatings ; the shearing specimens were screwed

   7th gives {,~p0 ; the 8th gives w2,_the area of the specimen in the
   shearing experiment; and the 9th column gives s, the intensity of
   shearing stress at rupture in the shearing experiment.
      It will be seen that in every case %p0 is very nearly equal to s, 'l.e.
   the shearing stress at rupture in a tensile experiment is very nearly
   equal to the ultimate resistance to shearing in a pure shearing experi
   ment.
      There are, however, two points to be considered before accepting
  the result of these experiments.
      The distribution of stress over the section of rupture in the tension
  experiment has been assumed constant, whereas it is not actually so.
  I  <U+FB01>nd, by actual measurement, that the area of a plane section at 45°
  to the axis passing through the centre of the narrowed section bears
  to the area of a parallel plane passing through a point on the circum
  ference, the ratio of 100 to 108, in a bar which has contracted 50 per
  cent., so that the shearing stress is rather greater at the centre, and
  hence     the value   of ép, given above, is too small by about 4 per
  cent.
      On the other hand, it has been pointed out to me by Professor
  Darwin that the distribution of stress in the shearing experiment is
  probably not uniform, being greater in the neighbourhood of the
  application of the stress.
      Experiments were made with two pieces of Lowmoor iron, out off the
  same bar, and prepared as shearing specimens in the ordinary way,
 and tested in double shear, one with an area to be sheared of twice
  1039 square inch, and the other of twice 0322 square inch. The
 result was as follows: Large section, shearing stress at rupture—(i)
  187, (ii) 18'9; mean, 188 tons per square inch.                    Small section,
 stress at rupture—(i) 201, (ii) 20'6; mean 2035.                Giving the latter
 as 8'2 per cent. stronger than the former. The smaller the section the
 more uniform will be the stress, and with the small section employed
 in the experiments quoted in Table           III  the stress is probably nearly
 uniform.
     It would seem, then, that the possible errors due to the unequal
distribution of stress in the tensile and shearing experiments would
nearly balance one another, and that we may regard these results as
 tending to con<U+FB01>rm the theory that the greatest shearing stress is the
proper measure of the tendency to break.*‘
    "  I have made experiments of a similar kind on cast iron. Great care was taken in
casting to secure uniformity, by casting the bars upright and cutting off the spongy
top; they were cast with two heads which were turned to <U+FB01>t spherical seatings.
The shearing specimens were cut off bars from the same cast.      The bars in tension
were 10 inches long between the shoulders, and turned throughout their length.

                 The Rupture        of Steel by  Longitudinal Stress.                 253
     It will  now be necessary to enquire how far the appearance of the
fracture of a steel bar affords evidence of its having broken by
shearing.
    In a bar of circular section         and uniform thickness throughout its
length, every plane at 45° to the axis opposes an equal resistance to
the tangential stress caused by direct tension.                    Hence, there is no
one plane or planes along which the bar would be more ready to
break by shearing than along any other plane, provided that the
material was of uniform strength throughout. If, however, the bar
be    gradually thinned at a certain point, this will no longer be the case ;
it has been shown on p. 252, that the area of a plane at 45° to the
axis passing through the centre of the narrowed section is less than
the area of a plane passing through any other point in that section ;
hence, there will be a surface formed by a complete cone of 415°, with
apex at the centre of the narrowed section, which will oppose a less
resistance to rupture by shearing than any other similar cone with
apex at any other point. This cone is shown in section in <U+FB01>g. 6 at
gof—a0b.        We should then expect to <U+FB01>nd rupture result in a fracture
formed by a cone and crater, or, since there is nothing to determine
along which part of the cone rupture will take place, we may expect
to <U+FB01>nd the cone irregularly broken up, part on one end, and part on
the other.
     This narrowing of girth at one point always accompanies the
rupture of soft steel, and we invariably <U+FB01>nd such a cone and crater ;
<U+FB01>gs. 5 and 6, Plate 2, and 6 and 7, Plate 3, are good examples.
     [Note.——The rupture of cast iron in compression by shearing is of
course well known. Fig. 2, Plate 2, shows the cone of shearing very
well.]
     In <U+FB01>at bars of soft steel, this shearing action is still more marked.
Here the surface of the least resistance is a plane at 45° to the axis
and making 90° with the thin side of the bar ; it is evident that in a
bar whose width            is considerable compared with its thickness, and
which has suffered considerable local contraction, this plane has the
least area of all planes at 45° to the axis passing through any point in

with the surface of least resistance to shearing, 1..e., becomes inclined
at 45° to the axis.
   Now, at rupture, an originally soft bar is harder in the centre of
the narrowed section than at the circumference, where the drawing
out has been less; hence, fracture commences at the centre perpen
dicular to the axis, and tears outwards until it reaches the softer
material, when it will continue along a surface of least resistance to
shearing, 'i.e., along a surface formed by the intersection of two cones.
Hence, we <U+FB01>nd the fracture of a soft steel bar consisting of a crater
with a more or less extended base; see <U+FB01>gs. 5 and 6, Plate 2, and 6
and 7, Plate 3.
   The harder the steel, at the outset, the broader will be the base of
the crater, until, in very hard steels, there is only a rim or crown left
round the edge; and in the hardest steels all trace of the surface of
least resistance to shearing disappears.
                                           “ hard" in the sense
   [N0te.——[ have employed the term                               usually

                                             is measured by the value of
the limit of elastic resistance.]

   1. In the publications of the Society from 1859 to 1870, many com
munications by Sir Henry Roscoe on this subject will be found. Of
these, the most important bearing directly on my observations
are—

Chemical Action of Sunlight,” in ‘ Phil. Trans.,’ 1863, pp. 139-160.
   It is proved, inter alia, that equal shades are produced in photo
graphically sensitised paper by equal products of intensity of light
 X time of insolation. The preparation of a photographic paper which
shall always possess the same degree of sensitiveness is carefully
described.

    By “total daylight” is meant the whole resultant action of the
Sun and sky on paper exposed horizontally.
    By “diffuse daylight” is meant the same action when the Sun was
stopped out.
    The “ direct sunlight” was taken as the di<U+FB01>erence between these
two ; it does not appear to have been observed directly.

    2. My observations       made at Dacca, in 1861-1866         (repeated at
Milverton, in Somersetshire, during the last year), were made in
entire ignorance of the work of Sir H. Roscoe; his results, therefore,
so far as they agree with mine, afford an independent support to my
theory.    My experiments have been directed largely to ascertaining
the laws of the distribution of the actinic power in the sky, and thus
the work of Sir H. Roscoe overlaps mine at particular points only.
So also Roscoe has taken numerous observations of the sky more or
less clouded;    I   take no observation except when the sky is clear, as I
<U+FB01>nd even a very slight haze to produce large diiferences in the
measurements, and to bring into the numerical results complications
that I have not at present attempted to deal with.                      I
    3. The method of measurement           I  adopted, is the darkening pro
 duced in sensitised photographic paper; for this e<U+FB01>ect I accept
 Roscoe’s term of “ the chemical action.” My method of measurement
 differs from that of Roscoe in one important point:          I use strips cut
 from one uniform sheet of ordinary photographic paper; all my
 measurements are so far relative, and          I obtain the same numerical
 results (ratios) with any paper.        I compare ultimately the e<U+FB01>ect of
 the Sun and of a candle on this same paper.             Roscoe, by preparing
 special paper      with   de<U+FB01>nite   proportions  of  nitrate  of silver, &c.,
 depends on thus reproducing paper of exactly the same sensitiveness.
 I  make each measurement numerically (as did Roscoe) by comparing
 the shade produced with some standard blackness.
    4. I assume that in the burning of a stearine candle, the
                                                                    “ chemical
 action” is proportional to the material consumed.            I have taken as
 my unit       of measure of chemical action, the darkening produced
 at a distance of 1 inch from the wick of the candle, when 100 grains
 were consumed, which, in the candle         I used in India, occupied about

                Photometric Observations  of the Sun and Sky.         257
 47 minutes.       [I  am here narrating the course   I pursued in com
 mencing     these observations   at Dacca;   I  very soon  discarded the
 candle, as   I was able, by the aid of my table given below, to recover
 the unit of measurement by a Sun observation]
    5. I  form a strip of photographic paper about § inch deep into a
 circular ring, placed inside a metal cylinder 3 inches in diameter.     I
 place now my standard candle eccent-rically, at a distance of l inch
 from the surface, and burn the 100 grains of stearine.      I thus get a
 strip which is gradually coloured from the point nearest the centre
  (where   the intensity is unit i) to the most remote point (where the
 intensity is   f i). By calculating the distances of various points of
 the ring from the wick, the intensities corresponding to these dis
tances can be marked.         I exhibit a small strip (of somewhat dif
ferent dimensions) so calibrated to show a scale of intensities; it
 has lost its original shade in consequence of <U+FB01>xing and toning.
 For actual purposes of measurement, a strip is used in its original
 un<U+FB01>xed state.
    6. My earlier observations    on the chemical action of the Sun and
sky, were made in Bengal, with a“ mica actinometer.” In this, small
squares of one sheet of sensitised paper were covered by 1, 2, 3, 4
 . . . . thicknesses    of mica cut from the same plate; the sheet of
paper then exposed to any light for a certain time gave me a series
of chequered shades. To measure the effect of the Sun or of any
portion of the sky, I noted the time necessary to darken the paper
till it matched one of the squares in blackness.       This instrument  I
 have long since laid aside, as    I have superseded it by better; but by
                     I
its aid in 1863 was led to the attempt of measuring the chemical
action of the Sun, in a clear sky, for each degree of the Sun’s altitude,
so as to form a table of constants, which would render a direct
reference to the candle power unnecessary.
    7. I have made an instrument (<U+FB01>g. 1) similar to one employed in
India. The plane on which to expose the sensitised paper has
motions in altitude and azimuth; a perpendicular style is placed at
the corner; and, by shifting the plane until the style casts no shadow,
the plane can be adjusted at right angles to the Sun’s rays, and the
Sun’s altitude can be read by a brass Gunter’s quadrant. A slide
which covers the strip of sensitised paper, is made to move uniformly
up the plane, by means of a string passing over a pulley attached to a
<U+FB02>oat in a column of water in a long cylinder (the one used in India
was a rain-gauge) ; the <U+FB02>oat descends as the water is drawn off by a
stopcock at the bottom of the cylinder.        Lines can be drawn on a
gauge pasted on the plane, beside the longitudinal slit, in which is
exposed the sensitised paper, corresponding to the motion for 1, 2, 3,
. . . . 20 seconds; also a second gauge has been drawn for a larger
tap giving quicker motion. By simply moving the sensitised paper

desired.
   8.By comparing the darkening produced in the paper in para
graphs    and
           5     we easily show that we have to expose the paper four
                     7,
times as long to produce the effect caused by diminishing the distance
one half; and that a light of intensity   acting for    second has the
                                                                   4               1

think might have been assumed; Bunsen and Roscoe, in their paper
(1863) above cited, have, however, taken great pains to prove it.
   9. My early experiments were designed to test the total e<U+FB02>'ect of
the sky and Sun for photographic purposes.           have always experi    I
mented mainly by exposing the paper at right angles to the Sun’s rays.
Roscoe on the other hand, exposes his paper in a horizontal plane.
It will be seen below, that theoretic considerations have led me to
another method of observation, which gives directly the measure of
effect really desired, and does not require a clear heavens down to the
horizon on all sides (the Octant Actinometcr).           give as a <U+FB01>rst        I
example of my experiments the following table            The observation

was taken on 21st December,                     1863, on      the    roof of my house at
Dacca, the sky being perfectly clear.                    The paper was exposed at right
angles to the        Sun, thus giving         the   effect  of the Sun, together with the
total effect (resolved on the plane at right angles to the Sun) of that
portion of the visible sky within 90° of the Sun.

   The constant C of shading used as the standard of comparison
was the     tint produced in the same paper by the candle burning 47
minutes at 1 inch distance.                   Hence, the unit I here employed was
47 X 60 times i the unit in paragraph 4 above.
   In order to get a deeper shade of darkening in the <U+FB01>rst two obser
vations, when the Sun was low, a smaller stopcock was used                      i
                                                                                    than in
the succeeding observations.
   In each of these observations,                 the actual velocity of the slide was
observed by an assistant with a watch.                      As explained in paragraph 7,
this constant can be obtained more easily and exactly by a gauge,
pasted on the plane beside the slit, graduated for the stopcock
used.

  10.   The observations             of Table    (A), and numerous other similar
observations, were taken with great care, the strips being read the
same evening.  The strips taken on separate days, were also compared
with each other; it was thus found that the numerical values for the
chemical action were the same, with different paper, and with diiferent
candles.                         I
          In England, have, within the last two years, made similar
observationsto those at Dacca twenty-<U+FB01>ve years ago, and   submit        I
three of the strips taken; these have been <U+FB01>xed, and have conse
quently changed both in density and in colour, and are submitted
merely for explanation.   The photographic sensitised paper, now pre
pared in  England,   keeps in the dark for months unchanged, and
renders constant reference to the candle standard  unnecessary.    But
by the aid of the table (B) which immediately follows,   could     I
                                                                always
in 1889 and 1890 recover the standard unit, by an observation of the
Sun better than from the candle.
    11. The chemical action of the Sun alone, is got in adark room, by
arranging a vertical slit, so that the Sun’s light falls exactly down the
strip of paper, which I expose at right angles to his rays.            To get the
chemical action of the Sun and sky (i.e., the portion of the visible
sky within 90° of the Sun) together, the exposure is completely in
the open.      The chemical action of the sky (i.e., the resultant action
on the plane at right angles to the Sun of that portion of the visible
sky within 90° of the Sun) is got by an exposure in the open, a
vertical stick having been arranged so that its shadow should just
cover the exposed strip.
    As  I  took each of these three kinds of observations, giving nume
rical results a,       ,8,   respectively,
                             q                was enabled from the simple
                                                I
formula a+¢1     = ,8   to check my   observations,   to test the closeness with
which the strips could be read certainly, and to show again that an
intensity of   4   acting for    second has the same e<U+FB01>ect as the intensity
                                     1
 of1    acting for 4   seconds.
    12.I    found,  as  Roscoe, working in a less pure atmosphere, found
in still greater degree, that observations very close to the horizon
  a
were not to be depended upon.           Also, in the cold weather at Dacca,
at which season alone the sky was sufficiently clear, the Sun did not
attain a greater altitude than about 45°. The <U+FB02>at roof of my house
oifered nearly a complete hemisphere of unclouded blue; neverthe
less, I  know that the full effect of the band of sky near the horizon,
must have been to some extent interfered with by haze; and the
constants in some of the tables that follow will be, in           a small degree,
affected by this cause.

partially completed by using the formula                                                                                       1'   = 0494 (O'99I)‘ where                                                      e
is the distance traversed by the Sun’s rays in the atmosphere for
di<U+FB01>ercnt altitudes.  This formula is parallel to the equation t=Ap‘
used by Pouillet in his memoir on the Solar Heat (and can be found
in ‘Taylor’s Memoirs,‘ vol. 4, p. 49).
   N.B.—In this table, in each observation the sensitised paper was
exposed at right angles to the Sun’s rays: so that a di<U+FB01>erent portion
of the sky was observed at each altitude.

    were obtained by taking the inverse of these times for the chemical
    action.
        l5. The table is only      a <U+FB01>rst approximation;     yet I  have much
   greater    con<U+FB01>dence    in the values, than in those given by any one obser
   vation, the table itself being deduced from a very large number of
   experiments.
       Sir H. Roscoe      believes (Bakerian Lecture, 1865) that he brought
   the errors due to matching shades to within 2 per cent. correct; and
   in graduating strips, the mean error was found by him not to exceed
   1 per cent. of the measured intensity.          I am not satis<U+FB01>ed that my
   separate observations were always so closely accurate in the matching
   of shades.      I employed my daughters independently, to match shades,
   and    compared     them    with my own reading, and found that the
   readings     sometimes  di<U+FB01>ered  more than 2 per cent.
       The photographic paper employed, varied somewhat in tint; that
   exposed to the candle being a little redder than that exposed to the
  Sun and sky; the same intensity in the darkening was sought in
  every case.       I suppose the diiference in tint to have been due to the
  heat of the candle.
      16. The effect of the sky observed, was that due to the e<U+FB01>ect of
  each elemental area of it multiplied by the sine of the angle between
  that elemental area and the normal to the plane of exposure, these
  in<U+FB01>nitesimal effects being summed throughout the visible sky within
  90° of the Sun.
      The chemical action of the sky ('i.e., of the portion of it thus in
 eluded) is seen to be half that of the Sun at 45° altitude; and at
 altitudes of the Sun below 13°, where little more than half the sky is
  included in each observation, to be greater than that of the Sun.
      17. I found the chemical action of the Sun, exactly the same for
 the same altitude, at all seasons of the year and at all hours of the
 day, as far as the experiments went at Dacca, and I <U+FB01>nd in Somerset
 shire the same chemical action of the Sun at the same altitude as at
 Dacca.       I  have not been able to get exactly the same candle that
 I  used at Dacca; and a di<U+FB01>erence in the composition of the stearine
 might possibly cause a small diiference in the results, but believe I
not one of much importance.
     [The observations in Table       J below in the postscript show that the
 difference is absolutely nil.——‘Z7th October. 1890.]
     In the ‘ Phil. Trans,’ 1867, pp. 558-562, Roscoe says that for equal
altitudes of the Sun the chemical intensities are equal; and he “as
sumes
           ”
             that the same “ relation between the Sun’s altitude and chemi
cal intensity holds good at Kew, Heidelberg, and Para.” These results
of Roscoe are con<U+FB01>rmed by my observations; he obtained them only
      “
by       averaging” numerous observations taken at‘KeW, and assuming
that the e<U+FB01>ects of cloud, &c., in the long run were self-destructive.

              Photometric Observations   of the Sun and Sky.           263
Roscoe supposes that a marked difference which he found in intensity
between spring and autumn might be due to a difference in trans
parency.    I  can only explain some of Roscoe’s results by supposing
that the sky was not perfectly clear at the time of the observations.
Indeed, from the description, many of Roscoe’s observations would
appear to have measured the effects of cloudiness rather than of Sun
and sky.     I  have no anomalies in the results of my observation
except such as    I  think I may fairly attribute to cloud or haze.     My
experience in England is that it requires months of watching to
catch a sky that will give results similar to those   I obtained regularly
in Dacca during the cold season.
   In the ‘ Phil. Trans.,’ 1867, p. 559, Roscoe <U+FB01>nds (by the same
method of “ averaging ”) that “ the relation between the Sun’s
altitude and the chemical intensity of total daylight is graphically
represented by a right line.”     And in the ‘ Phil. Trans.,’ 1870, p. 31-5,
Roscoe and Thorpe say that the relation between altitude and total
chemical intensity, for altitudes above 10°, is seen to be accurately
represented by a straight line.
   Table B indicates, and Table G below proves, that the straight line is
only a <U+FB01>rst approximation to the truth.          The calculation from my
Table B of the chemical action of the whole visible sky (and Sun) on
the horizontal plane can be e<U+FB01>ected, as shown further on in the
present paper.
   18.  Various observations had led me to expect that the chemical
action of the sky at the same moment was different in di<U+FB01>erent parts
of it. To investigate this suspicion,   I  designed an instrument which
I call the Miti'atlleuse Actinometer (<U+FB01>g. 2) ;  I place in the President’s
hand photographs of two of these instruments.
   I  mount a number of similar cylindric tubes in one plane in a semi
circle, to the centre of which each tube is directed.       One extremity
of each tube lies on the circumference          of the circle ; the other
extremities lie on a concentric circle of about half the radius. In the
circumference of this smaller circle, is a semicircular series of holes,
against which a semicircular block, carrying the sensitised slip of
paper, is pressed by a screw. Each cylinder in the <U+FB01>rst Dacca mitrail
leuse out out of the sky a circle of 8° 28' angular diameter. One of the
tubes near its top, carries a small plate of wood, on which stands a
style parallel to the tube, by means of which the particular tube can
be brought into a line with the Sun.      By another motion the plane of
all the tubes can be adjusted to the plane of symmetry (or else
where).
   [A vertical plane through the Sun at any time divides the visible
sky into two exactly similar portions.        I will call it the plane of
symmetry].

                P/zotometric      Observations           of the Sun and Sky.                   265
  The readings of the chemical action are taken in terms of the unit
of candle power, and were compared also with a graded Sun-strip,
made at the same    time from the same photographic paper by the
water-motion actinometer, <U+FB01>g. 1.
   The observations given by the barrels at 170° and 10° are too low,
doubtless owing to haze so near the horizon. No observation could be
made with the barrel at 40°, because the Sun could not be kept out of
it. The observation made by the barrel at 20° is (apart from com
parison with computed value) evidently erroneously large.          give               I
the table as an early observation that shows well that there is a point
of minimum sky intensity at 90° from the Sun. It also appears that
if   represent this intensity for the altitude an of the Sun (= 0'12),
     ia.
then the intensity of the sky at a point      from the Sun   0    given              is
(roughly only according to this table) by the formula
                                        7:2     cosec 0.
   This observation was made in the plane of symmetry              turns out:   it
                      7:17.
that the value,       cosec      gives
                                   9,   the  intensity very accurately, in
whatever plane     be measured from the Sun.

I    would note once more that my observations are largely compara
tive, and the results obtained are independent of the unit:               not        it   is
necessary  to reduce  the  readings  in this  table to the one-second  unit.
   20. For any altitude of the Sun (at), the chemical action of the sky
is a minimum at all points of a great circle 90° from the Sun, the
plane of which       the plane of minimum intensity (in).
                    is                                           And at this
moment, the chemical action of the sky at any point distant             from          0
the Sun     given with great accuracy by the formula
           is
                                        Ii...   cosec 0.
   As the whole of the mathematical developments of this paper are
founded     on this law,   have been careful not only to verify
                              I                                      by                   it

to vary the form of the observations in every way      could devise.    I
    21. Thus, the mitrailleuse has been placed in the plane of minimum
intensity: in this case, all the barrels give accurately the same read
ing, except that those barrels 10° from the horizon read rather lower,
as
 I    anticipated they would; there must nearly always be some haze
near the horizon.
   Next, the mitrailleuse was placed at various angles with the plane
of symmetry, by turning        round the line joining one of its tubes
                                  it
with the Sun.        The observed chemical actions agree well with
is-cosec 0.    Next, by means of stops,     made the aperture of each

Further, I calculated the times of exposure, for a (particular)
mitrailleuse which ought, on the law ia cosec 0, to give a uniiorm
tint. I exposed this mitrailleuse for these calculated times, <U+FB01>rst in
the plane of symmetry, afterwards in a plane inclined to it at an
angle of 52°; the results agreed closely with my anticipation, and
                                                                    ‘

    I     have therefore made full use of the expression        11¢cosec  0
 for the chemical action of the light of the sky     in a circle distant  0
from the Sun (whose altitude     isan).
   In carrying out integrations which include the portion of the sky
actually occupied by the Sun, we do not, by employing this formula,
introduce any in<U+FB01>nite expression; for each circular band of the sky
of small breadth 86 distant from the Sun has an area 21r sin d0;

                                          therefore 211- d6: so that the
total chemical action thus attributed to the sky in the area occupied
by the Sun’s disk would be inappreciable.
   23. Bunsen and Roscoe    (‘   Phil. Trans.,’ 1859, p. 891) determined
chemically  the action  of the rays falling from a measured portion of
cloudless sky situated near the zenith, and then compared the visual
luminosity of this same portion of zenith sky with that of the total
heavens.    They say “the amount of light chemically measured,

 which falls from the same surface of zenith sky, multiplied by the
preceding ratio, must give the chemical action which the whole sky
would produce on a horizontal unit of surface.”
   I have below in one or two points only attempted to institute a
numerical comparison between the results of Sir H. Roscoe and my
own; considering the great difference in our methods, I am not
surprised that no good coincidence in the results can be established.

   Referring back, however, to diagram             will be seen that (Q2) 1,    it
differs from (Qs) by the addition      of the gore AYH, the subtraction
of the gore HYX; which will be found to be no di<U+FB02>’e1-ence at all; as
the values of the chemical action of each elementin the subtracted
gore are equal to those for a corresponding element in the added
gore, with the same sign and angles of resolution on the horizontal
plane.    Hence we must have——

arrived at the equation (Y) by laborious transformation of the elliptic
integrals, which are reduced <U+FB01>nally so that two terms, each irre
ducible by integration in algebraic form, destroy each other.
   30. The results thus arrived at by employing the law of the
cosecant are so neat that a suspicion may arise that the law may
have been assumed as one lending itself to mathematic manipu
lations.
 I   may be permitted, therefore, to state, that the law was arrived
at, more than twenty-two years ago, by experiment simply, and the
subject soon after laid aside. The present mathematic investigations
were only recommenced within the last two years, in order to in
stitute a comparison between my old Dacca observations and those
of Sir H. Roscoe.
   3]. In ‘Phil. 'l‘rans.,’ 1870, p. 314, Sir H. Roscoe gives a table
showing the total chemical action of diifuse daylight (i.e., of the
whole sky, the Sun being stopped off) on horizontally exposed paper.
These observations were taken in Portugal, with a perfectly clear
sky, and I therefore select them for comparison with the foregoing
theory and observed values of constants.

    It   is evident that these observations were interfered with greatly
by   haze     or cloud; but it may be well to explain exactly how they
were taken.
    A “ sunstrip ” was shaded <U+FB01>rst by the water-motion actinometer ;
the altitude of the Sun being known, the value of any line in this
sunstrip, in terms of the Dacca candle unit, was known by the aid of
Table B.
    The adjustment and working of the octant actinometer were found
not di<U+FB02>icult.        The readings in the two planes [V] and                                   were
found practically equal; the results are in the third column.                               These
“readings” were obtained directly by comparison with the “sun

the numbers in Column 4 represent
                            Now   [V] = [W]   should be      [U].
   These observations do not give [U] large enough.
   Also, the observations of 12th August would show the value of it.
when a = 20 to be about O'Ol8 or 0019. But the Table D shows the
true value of it when M = 20° to be O'O107 ; that is to say, the read
ings of 12th August, 1890, with the octant actinometer are altogether
too high.   This may easily be so without any fault in the instrument
or error in the observations, and on two reasons.   First, the presence
of any bright cloud may have given the readings [V] and             'too
        (Bunsen and Roscoe, in Phil. Trans,’ 1859, p. 905 :—-“ These
                                ‘

observations prove that the presence of a thin <U+FB01>lm of cloud increases
the  amount of chemical illuminating effect in the most striking
ma-nner.”—The clouds “ act as mighty re<U+FB02>ectors of light.”) Secondly,
a very slight haze over the Sun would give the sunstrip too low, and
thus largely increase the results of columns (3) and (4) read by it.
   I do not consider these observations to decide anything as to the
merits of the octant actinometer, which can only be satisfactorily
tested by the sky of Dacca or some similar subtropical or tropical
station.
     37.   It    is di<U+FB01>icult to determine  which method of resolution of the
sky and Sun gives the most useful measure of the general total e<U+FB01>ect,
whether for determining the time of exposure of a photographic plate                    ,
or for estimating the effect on vegetation.           Sir H. Roscoe has taken
(for  the  sky)    the   resultant action   on  paper exposed horizontally; I
append, therefore, in Table G the chemical action similarly measured,

   This table, as far as 1 = 45°,        isa direct consequence of the Dacca
observations.        The values given from 50° up to 60° are a theoretical
extension, perhaps as near as would be given by interpolation between
known extremes.             Ido not think the numbers for at from 60° to 90°,
which might he arrived at in a similar way, would have any real
value.
     This table, equally with the Dacca Table B, shows how large the
sky effect is in comparison with the Sun effect, especially for altitudes
of the Sun below 30°. This may be the explanation of the reason why
trees close to the north side of greenhouses exercise a prejudicial
in<U+FB02>uence.

   The    present paper contains my Dacca experiments and numbers
arrived   at by calculation therefrom.               I
                                        have been for a year making
similar   experiments          in England whenever
                                                 the sky by its clearness
olfered   any chance of a good observation ; but       have not been ableI
to get    any observation  such  that     should Iattempt to correct the
Dacca     Table B thereby.    I, therefore, am satis<U+FB01>ed to publish the
present paper in its present form, leaving to others its extension                                 by
the help of further observations under a perfectly clear sky.
   38. Postscript, 15th October, l890.—I have within the last few days
made a number of observations with the octant actinometer, and have
also, by making a. few sunstrips at different altitudes, compared the
times for the candle unit with those of the Dacca tables.        These
observations, though giving no numerically valuable results, strongly
con<U+FB01>rm the views           I
                    have expressed in this paper, and I append a
statement of them.
   On the 10th October the sky was seemingly clear; but, the values
obtained for [V] =        being much too high,  did not continue the I
observations.
                                 I
   On the 11th October took a sunstrip at 121‘ 8'“, the Sun’s altitude
being 31° 30' ; comparing this afterwards with a candlestrip, found                        I
the time for the candle unit to be 8'5 seconds.          Referring to the
Dacca table,     I
                found the time for the same altitude, 31° 30', to be
89 seconds.       I
                 therefore used this sunstrip for the observations in
the preceding table.     I infer that, at least at 121] 8"‘, the sky on the
11th October was really clear.     Some of the values in this table are
higher than those obtained by computation for                        in.

     On the 13th October, 1890, I made a series of octant observations ;
 but, as I doubted whether the sky was really clear (t'.e., as the clear
 sky of Dacca in the cold weather),                          I  made a series of sunstrips, as

    In  the <U+FB01>rst four observations,                    the sky was apparently, and doubt
less    really, clear;          in the three latter observations,                        some slight
invisible cloud over the Sun produced great changes in the sunstrips.
    From the exact coincidence in the readings in the four <U+FB01>rst obser
vations, at Dacca and Milverton, I think it follows (1) that there
was no material dilference in my candles at Dacca and Milverton;
(2) that the chemical action of the Sun at the same altitudes was the
same at Dacca and Milvertou.
    It is also clear that the number of really <U+FB01>ne hours of sky in
England (i.e., when it can be compared with the Dacca cold- weather
sky) is very smal1——perhaps not a score in the year.                                    And further
that, in a great many apparently clear skies in England, there is

   The values of [V] = [W], being so much greater than expected,                        I
led me to imagine that, though the sky was apparently clear, the
observations might have been a<U+FB01>ected by the hygrometric state of
the atmosphere.            There had been a fog in the morning, and the                             air
was, though translucent, saturated all the'a.ftern00n.
   The next day, the 14th October, was a similar day (fog in the
                        I
morning), and commenced octant observations much earlier in the
 morning. The results are given in the following table :—

      styles   which form the Wing-Muscles of Insects. Pre
      liminary Note.”         By E. A. SOHKFER, F.R.S.                    Received
      December 15, 1890,—Read             January         8, 1891.
                                 [Purse     4 & 5.]
   The <U+FB01>bres of the wing-muscles of most insects are made up of
readily separable longitudinal elements, which are often called the
“ wing-<U+FB01>brils,” although several observers have remarked the.exist
ence of an apparently <U+FB01>ne <U+FB01>brillation in them.                 To avoid ambiguity,
I shall employ the term “muscle-columns” (Muskel-sdulchen, K61
liker), or its equivalent “ sarcostyles,“ to designate these elements.
They are united together to form the <U+FB01>bres by a not inconsiderable
amount of granular interstitial substance                    (sarcoplasm, Rollett).
This substance has been regarded (Ramon y Cajal) as the true con~
tractile material of the muscles, but it is easy, nevertheless, to
observe the contraction of the sarcostyles, isolated in white of egg,
a fact which has been pointed out by more than one writer on the
subject (Merkel, Kolliker).
   If an insect of which the wing-muscles are of the character
 above described is cut open and placed in alcohol of about 90 p.c.
for twenty-four hours or more, and is afterwards transferred to
glycerine, the sarcostyles of the wing-muscles can be isolated and
examined without difficulty;          they exhibit almost every phase of
extension and retraction (or contraction), and the usual appearance
of alternate dark and light transverse bands, with a <U+FB01>ne line
traversing each light band.            When stained with dyes, such as
haematoxylin,   the  dark   bands    are    found to take the staining most
intensely; the <U+FB01>ne transverse lines are much less stained, and the
clear bands hardly at all.           The various parts of the sarcostyle
evidently differ from one another in their behaviour to staining
reagents, and the‘transverse striation is not to be explained by the
effect of the varicosities of the sarcostyle upon the light transmitted

through it (Haycraft); moreover, many of the sarcostyles show no
such varicosities. A more valuable, because more sharply selective,
method of staining is that recommended by Rollett (‘Wion. Akad.
 Denkschr.,’ vol. 51) for alcohol-glycerine muscles,                 This consists
 simply in the after-application of the gold-formic method to
 the tissue.        In place of treating the fresh muscle with chloride
 of gold and afterwards with formic acid, the alcohol. muscle,
 which has been afterwards steeped in glycerine, is taken.                        If
fresh muscles are thus treated, the sarcoplasm alone is stained, the
 sarcostyles remaining colourless (or they may be-entirely dissolved by
 the action of the formic acid).          In this way, in the leg-muscles, the
 often-described      appearance    of  a   network is. obtained.       But if the
 alcohol-glycerine muscle be taken, the reduction of the metal takes
 place in the sarcostyles, and almost exclusively in their dark bands, so
 that, while the interstitial sarcoplasm and the clear bands of the
 sarcostyles remain clear and colourless, the dark bands of the sarco
 styles are deeply coloured» of a tint varyiug- from an.- intense purple
 red to a faint purple-blue-.,       Rollett recommends the application of
 this method to the study of the structure of the leg-m-uscles, but it is
 still better applicable to. that of the wing-muscles, since it brings out
 in them, with a clearness which renders the- application of the photo
 graphic method comparatively; easy, points of structure which, up to
 the present,     with the usual methods of investigation, have remained
 obscure.
    Before describing the special points which. are thus capable of
 elucidation, it is necessary to adopt names for the several parts of the
 sarcostyle.       For the more or less cylindrical disk which forms the
 dark band I shall retain the name “sarcous element,” without
 thereby intending to imply that it accurately corresponds to the part
 to which that name was originally applied by Bowman; in a general
 sense,   I  believe that it will be found to do so.        The term represents,
on the whole, the Querscheibe of the German, the disgue épais of
 French, authors.        The <U+FB01>ne line which bisects the light band I shall
                                       ”
term “transverse membrane                  (Quermembmn,       Krause; Zw'ischen
 scheibe of German        authors;   disque    mince  of French writers).       The
‘light space separating the ends of the sarcous elements from the
transverse membranes may, for the present, he simply spoken of as
the “clear interval ;” it corresponds with the isotropous substance
of authors.         The segment of a sarcostyle comprised between two
transverse membranes may be termed
                                                 “

    The relative amount of the sarcomere occupied by its several parts
varies with the degree of extension or retraction (? contraction) of
 the tissue.      In the retracted condition (figs.     1  and la.) the saroostyle,

282      Prof. E. A. Schiifer.    On the Zllinute Structure  of the
entirely of the sarcous elements, which are distinctly bulged, and are
arranged closely succeeding one another with but narrow clear
intervals between them. In these very narrow clear intervals the later
ally-stretched and thinned-out transverse membranes cannot be seen
unless the sarcous elements are forcibly dragged somewhat apart in
the process of isolating them; if this is done the transverse mem
branes become visible (<U+FB01>gs. 2 and 20.).          In moderately extended
sarcostyles (<U+FB01>g. 5) the sarcous elements are more separated from one
another, the clear intervals being correspondingly longer and the
transverse membranes distinct. In greatly extended sarcostyles (<U+FB01>gs. 3
and 3a) the sarcous elements are not only lengthened and much
narrowed, but show a tendency to separate in the- middle into two
halves, leaving a space between them.        The clear intervals are also
lengthened, and the transverse membranes are thickened ; the whole
sarcostyle being narrowed.      It may be inferred, from the separation
of the sarcous element, that it is really constituted of two halves, which
in the retracted <U+FB01>bre abut against one another in the middle of the
muscle segment, but in the extended <U+FB01>bre are separated from one
another. Indications of this separation can be made out even in the non
extended sarcous element, as in some of those represented in <U+FB01>g. 8.
Whether or not there is a <U+FB01>ne membrane between the two halves,
as described by Henson, my preparations do not enable me to deter
mine.     Nor have I been able to observe in them the further separa
tion, with still fnrther extension, of separate disks (accessory disks,
Nebenscheiben) from the ends of the sarcous elements, a separation
which has been described and <U+FB01>gured by several good observers.
   In the preceding statements and descriptions there is nothing that
is altogether novel or that has not been described with su<U+FB01>icient
elearness by previous authors.      But the application of photography
leaves no room whatever to doubt the accuracy of those descrip
tions.
    There is, however, one essential point of structure which I have only
 seen clearly in preparations made by this method, and which is also
distinctly shown in the photographs.         Various authors (Wagener,
 Krause, Kolliker, van Gehuchten), as before said, have described a
<U+FB01>brillation of the sarcostyles of the wing-muscles ; or at least a longi
tudinal striation of the sarcous elements, with a dotted appearance of
the transverse membranes.      This striation is very plain in several of
those wing-sarcostyles which are here photographed, and also in all
others which are similarly prepared.        It is even plainer under the
microscope than in the photographs, because the mass of red-stained
substance which forms the sarcous elements allows hardly any actinic
light to reach the photographic plate, and the sarcous elements, when
well stained, look, therefore, nearly uniformly black on the positive.
It is very difficult, however, to trace the longitudinal striations.

      Muscle- Columns which form      the  Wing-Muscles    of Insects.  283
through the clear intervals under the microscope, and I was at <U+FB01>rst
disposed to believe that it was con<U+FB01>ned to the sarcous elements.        But
the <U+FB01>rst photograph which was taken showed faintly, but unmistak
ably, that it extended also through those intervals. This can also be
detected at certain parts of those photographs which are here repro
duced.     The longitudinal striation, therefore, although by far the
most marked in the sarcous elements, extends through the whole
length of the sarcostyle. It might, therefore, be supposed to represent
a <U+FB01>brillation of the sarcostyle, and this is the view which has been
taken by all previous authors who have noticed the appearance.
They have supposed the muscle-column to be constituted of a number
of juxtaposed <U+FB01>brils, each of which is composed of successive alterna
tions of the substance composing the sarcostyle, each one, therefore,
being composed, in the middle of each segment, of a rod-like portion
of the sarcous element; at either end of this, and continuous with it,
 of a portion of the substance of the clear interval ; and, lastly, at the
ends of the segments, of a portion of the transverse membrane.
 The sarcous element is, according to this view, formed by the juxta
position of a number of rod-like elements, which are stained by
 haematoxylin and similar methods (amongst which must be reckoned
 this alcohol-gold method) ; the clear intervals being formed of continua
 tions of these rod-like elements, which are, however, of a different
 chemical nature since they do not take these stains, and exhibit differ
 ent optical properties ; and the transverse membranes of minute, dot
like elements having, again, different chemical and optical properties
 from the other parts.   (The accessory disks, since they are inconstant,
may, in this brief preliminary communication, be left out of account.)
But the optical sections of the sarcostyles (<U+FB01>gs. 6, 7a, 8, and 8a), i.e.,
 more especially of their sarcous elements, which, in teased preparations
of muscles prepared by the alcohol-gold method, are frequently set
free in the preparation, and are seen lying, as often as not, upon
one surface, show conclusively that the above supposition regarding
the <U+FB01>brillar constitution of the sarcostyles is entirely erroneous.
 The sarcous elements are not made up of a bundle of rods, but are
 formed of a continuous substance (sarcous substance), staining with
haamatoxylin and with gold after hardening in alcohol, which sub
 stance is pierced by tubular canals which open at each end of the
 sarcous element, and in its middle abut against one another at the
 plane of Hensen’s line.      The optical section of each sarcous element
 shows   a  dozen  or  more   of such canals, and the contents of these
 canals are, to all appearance, freely continuous with the transpa
 rent, colourless substance of the clear intervals; this can be made
 out in the longitudinal views.        The longitudinal striation of the
 sarcous   element  is due to  this canalisation; that of the clear interval
 to a prolongation of delicate lines (which may, perhaps, represent

 284      Prof. E. A. Schiifer.           On the Minute Structure       of the
 thin septa) of the sarcous substance through the clear interval to the
 transverse membranes.             The whole sarcostyle appears to be itself
 enclosed by     a membrane      of   extreme delicacy.
    If we assume, as is to all appearance the case, that the substance of
 the clear interval is of a <U+FB02>uid or semi-<U+FB02>uid nature, the above view of
 the constitution of the sarcostyle, which is illustrated with unmis
 takable clearness in the photographs, enables one to form a tolerably
 reasonable idea a to the physical change which may occur when the
 sarcostyle passes from the condition of extension to that of retraction,
 and vice verszi.     For if the sarcostyle      be extended, the sarcous elements
 being narrowed and laterally compressed by the extending force, the
<U+FB02>uid which is contained in their canals will become squeezed out, and
will pass into the clear intervals, while, at the same time, the process
of extension will elongate the sarcous elements and separate them
 further from the transverse membranes.                 With further extension, a
separation of the sarcous element in the middle may also occur,
some of the expressed <U+FB02>uid passing into the interval between the two
halves!
    On the other hand, when the extended sarcostyle becomes retracted
 (? contracted), the sarcous elements swell and the clear intervals
become shortened ‘so as eventually almost to disappear.                This can only
be effected by the absorption of the homogeneous substance of the
-clear intervals into the sarcous element, and in all probability it is
imbibed into the canals or visible pores of the sarcous substance.
The process may, in fact, be roughly compared with that which would
occur with a series of pieces of sponge, placed at short intervals, in a
thin-walled elastic tube <U+FB01>lled with <U+FB02>uid. If the tube were extended
the <U+FB02>uid would be squeezed out of the pores of the sponge, and
would go ‘to increase the volume of that in the intervals; on relaxing
the extending force, the <U+FB02>uid would be re-imbibed by the sponge, and
the intervals would be diminished.               This comparison is not intended
as an explanation of the mechanism of muscular contraction, but
merely as an illustration of the physical changes which may reason
ably be supposed to accompany the varying conditions of extension of
the muscle.                                                    _
    The subject of this preliminary communication is treated of more

shortly appear in the International Journal of Anatomy and Physio

although they show the effect of traction in their elongation and narrowing, are not
separated and contracted in the middle, as in the sarcostyle shown in fig. 3, but are
even slightly bulged at the centre.     There appears, howe\ er, a slight tendency for
tl.eir ends to separate as (P accessory  disks).

 considerable length to the views and statements of other recent
 writers on the same subject, and to indicate the bearings of these
 observations upon the wing-muscles on the more intricate subject of
 the structure of the leg-muscles of insects, and of the ordinary skeletal
 muscles of vertebrates,     I have omitted such references and indica
 tions from the present notice.     I may simply state, however, that for
 reasons which are given at length in the article above referred to,      I
 regard the structure of the wing-muscles of insects as furnishing the
 key to the understanding of muscular structure in general, and I
 believe that it is possible to draw a comparison detail for detail
 between the two kinds of muscle which hows a complete correspond

          DESCRIPTION or run PHOTOGRAPHS.        (PLATES   4 AND  5.)
     All the <U+FB01>gures upon these plates are photographs of parts of sarco
 styles of the wing-muscles of the common wasp, which had been
 prepared and stained by the method mentioned on page 281. In
 specimens thus prepared there is a considerable amount of variation
 in the degree to which the sarcostyles, and even the sarcous elements
 of the same sarcostyle, are swollen by the dilute formic acid, into
 which the muscle is placed after having been acted upon by gold
 chloride. This is noticeable in <U+FB01>g. 8, a part of which is further
  magni<U+FB01>ed in 8a, where, in the same sarcostyle, some of the sarcous
 elements are narrow, and others wide.       The latter do not, I believe,
 belong to contracted or retracted portions of the sarcostyle, but are
 merely more swollen by the acid, probably because they happened
 to be less <U+FB01>xed, 1'.e., coagulated by the previous treatment with
 alcohol and gold. It is noticeable also that these more swollen
 sarcous elements are fainter in the photographs; this is due
 to the fact that they are always of a bluish tint; whereas the
 less swollen sarcous elements are deep-red, and hence come out
 nearly black. The former, however, show the longitudinal striation,
'i.e., canalisation, better than the latter.    It must further be stated
that the extension of the sarcostyles shown in <U+FB01>g. 8 has been produced
in teasing the preparation with needles by the demi-desiccation
process ; it is quite di<U+FB01>erent from the extension shown in <U+FB01>gs. 3 and
4, which has been brought about in the living tissue prior to the
advent of the hardening <U+FB02>uid. The sarcostyles represented in <U+FB01>gs.
 l and 3, and the lower part of <U+FB01>g. 4, have been specially selected to
illustrate the characteristic appearances of retraction (? contraction)
and extension, because they were very distinctly red-stained           and
showed neither distortion from being swollen by acid nor dislocation
from mechanical stretching after hardening ; all the other sarcostyles
which are shown in the photograph exhibit such distortion or disloca
tion to a greater or less extent.

    _ HAYORAF1‘.    M.D., D.Sc., F.R.S.E. Communicated by Dr.
      KLEIN, F.R.S. (From the Physiological Laboratory, Univ.
      Edin.) Received January 2,——Read January 8, 1891.
                                  [PLATE  6.]
                                  Historical.
   Curiously enough many of the early microscopists—Schwann for
instance—recognised that the <U+FB01>brils of a muscle are not simply
threads of uniform thickness, like those of connective tissue: they
were able to demonstrate their varicose character, even with the
imperfect lenses at their command.            They concluded-—of course
without any experimental proof—that the cross striping of the
<U+FB01>brils, and, therefore, of the <U+FB01>bres themselves, was an optical expres
sion of such varicosity.
   But Bowman, while believing apparently that the striping was
optical, and comparing the muscle <U+FB01>bril to a beaded rod of glass,
succeeded in breaking up the <U+FB01>brils into little segments.
   According to his view, these “sarcous elements,” as he termed
them, joined end to end by cement, constituted a muscle <U+FB01>bril.         He
further believed that each sarcous element coincided in position with
one of the alternating stripes, the other kind of stripe corresponding
with the position of the cement joining the segments together.
   But no sooner had histologists begun to associate the cross-striping
with structural differences along the <U+FB01>brils, than their varicosity was
almost entirely lost sight of, and every new stripe (and many were
discovered by Dobie, Hensen, and others) was gratuitously assumed
to mark the position of some new structure.
   There was, however, much to excuse what might at <U+FB01>rst sight
appear to have been a great want of critical acumen, for the applica
tion of staining reagents appeared to bring out alternating diiferences
of structure along the <U+FB01>bre. Thus, with logwood or picrocarmine or
eosine, the clear stripe (isotropic bands), the dark stripe (Querscheibe;
disque épais), the band of Hensen (Mittelscheibe; disque méclian),
and Dobie’s line (Que!-wand;      strie mince), all appear to take on the
stain in different degrees, so much so that, in specimens successfully
prepared, some stripes appear deeply stained, others hardly at all.
   Then, again, Brilcke and other investigators demonstrated that the
<U+FB01>brils consist of alternating parts, some of which appear to be doubly,
and others singly, retracting.
   Overwhelmed by what appeared to be such a mass of evidence, the

288                       Dr.  J. B. Haycraft.
histologist of ten or twenty years ago felt bound to assume that the
<U+FB01>bril was a very complicated structure, and he never doubted that a
muscular <U+FB01>bril consists of a series of alternating and recurring struc
tures. It then became his duty to <U+FB01>nd out what these structures really
might be, and what part they play during a muscular contraction.
   The lines of Dobie are often seen as narrow dark bands, wh-ich
were believed to be membranes (Querwand), and it was held that
these membranes separated up the <U+FB01>brils into little boxes (Muskel
kiistchen), so that a <U+FB01>bril consists, according to these authorities, of a
series of little boxes, joined end to end, containing the substances
whose position was marked by the other stripes.          Certain of these
stripes (the dim ones) were considered to mark the position of solid
or relatively more solid substances, and the other stripes (the clear
ones) to consist of <U+FB02>uid or relatively less solid substances.         The
appearance of the stripes, the staining, and their action on polarised
light gave, at any rate, some colour to this hypothesis, for the dim.
stripes appear to have more substance than the clear stripes; they
appear to stain with reagents, and to doubly refract light, which
latter property is certainly seen in some solids.       The light stripes,
on the other hand, appear de<U+FB01>cient in substance and solidity, they
stain less readily, and they simply refract light (a property common
to all liquids, and some solids).
   The Muskelkastchen hypothesis seemed, therefore, feasible enough,
and having under their microscopes little boxes containing more
solid and less solid parts in alternating layers, Krause, Merkel,
Engelmann, and others, sought to explain, each in his own way,
the most obvious phenomenon of contractility, namely, the shorten
ing and thickening of the contractile tissue, as being due to the
interaction of these structures.
   Histologists are accustomed to observe osmotic changes, the swelling
up and the shrinking of red blood-corpuscles, for instance, and to see
the resulting alterations of form. Under these circumstances it was
not unnatural for them to suppose that during contraction the more
solid parts of the Muskelkiistchen imbibed fluid from the less solid
parts, in such a way as to alter the shape of the muscle box, making
it shorter and thicker, and causing, in consequence, the whole <U+FB01>bre
to change in the same way.
   In apparent support of this‘ theory, the stripes in the muscle
boxes change their relative thickness, and alter in appearance, in the
manner so carefully described by these observers.         There seems, in
fact, only one objection to this osmotic theory which would at once
present itself to the eye of the critical observer; it is the time taken
by the process, for osmotic changes are slow in their very nature, and
the muscles of an insect’s wing can contract over a hundred times a
second.

             On the Minute Structure    of Striped Jlfuscle,   ($0.      289
               Personal  Observations Lefore the Year 1880.
   More than ten years ago it was my duty, as a young teacher, to
make myself familiar with the current literature bearing upon the
structure and function of muscular tissue.       Even then the number of
publications was very great, and I can now recall the despair with
which   I tried to get a grasp of a subject about which no two observers
could be found to agree.         While endeavouring to verify some of
the statements I had read,     I found out for myself that the <U+FB01>brils are
in reality varicose threads of tissue, presenting alternate swellings and
constrictions of their substance.     At once the conviction forced itself
upon my    mind   that the striping might after all _be an optical expres
sion of the form of the <U+FB01>brils, and have nothing whatever to do with
their internal structure; and it was not until my results were in
manuscript form, and ready for publication, that I got access to the
older and almost forgotten literature in which          I   found the same
views freely expressed, although without any attempt at their proof.
   When    I had made certain that, both in the fresh and in the prepared
muscle, the <U+FB01>brils are invariably varicose, then I felt that the position
of the subject was as follows. Such <U+FB01>brils are bound to be cross
striped like all other objects of similar shape, viewed by transmitted
light. It may be that the cross-striping observed is due to the vari
cosity alone, or to the varicosity and to ('0-existing structural differ
ences as well; and, under these circumstances, before we are in a.
position to take any further step in an investigation into the nature
of the muscular <U+FB01>bre, it is imperative to eliminate the appearances
due alone to varicosity.                                                     I
   My <U+FB01>rst endeavour was to ascertain whether there are any stripes
that do not correspond in their position with inequalities in the thick
ness of the muscular <U+FB01>brils.
   Of course in many cases it is di<U+FB01>icult, especially if the <U+FB01>brils or
<U+FB01>bres are somewhat distorted, to make out the border clearly; but in
good specimens, in a suitable position for study,         I  found that the
striping,  both  in the  contracted  and  uncontracted    <U+FB01>bre,  corresponds
invariably to either thickenings or constrictions of the <U+FB01>brillar sub
stance, and in this investigation the muscular tissue of many repre
sentative species, both Vertebrates and Invertebrates, was examined.
The broad dim stripe occupies the position of a thick bulging part of
the <U+FB01>bre, and Hensen’s stripe, when present, corresponds to the posi
tion of a shallow depression in its centre.     The clear stripe lies in the
constrictions of the <U+FB01>bril and Dobie's line corresponds with a tiny
 swelling in its centre.
   In addition, the stripes can be reversed by altering the focus, just
as is the case with a little varicose glass thread, the scale of a Lepisma,
or the shadow in the centre of a red blood-corpuscle; indeed Bowman

Part of  a muscular <U+FB01>bril is represented in this <U+FB01>gure, and it will be noticed that

actually described the striping in the reverse focus to that generally
                    “ clear ” what we                           “
adopted, calling                           speak of as the        dim’? band.
   A very simple method of determining exactly what part varicosity
plays in the production of the cross-striping then suggested itself
to my mind; it was to immerse the <U+FB01>brils in a <U+FB02>uid having the
same refractive index.          Under these circumstances it is obvious
that these stripes, which are due to varicosity alone, will disappear,
but the striping will become even more marked if there are alter
nating structures along the <U+FB01>bre possessed of di<U+FB01>erent refractive
indices.    At Professor P. G. Tait’s suggestion,            I  placed the <U+FB01>bres in
a mixture of alcohol and oil of cassia, varying the proportions until               I
approximated      to the refractive index of the <U+FB01>brils.                The striping
never entirely disappeared, but          it   grew fainter and fainter, and         I
am inclined to explain the partial failure of this experiment on the
grounds that, unlike a glass rod, the muscle <U+FB01>bres imbibed the
medium in which they were embedded.                     As a result of this slow
imbibition, the refractive index of the <U+FB01>bres would be constantly
altering, and it would be a matter of the greatest di<U+FB02>iculty to_ make
it exactly the same as that of the surrounding medium. In addition
to this, coagulation would be almost certain to take place within the
<U+FB01>brils, destroying their optical uniformity.
                                            I
   While looking upon the results had obtained as valuable but not
conclusive evidence,      I  sought to solve the problem in another way.
I  took the living muscle of a Crab or Fly, and, while examining
it under the microscope,          I   pressed down the cover-glass with a

            On the Zllinute Structure    of Striped Muscle,  <§'c.       291'
needle.    Under these circumstances, those <U+FB01>bres which were pressed
upon lost their cross-stripes, and looked extremely like connective
tissue.   Of course it might be urged that the <U+FB01>bres were by this
pressure entirely disorganised, and no conclusions can legitimately be
drawn from the experiment, but to this it can be replied that if there
really are little bands of tissue so clearly distinguishable from each
other, as those who hold the Muskelkcistchen hypothesis believe, these
or their traces should be found scattered about throughout the pre
paration. In point of fact, as you press upon the cover-glass the
stripings gradually disappear with increased pressure, and in the ill
de<U+FB01>ned <U+FB01>brillated structure that remains there are no traces of the
broken llfuskelkzistchen. And <U+FB01>nally, if more proof is wanted, it is
possible by means of a screw, which raises or lowers the cover-glass,
<U+FB01>rst to press upon the <U+FB01>bres and cause the striping to disappear, and
then on raising the cover-glass to cause them to reappear once more.
We can only explain this result on the assumption that the varicose
<U+FB01>brils are <U+FB02>attened out, and that the striping caused by their vari
cosity disappears in consequence.
   There were, however, three important facts which had to be
thoroughly accounted for, before it could be affirmed that the <U+FB01>brils
do not consist of the alternating structures supposed to exist ; these
facts were the effect of cleavage, of staining and the action of
polarised light.    The muscle <U+FB01>brils can be broken across into the
sarcous elements described by Bowman; but a careful study of the
question soon convinced me that the cleavage is always across the
thinnest parts of the fibrils, taking place in the substance of the clear
stripe. If Dobie’s line is at all marked, the cleavage takes place near
the little swelling which corresponds to it, and through the substance
of the clear stripe.    Reference to <U+FB01>g. 1 will at once show that here
we have to deal with the thinnest part of the <U+FB01>brils, and it is there
fore begging the question to assume anything over and above this
mechanical reason for the cleavage, for every varicose rod will break
across at its thinnest part.     The phenomenon of transverse cleavage
cannot therefore be taken in itself as an argument in favour of
structural di<U+FB02>*'erences along the <U+FB01>brils.               .
   The appearances seen in stained preparations can also,          I pointed
out, be satisfactorily explained on the varicosity hypothesis.           \Ve
<U+FB01>nd that whatever else is employed, and at whatever focus you adopt
in your examination, those stripes which in the unstained preparations
appear dim also appear to take on the stain, while those stripes which
appear clear and bright are unaffected by it. In fact, the difference
in colour is entirely a question of “ saturation,” for whenever there is
a <U+FB02>ood of light, as in a clear stripe, the colour of the <U+FB01>bre at that part
becomes unsaturated by it.       It is easy to convince oneself practically
of this fact by the examination of varicose threads of faintly coloured

 glass in a ray of parallel light.         Rods of faintly tinted glass of the
 same shape as the muscle <U+FB01>bres, having tiny globules—Dobie’s lines—
 and broader swellings for the dim stripes, when examined under the
 microscope, orin the <U+FB01>eld of a lantern, give as strong colour di<U+FB01>erentia
 tions    as any muscle <U+FB01>bres, the constrictions coming out quite colour
 less, while the dim band and D0bie’s line are sharply brought out by
 their deepened colour.*
     One of the chief faults of which            I was guilty when publishing
 these results in 1880 was that I did not su<U+FB01>iciently lay stress on the
 appearances presented by a coloured or_colourless varicose thread of
 glass when placed in the path of a parallel ray of light.                It is quite
 different from the same thread when examined in di<U+FB01>use daylight,
 for in the latter case a hundred images fall upon the retina at the
 same time, and the striping and colour dillferentiations             are confused.
 One can see little appearance of striping, and if the glass is coloured
 it may appear very much of the same_ tint; place it in a lantern, or
 even lay it down on a piece of white paper, and the picture is quite
 different. As one is accustomed to view objects in di<U+FB01>use daylight,
 one is not prepared to interpret correctly the character of such an
 object when viewed through a microscope : the clear well-de<U+FB01>ned
 bands and colour di<U+FB01>erentiations of a muscle <U+FB01>bril are not the ap
 pearances of a varicose thread as seen in di<U+FB01>use daylight, but they
 are those of a similar <U+FB01>bre observed in parallel light when practically
 a single image falls upon the retina.
     Lastly, we come to the action of polarised light, and here at once
 the phenomena by no means prove structural differentiation. along
 the <U+FB01>bre. There are many questions which lead to complication. We
 have the varicosity of the <U+FB01>bril, which will alter the path of the
 polarised beam and produce apparent differences along the <U+FB01>bre when
 there may he in reality none at all. Then we have as a complication
 the inter<U+FB01>brillar substance, which is simply ref:-acting, and which is
 chiefly lodged in the neighbourhood of the clear stripe. I was not
 prepared to say, under these circumstances, what is the action of
 polarised light on the <U+FB01>brils, nor do I wish to commit myself now: it
 is su<U+FB02>icient to say that, even if we grant that alternating singly iso
 tropous and doubly ref:-acting anisotropic bands exist along a <U+FB01>bril,
 it does not follow that these are bands of more solid and less solid
 material: the whole difference may be due to molecular tension.                     A
 <U+FB01>bre of such a shape, as was pointed out to me both by Professor
  Stokes and by Professor P. G. Tait, is almost bound to possess altern
 ating parts in different conditions of molecular tension, and give the
 familiar appearances when examined by polarised light.
    “‘ In doing this experiment, only faintly tinted glass must be used, and, as this is

Society of London by my kind friend Professor E. Klein, and was
printed in the ‘Proceedings
                               '
                                 of 1880, and in the ‘ Quarterly Journal
of Microscopical Science,’ 1881, and in this paper               I
                                                            ventured to
assert that  I had been able to explain the appearances generally
considered to indicate structural differences       in the course of the
<U+FB01>brils as being due to the varicosity of the <U+FB01>brils themselves.                     I
further stated that of course structural differences might exist, but
that the proof of their existence was not as yet forthcoming.
   My views were received in many quarters with kind consideration,
but they were only very partially accepted.        For my own part, as
soon as I had published them          Iresolved not to think about the
subject again for some  years,   when, with  more matured experience,               I
might return to its consideration and picking up the threads that                   I
had dropped unravel them with a more skilful hand.
          Recent Irwestigatwns    with    the Collodirm Impressions.
    Last winter (1889—90) an idea occurred to me which led once more
to my examination of the subject.        It struck me that if could        I
“          ”
   stamp      some soft transparent solid with muscle <U+FB01>bres it might be
possible    to obtain impressions of the <U+FB01>bres on the soft material. If
these impressions had smooth unstriped depressions corresponding to
the <U+FB01>bres, this would indicate that the striping was caused by struc
tural diiferences within the <U+FB01>brils;       if,
                                          however, the impressions were
striated, this could only be explained on the ground that the striation
of the “ stamp ”—the muscle—was caused by the form of the <U+FB01>brils,
which form and which striation were transferred to the soft material
in the process of stamping.                    -
    It seemed improbable that should succeed in getting faithful im
                                I
pressions of such microscopic objects, yet       felt that
                                                 I            would be well
                                                               it
worth while making the attempt, for the results        ifobtained would be
most conclusive.       I experimented with every substance that        could
                                                                           I
think of, using wax of various kinds, glass, gelatins, glycerin jelly,
transparent soaps, &c. Once or twice thought that
                                            I                  Ihad obtained
very partial success, but my difficulties         were    great, for when
ever
   I      hit upon     substance like gelatin, for instance, which would
                       a
set in intimate contact with the <U+FB01>brils,      invariably came away with
                                                 it
them when they were removed.        I worked at the subject for months,
trying every expedient which suggested itself to me, and in July,
1890, I   at last succeeded beyond my most sanguine anticipations.
    It occurred to me that perhaps collodion might be of service, for a
thin layer dries quickly and forms a beautifully smooth transparent
<U+FB01>lm.  I     accordingly prepared a <U+FB01>lm by allowing        adrop of collodion
 to fall upon a slide, and tilting the slide so that      it<U+FB02>owed over     in  it

294                                 Dr.  J. B. Haycraft.
a  layer of uniform thickness. When still somewhat moist                     I  pressed
against the <U+FB01>lm some roughly teased muscle <U+FB01>bres held on my <U+FB01>nger
tip. They came away quite readily when the <U+FB01>nger was removed,
                              ”
leaving little “ ruts in the collodion obvious to the unaided eye. On
 examining these ruts with the microscope                    I found what     I  at <U+FB01>rst
 thought were actual muscular <U+FB01>bres still adhering to the collodion
 <U+FB01>lm, showing the <U+FB01>brils and every detail of the cross striping with
 remarkable clearness.              The ruts contained, however, no trace of
muscular         tissue   when    examined     by the naked eye, for the slightest
trace of muscle is at once recognised by its opacity.               On looking at the
 specimen       a  few  minutes    afterwards,    what   was  my surprise to <U+FB01>nd that
 all the appearances          I had just seen had completely vanished, the ruts
 had disappeared,          and  the  collodion <U+FB01>lm was <U+FB01>at and smooth.
    The explanation was very soon found, and no doubt remained
                  I
 that what had at <U+FB01>rst actually mistaken for muscular <U+FB01>bres were in
reality their “impressions,” their subsequent disappearance being
 due to the contraction of the <U+FB01>lm, as it dried, pulling out every in
                                                                     '
equality in its surface.
    It is very instructive to watch one of these collodion impressions ;
 at <U+FB01>rst clearly cut, with every stripe sharply de<U+FB01>ned, they gradually
 fade, and perhaps in <U+FB01>ve or ten minutes they disappear entirely.
 Sometimes a portion of a <U+FB01>bre really remains sticking to the col
 lodion; it is at once recognised by its great opacity. What astonished
 me almost as much as the perfect reproduction in the impression of
 every cross stripe was the ease with which these impressions can be
 made.       One can hardly fail to obtain them, and at the International
 Congress in Berlin, while demonstrating                 the subject to the members
 of the Physiological and Anatomical Sections,                  I made over one hun
 dred preparations—few of which were failures. Not only can one
 stamp with hardened muscle, but the fresh tissue can itself be used.
 Of course the fresh tissue is soft and does not make so good a stamp,
 the results are not so striking, but they are quite evident. In making
impressions of a fresh muscle one can take a piece of muscle, say
from a Rabbit, cut it through in the direction of the <U+FB01>bres, and press
the cut edge for a second or so against the collodion <U+FB01>lm, which must
be very soft : one rarely examines the <U+FB01>lm without getting some trace
of an impression upon it.*
    If the impressions are examined with a high power, say 600 diameters,
the following details can be made out.                    Each <U+FB01>bril, if a hardened
   *   One can get impressions of other tissues, bone, tooth, hair, &c. A section of
      bcne comes out very well, and one can see in the impression the
                                                                           “ set” of the
dry
lamellae,   the lacunm and their canaliculae, and every detail with marvellous clear
ness.    If  a still moist <U+FB01>lm be pressed against the back of the hand, and then ‘ex
amined,     one  sees the impressions of the imbricated scales covering the hairs on the
 back   of the  hand   iar clearer than in the original.

       preparation be used for stamping, makes its own individual impres
       sion in the collodion, which rises between the <U+FB01>brils in the place of
       the inter<U+FB01>brillar substance, which has, of course, been removed in the
       ordinary preparation of the tissue.    When the muscle is pulled away
       the impressions of the individual <U+FB01>bres can readily be made out, and
       the borders of the little varicose hollows are plainly to be seen; the
      cross-striping, which can here only be due to the form of the impres
       sion, is exactly the same as that of the muscle itself.     To put it in
      another way, we have varicose threads of air, within surrounding
      collodion in the place of varicosethreads of muscle surrounded by
      balsam or Farrant, and varicosity, the only common factor in the two
     cases, is alone the cause of the striping observed in each.      Not only
      are the broad stripes well marked, but one can see with even greater
     ease than in the muscle itself the lines of Dobie and of Hensen.
      In the fresh muscle I have only once or twice seen the outlines of the
     <U+FB01>brils with any degree of distinctness, but the stripings are more
     readily seen; yet one would hardly expect to get such good results
     from fresh muscle, both on account of its softness and from the fact
     that the <U+FB01>brils are covered by sarcolemma.      If the collodion be tinted,
     say   with  magenta   or  Bismarck-brown,   impressions can be made in
     this coloured medium, and these show in beautiful detail the apparent
     stain diiferentiations observed in muscle.        The broad dim stripe
     comes out red and appears like a solid, well-de<U+FB01>ned band, and the
     clear stripe in successful preparations appears by contrast devoid of
     colour.
         It will be seen from the above experiments that, as the stripings
     are all optical effects of varicosity, the very foundations of the
     Muskelkiistchen hypothesis. are removed, and we now come to the
     consideration of the phenomena of contraction.

     <U+FB01>bre.     Photograph    was very kindly taken for me by my friend Dr.

  similar condition, and it will be noticed that the appearance is
  essentially the same, except that the stripes are reversed, the little
  dots forming Dobie’s line and the dim bands coming out bright, and
  the clear stripe appearing dark; the slightest alteration of the focus
  would have reversed the photograph and have given the ordinary
 appearance.
     A contracted   <U+FB01>bre has quite another appearance, for not only are
  the cross-stripings much nearer together, but they have changed in
  character.    Without going into detail, at present, it is su<U+FB02>icient to
  say that alternately dark and light stripes are seen. and that the
 Dobie’s line, so constant a feature in the extended <U+FB01>bre, is no
 longer to be seen in the contracted condition; the stripes, moreover,
 have altered in thickness relatively to one another.              Now it is need
 less to again point out that the change in the striping has hitherto
 been held to indicate changes within the <U+FB01>brils of the nature of
 osmosis, the stripes being taken to represent actual structures.               But
 if an impression be taken of a muscle killed in contraction it shows
 every detail of a muscle in that condition, as photograph III, taken
 from a collodion impression, very well indicates.            (In this photograph
 the clear stripes come out clear, and the dark stripes dark, just as in
 the original muscle, but of course the appearance could be reversed
by altering the focussing.)
     It follows that when a. muscle passes into a condition of contraction
the changed appearance is entirely due to a change in its form, and
 I  have frequently stamped muscles which show in the same <U+FB01>bre both
 the contracted and uncontracted state with the intermediate stages.
 These intermediate changes come out perfectly in the “impressions,”
 so that one can positively affirm that the striping is due to form, and
 every change in striping observed during contraction depends upon
 some change of form too.              Of course the imbibition theories of
 Krause, Merkel, and Engelmann are no longer tenable, since the facts
 on which their theories were founded have received another explana
 tion. The Muskelkiistchen was evolved on the supposition that the
 cross stripes correspond to membranes and layers of tissue along the
 <U+FB01>bres, whereas the impressions prove that they are due to variations
 in the thickness of the <U+FB01>brils in di<U+FB01>erent parts of their course. The
 imbibition theories were evolved on the supposition that the changes
 in the striping observed during contraction are due to alterations in
 from ten to <U+FB01>fteen minutes is required, our <U+FB01>rst attempts were not as successful as
might have been desired, and those exhibited in Berlin were decidedly faint and
wanting in density. Dr. Edington subsequently, adopting a suggestion of Mr.
Forgan, used magnesium light in the place of the ordinary oil lamp, burning about
one foot of the thin riband in the optical axis of the apparatus.     This exposure,
lasting only a few seconds, gave us very beautiful negatives,  from which the photo
gr-wure plate was taken.

   the relative quantities of <U+FB02>uid held by the substances producing the
   striping.    Inasmuch, however, as the changes in the striping are
   due to changes in form of the <U+FB01>brils, the very foundation of these
  theories has been removed.
           The Author’s     Views as to the Structure of Striped Mrrscle.
      Before proceeding further       I would venture to state what          I think
   we are in a position to a<U+FB02>irm respecting ,the structure of striped
  muscle.      The <U+FB01>bres consist of <U+FB01>brils generally grouped together in
  bundles and separated from each other by inter<U+FB01>brillar matter.                  As
  the <U+FB01>brils are varicose, and have a different refractive index from the
  inter<U+FB01>brillar matter in which they lie, they, in consequence, present
  the optical striping possessed by all such bodies under similar circum
  stances, and we have no reason to suppose that this striping has any
  other interpretation.        The <U+FB01>brils, from whatever point we look upon
  them, are composite structures, and their varicosity indicates this
  quite clearly. Each <U+FB01>bril has practically undergone segmentation
  into a series of tiny particles, although there is no evidence that these
  are separated from one another by membranes, or any other anatomical
  structures, and each little bit contracts on its own account so as to
  thicken and shorten.         Although we know absolutely nothing as to
  what there is within each <U+FB01>bril, yet the condition of parts, whatever
  it may be, is probably the same in every Dobie’s line, or in every dim
  or light stripe. Each light stripe may merely consist of contractile
  tissue in a different state of tension from that in the position of the
  dim stripes, and if so, that may partly interpret the polariscopic
  phenomena, but beyond the fact that a difference exists we are not
 in a position to make a further a<U+FB01>irmation. When we study the
 change in form which these little segments undergo in passing from
 the relaxed into the contracted condition we come upon several
 curious facts, the interpretation of which is at present very dii<U+FB01>cult.
 Some muscles, and especially those of some of the lower Vertebrates
 appear to be very simple in form, and to undergo very simple changes
 during contraction.         I  hope to enter into greater detail in a subse
 quent paper,     but  in   the  meanwhile    I  would simply state that the
.<U+FB01>brils seem to be devoid of the tiny swellings which form the line of
 Dobie. The <U+FB01>brils, therefore, possess simply alternate swellings (dim
 stripes) and constrictions (clear stripes). During contraction, the
 swellings become more marked as the <U+FB01>brils shorten, the change
 being represented in <U+FB01>g. 2.
     In this case the dark stripes of the contracted <U+FB01>bre are at just the
 same parts of the <U+FB01>bril as in the relaxed condition.                      In other
 muscles     in  most  of   the  Arthropoda,    for  instance,    the  stripes   are
 reversed, as already so well described by the German histologists.
                                                                          x 2

                                                                        ‘

FIG. 2 (R) represents a relaxed <U+FB01>bril with a pin, A, sticking into the dark stripe.
   During its contraction (C), as the <U+FB01>bril simply shortens and thickens without
   otherwise changing its shape, the needle A is still seen sticking in the dark
   stripe.
FIG. 3 (R) represents a relaxed <U+FB01>bril with a pin, A, sticking into the dark stripe,
   and another pin, B, sticking into the swelling in the position of Dobie’s line.
   When contracting (C), the <U+FB01>bril is profoundly modi<U+FB01>ed in shape, the pin A
   sticking into the clear stripe, and the pin B into the centre of the dark stripe.
The    reason    is  that, during contraction, the <U+FB01>brils change their
shape in such a manner that the parts which previously bulged now
become the thinnest part (<U+FB01>g. 3).             As the <U+FB01>brils begin to contract
the substance of the clear stripe becomes an eminence instead
of a depression, and the little bulging part forming Dobie’s.1ines
becomes smoothed out and gradually obliterated.                  The dark stripe,
on the other hand, becomes the constriction in the case of the
contracted <U+FB01>bre; and, of course, appears now as a clear band.                 These
points    can   only clearly     be  made    out   by studying      all   the inter
mediate conditions between complete contraction and relaxation, and
they are best seen in the living muscle <U+FB01>bres on which waves of
contraction are still slowly passing; one may see them, too, upon the
muscle impressions.         I  have never happened to make an impression
of a <U+FB01>bre showing a series of these intermediate stages in a short
piece of a <U+FB01>bre while engaged with Dr. Edington in photographing
them, but <U+FB01>g. 4 shows very well the appearance; it is a careful
drawing of a Crab’s muscle in a state of contraction, but bent at an
angle so that the convex side_is arti<U+FB01>cially extended.                 The Dobie’s
lines on the extended side are seen gradually to thin away, and
gradually disappear on the contracted side, while the surrounding
bands which appear as clear depressions gradually become dim
elevations.
   Of course, this change of form leads to the shortening of the <U+FB01>brils,
but it is at present di<U+FB01>icult to say why this reversal of the varicosity
should occur; at present, we have to accept            it as an  unexplained fact.

A  drawing of a living and contracted Crab's muscle, which has been bent round
    and arti<U+FB01>cially extended on its convex lower border.   The transitions between
    the relaxed and contracted parts are well seen. Dobie’s lines (D) gradually
    fade away as you pass to the contracted condition, becoming invested by and
    then replaced by the dark stripe of the contracted condition.  The dark stripe
    of the relaxed part (B) fades away, and is replaced by the light stripe in the
    contracted part.
Many of the German histologists have described             a   condition observ
able before the muscle has completely contracted (Ueberga/ngsstadium),
imwhich all striping has disappeared, and this Merkel and Engelmann
each explains on his own imbibition theory.                Now, one can dog
matically a<U+FB02>irm that in the greater number of <U+FB01>bres of which the tissue
is in one part contracted and another part relaxed, and in which the
intermediate stages are plainly visible, as in <U+FB01>g. 4, for instance, not
a trace   of such a condition is visible; it is therefore not an essen
tially intermediate phase.           I have had the privilege of seeing
Professor Engelmann’s preparations, and here it is seen, and in my
own    I  occasionally come across it; but what I have invariably
observed is this, that it is never seen in a fresh preparation free and
unattached to cover-glass or slide.         It frequently happens that <U+FB01>bres
become pressed and otherwise <U+FB01>xed, and then it appears that when
they shorten, the contracted part pulls upon the still extended
portion, and diminishes by so doing the varicosity of the <U+FB01>brils, and,
in consequence, the striping which depends upon it. The effect is
exactly the same as that produced by <U+FB02>attening out the <U+FB01>bres by
pressing on the cover-glass; in one case the varicosity is diminished
or obliterated by a pull in the length of the <U+FB01>bril, in the other case
by pressure applied to its sides. One may, at any rate, state that in
the vast majority of cases, as the varicosity becomes reversed, the
<U+FB01>brils never become uniform threads of tissue, for, as the dim stripe
is <U+FB02>attening out, eventually to form a depression, the clear stripe,
with Dobie’s line still visible in its centre, is becoming a ridge.

                        The Intew<U+FB01>brillrir Substance.
   The inter<U+FB01>brillar substance is not usually held to have the property
of contractility, and it appears to me that the arguments based on
its fancied homology to a cell network recently brought forward, espe
cially in England, can hardly be said to prove the contrary ; I hope to
refer to this subject in a subsequent paper, to be devoted to the com
parative histology of muscle.      From the varicose character of the
<U+FB01>brils, it follows that the inter<U+FB01>brillar substance is of the nature of a
matrix or bed of tissue perforated by varicose tubes. It is like a
honeycomb minus its transverse partitions, or, better still, like a
mitrailleuse; we have, however, to imagine the walls of the honey
comb of variable thickness, sometimes thicker and sometimes thinner,
and the analogy is complete.      In optical section, as when we focus
a piece of muscle, this inter<U+FB01>brillar     honeycomb will appear as in
              I
photograph or <U+FB01>g.      5.

    <U+FB01>bres are represented, A and B. The inter<U+FB01>brillar substance        is  strongly
  represented by the varicose lines; the outlines of the <U+FB01>brils are faintly repre
  sented at the borders of the <U+FB01>gures.      In A the <U+FB01>brils possess well-marked
  Dobie’s lines; the swellings of the <U+FB01>brils causing them are seen, D. In con
  sequence, the cement matter forming single masses in B      is in A divided into
  two sets (heads of Schiifer’s muscle
                                        rods).   In B Dobie’s  lines are not seen.
  In diagram the cross-stripingl of the <U+FB01>brils has been omitted for the sake of
  simplicity.
  Here the <U+FB01>brils are left blank, and the inter<U+FB01>brillar substance is
represented by dark varicose lines, the optical sections of the longi
tudinal walls of the honeycomb.      The walls are thick opposite the
position of the constrictions of the <U+FB01>brils which lie within the honey
comb, and thin wherezthe bulgings come.      When a Dobie’s bulge               is
present as at A, the bulgings, corresponding to the clear stripe, are
divided into two (Schafer’s muscle rods); but when Dobie’s line
not well marked, we have the appearance seen at B. Of course,                   it is
will be understood that where these thickenings of the honeycomb

                On the lllinute Structure   of Striped Muscle,    <§-0.        301
  occur the <U+FB01>bres are encircled by a thicker band of inter<U+FB01>brillar sub
  stance, that the little beads or swellings in the diagrams are merely
  optical sections of the thicker parts of the honeycomb.                    These
  thickened portions, when very strongly differentiated from the            <U+FB01>brils,
  as by the gold method, may appear like transverse                bars running.
  across the <U+FB01>brils in the region of‘       the  clear stripe, and the whole
  structure has unfortunately been misinterpreted by some observers
  into a network, the transverse links of which are the encircling and
  thickened parts of the honeycomb, while the longitudinal threads are
  the lines really marking the optical section of the honeycomb tubes.
  If   any threads of tissue are to be actually seen,       I  quite agree with
   Professor   Klein  in ascribing   them to  precipitation   within    the inter
  <U+FB01>brillar honeycomb.
                 The Physiological Explanation of the Varicosity.
      I may   not unreasonably be asked to supply some hypothesis of my
  own in place of the exploded theories of imbibition, for, if we simply
   view a muscle <U+FB01>bre as consisting of varicose <U+FB01>brils, we have a bare
   morphological fact without any physiological signi<U+FB01>cance.                Before
                I
  doing this, will venture to clear up one misunderstanding which has
  arisen concerning the morphological difference between striped and
,  unstriped muscular tissue, although this question will, I hope, be
   more   fully discussed in   a subsequent  paper.
       The unstriated muscle is generally described as a nucleated spindle,
   presenting <U+FB01>ne longitudinal <U+FB01>brillation, and devoid of a true sar
   colemma, while the striped or voluntary <U+FB01>bre is described as a
   <U+FB01>brillated thread of contractile tissue, invested by a sarcolemma
   underneath which numerous nuclei are placed.           The heart muscle is
   generally looked upon as a tissue intermediate between the two.
   But authors to whom we owe these ideas, have restricted their
   enquiries to the Vertebrate histology alone. It is necessary to pass
   into the region of comparative histology, before we can thoroughly
   comprehend the subject.         If we do this, we shall <U+FB01>nd that there are
   two chief varieties of fully dilferentiated muscular tissue.            First of
   all, there is the nucleated spindle devoid of sarcolemma and made up
   -of <U+FB01>brils cemented together, and we notice that these spindles may be
   striped or unstriped, the di<U+FB01>rrence depending upon the rapidity of their
   contraction.    They are found in most divisions of the animal kingdom ;
    thus, in the adductor muscles of Gav-diam, Pecten, Lima, rapidly
    moving Lamellibranchs, we have nucleated and striped spindles;
    these occur in the heart muscle of the Frog and many other animals,
    while non-striped spindles are found in parts of the circulating and
    digestive systems where less active movements are required.
       Then again, there is another type of muscular tissue, consisting of

302                        Dr.   J.   B. Haycraft.
 cylindrical threads, sometimes invested by a sarcolemma, and with
nuclei within the <U+FB01>brils, under the sarcolemma or in both ofthese
situations, and we notice that these threads of tissue are striped or un
striped according to the rapidity of their contraction.   In Vertebrate
skeletal muscle, they contract quickly and are striped, and the same
applies to the adductor of the Tm-ebratula, which closes its shell so
quickly as sometimes to nip its protruding siphon.       In many of the
Polychaataa, in  many   Lamellibranchs,  as in Mytilus,   and in slowly
moving Ascidia, the <U+FB01>bres are devoid of striation. We see_ then that
the striping of muscular tissue cannot be said in any way to associate
                                   ”
itself with any particular “ build of cell; it may be present in both
a spindle and in a cylindrical thread.      When a muscular <U+FB01>bre, it
may be spindle-shaped or cylindrical in shape, is called upon' in the
process of evolution to contract very quickly, then it becomes striped,
the cause of which is the segmentation of the previously cylindrical
<U+FB01>brils into varicose threads.    The Swallow in its rapid <U+FB02>ight has
quickly to see, and catch the passing <U+FB02>y, and the <U+FB01>brils of its ciliary
muscle, simple threads of uniform thickness in some ancestral form.
now become beaded and cross-striped.
   Striated muscle may, therefore, be de<U+FB01>ned as “ muscular tissues.
the ultimate <U+FB01>brils of which have become varicose, and this in
association with the power of quicker and more active move
ment.”
  We can now ask ourselves       whether it is not possible to explain
this correlation between the segmentation of a muscle and its power
of contracting more rapidly, and it will,      I
                                               think, be seen that a very
simple and straightforward explanation       can  at once be given. The
whole subject can be resolved into a question of “ mass ”; the larger
the contractile element     the longer time will
                          is,                           take to reach its
                                                         it
maximal degree of shortening, so that when         <U+FB01>bril segments into it
                                                     a
number of      much   smaller   particles,  each   one   contracting and
relaxing on its own account,         considerable
                                      a             amount of time will
thereby be gained.      We have many examples of the in<U+FB02>uence of
bulk, or mass, upon rapidity of contraction in the case of the gross
muscles themselves, the larger animals moving relatively slower than
the smaller ones, as when the Hare, in spite of its smaller leaps, can
nearly keep pace with the Horse, because its leaps are repeated at
much shorter intervals.     We can now see how, by simple means, a
muscle can, during its evolution, contract more quickly, but the
fundamental explanation of the phenomena of contraction           isstill to
be found.    Whether or not we may ever be able to express muscular
contraction in terms of those phenomena which we see in the inor
ganic worldI    am not in a position to say, but this we must all be
certain of, that this explanation will result rather from study of the
                                                              a

       <U+FB01>bres, and corresponding to tiny bulgings of the individual <U+FB01>brils; seen best
      at the upper edge of the <U+FB01>bre. The clear stripes on either side of Dobie’s lines»
       correspond with constrictions in the <U+FB01>brils, and the dark stripes correspond
      with broad swellings. The cement substance between the <U+FB01>brils appears light
      in colour.

Photograph of a moist <U+FB01>lm of collodion, upon which a piece of contracted Crab’s
      muscle had been pressed and had then been withdrawn.            The striping is that
      of the contracted <U+FB01>bre in all its detail; the approximation of the cross-stripes
      to each other and the absence of Dobie’s line are points especially to be noted.
       Owing to the collodion <U+FB01>lm varying in its thickness, the intaglio is photo
       graphed at different focal planes, and the dark stripe, which appears light in
      the lower part of the photograph, comes out dark in colour at the upper part.
       The edge of the intaglio is better seen than in Photograph II, and by the aid
       of a lens one can readily see in the original negative the inter<U+FB01>brillar matter.
    I   am much indebted to the Cambridge Engraving Company for
the excellent manner in which the photographs just described have
been reproduced.
   '   Professor P. G. Tait has recently suggested to me, that, owing to their
varicosity, the <U+FB01>brils will be able, as it were, to get a better “grip” of the inter
<U+FB01>brillar matter, so that during contraction or relaxation the muscle will be able more
effectually to move as a whole.

                Suggestions regarding Solutions.”
      RAMSAY, Ph.D.,      F.R.S., Professor of Chemistry in Univer
      sity College, London. Received February 16, 1891.
   The brilliant presidential address of Professor Orme Masson at the
Chemical Section of the Australasian Association for the Advancement
of Science marks a distinct advance in our ideas of solution. The
analogy between the behaviour of a liquid and its vapour in presence
of each other and of a pair of solvents capable of mutual solution is
so striking as to carry conviction.        The resemblance of the liquid
vapour    curve,  with its apex  at   the  critical point, to the solubility
curve, with its apex at the critical solution point, appears to me to
prove beyond cavil that the two phenomena are essentially of the
same nature.      The address will take rank along with van’t Hoif’s
classical paper on “ Osmotic Pressure.”
   There are two other phenomena, which, it appears to me, are made
clear by the ideas of Professor Masson.              The <U+FB01>rst of these has
reference to supersaturated      solutions.      The curves (published in
‘Nature,’ vol. 43, p. 348, Feb. 12, 1891) showing the analogy
between liquid-gas and solution curves, are isobaric curves, or, more
correctly, they represent the terminations of isobaric curves in the
region of mixtures, where, on the one hand, a liquid exists in
presence of its vapour, and, on the other, one solvent in presence of
another (for both solvents play the part of dissolved substances as
well as of solvents). M. AlexéefE’s data are not su<U+FB01>icient to permit
of the construction of a curve representing a similar region mapped
out by the termination of isothermal lines. But it is obvious that it

would be possible to determine osmotic pressures of various mixtures
by the freezing-point method, and so to construct isothermal curves
for such mixtures of solvents.       And there can be no reasonable
doubt that, as the isobaric curves of liquid-gas and of solvent-solvent
display so close an analogy, the isothermal curves would also closely
resemble each other.
   Granting then that this is the case, we may construct an imaginary
isothermal curve on the model of the curve for alcohol published in.
the Phil. Trans.’ by Dr. Sydney Young and myself.

                                                           Now, in one
series of papers on the liquid-gas relations, we showed that with‘
constant volume pressure is a linear function of temperature; and
we were thus able to calculate approximately the pressures and
volumes for any isothermal representing the continuous transition.
from the gaseous to the liquid state (see ‘Phil. Mag,’ 1887, vol. 23,
p. 435). It would be interesting to ascertain whether, if concentra
tion be kept constant, osmotic pressure would also show itself to be a
linear function of temperature.     But, this apart, it appears in the
highest degree probable that there should also exist, in theory, at
least, a continuous transition from solvent to solvent, the representa
tion of which would be a continuous curve.          In such a case, on
increasing  the  concentration  of  the  solution  by eliminating one
solvent, the other solvent should not separate visibly, but the two
should remain mixed, until one solvent has been entirely removed.
The accompanying diagram will make this clear. The sinuous curve
ABCDE      may represent either continuous change from gas to
liquid along an isothermal on decrease of volume, or it may

represent a similar continuous change from saturated solution to
dissolved substance on increase of concentration.
   Mr. Aitken’s experiments on the cooling of air containing water
vapour have shown us that it is possible to realise a portion of the
curve AB; the phenomenon of “boiling with bumping” constitutes
a practical realisation of a portion of the curve DE; and we may
pro<U+FB01>tablyinquire what conditions determine such unstable states
with solvent and solvent.
   Regarding the portion of the curve AB,       I think that no reasonable
doubt can be entertained. It precisely corresponds to the condition
of supersaturation. In the liquid-gas curve, the volume is decreased
at constant temperature without separation of liquid; in the solvent
solvent curve the concentration is increased without separation of the
solvents.    Dr. Nicol has shown that it is possible to dissolve dry
sodium sulphate in a saturated solution of sodium sulphate to a very
considerable extent without inducing crystallisation; and here we
have a realisation of the unstable portion of the curve AB.         In the
gas-liquid curve pressure falls with formation of a shower of drops;
in the solvent-solvent curve crystallisation ensues, and the solvents
separate.    The phenomena are, however, not completely analogous;
the complete analogy would be if the temperature were so low that
the substance in the liquid-gas couple were to separate in the solid,
                                              I
not in the liquid, state. This, so far as am aware, has not been
experimentally realised, but one sees no reason why it should not be
possible.
   I have some hesitation in offering speculations as to the state of
matter at the portion of the continuous curve DE.          It may be that
it corresponds to a syrupy or viscous state.             Cane-sugar at a
moderate temperature dissolves water; indeed it is possible to obtain
a solution of 1 per cent. of water in molten cane-sugar.       And such a
solution, if quickly cooled, remains a syrup. But it can be induced
to crystallise by the presence of crystals.       Thus, in such a mixture
of sugar and water, a few grains of _crystall_ine sugar cause the
whole mass to crystallise, and water saturated with sugar and sugar
separate into two layers.      Here, again, a complete analogy fails us,
for it is a solid which separates. As we know nothing of the osmotic
pressure of a syrup, the analogy is a defective one ; but it is probable
that a dilute solution of sugar would pass continuously into a syrup
of pure sugar by evaporation of the solvent, and analogy would lead
to the supposition that the syrup coincides with the unstable state of
the liquid.    I would, therefore, offer the analogy between the syrupy
and the supercooled states as a tentative one; it lacks foundation in
both cases.
   One point remains to be mentioned.           I have for the past nine
months, in'_conjunction with Mr. Edgar Perman, been determining

  308             Mr. F. E. Beddard.           On a new     Form of            [Man 5,
  the   adiabatic relations for liquid and gaseous ether: the rise of
  pressure and temperature when volume is decreased without escape
  of heat. It is obvious that similar relations are determinable for
  solutions, and probably with much greater facility.                M. Alexéeff has
  made some measurements which might be utilised for this purpose ;
  but they are far too few in number, and, moreover, the necessary
  data as regards osmotic pressure are wholly wanting.                   It would be
  possible by a series of differential experiments to ascertain the
 evolution of heat on increasing concentration, and so to arrive at a
  knowledge of the speci<U+FB01>c heats of the solution at constant osmotic
  pressure, corresponding to the idea of speci<U+FB01>c heat at constant
 pressure; and also of speci<U+FB01>c heats at constant concentration, corre
 sponding to speci<U+FB01>c heats at constant volume.                      I do not know
 whether such researches would yield as accurate results as those we
 are at present carrying out, but they are at least well worthy of
 attention.

        Received February 19, 1891.
     So far as our knowledge of the Oligochaeta goes at present, the
 excretory system appears to consist either of one or more pairs of
 separate     nephridia in each segment, or of a diffuse, irregularly
 arranged system of tubules with numerous external pores upon each
 segment, and often with numerous coelomic funnels in each segment;
there may or may not be a connexion between the tubes of successive
 segments.      All the aquatic Oligochmta have nephridia of the <U+FB01>rst
kind; a large number of the terrestrial Oligochaata have nephridia of
the second kind; there is occasionally in the latter forms a specialisa
tion of part of the diffuse nephridial system into a pair of large
nephridia; these species connect the two extremes.                  But in all these
 Worms the nephridia are contained in the coelom, though some of the
connecting branches may be retroperitoneal ; the ducts which lead to
the exterior may branch in the thickness of the body wall, but there
does not seem to be any extensive rami<U+FB01>cation and anastomosis of the
tubes in the muscular layers of the body wall.*
    I have recently found a remarkably different arrangement of the
nephridia in an Annelid belonging to a new genus of Eudrilidae.
This family is chie<U+FB02>y noteworthy on account of the remarkable modi

<U+FB01>cations of the reproductive organs, and the present genus is no
exception to the rule in that particular; but it shows a further
peculiarity in the structure of the nephridia; the arrangement of
these organs in the clitellar region of the body is unique among
Annelids, and is to a certain extent suggestive of the condition of the
organs supposed to be nephridia in certain Nematoidea. Throughout
the body generally, as in other Eudrilids, the nephridia are paired;
in the genital region        I  was struck, on dissecting the worms, by the
apparent absence of nephridia. Sections through the body wall in
this region show that the longitudinal and transverse muscular layers
are traversed by a system of peculiar canals not at all like nephridia
in appearance. These canals are not mere clefts between the muscular
<U+FB01>bres, such as Kiikenthal has described in his paper“ Ueber die
lymphoiden Zellen der Anneliden ;”* such lymph spaces have found       I
in a good many Oligochaata, but they never possess a de<U+FB01>nite wall. On
the contrary, the canals which          I describe here have a de<U+FB01>nite darkly
staining wall, with nuclei here and there._ They resemble the blood
vessels very closely, and might easily be confounded with them.
   These vessels are arranged in a longitudinal and a transverse series
with nhmerous branches and interconnexions.                      The longitudinal
muscles are imbedded in a nearly homogeneous, transparent, connec
tive tissue, which is of some thickness between the peritoneal
epithelium and where the muscular <U+FB01>bres end. It is in the latter
tract of tissue that the four principal longitudinal trunks run, corre
sponding in position to a line connecting the four successive pairs of
setse; there appear to be smaller longitudinal trunks, but the four
principal ones run through several segments without a break; these
longitudinal trunks are connected with a metamerically repeated
system of transverse vessels; these lie between the transverse and
longitudinal muscular coats, and appear to run right round the body.
They are of considerable calibre, but not so wide as the longitudinal
trunks;   I   could not detect any ciliation anywhere, and their walls
are extremely thin. They give of? numerous branches, which traverse
the body wall in every direction, and form a <U+FB01>ner meshwork of
tubules; some of the branches run towards the epidermis, and
although    I  could not detect in transverse sections the actual ori<U+FB01>ces,
on account of the <U+FB01>neness of the tubes,           I  could make out at frequent
points   a   slight     modi<U+FB01>cation     of   the  epidermis     which seemed to
correspond to an external pore;
   Upon fragments of the chitinous cuticle being stripped o<U+FB01> and
examined with a high magnifying power, the ori<U+FB01>ces were quite plain.
They wer much smaller than the nephridiopores of Perichwta, but
not so minute as to be confounded with the pores of the gland cells
of the epidermis.

  310         Emcretory Organs in an Oligochwtozts Annelid.                  [Man   5,
     The system of tubes was everywhere accompanied by blood vessels;
  but, it is perhaps unnecessary to remark, there was nowhere any con
  nexion between these tubes and the capillaries; no coagulated blood
  was in a single instance found in the excretory tubules.
    In spite of their very di<U+FB02>:'erent appearance, as well as arrangement,
 from the nephridia of other types, such as Perichueta, which possess a
 di<U+FB01>use nephridial system, the excretory nature of these tubes seems
 probable, without any further description.                  A connexion with the
 body cavity must be proved in order to remove all doubts as to their
 nature; in each segment, just behind the pair of sets», the longitudinal
 duct gives off a branch, which passes through the peritoneum and
 comes to lie in the coelom; this branch continues for a short distance,
 and then abruptly ceases; whether it is furnished with an actual
 ori<U+FB01>ce or not I am nn able to say. In a few cases, the branch entering
 the ccxalom became connected with a very small coiled nephridial
 tubule, so small that it was not, as already mentioned, recognisable in
 dissection.
    I am inclined    to refer the atrophy of the intra-coelomic part of the
 nephridia to     their having been used up in the formation of the
 genital ducts.    I have     recently communicated to this Societyia notice
 of the development of the genital ducts out of nephridia in Acanth0
 drilus;* and that mode of development is possibly general. In any
 case the nephridial system of the genital segments of this Eudrilid con
sists almost entirely of a complex system of tubes, which ramify in the
thickness of the body wall, which open by numerous pores on to the
 exterior, and are connected by ct few short tubes with the body cavity.           If
the tubes leading to the caalom became             obliterated,    and they are very
short as it is, the excretory system would consist only of the network
in the body walls.
    This system of tubes in the skin may perhaps be more comparable
to the nephridial network of Cestodes and other <U+FB01>at Worms, than the
intracoelomic network of other Oligochseta; its presence, however, in
the, body walls suggests a comparison               with the Nematoidea, which
appear to possess at least the remains of a coelom. . In some of these
Worms a system of <U+FB01>ne tubes connected with the excretory pore
permeates the interspaces between the longitudinal muscles.                       In
Echinorhynchus      the    tubes  connected     with   the  lemnisci  also ramifyin
the integument, and the lemnisci themselves are processes of the
body wall depending into the coelom.

HI. “Contributions          to   the Study of the Connexion between
        Chemical Constitution and Physiological Action.            Part II.”
        By T. LAUDER BRUNTON, M.D., F.R.S., and J. THEODORE
        CASH, M.D.,    F.R.S.      Received March 2, 1891.
                                    (Abstract)
   In    a former paper, the authors discussedthe alterations which are
produced in the action of ammonia by ‘the substitution of alkyl
radicals for hydrogen, and by combination of the compound ammonias
with different acid radicals.
   In the present paper, they have examined on a similar plan the
physiological action of some bodies of the aromatic series.
   The research was begun more than four years ago, a preliminary
communication having been made to this Society on March 24th,
 1887. A good deal of work has been done in connexion with the
subject by other observers while the research was in progress.          The
 results obtainediby others, however, are not easy of comparison,
 while the experiments of the authors, having been made as nearly as
 possible under the same conditions, yield*results which are more
 easily compared, so as to allow"of general conclusions being drawn
from them.        They have examined (1) the physiological action of
benzene, and (2) the alterations which occur in its action when one
or more atoms of hydrogen in it are replaced by (a) haloid radicals,
               radicals, (0) by‘ hydroxyl, (d) by N02, and (e) by amidogen,
](é>I){alcohol
      2.
   They have also examined the modi<U+FB01>cations in the action of various
members of the series by changes in temperature.
   They describe the general symptoms produced by benzene and its
compounds in frogs and rats, their action on muscle and nerve, on
re<U+FB02>ex action, on respiration, and circulation.
   They describe a new method of registering the blood pressure and
pulse, using a slow drum for the former, and a quick one for the
latter, so as to have the whole course of the blood pressure during an
experiment given in a comparatively short tracing, while samples of
the pulse waves are taken at various periods.
   They <U+FB01>nd that the action of benzene and its compounds is chie<U+FB02>y
exerted on the spinal cord, although they act also on the cerebrum
and, to a slight extent, on nerves and muscle.       Their effect on muscle
and nerve is to weaken them, the paralysing action being stronger
upon the nerve than the muscle.
   Their action on the cerebrum is evidenced by lethargy and dis
inclination to voluntary movement both in frogs and rats.
   Their action on the spinal cord appears to consist in producing

increased    excitability, greater diffusion of stimuli with diminished
power and de<U+FB01>niteness of movement.              Thus slight stimuli in the
frog produce movement more readily in the poisoned than in the
normal condition, but the movement, instead of being limited to one
limb, vigorous and steady, is diffused over several limbs, feeble and
tremulous or jerking.
    In frogs, the tremors or jerking always occur on attempted move
ment, and sometimes, to a slight extent, when at rest.             If the dose
be large, they are succeeded by paralysis.        Absorption    of the drug is
slow and irregular, and it may cause local rigor of the muscles. The
heart remains long irritable.
    Haloid radicals do not modify the action of benzene to the same
extent as they do that of ammonia, but they do so in somewhat the
same direction as the authors described in their former paper on this
subject.   Monochlorobenzene    affects the spinal cord more than benzene,
causing spasm and rapid diminution of re<U+FB02>ex.             It also weakens the
circulation, but does not seem to a<U+FB01>"ect motor nerves or muscles more
than benzene. The br0mo- and iodo-compounds have a more power
ful paralysing action on the cerebrum than benzene and chloro
benzene, and the compound of iodine with benzene, like its compound
with ammonia, appears to have a special tendency to paralyse motor
nerves, muscles, and cerebral re<U+FB02>exes, and to depress the heart. Heat
accelerated and cold retarded the action of the substances.
    The substitution of alcohol radicals for hydrogen in benzene
appears to modify its action in much the same way as one would
expect from a general consideration of the properties of the alcohol
group, which, as a rule, have a sedative action on the nervous
system.
    The compounds of benzene with alcohol radicals produce less
tremor, less hyperaesthesia, and greater lethargy than the halogen
compounds.       The circulation is little a<U+FB02>ected by them. They have
little action on muscle or nerve, but act more powerfully on the nerve
 than on the muscle. Their action appears to be more <U+FB02>eeting -than
 that of the halogen compounds.       Trimethylbenzene (mesitylene) was
 more active than methyl- or dimethyl-benzene.               In poisoning by
 dimethylbenzene      a curious increase of re<U+FB02>ex action was observed,
 after it had almost gone, and spontaneous movement had quite
 gone.
     Substitution   of hydrogen by hydroxyl increases the tendency to
 convulsions.     These are due to the action of the substances on the
 spinal cord and not on the cerebrum ; they occur independently of
 voluntary movement, except when the dose is very small, and con
 tinue almost unchanged after destruction of the cerebrum.               Slight
 tremor may occur before destruction of the cerebrum, but it is greatly
 masked by the powerful contractions referred to. The position of the

1891.]     Chemical Constitution and Physiological Action.           313
 hydroxyl groups in the di- and tri-oxybenzenes a<U+FB01>ects their physio
logical action.    Para-oxybenzene (resorcin) has an action similar in
 kind, but weaker than the ortho- and meta-oxybenzenes           (hydro
 quinone and pyrocatechin).     The most characteristic feature of its
 action is the occurrence, at nearly regular intervals, of clonic con
 vulsions, which never become tonic or~tetanic, and are due to the
 action of the drug on the cord.      They are abolished-Tby the action
 of curare, even in a limb protected by ligature fromthe action of both
 poisons.   Strychnine produces tetanic spasm in a frog poisoned by
 resorcin, if the symptoms due to the latter drug are only imperfectly
developed, but does not do so if the clonic spasms have become well
marked. Large doses cause paralysis, destroying -the irritability and
conducting power of the cord. Trioxybenzene (1 : 2 : 3-pyrogallol)
produces more lethargy than resorcin, less tremor on movement, and
little spontaneous jerking. Its power to produce immediate symptoms
in the frog is only
                      one-fourth or one-<U+FB01>fth that of "resorcin, but it is
almost exactly equal to it in its ultimate lethal power.
    Amidobenzene (anilin) may be regarded either asibenzene with one
hydrogen replaced by amidogen, NH2, or -as ammonia in which one
hydrogen is replaced-by-phenyl, C6H5. In -conformity with this con
stitution, the symptoms produced by it di<U+FB01>er from those of benzene
and resemble those of ammonia in the tendency to more violent
spasm and to greater paralysis of muscle and nerve.          They diifer
from those of ammonia in the fact that the convulsions never assume
 the form of true tetanus, the tetanic spasm which the ammonia group
would produce being broken up,. so to speak,‘ by the action of the
 phenyl.    With the exception of the hydroxyl compounds, amide
benzene causes the most rapid occurrence of: motor phenomena.          It
produces great tremor after a spring and active incoordinate move
ment, but no tonic spasm.         Nitrobenzene ‘causes lethargy with
increasing tremor on movement, and ‘early abolition of re<U+FB02>ex action.
    The e<U+FB01>ect of several benzene compounds on re<U+FB02>ex time was
observed.    The oxybenzenes could not‘ be tested on account of the
spontaneous jerks to which they give rise.      The general action is to
cause a lengthening in the re<U+FB02>ex time, but a primary shortening was
observed frequently in the case of chlorobenzene, slightly in methyl-,
dimethyl-, and ethyl-benzene.
   In producing muscular rigor, chlorobenzene is considerably more
powerful than the bromo- or iodo-compound, and is intermediate in
strength between methyl- and dimcthyl-benzene.           Of the methyl
benzenes, the methyl- is the strongest, the dimethyl- next, and the tri
methyl- weakest.      The action of these compounds on muscles         is,
therefore, inversely to the amount of methyl substituted for hydrogen
in the benzene molecule.     Ethyl benzene  is nea-rly the same strength
as methyl, and stronger than the dimethyl or trimethyl              com

        The present investigation was commenced three" years ago, in order
     to throw further light on the mode of action of the paraf<U+FB01>nic nitrites
     when introduced into the animal organism, and particularly to deter

 mine     in what manner this action is conditioned by the diiferent
 chemical constitution of the various nitrites employed.          Since the
 chemical constitution of these compounds is well established, and
 their molecules are comparatively simple in structure, and, moreover,
 as their principal physiological effects are capable of accurate qu_anti-  -
 tative study, it seemed likely that the inquiry would furnish valuable      '
 pharmacological     results.
      Our knowledge of i the physiological behaviour of the (organic
 nitrites has been almost wholly derived from the study of‘ amylv
 nitrite, which has been observed to produce a similar but far. greater
 effect than its lower -homologue ethyl nitrite, whose action, however, .
 has not hitherto been so closely_ examined as thatlof the amyl corn- -
-pound.       Unfortunately it seems certain that the results which have
 been obtained with amyl nitrite are to a large extent vitiated by the
  circumstance that, as a rule, insufficient pains have been taken to
  procure the nitrite in a chemically pure state, whilst, in addition, the
  usual mode of administration has been such that it is impossible to
  determine exactly._ how much. of the. compound has actually been
  inhaled.
      It  is believed that both these sources of error .have been obviated
  in the present research. The exact composition of each substance was
  known, and a special apparatus was devised for ensuring. the inhala
  tion without loss of a de<U+FB01>nite amount of nitrite, through the trachea
  in animals, and through the nostrils in the human subject. _
      In this, the <U+FB01>rst part of the communication, an account is given of
  the principal work which has already been done on this subject, and
  this is followed by a brief description of the method by which the
  nitrites have been prepared . and their purity ascertained.           The
  physiological actions which have. -been made the subject of special
  study are those on blood pressure, pulse, and respiration, whilst the
  action on striated muscular <U+FB01>bre has also been fully examined.        The
  present paper deals almost entirely with the action of various nitrites
   on blood pressure, and with the special apparatus used in studying it.
   A   subsequent paper   will have reference to the action-.of these same
   nitrites in producing contraction of striated muscle, and will conclude
   with a discussion of the whole of our results, both in their chemical
   and physiological aspects.
      The nitrites have been prepared by the reaction of the correspond
   ing alcohol, previously puri<U+FB01>ed, with sodium nitrite in the presence of
   dilute acid. This has proved to constitute a satisfactory plan of pre
   paring the entire series of nitrites with which we have worked.      The
   liquid nitrites, after having been thoroughly washed and dried, were
   repeatedly distilled, in some cases under reduced pressure, until a
   liquid boiling at a constant temperature was obtained.        Proof that
    the liquids thus obtained had the composition of the required nitrites

316             Profs.  J. T. Cash and W. R. Dunstan.          [Man 5,
was furnished by analysis.     The nitrites which we have prepared are
those of methyl, ethyl, primary propyl, secondary propyl, primary
butyl, secondary butyl, tertiary butyl, isobutyl, 4-amyl, ,8-amyl, and
tertiary amyl.    Certain of these nitrites were prepared by us for the
<U+FB01>rst time, while of those which had already been described some have
been found to possess di<U+FB01>erent physical properties to those usually
ascribed to them. For the purposes of administration, a known volume
of eachnitrite-was taken. The-relative density of each substance
havingibeen previously determined, the weight corresponding to the
volume taken was readily calculated, and from this was ascertained
the amount of the active nitrite group (N02) present.
   The apparatus for recording alterations in blood pressure consisted
of a mercurial "manometer writing upon a slowly rotating drum, and
a Fick’s Y-kymograph writinglupon a more rapidly revolving l3alzac’s
cylinder. These manometers could be employed together or sepa
rately, but, as a rule, when pressure and number of pulsations only
were being observed, both were kept open.        The advantage of the
arrangement is that a considerable period of. time is represented by a
short lineal movement on a. small drum, whilst on the quick one the
pulse can be reckoned and the course of the rapidly occurring varia
tions of pressure studied. Respiration was ‘recorded on a registering
Marey’s tauibour attached to a double tambour placed on the thorax
of the animal. An electrical signal, in connexion with a key and
Daniell’s cell, was placed beneath the point recording the blood
pressure in order to mark the time of administration of nitrite.     In
cases where vagus, splanchnic,» or sciatic stimulation was employed, a
double key admitted the faradic current from the secondary coil of
a du Bois-Reymond’s inductoriumto the electrodes on which the
nerve rested, while at the same time it closed the signal circuit indi
cating the length of stimulation.
   The following represents the course of the nitrite administration.
The blood pressure being steady, the clockwork of the quick drum
was started so as to bring -it up to full -speed before-the cylinder
was made -to rotate by screwing up the friction-wheel.      The nitrite
was then introduced into the side tube of the inhaler; an arrange
ment of valves permitted inspiration only to take place through this
tube.   The cylinder was started, and after a su<U+FB01>ieient record of the
pulse and respiration for the time --being had been recorded, the
nitrite was administered, the time of administration being recorded.
A su<U+FB02>icient time having elapsed for inhalation, the air-tube of the
inhaleriwas opened, the.quick -drum being permitted to run as long
as wasnecessary for the purpose of recording the changes in pulse
and pressure.    During the recovery of pressure an occasional record
of pulse and respiration was taken on the quick drum, corresponding
marks being made on the slowly revolving cylinder.

1891.]      The Physiological Action of the Para<U+FB01>inic Nitrites.          317
    It is well established that small doses of amyl nitrite cause a fall of
blood pressure, resulting chie<U+FB02>y, if not entirely, from a powerful
dilatation of the arterioles, reducing peripheral resistance to a great
extent.     Two distinct views have been advanced as to the cause of
the dilatation.     Filehne maintains that his experimental results de
monstrate the dilatation to be due, not to a local action on the walls
of the vessels, but to the direct action of the nitrite on the vaso-motor
centres.     On the other hand, Brunton, and also Mayer and Friedrich,
believe they have shown that the dilatation is the result of a direct
action on the walls of the vessel, and is independent -of any e<U+FB01>ect on
the central nervous system.
    After discussing the experiments     of Filehne, Brunton, and Mayer,
an account is given of the experiments made by the authors to eluci
date this question.      These were made with cats, but control experi
ments with rabbits a<U+FB01>orded the same results.        In the <U+FB01>rst series the
head of the animal was entirely out off from the circulation, yet inha
lation of pure amyl nitrite (§‘§th c.c.) caused a rapid fall of pressure,
the lowest point reached exactly corresponding with that noticed in
an immediately preceding experiment, in which the head was included
in the circulation. In the second series all the arteries passing to the
head were temporarily ligatured, and salt solution containing dis
solved amyl nitrite (3-‘Eth c.c.) injected through the distal end of the
carotid artery, one of the jugular veins being opened so as to admit
of an escape of blood and hinder the production of a possibly
abnormal intravascular tension in the brain. The same effect was
constantly observed; the blood pressure rose, and not until the clamps
were removed did the fall of pressure of the usual character occur.
 There is thus no indication of the characteristic nitrite effect, so long
as the vessels are ligatured, although the nitrite must have passed to
the medulla oblongata by vascular anastomosis, and therefore to the
chief vaso-motor centre.        By the injection of Berlin blue, it was
demonstrated that access could be gained to the medulla through
this channel.      The conclusion that the nitrite effect is the result of an
action on the vessels, and not on the central nervous system, was con
<U+FB01>rmed by observations on the effect produced by nitrites after
 splanchnic stimulation and section.         Splanchnotomy is attended
 with a    considerable   reduction of pressure, and if nitrite be admi
 nistered when this is at its minimum, a further reduction occurs,
 which, however, is not so great as that observed before section.        But
 if administration of nitrite be delayed until the occurrence of one of
 the temporary elevations of pressure which are observed from time to
 time, the fall of pressure closely approximates to that produced before
 splanchnotomy.        Simultaneous splanchnic stimulation and nitrite
 inhalation also cause a normal fall in pressure.
     In experiments with the human subject, an accurate record was

318          Physiological Action  of the Para<U+FB02>lnic ]\'itrites.  [M&T. 5,
taken of the pulse-rate, after inhalation of a known quantity of
nitrite. A mask inhaler was specially devised, so as to avoid loss of
substance during inhalation.      It consisted of a conical metal box
covering   the  mouth,  and <U+FB01>tting accurately on the bridge of the nose
by the aid of a hollow rubber border, which could be distended by
injection of air. It is provided with three tubes opening out of a
common trunk in the front of the mask; one of these was not fur
nished with any valve, but the two lateral tubes had each one valve,
opening inwards and outwards respectively.       The tube intended for
the inspiration of nitrite had a continuation of india-rubber, in the
middle of which a glass bulb was inserted for the reception of the
nitrite. Spring clamps were placed on either side of the bulb.        The
mask having been adjusted to the face, and respiration being regular
through the valvular tube, the drum was started at full speed so as to
record the normal pulse rate, and the. inhalation tube was opened by
removing the clamps on either side of the bulb at the same time as
the interior tube was closed.    The time of inhalation was recorded by
a signal marker.
   There is a considerable -variation on the part of individuals to
nitrite effect, the acceleration of the pulse in the case of those of
neurotic tendency being much greater, and the time of its con
tinuance much less than in that of a lymphatic subject.         The order
of activity (extent of acceleration) for various nitrites deduced from
a large number of- experiments is (1) a-amyl; (2) /3-amyl; (3) iso
butyl; (4) secondary butyl; (5) primary butyl; (6) secondary propyl;
 (7) primary propyl; (8) ethyl; .(9) methyl.
   The action of each paraf<U+FB01>nic nitrite has been closely contrasted with
that of amyl nitrite. The results may be broadly summarised as
follows :—
   All the nitrites examined produce, in whatever way administered,
a reduction of blood pressure, variable, however,.according to the
compound employed in its extent and in its progress, as well as in the
 ensuing recovery.
   A pulse acceleration usually accompanies and succeeds the fall
 upon inhalation, the extent of inhalation varying in the case of indi
 vidual nitrites.   The accelerationis less upon intra-vascular injection,
especially intra-arterial injection, than when administration is by
inhalation; a distinct retardation of pulse is frequently produced by
the former method, especially by carotid injection.
    The extent of acceleration appears to be less in the case of cats than
in the human subject.
   The respiration is aifected (1) temporarily during and immediately
subsequent to inhalation, in various degrees by the dilferent nitrites,
and (2) permanently by the repeated administrations of. the same‘ or
different nitrites.

    As regards the principal e<U+FB01>ect, reduction of blood pressure,         the
 activity (extent of reduction) of the various nitrites takes the follow
 ing order when equal volumes are administered to animals by inha
 lation :—(l) secondary propyl; (2) tertiary bntyl;               secondary
 butyl, (4) isobutyl, nearly equal; (5) tertiary amyl; (6) ¢-amyl,
  (7) ;3-amyl, nearly equal; (8) methyl; (9) butyl; (10) ethyl;
  (ll) propyl.
    The order is somewhat modi<U+FB01>ed when the nitrites are given by
 intra-vascular injection.     When the duration of the sub-normal
 pressure is considered, the order is nearly the reverse of that given
 above, the e<U+FB01>ect of methyl nitrite being the last, and that of secondary
 propyl nitrite one of the <U+FB01>rst, todisappear.            In contrasting the
 results of   the measurement    of. pulse acceleration produced by these
 nitrites, it is noticed thattheir activityin this respect does not follow
 the same order as that in reducing blood pressure, the amyl nitrites
 in particular occupying a.higher position in the table. The causes of
 these differences will be considered in the second part of this paper,
 in conjunction with a discusion of the relation of the chemical con
 stitution of the nitrites to the physiological effects now described,
 and also to those produced in striated muscle, a description of which
 will form part of the subsequent communication. _
    In order that the physiological data might be placed on an abso
 lutely satisfactory basis for chemical discussion, we determined at the
 commencement of last year to .repeat all the more important physio
 logical experiments.     This necessitated the labour of preparing fresh
 specimens of the nitrites-.-   The results of these con<U+FB01>rmatory experi
 ments have been in every respect satisfactory, since they differed
 in no important respect from those previously obtained. .

V. “ Some- Points in the Structure and Development of
       Dentine.” By J. HOWARD MUMMERY. Communicated by
       (J. S. TOMES, F .R.S. Receivedltebruary 7, 1891. .
                                 (Abstract)
    The purpose of. the present .paper is to show that there are appear
ances in dentine which. suggest that it is formed by a connective
tissue calci<U+FB01>cation,    and that the process is more closely analogous to
the formation of bone than has usually been supposed.
    The varied theories held as to the structure and development of

dentine are partly due to the di<U+FB02>iculties met with in the investigation
of this tissue, soft and hard parts having to be retained in their
natural relations to each other.       Decalci<U+FB01>cation of the dentine by
acids has been resorted to, a mode of preparing microscopical objects
for study which is open to many objections.              Sections cut by a
process recommended by Dr. L. A. Wei], of Munich, exhibit the
natural relations of pulp and tooth without the necessity of resorting
to decalci<U+FB01>cation.     Fresh specimens are <U+FB01>xed in sublimate, passed
through gradually increasing strengths of spirit to absolute alcohol,
and slowly impregnated with a solution of desiccated balsam in
chloroform, dried with more balsam over a water-bath, and cut down
on a stone with water.      The present investigation was undertaken
with the aid of this process, controlled by the examination of other
specimens cut by the more ordinary methods.
    Processes or bundles of <U+FB01>bres are seen, incorporated on the one
side with the dentine, and on the other with the connective tissue
stroma of the pulp; some of the bundles give evidence of partial
calci<U+FB01>cation, reminding one of similar appearances in the calci<U+FB01>cation
of membrane bone. Cells are seen included in the bundles and lying
parallel to their course; these cells, it is concluded, form together with
the odontoblasts the formative cells of the dentine, the calci<U+FB01>cation of
 which tissue should be looked upon as in part, at least, a secretion
 rather than a conversion process, the cells secreting a material which
 calci<U+FB01>es along the lines of and among the connective tissue <U+FB01>bres,
 the cells themselves not being converted into dentine matrix. These
 appearances are seen in the rapidly forming dentine of a growing
 tooth, as well as in more fully developed specimens.        An examination
 of  other Mammalian teeth reveals similar appearances.           The dentine
 of the incisor of the Rat (Mus decumanus) shows with great distinct
 ness the incorporation of the connective tissue <U+FB01>bres with the dentine,
 and there is a marked striation of the dentine near the pulp cavity,
 parallel with these <U+FB01>bres. The ivory of the Elephant’s tusk shows
 the same relation of connective tissue to formed dentine.               Vasc
  dentine  exhibits  a very  well de<U+FB01>ned      connective   tissue   layer sur
  rounding the pulp. This layer has hitherto been looked upon as
  consisting of odontoblasts, but this tissue shows no nuclei, and has
  the characters of a layer of <U+FB02>attened connective tissue <U+FB01>bres—a layer
  of nucleated cells in close apposition to the dentine, probably being
  the real odontoblasts of vaso-dentine.

Lowering of the Melting Point of Ice by Distorting                Stress
(‘ Phil. Trans.,’ 1849), in which he expresses the opinion that crystals,
whether of ice or other substances, are not plastic.
   If we reject the idea of internal distortion of the crystals, we are
driven to the conclusion that the observed plasticity must be due to
some action at the interfaces, whereby the crystals alter their shape
sufficiently to allow them to alter their relative positions.  As to the
nature of the action, various suggestions occurred to me.           James
Thomson explained the plasticity of ice at 0° C. by supposing the ice
to melt at those interfaces where the stress was great, and the liberated
water, after <U+FB02>owing to points where the stress was small, to again
solidify. This might be extended to low temperatures by supposing
a certain quantity of water to be kept in the liquid state by the
pressure of residual impurities.       But the process would be enor
mously retarded by the constant necessity for the distribution of salt
being equalised by diffusion. Again, it is not clear how a bar of ice
during this process would be able to resist a tension considerably
greater than the pressure of the atmosphere.      With more probability
we may suppose      one crystal to grow at the expense of another owing
to the stresses and strains on the contiguous parts being different.
Though the stresses were the same, the strains might be different,
owing to acolotropic elasticity. But the elasticities are not likely to
be very di<U+FB02>erent in di<U+FB01>erent directions, so for a very small extension
of the bar we should expect considerable movement of the interfaces.
There is, however, nothing to prevent the stresses being different.
The tension in any direction parallel to the interface might be greater
in one crystal than in the other.     The migration of matter from one
crystal to another under less stress would probably in almost all cases
be accompanied by yielding to the external force producing the
stresses.    But in this case the effect would be very indirect, and
again   we  might  look for large movement of the interfaces.
    Some such speculations had occupied my mind last autumn, and it
was with considerable curiosity that I began experiments in Decem
ber on the puzzling question of the real cause of the plasticity of ice.
I  took a bar of ice consisting of half a dozen crystals, made a draw
ing under the polariscope of the relative position of the interfaces,
and then set up the bar with the ends supported and a weight hung
from the middle.      After two days, it had bent a good deal, yet, under
the polariscope, I could detect no material change in the position of
the interfaces.     One crystal, however, had completely changed its
appearance.     It now strongly reminded me of a piece of unannealed

1891.]             On the Plasticity   of an Ice Crystal.            325
glass.   There were two centres of colour encircled by irregular rings,
and these remained much the same when the two faces through which
the light passed were rubbed quite <U+FB02>at and the other crystals cut
away.     There could be no doubt that this crystal had su<U+FB01>ered some
thing more than mere elastic distortion.
    The next experiment was very instructive. A thin slip of ice,
being a single crystal, was subjected to bending stress as before, and
left for several hours. It apparently bent very quickly, for after a
few hours it was found crescent shaped, and luckily unbroken, lying
at the bottom of the box. The optic axis was bent, and, though its
change of direction was rapid where the bend was sharp, there
appeared to be no break in continuity.       On the other hand, the long
narrow bubbles, which were originally no doubt parallel to each
other and perpendicular to the slip, were still parallel to each other
throughout. In fact, as     I noted at the time, the crystal behaved as
if it consisted of an in<U+FB01>nite number of inde<U+FB01>nitely thin sheets of
paper, normal to the optic axis, attached to each other by some viscous
substance which allowed one to slide over the next with great di<U+FB01>i
culty. This comparison proved to be the key to the whole question
of the plasticity of a crystal of ice.
    Further experiment showed that if a bar of ice consisting of a
single crystal with the axis perpendicular to two of the side faces was
subjected to bending stress, it would bend freely in the plane of the
axis either at or below the freezing point, but not at all in a plane
 perpendicular to it. In the bent crystal the optic axis in any part
 was normal to the bent faces in that part.       But any series of lines
 drawn in the substance of the ice which were originally parallel to the
 optic axis and to each other remained parallel to each other, though
 not, of course, to the optic axis.   This was evidenced by the position
 of long narrow bubbles which frequently form at right angles to the
 planes of freezing, and also by the end faces of the bar remaining
 parallel to each other. When the optic axis was longitudinal, the bar
 bent indeed, but not very readily, and the general behaviour was
 more obscure.     Still, this case, too, was in satisfactory agreement
 with the analogy mentioned above.
    Let us state this analogy more fully. The sheets of paper oifer no
 resistance to bending, but utterly refuse to stretch except, of course.
 elastically. Initially they are plane and perpendicular to the optic
 axis, and, after they have been deformed by bending, the optic axis at
 any point is still normal to the sheet at that point.      They are of
 uniform thickness, whence it easily follows that the directions of the
 optic axis in any crystal form a series of straight, though not parallel,
 lines.

                  Detailed Account of the Experiments.
    The <U+FB01>rst two experiments have been su<U+FB01>iciently described already.
    The place of experiment was a north room in the Buol Hotel,
 Davos.   A box without a lid was placed on a wooden table, and
 across the top of this box were laid two pieces of wood, which
served to support the ends of the bar of ice.       From the middle of
the bar was suspended a weight with a loop of thick string.         In the
bottom of the box, but at the other end, 'i.e., about a foot from the ice
and 6 inches below  it, was placed a registering thermometer of the Six
pattern. Over the whole was put a thick wooden cover. As there
was nothing inside the cover of great capacity for heat,           believe    I
that any variation of the temperature of the ice was nearly simul
 taneously felt by the thermometer.      This thermometer, which was
used throughout, was divided into Fahrenheit degrees; its correction
at freezing-point was tested both before and after the experiments.
The error did not exceedf’ F. At         F. compared

two ends of the bar were composed of many crystals.         A weight of
1'29 kilograms was applied from 11.20‘A'.'M. to 8.30 P.M. on December

of the middle crystal are in the same position as before the bending.
The question immediately suggested itself whether the bend was due
to a limited number of layers sliding over each other by <U+FB01>nite amounts,
or to a true shearing strain.   I  examined the surfaces of the bubbles
very carefully with a magnifying glass, and could <U+FB01>nd no trace of pro
jecting edges or “faults,” so   I   concluded it was a true shear.  My
polariscope was the same as was used two years ago.
   Light from the white paper A, <U+FB01>g. 2, was re<U+FB02>ected by the three

                                 I

 with convergent light.‘ The bent bar under this polariscope was
 found to have the optic axis as nearly as    I could tell normal to the

bent faces throughout.     If the black centre was near the middle of
one half‘, the sharp bend was crowded with narrow coloured bands
which moved slowly along as the bar was tilted, till as each band
reached the straight piece beyond         the bend   it moved rapidly and
broadened out.
   The movement of the bands across the bend, though slow, was quite
regular, so the direction of the optic axis changed quickly but not
per saltum.
    Exp. 4.—A similar arrangement.        The bar was all one crystal except
the parts actually on the supports.         The optic axis was transverse,
but horizontal. Depth,     9'5  mm.  ; breadth, 10 mm.; supports, 75 mm.
apart.    The weight of 1‘29 kilos. was applied over 42 hours from
4.15   P.M.  on ‘December 15 to 10.35 'A.M. on December 17. The
minimum temperature was —'7°'8 C., the maximum ——1°'1 C., the mean
about —3°'3 C.
    Decided evaporation had taken place; ‘the edges of the bar were
rounded and the string which had stuck to the bar was raised on
ridges.    The greater part of the bar was 8} mm. deep, 9 mm. broad.
In comparing the traces taken ‘before and after 'the experiment
I  could <U+FB01>nd no bending.     It certainly did not amount to half a milli~
metre.     The traces were taken by laying the bar on a 'sheet of
paper and following the upper and lower edges with a pencil.
   Exp. 5.—The same bar, turned so as to put the optic axis vertical,
bent rapidly.
    Depth 8% mm., breadth 8% mm. ‘Distance between supports 73mm.
The weight of ()‘62 kilo. was applied from 11.10 A.M. to 9.5 P.M. on
December 17.        The minimum temperature was —4°'4 C., the maxi
mum —1°'7       (1,  mean about -—3°'0.      The depression of the middle
measured on the trace was about 44 mm., which had taken place
in 10 hours. Assuming that in Experiment 4 the depression was less
then 0'5 mm.,'the bending of the bar in the new position must have
 been at least thirty-seven times as fast.       It is true the depth and
 breadth were-slightly less, but the weight was less than half as great.
 The results of Exp. 3 as to bubbles and optic axis were confirmed.
    Exp. 6.—A bar with the axis longitudinal.
    I obtained a»la_rge lump of thick ice from the Davos lake, and
 from this cut a bar which appeared to be all one crystal, with the
 axis longitudinal.    Ineed not enter on the details of the experiment,
 especially as the "temperature rose above freezing-point.        But at the
 end the bar had the shape shown in the diagram, Figs. 3, 4.
    The dotted line indicates a division between the crystals.           The
 double-headed arrows show the direction of the optic axis in di<U+FB01>"ercnt
 parts, or at least the projection of that direction on the plane of the
 paper. This was determined by making the <U+FB01>eld of the polariscope as
 dark as possible, putting the part of the bar in question in the middle

of the <U+FB01>eld and then turning it till it looked as dark as possible.
When this is done the axis lies in the principal planeof the instru
ment.     It will be noticed that in each crystal the direction of the
optic axis is almost uniform.      I  imagine that the two crystals existed
virtually   in the bar, but that their   optic axes were so nearly parallel
that in the polariscope they behaved as one crystal. The kind of
shear that must have taken place in the upper crystal is represented
in <U+FB01>g. 4 by a number of layers of <U+FB01>nite thickness slipped over one
another.
   I cannot say de<U+FB01>nitely that the bending was either slower or faster
than in a bar all one crystal with the axis vertical.
   The part beyond the dotted line is perhaps due to the intrusion of
another crystal completely overlapped by the main crystal, or perhaps
to some alteration of the optical qualities due to elastic strain.
   Exp. 7.—Another bar cut from the same lump was a single crystal
with the axis nearly longitudinal, inclined perhaps at 5° to the side of
the bar. Breadth lO‘7, depth lO'5, distance between supports 84 mm.,
weight 1'29 kilos. After six hours, during which time the tempera
ture had been between —1°'7 and —0°'6 C., the bar was found lying at
the bottom of the box broken into two pieces. It had bent so much
that it must have slipped down between the supports and been broken
in the fall. The two parts could be accurately pieced together.          At
the dotted line there was a very rapid but not sudden change in the
direction of the optic axes. The shape of the surfaces normal to the
optic axes is shown in <U+FB01>g. 5 (p. 330). These sliding surfaces must
have the geometrical property that the normal drawn at any point to
any point is also normal to all the surfaces it cuts within the bar. It
is in fact parallel to the optic axis all along its course.
                                                                 1 2

   It will be noticed  that the directions of the optic axis in different
parts form a series of straight lines. This is an immediate conse
quence of the hypothesis of the existence of sliding surfaces, and
may be shown in the following way.—In the part of the crystal
beyond the dotted line, however, this rule does not hold good.
   In the original unstrained crystal the optic axis is in the same
direction everywhere.      Hence layers perpendicular to it are of equal
thickness throughout.      Their subsequent bending and slipping does
not affect their uniformity of thickness.
   We need only consider one of the principal directions of
curvature.
   Draw PP’, QQ' normal to the surface at P, Q, to meet the next
surface at P'Q'. On PP’ drop perpendiculars Qn, Q'n'. All the quan
tities in small distances are small except the radii of curvature p, p’
at P and P’.     Since the thickness of the layer is uniform, PP’ = QQ’
= nu’. Thus to the second order of small quantities Pn = P'n'.

   Exp. 8.—This was an experiment on              bar composed of three
                                                       a
crystals designed to investigate the action at the interfaces of crys
tals.  The bar bent a good deal, but nearly the whole bend occurred
in the middle of one of the crystals.       had cut nicks in the sides of
                                                  I
the bar to test for migration of the interfaces within the ice, but
found none.     It appears, in fact, that the interfaces do not in any
way assist the plasticity, but hinder     by fettering the sliding of the
                                                 it
layers in the  separate crystals.
   Exp. 9.—Out of some thick ice formed on the surface of the
water in     afoot-bath    Icut   bar which was all one crystal. When
                                         a
the bar was in position the optic axis was horizontal, and inclined at
about 60° to the length of the bar.
   Breadth, 13 mm.; depth, 117 mm.; distance between supports,
38 mm.
     A   weight of 1'29 kilos. was applied for        16%    hours from 4.50   P.M.
on   January     29 to   9.15   A.1\!.   on   January 30, during which time the
maximum temperature was —5° C., the minimum —12°'7 C., and the
mean about —8°'6 C. The depression of the middle was 1'9 mm.            A
little consideration will show that by the theory of the‘ sliding layers,
the upper and lower surfaces of the bar -should be bent in such a
manner as to still contain straight lines perpendicular to the optic axis.
Some such deformation was observed, but*it was not very de<U+FB01>nite.                I
noticed that the numerous bubbles which were originally parallel to
the axis were still parallel to the upper and lower surfaces in their
neighbourhood.
I    now set up an arrangement for obtaining more accurate measure
ments   of the rate of bending.     A large square aperture in an iron
plate was bridged by a curved iron bar rigidly attached to the plate.
The bar of ice was placed across the aperture.      A loop attached to
the curved bar supported     wire lever, of which 'the long arm served
                                  a
as a pointer on a scale, and the short arm carried a stirrup which
embraced the ice.     When the bar bent thcstirrup was depressed
and the pointer raised about twenty-eight times as much.
   This part of the apparatus was placed in a cigar box, at one end of
which the pointer projected through a slit, while there was a hole in
the bottom to allow the string, to which the weight was attached, to
pass through.     The Six thermometer was on a level with the ice,
and could   be read by gently lifting the lid without disturbing any
thing. The mirror and scale with which the position of the pointer
was read were fastened to the box.
   The only part of the stirrup that touched the ice was the <U+FB02>at piece
of tin at the bottom.     This was slightly roughed and made <U+FB02>at, so

that it should not slip-off the projection left by the gradual evapora
tion of the unsheltered surface.
   The string carrying the weight was put as close as possible to the
stirrup without risk of touching             and so that the central point of
                                             it,
the aperture came ‘somewhere between the two.
   Exp. 10.—The bar was taken from the same bath ice as in
the last experiment.      It was all one crystal with the axis vertical.
The <U+FB01>rst attempt was        a    failure, owing,   I   believe, to some snow
getting underneath the iron plate, and, by giving way gradually,
tilting up the plate.    I     had put a good deal of snow inside the
cigar box, with the hope of preventing evaporation.              This made the
readings erratic and unreliable, so the next day         I      turned the bar
over to give the stirrup     a    smooth surface toibear upon, and started
fresh.    The results are given in the table (p. 333).        I       think the
amount of depression may generally be           trusted  to Within 0'01 mm.
    Several interesting points are brought out in this table.             When
the weight  is  changed,   the alteration   in the  rate of  depression
                                                                      is  great
out of all proportion, e.g., the alteration from 00058 to 0410 when
the weight   is changed from 0'17/L to 147 per square cm.            During the
 course of the experiment there was a decided rise in plasticity;
 compare the earlier with the later rates under 1'47 per square cm.
at similar temperature.         This   is corroborated by the increase of
 speed  under  0'85 kilo.
    The only exception, viz., the decrease of speed at <U+FB01>rst under
 41''? kilos. was due,
                     I     believe, to the elastic strains which had been
 set up in the preliminary bending.        The effect of these elastic strains
is shown by the undoubted rise of the middle of the bar when the
 weight was removed at the end of the experiment.

1891.]             On the Plasticity      of an Ice Crystal.              335
   Into this matter   I  enter more fully below.
                                                           I
   The indicated rise between 12.59 and 2.3 P.M. is, feel sure, simply
due to a misreading. Whenever the weight was altered the appa
ratus was unavoidably disturbed, so I had to take an entirely fresh
reading of the pointer. Generally this only differed by fractions of a
millimetre from the previous reading, but in the case in point it was
nearly 6 mm. greater.        The ice showed an inconvenient tendency to
slip  backwards    on   the   iron plate, thus bringing the end of the
pointer forwards till it almost touched the edge of the slit. The ice
had to be pushed forwards three or four times during the experiment.
Of course a fresh reading was taken after each such displacement, so
that no error resulted.        This trouble was caused doubtless by the
plate not being accurately level.         In subsequent experiments    I  was
more successful in avoiding it.
   Exp. 11.—I desired to establish with the more delicate system
of measurement that the plasticity is inappreciable when the bending
stress is applied at right angles to the axis.           I out a bar, all one
crystal, from the bath ice, and planed it so that the upper and lower
surfaces were as accurately as possible parallel to the optic axis.        In
the polariscope, when the middle of the black cross was in the middle
of the bar, the two faces were equally inclined to the lines of sight.
I then set up the apparatus in the usual way.         The results are seen in
the annexed table (p. 334).
   It will be seen that thepointer indicated a rise of the stirrup
amounting in the 21% hours to 0'29 mm. As was before mentioned,
the stirrup was slightly roughed to prevent it from slipping, so at
<U+FB01>rst it would make contact with the bar at only a few points.
Evaporation would help to extend the contact to large surfaces, and
admit of a slight movement of the stirrup relatively to the ice.
Thus the experiment was not as satisfactory as could be wished.             It
is possible that a very slight depression of the bar might be masked
by this effect of evaporation.        But even supposing that the rate of
real depression was twice as great as that of the apparent elevation,
viz., O'OO4=3 mm. per hour, it would still be very small compared with
the rates of the next experiment.          I am at any rate entitled to say
that within the limits of error of experiment there is only one kind of
plasticity in an ice crystal, viz., that due to the sliding layers at right
angles to the optic axis.       It is probable that the same source of error
was active in other experiments, but in them the eifect would be
almost negligible.
   Exp. 12.—The same bar was turned on its side so that the optic
axis was vertical.

1891.]               On the Plasticity   of an Ice Crystal.               337
    We <U+FB01>rst notice that the plasticity exists down to —14°'4.          At this
temperature the bending was slow, but this was due in great part to
the fact that it came at the beginning, and the bar was as usual.         The
rapid growth of plasticity, independently of the temperature, is shown
by the rate of 0'59 mm. per hour at a mean temperature of —5°'6,
being raised in less than two hours to 1'18 mm. at —6°'1. The tend
 ency to recover when the weight is removed is shown three times over
in the table. As might be expected, it soon becomes very slow, and
in that case after twelve hours, when the recovery amounts to 0'72
mm., it has probably stopped altogether.           In the fall of rate from
 1'89 at --1°'7 to 118 at —6°‘1 and 0745 at —13°, in spite of the
natural tendency for the rate to rise, we seem to have a real effect of
temperature.      After 8.38, the cigar box had to be left open as the pointer
had almost reached the lid of the box, and so the subsequent tem
peratures are unreliable.       I imagine that the change from 0685 to
U'74=5  was  due  to a fall of temperature.
    At the beginning of Exp. 11 the bar measured 14 mm. by 123 mm.,
which was reduced at the end of Exp. 12 to 13 mm. by 108 mm.
The evaporation had been rather more rapid just at the bend of the
bar.    This was owing, I believe, to the circulation of air through the
hole by which the string passed out.
   I  measured the total depression on the trace as 26 mm.            As mea
sured by the pointer it is 2'45. The agreement is as good as could be
expected.
    Exp. 13.—In this experiment        I  used a thicker bar and tried a
variety   of  weights.   The   bar  was  only just small enough to go into
the stirrup.     (See Table IV, next page.)
   The stiifness of the bar in the <U+FB01>rst three hours is surprising.
   Exp. l4.——In all the experiments hitherto on bars composed of
single crystals it happened that the optic axis had been vertical when
the ice was formed, so that the planes of freezing coincided with the
sliding layers. 1 fully believed that this coincidence was merely acci
dental, and what happened in Exp. 8 had con<U+FB01>rmed this idea, but              I
thought it desirable to have a more direct proof.           So I  cut a piece
out of a good large crystal in the ice, found on the surface of the
water in the bucket, in which the optic axis was not vertical. When
the bar was put in position the planes of freezing were vertical and
parallel to the length, and the optic axis was normal to the length
and inclined at about 50° to the vertical.        The bar was about 8 mm.
square, and the distance between the supports was 51 mm.
   Under a weight of 062 kilo. in 41 hours 28 minutes at a mean tem
perature of —-4,°'41 (the maximum --1°'4) it bent downwards about
4 mm.      There was a large lateral bend, which made the vertical bend
very di<U+FB02>icult to measure.

freezing, this bar should not have bent at all. If, however, the sliding
layers are necessarily perpendicular to the optic axis, this bar should
have been free to bend on the plane of the optic axis, but not in the
perpendicular plane. In the experiment the plane of the total bend
contained the optic axis.     Thus the experiment was decisive.
    In attempting to discover the manner in which the rate of the
 molecules sliding over each other depends on the driving force, we
 are met by the di<U+FB01>iculty that the rate of depression depends on at least
 three other circumstances, the temperature, the previous history of
 the bar, and the irregularity of the stresses and strains within the bar.
 The second is to some extent avoided by only considering the rates
 observed immediately before and immediately after the change of
 weight. The third is probably not very important. In the following
 table are collected all the instances which occurred, with the attendant
 changes of temperature.      The changes of rate are not so great as the
 square, but  greater than  the  <U+FB01>rst power of the changes of the applied
 force. In the table may be seen the amount of correspondence with

explained by the great change of temperature.    Without elevating
the statement to the rank of a law, we may say that fairly close
agreement with the observed facts     obtained by supposing that when

 elastic bar, supported at either end and loaded in the middle, had
been fully worked out.      But this does not appear to be the case.
 The ordinary elementary treatment makes the gigantic assumption
that plane cross-sections of the unbent bar remain plane, and that the
lateral contraction or expansion of elementary strips parallel to the
  ength of the bar under longitudinal pulls or thrusts are the same as in
free space. It does not consider any shearing stresses or strains. It is
true that Rankine (‘Applied Mechanics,’ p. 338), assuming the
results of this method, proceeds to <U+FB01>nd an expression for the shearing
stress.   He makes it proportional to a.2 -0.3, where the origin is at
the centre of the bar, the axis of a: is drawn upwards, and 2a is
the depth of the bar.     But this expression is inconsistent with the
general equations of an elastic solid. St. Venant’s solution of the
                                                  ‘
bending of a bar, given in Thomson and Tait’s Natural Philosophy,’
postulates equal and opposite couples applied at the two ends, so that
the bending moment is uniform throughout.        The importance of the
absence of this uniformity is not tri<U+FB02>ing but fundamental, for in our
case everything depends on the shears, and in St. Venant's solution
there are no shears.
   I  fancy that I see my way to obtaining the complete solution in
the form of in<U+FB01>nite series. But, since it ceases to be applicable the
moment plastic strains take place, it would only enable us to deter
mine the initial stresses, and this would hardly justify the insertion
here of such a long investigation.
   The following simple but imperfect treatment must sui<U+FB01>ce.         Let
us <U+FB01>rst de<U+FB01>ne the coef<U+FB01>cient of plasticity. Take a rectangular element
with two faces normal to the optic axis, and let these faces be sub

suppose that the same amount of plastic shearing strain would take
place between the layers perpendicular to the optic axis at every cross
section.  This condition makes the bar bend sharply when the weight                                is
applied, and keeps the two halves straight. In the earlier experiments,
where the bending was considerable, this form was observed before its
cause had been perceived.        For this form to be assumed without
elastic strain, the plastic strain must be the same, not merely in corre
sponding points of different cross sections, but also throughout each
cross section itself, and, in fact, throughout the entire half of the bar.
But as we have seen, the shearing stress must vanish at both the
upper and lower surfaces.       Doubtless the truth     that the state of

assist any one in estimating, as far as can be done from my experi
ments, the rate of distortion of an ice crystal in any given case.
  In several cases in the experiments, after a heavy weight was
removed, a slight gradual nnbending of the bar took place.       At <U+FB01>rst
I thought this    mere consequence of the irregular elastic strains or.
                            a

rest.  But the magnitude of the recovery seems, on closer examination,

doubt that        a true molecular effect.
                      it   is
   In Exp. 12, after        stress of 1'69 kilos. per sq. cm. had been
                                     a
removed, the middle of the bar rose 00] 04 cm. in four hours. Accord
ing to an experiment by Moseley            Phil. Trans.,’ 1871), Young’s

                                is     per sq. cm.  Hence,     we neglect    if
the effect of the plastic strains in one bar of ice, the elastic depres
sion under 25 kilos. should have been O'OO138 cm., less than one
seventh of the recovery observed.        The permanent or plastic strains
in Moseley’s bar are considerable, so that the deduced value of
Young's modulus may be too great.           Bevan, also by <U+FB02>exure of bars

   1891.]    Temperature   and  the Refractive Index   of Liquids.      343
  of ice, found the value 60,000. Reusch (‘ Nature,’ vol. 21, p. 504),
  by experimenting on the sonorous vibrations of rectangular plates of
  ice, found Young’s modulus to be 23,632 kilos. per sq. cm. (this last
  method seems rather dangerous).       In attempting to devise an imagi
  nary systcm of strains su<U+FB02>iciently great to render such a recovery as
  0'1 cm. possible, we are soon brought up by the breaking tension of
  ice. Direct experiments by Moseley give this as 7 or 8 kilos. per
  sq. cm., and Kidd and myself found it in one case to be 8'3 kilos.
  per sq. cm., but the fact that the bar of ice in Exp. (11) bore the
  weight of 2'5 kilos. before any plastic strains had taken place brings
 it out greater than 15'5 kilos. per sq. cm., and the bar in Exp.
  was able to endure an even greater stress.
     A similar discrepancy has been noticed      in the  case  of cast iron
  (Rankine, ‘App. Mechanics,’ § 297).
     Using the latitude given by the uncertain values     of the constants
 to the utmost,   I  have not been able to devise any system of elastic
 strains which could possibly make the bar rise 0'01 cm., and there is
 no reason to suppose that the unknown system of strains actually
 occurring in the experiments would be exceptionally well adapted
 to such a purpose.    I conclude, then, that we have to deal with a real
 tendency of the forcibly displaced sliding layers to slide back.      The
 rate of recovery, rapid at <U+FB01>rst, soon falls off. Thus in Exp. (10)
 there was a recovery of 0046 mm. in the <U+FB01>rst 18 minutes, and only
 0021 in the next 58. In Exp. (15) after 0014 in the <U+FB01>rst 11 minutes,
 and the same in the next 31, the motion probably came to a standstill
 after a few hours, practically, if not absolutely.     Thus in Exp. (12)
 the bar was left with no weight on for 12 hours, and the recovery
 was only 0072 mm.

                      MaxWell’s electromagnetic theory of light, were near enough to
                      make      worth while to try whether the divergence from theory

                      the same specimens of the liquids as were used in the electrical
                      experiments.   In the case of olive oil, however, the original supply
        .             could not be found. The results obtained are very close to Messrs.
                      Dale and Gladstone’s for those of the liquids they had examined, and
                      for the others the optical effect shows a similar divergence from
                      Maxwell’s theoretical relation. And considering the enormous diffe
                      rencein the rapidity of the electrical and optical effects, this    not                                            is

      Coerulin as Sensitisers for Rays of Low Refrangibility.”
      By Gnonor. HIGGS. Communicated by Loan RAYLEIGH,
       Sec. R.S. Received February 19, 1891.
   The determination of the relative wave-lengths of the Fraunhofer
lines, by photographing all the orders of spectra given by any
particular grating, includes certain subjects which present more or
less difficulty, and that of selecting or producing a dye-bath adapted
to the requirements of the two or more orders comprising the subject
is intimately connected with that of the choice of absorbing media.
   Having been engaged for some time in investigations of this nature,
I  had occasion, during the summer of 1889, to require an impression
of the 2nd order, about X 3300, contiguous with that of the red end
of the 1st order, and <U+FB01>nding that the ordinate of an actinic curve for
a plate immersed in a very dilute alcoholic ammoniacal solution of
cyanin (1 : 30,000), reduced to about one-fourth of that for an unpre
pared plate,     I abandoned its use for this purpose.             The results
appeared to be unaffected by the addition of quinine.
   Subsequently, induline, coerulin, alizarin-blue, and the bisulphite
compounds of the two latter were used. When obtained in a state
of sufficient purity the alizarin-blue S leaves little or nothing to be
desired, for, whilst possessing, in a high degree, seusitising properties
for rays throughout the region comprised between X 6200 and 8000,
it does not, like cyanin, lower the scnsitiveness to the violet and
ultra-violet.
   The following is one of the processes           I  employed in the prepara
tion of the dye-stuff in a pure state :
   To a saturated solution of sodium bisulphite in a mortar is added
alizarin-blue paste.     This is disintegrated with a pestle, and poured
into a glass vessel capable of holding an additional quantity of sodium
bisulphite, in all 10 parts of the paste to 20 parts of bisulphite, and
another 10 parts of water. The vessel is well stoppered, set aside in
a cool place for <U+FB01>ve or six weeks, and shaken daily, but left undis
turbed during the last eight or ten days.
   The solution is decanted, <U+FB01>ltered, and treated with alcohol, to pre
cipitate the greater portion of the remaining sodium bisulphite.
50 parts of water are now added with a su<U+FB02>iciency of sodium chloride
to form a concentrated solution. Again set aside in an open-mouthed

glass  jar, covered with bibulous paper, for seven or eight days, a
deposition of the dye in a crystalline state, together with sulphite of
calcium, will take place, which latter, owing to its insolubility in
water, may be removed by <U+FB01>ltration.
   The alizarin-blue S is separated from any unaltered substance left
in the original stoppered vessel by solution, and added to the brine,
now puri<U+FB01>ed from lime salts, and once more set aside to crystallise,
the <U+FB01>nal puri<U+FB01>cation being effected in a beaker containing alcohol and
a small percentage of water to remove the last traces of sodium
chloride, collecting the crystals on a <U+FB01>lter-paper and drying at
 ordinary temperatures.
   The needle-shaped crystals are of a deep-red.     Dilute solutions are
of a pale sherry colour, changing, with the addition of a few drops of
ammonia, to a green, which immediately gives way to magenta and
every shade of purple, till oxidation is complete, when it assumes a
blue colour, the absorption spectrum of which is continuous and
strongest in the least refrangible end, presenting the appearance of
extending into the infra-red.
   Plates immersed in a solution containing 1 : 10,000 and 1 per cent.
of ammonia give the most perfect results the day after preparation,
but rapidly deteriorate unless kept quite dry.
   With a slit -<U+FB01>g inch in width, and an exposure of 40 minutes,
results have been obtained in the region of Great A of the 2nd order
which possess all the detail and de<U+FB01>nition usually so characteristic of
the violet end. Numerous lines are sharply depicted which were pre
viously not known to exist.    7t 8400 has been reached, giving almost
equal detail.*
   The process for the preparation of pure coerulin S is a slight
modi<U+FB01>cation of the preceding.      The results obtained, as well as the
actinic curve, are almost identical.     The pure substance is almost
white; dilute solutions pass rapidly from pale yellow to a bright
green; a trace of ammonia produces an olive-green.          In general a
solution of aurantia as an absorbent in quartz cell was used.
   For several samples of paste         I
                                      am indebted to the kindness of
Messrs. Schott, Segner, and Co., of Manchester,           agents to the
Badische Anilin- und Soda-Fabrik, Ludwigshafen, who hold the
patent rights for the manufacture of alizarin-blue S. It is hoped
this company may be induced to manufacture this substance free
from the minute crystallisable impurities which render it unsuitable
for use in investigations of such delicate nature.
  * P.S.—With      a low sun at times screens were found unnecessary.      Colonel    _
\Vaterhouse,   who has also employed alizarin-blue (‘Photographic News,’ Oct.   4-,
1889), states that Schiendl and Eder failed to recognise the sensitiveness of this
substance   to the red, and considers that red or yellow screens are required to
produce the full effect.

           previous paper published in the Philosophical Transactions
(1888, A, pp. 339——349), the e<U+FB01>ect of about 0'2 per cent. of im
purities on the mechanical properties of gold was examined, the
results of the experiments showing that metals which diminish its
tenacity and extensibility have high atomic volumes, while those
which increase these properties have either the same atomic volume
as gold or a lower one.           The behaviour of aluminium and of lithium
appeared to be somewhat exceptional.                 Gold contaminated with 0'2
per cent. of aluminium should, if the theory set forth in the paper
be correct, have a tensile strength of about 7 tons per square inch;
but it was found to be capable of sustaining a load of nearly 9 tons
per square inch without breaking.                 It became necessary, therefore,
to ascertain whether the cooling of a mass of gold containing alu
minium presents any peculiarities, more especially as Osmond’s*
 recent Work leads to the conclusion that a pure metal can exist in
 two distinct molecular forms, and that the passage of the ordinary
 modi<U+FB01>cation of a metal to the allotropic one may either be hastened
 or retarded by the presence of impurity.
     In order to continue the investigation, a trustworthy pyrometer
 was needed, and this has fortunately been provided by the thermo
 electric junction of platinum, and platinum with 10 per cent. of
 rhodium, the use of which was suggested by M. Le Chatelierxf It
 appears to be superior to any other of the thermo-junctions which
 have previously been used, and some experiments made in 1889
 satis<U+FB01>ed me that the appliance is an extremely delicate and useful
 one for temperatures           between 500° and 1100° C.                In a recent
 report    to   the   Institution   of   Mechanical    Engineers,    in which   details
 of the method of calibration are embodied, I have described a suitable
  arrangement for obtaining, by the aid of photography, autographic
 curves which represent the cooling or heating of masses of metal.
     It consists in enclosing a galvanometer of the Déprez and
  d’Arsonval type in a large camera; a <U+FB01>xed mirror, F, being placed
  below the movable mirror, M, of the galvanometer, so that the light
  from the lime cylinder, L, re<U+FB02>ected in the mirror H, passes to both

periodically by the vane, E, and a beaded datum line is given which
enables any irregularity in the advance of the plate to be detected.
     The amount of divergence from its datum line of the spot of light
re<U+FB02>ected by the movable mirror at any given moment bears a rela
tion (which can readily be found by calibration) to the temperature to
which the thermo-junction X is heated, and variations of tempera
 ture are recorded by a curve which is the resultant of the upward
 movement of the plate and the horizontal movement of the spot of
 light. The complete arrangement is shown in the diagram <U+FB01>g. 1.

     The thermo-junction X is inserted in a tubnlure, T, of a specially
 constructed crucible of plumbago, 0, which contains about 5 oz. of
 pure molten gold, and is allowed to cool down slowly inside a vessel,
 a, of silver 105 mm. diameter, and polished internally.     The cylinder,
  b, is of tin plate, polished internally and blackened outside.

      A  photographic record of the cooling of pure gold is represented
  by the thicker of the dotted lines in <U+FB01>g. 3.              The mass of gold had in
  this case an initial temperature of about 12-50° C., which fell to
  1045° C. when the mass began to solidify.                    The curve is approxi
  mately horizontal during solidi<U+FB01>cation, and throughout its entire
, course appears to be a perfectly normal curve of a cooling mass of
  metal, no points of exceptional absorption or evolution of heat, such
  as would occur in iron, being observable.
     A curve obtained in a similar way, and representing the cooling of
  gold with 0'5 per cent. of lead, is shown by the thin dotted line
  in the same <U+FB01>gure.         It is similar to the one representing the cooling
  of‘ pure gold, but it will be evident that the presence of lead lowers
  the freezing point of gold by an amount which is found by measure
  ment to be about 7°'5 C.
     A very different molecular condition is, however, established by the
  presence of aluminium.             With 0'47 per cent. of this element the
  true freezing point can be detected, but is nearly obliterated
  (<U+FB01>g. 3), and the mass does not become truly solid until the point
  marked a is reached when the temperature has fallen to 900° C.
     It is of interest to ascertain how far the lowering of the freezing
  point of gold is in accordance with the results of Raoult’s investiga
  tions on the lowering of the freezing point of solutions.                His generali
  sations have been tested in the case of solutions of metals in metals
  with low melting points (tin, lead, and bismuth), in an admirable
  series of experiments by Heycock and Neville.*                 In order to calculate
  the lowering of the freezing point of gold produced by one atom of
  the added element to 100 atoms of the solvent, which has been the
  usual method of stating such results, it is necessary to know the latent

                         because the accurate measurement of the latent and speci<U+FB01>c heats of
                         metals with high melting points, such as gold, presents many more

                         different temperatures, he was able to deduce the speci<U+FB01>c heat of
                         platinum at any point within the range, and he found that        regularly        it
                         increased with the temperature.        The data, thus a<U+FB02>brded, enabled

the amount of heat evolved          by the mass after it had become solid,
and deducting this amount from the total heat transferred to the
water by the melted platinum, he obtained the latent heat of fusion
of the metal.
   He also determined*       the speci<U+FB01>c heat and melting point (1045° C.)
in the case of gold, but he does not appear to have ascertained what
is the latent heat of fusion of the precious metal.               The following
experiments were therefore made, in order to afford a basis for cal
culating the theoretical lowering of the freezing point of gold which
a given    addition of impurity should produce.
   A calorimeter of polished silver, l0'5 cm. diameter, and 15'5 cm.
high, was supported upon three points of cork within a bright
metallic vessel, blackened externally, and constituting an air-jacket.
The amount of water employed varied from 800 to 1088 grams.
The stirrer was a thin sheet of mica, mounted upon a silver wire,
bent at its lower end into the form of a hoop; the mica also served
to catch the gold poured into the water.              In experiments E to I,
the stirring was effected by silver vanes, of a form suggested by
Professor Riicker, actuated by a small electromotor.               Quantities of
very pure gold, varying from 68 to 123 grams, were melted in a
small clay crucible and poured into the calorimeter.
   This portion of the manipulation was performed by my assistant,
Mr. Groves, whose long experience in melting gold enabled him to
select the latest moment before solidi<U+FB01>cation at which the gold could
be poured.       In Experiments A and B and E to I, the temperature of
the molten mass was measured, by the aid of the thermo-junction
previously described, which was placed directly in the molten gold,
up to the moment of pouring, and it is believed that the temperature
of the mass was known to within 10° C.
   At the end of each experiment, the gold poured into the calori
meter was carefully collected and weighed.             The thermometer used
was a very sensitive one with <U+FB01>xed zero, and made by Hicks, of
Hatton Garden; it could easily be read to 0°'O2 C. The depth
of water employed was sufficient to prevent the evolution of steam,
and none was observed to escape in any of the experiments recorded.
   The calculations are as follows :—

    Experiments are in progress with a view to ascertain whether the
mean specific heat of very pure gold is the same as that found by
Violle, for there is every reason to believe that the presence of im
purity has great in<U+FB02>uence upon this constant.                A few measure
ments already made would seem to indicate that his result is low,
and this is important, because a slight difference in the speci<U+FB01>c
heat will have a material eifect upon the latent heat of fusion, and con
sequently on the theoretical atomic fall in the freezing point produced
by aluminium.          In order to ascertain whether aluminium would
give   the  normal    lowering of the freezing point (10°'6 for each atom
 present in 100 atoms of gold) a crucible, <U+FB01>tted with a tubulnre, as

being recorded      in the usual way by a curve.             The gold was then
re-melted, and a weighed quantity of aluminium added, the mass being
stirred and the temperature of its freezing point measured and re
corded   in  a curve.
   The addition of 02 per cent. of aluminium produced an appreciable
fall in the freezing point, but this initial fall is only indicated by a
change in direction of the curve.           The fall as measured upon the
photographic plate is only 1 mm., which nevertheless corresponds to
a dilference of temperature of 7°'68 C.
   A further addition of 0'2 per cent. of aluminium (making 04 per
cent.) increased the fall to 1'8 mm., corresponding to 14i°'28 C. It
may be urged that these measurements are small, but the observa
tions were repeated with a scale some distance from the galvano
meter, and chronographic records gave results having the same
values.
   An experiment with gold in which 1 per cent. of aluminium was
present also con<U+FB01>rms this; the fall in temperature of the freezing
point was in this case 33°‘66 C., but there were indications that the
gold, the solvent, was becoming saturated.
   Now 0'2 per cent. of aluminium corresponds              to 2/10 X 196/27'5   =
1'42 atom per 100 atoms of gold.*
   Hence the fall per atom present           per hundred atoms of gold =
 7'68/1'42 = 5°44 C.
    Similarly,   a percentage     of 0'4 corresponds      to 4/10 x 196/27'5 =
2'85 atoms per hundred of gold, and the            fall  per atom = 14»‘28/2'85
= 5°'O C.
   With    1   per cent. of aluminium the total             fall will be due to
 7'16 atoms     per hundred of gold; hence the              atomic fall will be
 33136/7'16 = 4°‘? C.
    It may be added that experiments (as yet incomplete) seem to
 show that lead, bismuth, silicon, and platinum cause a much greater
 “ atomic fall ” in the freezing
                                     point of gold than aluminium does.
    The relations of aluminium to gold would, therefore, appear to be
 peculiar in more Ways than one. The curve (<U+FB01>g. 3) clearly indicates
 that aluminium has a remarkable influence on the cooling of a mass
 of gold, and in view of this it would seem strange that calculations
 based on the atomic weight of aluminium should show that it delays
 the initial solidi<U+FB01>cation of gold less than other elements.              The com
plete solidi<U+FB01>cation is, however, much retarded; for merely stirring a.
 mass of gold contaminated with very little aluminium reveals the
 fact that the added element has set up during the solidi<U+FB01>cation of the
 mass a “pasty stage” which continues through an unusually long
mange of temperature.
    In the metallurgy of iron, aluminium is known to play an im

 of the aluminium on iron in the “ mitis castings              has given rise to
 wide divergence of opinion, but the view that it acts by the removal
 of oxide, or of occluded oxygen, has gained much favour. In the case
 of gold, which has neither occluded oxygen nor oxide to lose, the
 castings of the metal with 0'2 per cent. of aluminium are also remark
 ably sound, and, as experiments prove, very tenacious ; the action of
 the aluminium is, therefore, probably a molecular one of much com
 plexity.
    It may be pointed out that the presence in gold of quantities of
 silver which vary from ()‘1 to ‘4'O per cent. does not lower the freezing
 point of the mass. Messrs. Heycock and Neville, who witnessed
 certain of the experiments above described, inform me of the hitherto
 unpublished fact, observed by them, that the presence of thallium
 does not lower the freezing point of lead“
     The close concordance in both these cases between the atomic
 volumes of the mass of metal and the added impurity is of special
 interest in connexion with the generalisation given in my earlier
 paper and re-stated on‘ the <U+FB01>rst page of this.           Silver has the same
 atomic volume as gold,     and if present   in  small   quantity, produces no
 e<U+FB02>'ect on either its tenacity or its freezing point.
     Throughout these experiments gold has simply been employed for
 the sake of its freedom from liability to oxidation, but other metals
 must be studied, and it is worthy of record that Had<U+FB01>eld has recently
  shown that the parts played by aluminium and by silicon in steel are
 almost identical. Most of the physical properties of aluminium and
 silicon, in a free state, are totally different, but they possess the same
 atomic volume, and when they are alloyed with iron they aifect it in
 precisely the same way.
    I  have to express my thanks to my assistant, Mr. H. C. Jenkins,
 for his aid in conducting these experiments.
     [April 20, 1891.—In the course of the investigation, it became
 evident that, as is the case when aluminium is alloyed with copper or
 iron, the addition of aluminium to gold is attended with evolution of
 heat.    The following experiment was therefore arranged, with a
 view to obtain evidence on this point :—
    A mass of 30 grams of gold, contained in an unglazed porcelain
crucible, was placed in the centre of a block of <U+FB01>rebrick and strongly
heated up to well above the melting point of the metal. The thermo
junction was inserted directly in the gold, and the spot of light from
 the galvanometer allowed to fall in the usual way on to the sensitised
 plate (<U+FB01>g. 1). A piece of cold aluminium‘. equal in weight to 1 per
 cent. of the mass of gold, was then added and rapidly stirred.             The

                      § 1. Preliminary Historical Sketch.
   That in the females of several Selachioids and Batoids the mucous
membrane of the terminal portion of the oviduct, or uterus, is pro
vided with glandular structures which secrete an albuminous <U+FB02>uid
destined in some way or other for the nourishment of the developing
embryo is a bionomic phenomenon which has attracted the attention
of numerous physiologists and histologists, though, as far as we are
aware, it has never been fully followed out.
   Concerning the intra-uterine arrangements for the protection and
nutrition of the egg or embryo among Selachians, Gegenbaur
(‘ Grundziige der Vergleich. Anat.,’ p. 875) writes :—“ The terminal
division of the oviduct of the Selachians, which has already been
mentioned as functioning as uterus, also di<U+FB01>ers from the rest of the
   VOL. xmx.                                                              2 B

360           Prof. Wood-Mason and      M1". Alcock.     On the    [Main 19,
oviduct in the nature of the mucous membrane.           In many it is raised
into   villi.   Glands are much   developed.    The relation of this division
of the oviduct to the egg or to the embryo that originates therefrom
is a tolerably various one. Least intimate is it in the oviparous
 Selachii (Raj a and Scyllium) : only furnishing the egg-case.              In
others (Spinaw, Acanthias, Scymnus), a shell is also developed, but
only for a short time, and the embryo afterwards lies free in the
uterus. Here come those Selachians in which there is no longer any
shell at all developed, and from this circumstance results the nutritive
connexion of the fcntus with the uterine wall by the intermediation
of the yolk-sac.”
   This passage, although it clearly de<U+FB01>nes the well-known functions
of the Selachian uterine mucosa, on the one hand of secreting an
egg-case, and on the other hand of forming a vascular nutritive con
nexion with the modi<U+FB01>ed yolk-sac of the embryo, makes only a vague
allusion to another modi<U+FB01>cation of function: namely, the secretion
by special uterine glands of a nutritive <U+FB02>uid which might be absorbed
or ingested by the developing embryo.
   Leydig also (‘ Handbuch der Histologie,’ Ed. 1857, p. 517)
describes the vascular uterine villi of Accmthias, Spinaw, Scymnus,
and Trygon, though without discussing their relation to the egg or
to the embryo.       He says :—“ In the Selachians the mucous membrane
(of the uterus) either appears smooth and possessing only zig--zag
longitudinal folds (Scyllium, for example), or it bears much-developed
villi (Acanthias culgaris, Spinaw niger, Scymnus Zichia, Trygonpastinaoa).
These villi are placed sometimes (Acanthias vulgaris, Scymnus lichia)
in very regular longitudinal rows which cease towards the end of the
uterus,     and pass into leaf-like longitudinal folds; or, as in Trygon
pastinaca, they are so crowded together that nothing more of the rest
of the mucous membrane of the uterus appears. The villi possess an
exceedingly rich vascular supply: there are to be distinguished in
them at most two stronger vessels which interlace and run into one
another at the end of the villus, and between the two a close-meshed
vascular network.        These vessels are in the gravid uterus          dis
tinguished by proportionately very
                   a                      thick  circular  muscular layer.”
There are <U+FB01>gures (p. 318, Ed. 1857) of “ the uterus of Try/gen, opened,
in order to show the villi”; and of “ a bit of the uterine mucosa of
Spinaw, somewhat more than the natural size,” showing the much
developed villi, which are represented as two- to three-branched.
   The great comparative anatomist Johannes Miiller, in his exhaus
tive paper : “ Ueber den glatten Hai des Aristoteles ” (‘ Abhand. Ak.
Wiss. Berlin,’ 1840, p. 188), reviews more completely the state of
knowledge up to that date of the Selachian uterine structures which,
quite apart from the secretion of egg-coverings or the formation of
yolk-sac placentzs, are concerned in the elaboration of secretions

  1891.]    Uterine Villzform Papilloe   of Pteroplataea micrura.        361
  which are to be considered either as providing nourishment for the
  growing embryo after the nutritive yolk of the egg has been absorbed,
  or as maintaining and increasing the nutritive material of the yolk.
     Of Spinaw niger he says (loo. cit., p. 236) :—“The fcntus in the
  uterus is distinguished by possessing no trace of an egg-shell, and by
  the inner membrane of the uterus being beset by very long (six to
 eight lines long) <U+FB01>liform villi.”
     More particularly of the genus Torpedo he writes (loo. cit., p. 239) :—
  “The eggs possess no trace of shell membrane; they are only sur
  rounded by an albuminous uterine <U+FB02>uid, as already Redi, Stenonis,
  Lorenzini, and in more recent times J. Davy, observed.            Cavolini
 states that the yolk sticks to the walls of the uterus, and that
 this is e<U+FB01>ected by an innumerable crowd of red uterine glands
  lying on the yolk. By this are clearly meant the papilliform villi on
 the uterus of Torpedo oculata. ,- but the yolk-sac in no way adheres to
  the uterus, as the observations of J. Davy show, observations with
               I
  which what myself have seen in the gravid uterus sent by Dr. Peters
  accords.   The yolk-sac of the Torpedos is perfectly smooth.         I can
  con<U+FB01>rm the extraordinary di<U+FB01>erence observed by T. Davy in the
 structure of the mucous membrane of the uterus, which in Torpedo
  oculata is furnished with villi, in Torpedo marmomta with parallel
  longitudinal folds.” Johannes Miiller also quotes Davy’s observations
 on the increase in weight, from the undi<U+FB01>erentiated egg-stage to the
  completed fcetal stage, in Torpedo, notwithstanding the disappear
 ance of the external yolk and the absence of any vascular maternal
 connexion.
     Of the Spinacoid Shark Scymnus lichia he observes (loo. oit.,
 p. 237) :—“ In the fresh uterus, the foetus and yolk-sac are sur
  rounded by a white-of-egg-like <U+FB02>uid. Also in this Shark no trace of
 an egg-shell membrane is met with.         The foetus with its enormous
 yolk-sac is immediately surrounded by the uterus.        The whole oval
yolk-sac is, in the younger and middle stages of development, 4 inches
 long and 2 inches thick.       The inner membrane of the uterus is
 furnished with cylindrical villi six lines in length.”
     John Davy (‘ Phil. Trans.,’ 1834, pp. 531-—54.~O), in the research
 on the embryology of Torpedo, referred to by Johannes Miiller,
describes the mucosa of the gravid uterus of this Batoid, and
specially dwells upon the absence of any vascular connexion between
the embryo and the mother.
    He states that, in several series of observations, while the average
weight of undi<U+FB01>erentiated eggs was 182 grains, and the average
weight of eggs in which the embryo had appeared was 177 grains, the
                                     ”
average weight of “ripe fmtuses        was 479 grains; and he asks how,
in the absence of any sort of structural connexion between the foetus
and the mother, this remarkable increase of weight is to be explained.
                                                             2   B  2

362         Prof. Wood-Mason and Mr. Alcock.            On  the  [M8.1‘. 19,
He observed that there was to he found in the uterine cavity “ a
little <U+FB02>uid, generally milky, more rarely glairy, and sometimes bloody,
which, on evaporation, yielded crystals of common salt, and a very
little animal matter composed chie<U+FB02>y of albumen ;” and he speculated
on the possibility of this uterine secretion being nutritive.            He
negatived, however, the supposition that the embryo in utero could
take in food by the mouth, and inclined, <U+FB01>nally, to the opinion that
the embryo increases by absorption,           partly through the general
surface of the body and partly through the branchial <U+FB01>laments.
    Sir Everard Home (‘ Phil. Trans,’ 1810, p. 208), in a paper on the
“ Mode of Breeding of the Oviviviparous Shark,” which is
                                                                 quoted by
J oh.  Miiller,  described   the  naked-eye anatomy     of  the oviduct   of
Acanthias oulgaris, the jelly and which <U+FB01>lls that part of its cavity
and which functions as a uterus in this Selachian. He states that when
the young one is completely formed the yolk remains attached to the
belly by a long cord of blood-vessels, and that the young one in this
state “ swims” in the uterine jelly.      The jelly he regards as a secre
tion of the oviduct.
    Home further quotes the observation of Dr. Patrick Russell, that a
Shark caught in lat. 70° N. had the oviducts distended with young
ones, each with the yolk-sac attached ; the young ones swimming in
    “
a     white gelatinous liquid, thicker than the liquor amnios of Quad
rupeds.” Home supposed that the function of the jelly was to aerate         '
the foetal blood.
    To sum up, we <U+FB01>nd that in Spinaa: niger, Soymnus Zichia, Acanthias
vulga<U+FB01>s, Trygon pastinaca, Torpedo ooulata (and also in Mg/liobatis
noctula and Gentrina saloiani, according to Trois, in a paper in the
‘
  Atti del Istituto Veneto,’ vol. 2, which we have unfortunately been
unable to obtain), special glandular villi have been observed on the
uterine mucosa, which villi have in some cases been supposed to bear,
either to the egg or to the developing embryo, some relation of
support or nutrition other than that of furnishing an egg-case, or of
assisting in the formation of a vascular connexion (yolk-sac placenta)
between the embryo and the mother.
    In Scymnus Zichia, on the one hand,    it seems certain, from Miiller’s
researches, that the   villi secrete a <U+FB02>uid which nourishes the embryo
through the medium of the yolk-sac; while in Torpedo, on the other
hand, it is certain that, at least in the later stages, the secretion
reaches the embryo in some less indirect manner, and the question
has actually been asked whether it is ingested by the embryo.
    In corroborating the opinion as to the function of the villi of the
Selachian uterine mucosa, we are able to bring evidence of a case in
which the nutritive secretion is actually conveyed into the pharynx
of the embryo.
   Following on this, and because the term “villus,” in its connexions

1891.]      Uterine   Villiform Papilloe of Pteroplataea micrura.          363
with mammalian        physiology, has come to connote a structure which
essentially absorbs nutriment, we propose to term the villiform struc
iures of the uterine mucous membrane in Selachians, which essen
tially secrete nutrimeut, trophonemata; and by this name they will
be referred    to in the descriptive   portion of this paper.
   § 2. Recent Observations     on. the Uterine Villi of some  Indian Rays.
   In        Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal,’ vol.       59, Part II,
           ‘
       the
p. 51, the second-named        contributor of this paper described some
observations on the uteri and the gestation of Trygon bleekeri and
Myliobatis nieuho<U+FB01>i, which it is necessary here to brie<U+FB02>y recapitulate.
   In a large female of Trygon bleekeri, taken on the 15th December,
1888, in the Mahanaddi estuary, the distal end of the right oviduct
was found to be enormously dilated, and to contain in its cavity a
fully-developed male foetus with a. disk 11% inches long and 10%
inches bread.      The folded foetus lay free in the uterine cavity, quite
destitute    of membranous covering, without any structural con
nexion with the mother, and without any vestige of external yolk
sac.    The uterine mucous membrane, which was a vivid vascular
scarlet, such as in Fishes is usually seen in the gill-laminae only, was
covered with an. abundant highly-albuminous <U+FB02>uid, secreted by a
crowded layer of glandular <U+FB01>lamentous villi which formed the inner
coat; and it was inferred that this secretion was a uterine milk
elaborated for the nourishment of the embryo. In the absence of any
special absorbent organs, and because the embryo was so folded that
any supposed “absorbent; function” of the skin would have been as
                                                                              ”
much as possible limited, it was further inferred that the “milk
was taken in by the embryo by the mouth; though unfortunately
the foetal stomach was not examined until post-mortem changes were
advanced.       It may be mentioned that the foetus did not possess
branchial <U+FB01>laments.
   Again, in Myliobatis nieuho<U+FB01>i, the structure of the uterine glands has
been made out, but we have had no opportunity of ascertaining their
relation to the egg or to the embryo.         In an adult female, taken off
the Godavari Delta on the 31st March, 1889, the left ovary was found
to be full of enlarged ova, while the distal end of the oviduct formed
a globular swelling with thick, muscular walls, and a mucous mem
brane thickly beset with long foliaceous villi. The entire surface of
the mucous membrane, both villons and inter-villous, was found to
consist of a close-set aggregation of tubular glands, most of which
were simple follicles resembling the Lieberkiihnian follicles of human
anatomy, though at the periphery of a villus they are commonly
racemose.
   We have now,        in the    case   of Pteroplataza,  micrura,  discovered

364         Prof. Wood-Mason and Mr. Alcock.           On  the  [Main 19,
another instance of a Batoid which develops a naked embryo in an
uterus with a mucous membrane of a complex structure; and while
the histological characters of portions of the uterine mucosa are those
of a secretory gland, the disposition of these glandular portions is
such as to leave no doubt that the greater part of their secretion is
poured into the pharynx of the embryo as it lies in the uterus.
§ 3. The Uterus and Embryo of Pteroplataaa micrura; and the Relation
     of the Uterine Villiform Papillae (Trophonemata) to the Embryo.
    In December, 1889, the detached pregnant uterus, with part of one
oviduct and kidney, of a Ray which had been captured in the estuary
of the Hooghly was sent to the Indian Museum by Mr. A. J. Miluer,
of the Bengal Pilot Service.
    The embryo, after removal, was identi<U+FB01>ed as Pteroplatcea micrum
(Bl. Schn.). The measurements of its disk arc, length 3'4 inches,
breadth 6'5 inches; its caudal spine is not yet developed, and the
nasal valves are still separate; its liver is of very large relative size,
and the intestine is greatly distended with grumous bile-stained
material.
    The gravid uterus forms a symmetrical ovoid swelling; dorsally
its wall is almost membranous, ventrally it is still thin; laterally, and
especially antero-laterally, it is thick and muscular.
    Internally, it is lined with mucous membrane, which, dorsally and
postero-laterally, is quite smooth.
    On the ventral aspect, however, the mucous membrane begins to
be extended in the form of short, compressed papillae, and these,
anteriorly and laterally, grow by degrees longer and more numerous,
until, at a point in the antero-lateral part of the uterus which
coincides with the position of the spiracle of the embryo in situ, they
form on each side a large bunch of long-compressed villiform tro
phonemata, the histological structure of which will be presently
described.
    On opening     the pregnant uterus by a dorsal longitudinal incision,
the naked embryo is found lying prone, head forwards, and tightly
 rolled in a right-to-left spiral. Although the embryo is in uniform
 close contact with the uterine walls, there is no sort of structural
 connexion    between    it and the mother, and no trace of any such pre
 vious connexion: nor can any vestige of external         yolk-sac be ob
 served.    But by the rolling up of the embryo the spiracles, which are
large patent cavities communicating freely with each other and with
the pharynx, and smooth-walled, except for a very faint pectination
anteriorly, come to have a lateral position, and deep into them passes,
on each side, the lateral bunch of long trophonemata above men
tioned, in such a way that the secretion of these richly-glandular

1891.]      Uterine Villzform Papillaa of Pteroplataea micrura.     365
trophonemata can only pass down the pharynx of the embryo.          The
only other external communications of the pharynx, namely, the
mouth and gill-clefts, are <U+FB01>rmly closed, the opposite margins of the
external gill-clefts being in the most complete apposition.   There are,
consequently, no branchial <U+FB01>laments.
    The trophonemata are narrow, strap-shaped processes of the uterine
mucosa which widen very slightly and gradually from their base to
about the middle of their length, whence they taper still more gradu
ally to their rounded apex. Those which enter the pharyngeal cavity
of the foetus are the longest of all, measuring from 18 to 20 mm. in
length and about 1'4 mm. in extreme breadth.      Save for the presence
of a blunt thickening that traverses them in a somewhat sinuous
course from base nearly to apex, tapering and branching as it goes,
and standing out in fairly bold relief from both their surfaces, they
appear quite <U+FB02>at.
    Stained in borax-carmine, mounted in spirit, and viewed under a
low power by re<U+FB02>ected light, they present a minute, honey-combed
appearance of their surfaces due to the presence of innumerable
small depressions.     From the appressed conjunction of ridges which
bound these, a slightly elevated polygonal network results.
    Transverse sections of a trophonema shew that ,these depressions
are the funnel-shaped mouths, narrowing below into the lumina, of
small, short, bulb-shaped glands of the same simple tubular type as
is seen, for example, in the crypts of Lieberkiibn, or, better still, in
the gastric glands of authropotomy.
    The glands are arranged perpendicular to the surface, side by side,
in the substance of the mucosa—into which they are, in fact, so many
involutions of the investing epithelium——so that the bases of those of
opposite sides are separated from one another only by blood vessels
and a very meagre, if any, connective tissue.
    Vertical sections of a trophonema in planes parallel to its surface,
or, in other words, transverse sections of groups of glands, shew that
these are so closely packed as to be polyhedral by appression.
    For a certain distance from the base of the trophonemata the de
pressions are small and simple, but they soon become larger and
compound, each being then the common mouth or short duct of a
little group of glands, just as in the human stomach, where one
meets with simple glands, each with its independent opening, and
with groups of glands opening into a common depression of the
mucous surface.
    The larger (secondary) depressions, it is obvious from an attentive
study of the surfaces of several trophonemata, as well as from trans
verse sections, have resulted from the further depression of the smaller
(primary) depressions in groups; and the raised margins of the
former result from the coalescence of those portions of the margins

  366        Prof. VVo0d-Mason and Mr. Alcock.            On the    [Man 19,
  of the latter which are not involved in the general secondary de
  pression.
     The epithelium is very thick in the bulbous basal portion of the
 glands: here its constituent cells are very long, taper from basement
  membrane to lumen, and are arranged round an axial cell in the form
 of   a cone, of  which the outer cells do not extend far up the sides of
  the gland.     Above this the cells become gradually shorter and less
 oblique, until at or near the month they pass into an ordinary
 columnar epithelium resting perpendicularly on the basal membrane.
     The nucleus of the cells is oval, and stains very strongly.        It lies
 excentrically   near the base  of the cell, which stains  only less strongly
 than the nucleus itself, so as to form a sharply-de<U+FB01>ned, coloured basal
  stratum, in which the nuclei are included, throughout the gland.
 This deeply-stained band is most conspicuous in the basal cells, which
 are arranged in the form of a cone, and perhaps constitute the chief,
 if not the only, seat of active secretion.
     Not a single cell in any of the sections has been observed to have
 undergone mucoid degeneration; but many have been noticed to
 contain    minute globules, probably of secretion, not only in the
 coloured basal portion, but also in the clear and unstained outer part
 of their protoplasm.
     The sections shew coagulated secretion in the mouths and lumina
 of many of the glands. The glands measure 0'06 to 0'08 in length
 by 0041 to 0'07 in breadth. In a trophouema, 12 mm. long by 1'4 mm.
 in uniform width throughout, taking 005 mm. as the average diameter
 of the glands, We have calculated that no less than 21,280 glands are
 present-—a result which is probably not far from the mark either way.
 The trophonemata are exceedingly vascular. Two vessels are present
in all : an artery, which runs in the substance of one of their margins,
and a vein, which takes a sinuous course not quite along the middle,
but nearer to the opposite margin, giving 011 in its course two or
three short branches which may or may not anastomose with the
main stem.       Both vessels taper towards the apex, near to which they
 are resolved into a capillary plexus, or rather into a system of narrow
sinuous cavities which establishes a communication between the two
sets of vessels.     The wall of these cavities is formed of a delicate,
nucleated membrane answering to, and appearing in some part of
almost every section to be in actual continuity with, the endothelial
                                                                                '
lining and subjacent intima of the vein, into which some of the
sinuses can actually be observed to open occasionally.
    The vein is much larger than the artery: its calibre in that part
of its course across which the section has been taken being no
less than <U+FB01>ve times as great.       The artery is strongly contracted and
empty: the vein, on the other hand, is fully dilated and <U+FB01>lled with
coagulated blood, even to its lateral branches and the larger of its

 1891.]     Uterine Villiform Papillce   of Pteroplateea micrura.       367
affluent sinuses.     Hence in lightly-stained trophonemata, examined
entire under a lower power, the artery is only just visible by trans
parence, while the vein presents itself as a very distinct, branched,
and tapering dark streak.
    The connecting system of sinuses occupies the plane between the
layer of glands of opposite sides, sending off processes around the
base or specially secreting portion of every gland.
    The glandular epithelium possesses no connective tissue framework
beyond a <U+FB01>lmy nucleated gauze, shreds of which can be traced wher
ever vacuities occur between the bases of adjoining glands, the
whole trophonema consisting, as has already been stated, almost
entirely of epithelium and blood vessels.
    Having already stated our conclusion as to the function of the
 trophonemata in Trygon and Pteroplatwa, and having described the
path taken by the secretion in the latter, it only remains to consider
brie<U+FB02>y how far other views of the manner of absorption by the
embryo of the nutrient uterine milk might apply in the case of these
 two <U+FB01>shes. Whatever may be the case in the earlier stages, in the
later stages, at any rate, branchial <U+FB01>laments do not absorb nutriment
from the maternal wall, for branchial <U+FB01>laments do not then exist.
    Again, absorption through the general surface of the body of the
embryo can hardly be looked upon as the principal channel of supply,
because the embryo, at least in its later stages, is so folded or rolled
up as to leave as little extent of surface as possible available for
absorption.
    [P.S., April  8, 189l.—Since the above was written and despatched,
we have had the good fortune to obtain from amongst the contents of
the <U+FB01>shermen’s       nets at Cocauada      several pregnant females of
Pteroplatwa rnicrura.      The examination of these specimens in the
fresh state, while it con<U+FB01>rms our description in its principal particu

sides; each uterus may contain from one to three young ones.          Again,
where two and three young ones exist, the trophonemata (which
appear to be fairly well developed over the entire mucosa of the
uterus) are specially long opposite to the spiracles of the young one,
into which they pass.    Apparentlg/—-and this will be our second quali
<U+FB01>cation——in    the early stages of gestation the trqahonemata are egually
well developed over the entire surface of the uterine mucosa, but by the
pressure exerted by the growing embryo they become greatly atrqohied,
ercoept on those spots where they can pass into the spiracles of the embryo,
and here, perhaps by compensation, they become hypertrophied]

II. “A     New Test for Albumin and other Proteids.” By JOHN
      A. l\iACWILLIAM. M.D., Professor of the Institutes of
      Medicine in the University of Aberdeen.‘ Communicated by
      Sir WM. ROBERTS, F.R.S. Received March 5, 1891.
    Salicyl-sulphonic acid is a remarkably powerful precipitant of pro
teid substances ; it is an extremely delicate reagent for the detection
of proteids in solution; it acts upon all the classes of proteid bodies.
   I   shall state the results   I  have obtained with this reagent under
two heads :—
     I. Its  action on the various classes of proteids.
    II.  lts use as a test for the presence of proteids        in urine.
     I. The Action of Salicyl-sulphonic Acid on the various Classes of
                                     Proteids.
    In order   to obtain the full e<U+FB01>ect of this reagent, it should be used
in saturated watery solution, and a drop or two of this solution should
be added to a     small amount (e.g.,     1  or 2 c.c.) of the  <U+FB02>uid to be tested,
 and the test-tube should       be shaken      so as to  mix its contents well.
When any considerable amount of proteid is present, a copious white
precipitate at once results; with only minute amounts of proteid a
cloudiness or opalescence of the <U+FB02>uid is what occurs.                 This cloudi
ness or opalescence is uniformly diifused over the <U+FB02>uid.                     When
dealing    with  traces of  proteids   it  is  well to  use  a  control   tube con
taining some of the <U+FB02>uid to be tested, and if dilution has been per
formed, another control tube with some of the water (or other liquid)
 used for dilution along with one or two drops of the salicyl-sulphonic
 acid.    The observer then holds the three tubes between him and the
light, and looks through them at a dark ground.               It is only, however,
when dealing with very slight traces of proteids that these precautions
are at all necessary.
                              A. Native Album/ins.
    (a.) Egg Albumin.-—Upon this proteid salicyl-sulphonic acid acts
with much precision. When a solution is obtained by diluting white
 of egg with water in the proportion of 1 part white of egg in 20 parts
 of the mixture, the addition of the reagent causes a dense white pre
 cipitate to be at once formed.         On boiling, the precipitate becomes
markedly <U+FB02>occulent. (The solution of white of egg of course contains
 globulin, but when this is removed by saturation with magnesium
 sulphate the albuminous <U+FB01>ltrate gives the same reaction with salicyl
 sulphonic acid as the original <U+FB02>uid.)

1891.]       A  New Test   for Albumin    and other  P1-oteids.         369
   When a similar solution is made with white of egg and the proteid
removed by thorough saturation with ammonium sulphate (after slight
acidulation) and <U+FB01>ltration, the proteid-free <U+FB01>ltrate gives no precipitate
with salicyl-sulphonic acid.     But if some of the precipitate thrown
down    by the    ammonium     sulphate, after being washed with a
saturated solution of the salt, be redissolved in water, the solution
of proteid so made gives a copious precipitate when tested as before.
(When considerable amounts of ammonium or magnesium sulphate
are present, a few crystals may form and sink to the bottom of the
tube, apart from the presence of any albumin.         This, however, does
not at all interfere with the working of the test, as such crystals,
<U+FB02>oating in the <U+FB02>uid at <U+FB01>rst and then sinking to the bottom, bear no
resemblance to the uniform turbidity or opalescence dependent on the
presence of albumin.      These salts are easily removed by dialysis.)
   Similarly,  when   the white of egg solution is treated with a large
excess of absolute alcohol (after slight acidulation with acetic acid),
so as to precipitate all the proteids, and is then <U+FB01>ltered, the <U+FB01>ltrate
shows no precipitate when tested with salicyl-sulphonic acid; re
moval of the alcohol from the <U+FB01>ltrate does not in<U+FB02>uence the result.
 On the other hand, the alcoholic precipitate, when (after being washed
with absolute alcohol) it is redissolved in water and tested, gives
a striking reaction: a large amount of proteid is at once thrown
 down.
   With very dilute solutions made with white of egg,           I have com
 pared the delicacy of the action of salicyl-sulphonic acid as a test for
 proteids with a number of other reagents more or less commonly
 employed, and   I  have found the former to be by far the most delicate
and precise of all.
   The white of egg solution was successively diluted to various
 degrees—1 part of the white of egg solution (1 in 20) in 100, 200,
 300, 400, 600, 620, 900, and 1000 parts of water or of 2 per cent. sodic
 chloride solution.
   With the <U+FB01>rst degree of dilution (1 part of the 1 in 20 white of
 egg solution in 100 parts of water or salt solution) the following re
 sults were obtained :
     Boiling after faint acidulation with acetic acid = no reaction.
     Xantho-proteic test = slight reaction.
     The cold nitric acid test (Heller's) = slight reaction.
     Mercuro-potassic iodide = haziness of the <U+FB02>uid.
     Salicyl-sulphonic acid = marked cloudiness.
   With the second degree of dilution (1 part of the White of egg
 solution in 200 parts of water) :—
     Boiling after faint acidulation with acetic acid = no reaction.
     Xantho-proteic test = no reaction.

370                      Prof.  J. A. MacWilliam.                 [Main 19,
     Mercuro-potassic iodide = doubtful haze.
     Salicyl-sulphonic acid = marked cloudiness.
   “Then the white of egg solution is diluted 400 times :—
     Acidulation with acetic acid and heat = no reaction.
     Xantho-proteic test = no reaction.
     Heller-’s test = no reaction.
     Mercuro-potassic iodide = no reaction.
     Salicyl-sulphonic acid = distinct cloudiness.
   When the degree of dilution is increased to 600 or 620 times, there
is still a distinct reaction with salicyl-sulphonic acid when the test
tube is compared with control tubes containing—(a)               the dilute
solution alone, and (b) water with salicyl-sulphonic acid.
   And even with still higher grades of dilution (900 and 1000 times)
there is still an appreciable e<U+FB01>ect recognisable a little time after the
addition of the reagent.
   The amount of proteid present in those dilute solutions is exceed
ingly small.
   Taking the percentage of proteid (albumin and globulin) in white
of egg as 12'2, the strength of the original white of egg solution
(1 in 20) would be less than 1 in 160.                               _
   WVhen this solution is diluted 400 times, the proportion of proteid
is less than 1 in 64,000; when diluted 620 times, about 1 in 100,000;
and when diluted 1000 times, proteid is present only in the very
minute amount of 1 in 160,000.
   (1).) Serum AlImmin.——Solutions      containing serum albumin were
obtained by saturating serum with magnesium sulphate and then
<U+FB01>ltering so as to remove the globulin; the <U+FB01>ltrate contained the
serum albumin. This <U+FB02>uid, when tested with salicyl-sulphonic acid,
gave an abundant precipitate.
   Again, when the serum is deprived of all its proteids by complete
saturation with ammonium sulphate and subsequent <U+FB01>ltration, it then
fails to give the slightest sign of precipitation on the addition of
salicyl-snlphonic acid. On the other hand, the proteid precipitate
thrown down by ammonium sulphate, when redissolved in water,
gives a dense precipitate with salicyl-sulphonic acid.
   Similarly, when serum is deprived of its proteids by means of
alcohol, the remaining constituents are entirely unable to give the
characteristic reaction with salicyl-sulphonic acid.
   The delicacy of the action of salicyl-sulphonic acid as a test for
minute amounts of the serum proteids is very striking, just as in the
case of the egg proteids.
   The following reactions   will serve as an illustration of this :—
   Some ox serum was diluted with £2 per cent. of salt solution to
the extent of 1 part of serum in 1000 parts.

    With this dilute <U+FB02>uid various tests were tried              :
     Salicyl-sulphonic acid = marked opalescence at once.
     Boiling after faint acidulation with acetic acid = no reaction.
     Heller’s test = no reaction at once. Distinct <U+FB01>lm at junction of
       the two <U+FB02>uids in a few minutes.
     Xantho-proteic test = no appreciable results.
     Mercnro-potassic iodide = marked cloudiness.
     Saturated salt solution with hydrochloric acid (Roberts’ test) =
       marked cloudiness.
    Serum diluted to   1   in 10,000   :
     Salicyl-sulphonic acid = distinct cloudiness   (especially after
       §—1 minute), recognisable on comparison with the control tubes
       in a suitable light.
     Boiling after faint acidulation = no reaction.
     Xantho-proteic test = no reaction.
     Mercuro-potassic iodide = no reaction.
     Roberts’ test = no reaction.
     Copper sulphate and caustic potash (Piotrowski’s) = no reaction.
     Heller’s test = no reaction at the time nor twenty minutes after
       wards.
   The amount of proteid present in these dilute solutions  approxi              is,
mately,  as follows :—
   Taking the percentage of total proteids in ox serum as 7'5,* the
serum diluted to the degree of     in 1000 would contain less than
                                           1
1  part of proteid in 13,000; while with the dilution of   in 10,000         1
the amount of proteid would be about     in 130,000.

   (a.) Acid Albumin.—A solution of acid albumin, obtained from a
solution of white of egg by the addition of afew drops of a dilute acid
and subsequent warming, gives a copious precipitate on the addition
of salicyl-sulphonic acid.
   (1).) Alkali Albmnin.—A solution of this proteid, obtained        by
treating the white of egg solution with a dilute alkali, also yields
an abundant precipitate on being tested with salicyl-sulphonic acid.

    A solution of globulin obtained from blood serum (by precipitating
with magnesium sulphate, and subsequently redissolving in dilute
salt solution) gives results similar to albumin.

   Solutions of <U+FB01>brin, both when a. dilute alkali and when 10 per cent.
salt solution are used as the solvents, give white precipitates with
salicyl-sulphonic acid.
   In the case of all the foregoing proteids (A, B, C, and D) the
precipitate does not redissolve on heating; on the other hand it
becomes markedly <U+FB02>occulent.
                                E.  Proteoses.
    Primary albumoses (proto-albumose          and hetero-albumose)    were
prepared   from Witte’s   peptone by precipitating  them  with sodic  chlor
ide and (after washing with saturated solution of salt) redissolving the
precipitate (containing some salt) by the addition of water.            The
solution so obtained gave a marked precipitate with salicyl-sulphonic
acid ; but in this case the precipitate redissolved on heating and
reappeared on cooling.
    Solutions of secondary albumose (deutero-albumose)        gave   similar
 results.
                                  F. Peptone.
    Solutions of peptone were obtained from albumin arti<U+FB01>cially
digested with pepsin and hydrochloric acid, by saturation with am
monium sulphate and subsequent <U+FB01>ltration.           The <U+FB01>ltrate contained
peptone; it gave no precipitate with nitric acid, while it gave the
 xantho-proteic and the biuret reactions.
    On adding a drop of salicyl-sulphonic acid to a small amount of
the solution containing peptone, a precipitate was at once formed.
This, like the precipitate of albumoses, readily disappeared on heating
and reappeared on cooling.
   Solutions containing peptone were also prepared by saturating the
arti<U+FB01>cially digested albumin solution with sodio-magnesic sulphate,
and similar results were obtained.
    Solutions of Witte’s peptone were (after being faintly acidulated
with acetic acid) saturated with ammonium sulphate in some cases,
and with sodio-magnesic sulphate in others.         The <U+FB01>ltrate contained
peptone, the other proteids having been precipitated by saturation
with the salts named and removed by <U+FB01>ltration. The peptone solu
tion yielded, on being tested with saturated solution of salicyl
sulphonic acid, a reaction similar to that described above, a precipi
tate which disappears on heating and reappears on cooling.

1891.]        A  ]\Tew Test for Albumin and other Proteicls.            373
   When the peptone was removed by precipitation with excess of
alcohol and <U+FB01>ltration, the remaining <U+FB02>uid failed to give the slightest
proteid reaction with salicyl-sulphonic acid.
   It will be noticed that there is an important diiference in the be
haviour of proteoses and peptones as compared with the other proteid
bodies under the in<U+FB02>uence of the salicyl-sulphonic acid; the pre
cipitate yielded by the proteoses and peptones clears up on heating,
and reappears on cooling, while the precipitate of the other proteids
does not clear up on heating, but, on the other hand, becomes
markedly <U+FB01>occulent. In this respect the reagent resembles picric
acid and mercuro-potassic iodide, and to some extent also nitric acid.
It differs from the latter, however, inasmuch as the latter gives no
precipitate with peptones.
   As regards the nature of the precipitate of egg albumin, or
serum albumin, thrown down by salioyl-sulphonic acid, its general
appearance might suggest that not only precipitation, but also
coagulation, had occurred, as with nitric acid, &c. But the fact that
it is soluble on the addition of a su<U+FB02>iciently large amount of a very
weak solution of potassic hydrate (01 per cent.) or of sodium car
bonate (1 per cent.) shows that no coagulation ‘could have taken place.
Solution of the precipitate does not take place as long as any acidity
remains in the <U+FB02>uid. And when it has been redissolved the addition
of a very small amount of a weak acid (nitric, acetic, sulphuric) can
again bring about precipitation.
    The precipitate of albumin thrown down by salicyl-sulphonic acid
is not redissolved by the addition of even considerable amounts of
this acid, nor is it dissolved by nitric acid, except when a large
amount of the strong acid is added.
    When salicyl-sulphonic acid is made to act upon albumin for some
time, especially at a high temperature, and the precipitate is then
<U+FB01>ltered off, the <U+FB01>ltrate shows a very marked coloration, varying from
a pinkish tint to a bright amethyst.           The <U+FB01>lter paper commonly
shows    a staining  of the same   colour.   When  the <U+FB02>uid is <U+FB01>ltered hot,
the <U+FB01>ltrate usually shows evidence           of containing albumoses; it
becomes turbid on cooling, and clears up on heating.            The colora
tion of the <U+FB01>ltrate is most marked and pure when the <U+FB02>uid is clear
 (e.g., when hot); when it is turbid the colour is, to some extent,
masked and modi<U+FB01>ed (often to an orange-pink tint) by the presence
of the precipitate.

                                      Urine.
    Salicyl-sulphonic   acid gives no precipitate whatever with normal
urine.

 374                     Prof.   J. A. MacVVilliam.               [ll‘l8.I‘. 19,
    In the case of albuminous urine, on the other hand, it constitutes
 an extremely delicate and precise test for the presence of proteids.
 By its use, coupled with heat, one can, with great facility, recognise
 very minute amounts of proteid substance, and can discriminate
                                     ”
 between the so-called “albumin        (albumin and globulin), most com
 monly found, and the albumoses or peptones, if such are present.
 This is easy, since the application of heat in the latter   case causes the
 precipitate to disappear—to reappear on cooling ; while,in the case of
 ordinary albuminous urine, the precipitate does not clear up on heating.
    The method of performing the test in the case of urine is the same
 as with other solutions.
    A very small amount of urine should be taken in the bottom of an
 ordinary test-tube (e.g., half an inch, or so), or a very small, narrow
 test-tube may be used:      The acid must be in a thoroughly saturated
 aqueous   solution.   A drop of this solution is then added to the urine,
 and the tube is shaken.     When any considerable amount of proteid is
present,   a  copious  precipitation  immediately occurs; when there is
 only a minute proportion of proteid, the <U+FB02>uid becomes uniformly
 opalescent.
    The delicacy of the test is shown by the following results, obtained
 with one of the samples of albuminous urine examined :—
    The urine was diluted to 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 times. With the
       weakest of these <U+FB02>uids (1 in 50), salicyl-sulphonic acid quickly
       gave a marked opalescence.
    Heller’s test gave no reaction for a considerable length of time;
       then it gave a doubtful haziness at the junction of the nitric acid
       and the uri.ne.
   Picric acid (saturated watery solution)        no reaction.
    Cupric sulphate and potassic hydrate           ,,    ,,
    The urine was then diluted twice as much, to 100 times, and still
gave, after standing a little, a distinct cloudiness with salicyl-sulph
onic acid, specially noticeable when the tube was compared (in a
suitable light) with two control tubes, containing respectively (a)
some of the dilute urine, and (b) water with a drop or two of salicyl
sulphonic acid.
   Even with much greater degrees of dilution, appreciable results

of its application, however,   I  <U+FB01>nd that in the case of the urine diluted
100 times, the amount of albumin contained must have been exceed
ingly small. A quantitative determination showed that the amount
of urine present in the undiluted urine was about 0'1 per cent.
Hence the amount present in the urine diluted 100 times must have
been about 1 in 100,000.

     The e<U+FB02>’ect of adding salicyl-sulphonic acid to samples of albuminous

 tated by means of absolute alcohol (after acidulation, when necessary)
 or by saturation with-ammonium sulphate.            The proteid-free <U+FB01>ltrate
 gave not the slightest reaction in any instance when tested with
 salicyl-sulphonic acid in the usual way.
     The characteristic reaction of even minute amounts of albumin in
 the urine    I  found to be given, on the addition of salicyl-sulphonic
acid, in very numerous and various conditions—in acid, neutral, and
alkaline urine; in urines rich in mucin, phosphates, urates, &c.; in
 urines containing bile, sugar, and other abnormal constituents.          My
results, obtained from the examination of a large number of samples
of urine, have not indicated that the applicability of the test is com
plicated or interfered with by any of the abnormal constituents
present.      The urine of persons under the in<U+FB02>uence of various drugs
 (e.g.,  alcohol,  quinine, sulphonal, oroton-chloral, iodide of potassium,
chloroform, salicylate of soda, strophanthus, &c.) has not shown the
slightest reaction with salicyl-sulphonic acid when shown to be free
from albumin by other tests (after concentration) or when freed
from albumin, if such has been present, by means of alcohol or
ammonium        sulphate.
    I   have also examined       the eifect of salicyl-sulphonic acid upon
solutions of various substances, many of which give precipitates with
certain of the well-known reagents for the detection of albumin in
urine—solutions of strychnine, digitalin, morphia, nicotin, chloral
hydrate, atropine sulphate, aconitine, ergotin, ca<U+FB01>ein citrate, stroph
anthin, sulphonal, gallic acid, quinine, bromide of potassium, copaiba,
&c.—-and in no case have        I  seen any reaction at all resembling that
yielded by proteids.
    The conclusion to which my results up to the present lead is that
salicyl-sulphonic acid is probably the most delicate and precise of all
known reagents for the detection of proteids in solution.

    Salicyl-sulphonic acid is a whitish crystalline substance, readily
soluble in water and in alcohol.        On slow evaporation of its aqueous
solution, it crystallises in long, thin needles.

                                   (Abstract.)
     A special interest attaches to the 1610 of oxygen in the life-h istory
 of bacteria.    Very wide diiferences exist, however, between di<U+FB01>ferent
 groups in respect of its importance. To the great majority a free
 supply of oxygen is absolutely essential for their proper growth and
 development ; to a small minority the converse applies, growth
 proceeding best in the absence of oxygen, if indeed it is not entirely
 prevented by its presence; while, lastly, in the case of an inter
 mediate group it seems almost immaterial whether oxygen be present
 or not, growth proceeding apparently equally well in both conditions,
 provided that the supply of food be otherwise suitable.
    Of these three groups of “ obligate aerobic,” “obligate anaerobic ”
 and “ facultative aerobic ” bacteria, respectively, the last has perhaps
 the greatest interest for the pathologist, as it is to it that the great
 majority of pathogenic organisms belong.
    The question is thus an interesting one, to what extent the patho
 genic properties of this class of bacteria are related to the power they,
 apparently under necessity, possess of obtaining their supply of
 oxygen from the food constituents          themselves when the supply in
the air is cut 0E.
    The present paper deals with the results of an investigation under
taken in this relation.
    It was necessary that the class of bacteria selected for study should
be one whose pathogenic properties were not constant, but subject to
variations presumably connected with the character of their sur
roundings.
    The bacteria of ordinary putrefaction possess in a special degree
this quali<U+FB01>cation, their chemical products differing much in character
and poisonous action under di<U+FB01>erent, for the most part as yet un
known, conditions.

 1891.]            Oxygen on the Formation     of Ptomaines.                377
    The method chosen by which to gauge the in<U+FB02>uence of oxygen on
the pathogenic properties of bacteria was to estimate the quantity of
 alkaloidal bodies or “ ptomaines ” formed in the putrefactive process,
according as oxygen (1) was freely admitted; (2) was present in
 moderate quantity; or (3) was withheld altogether.
    For our knowledge of the ptomaines of putrefaction we are chie<U+FB02>y
 indebted to the researches of Brieger. In their order of formation as
 well as complexity, the most commonly met are choline, C,H1,NO,;
 cadaverine,   C,,H14N,;  putrescine, C4H,2N2; trimethylamine, (CH,),N ;
 dimethylamine,    (CH,),NH;     and methylamine, (CH,)NH,.
    The ptomaines most characteristic of the early stages of putre
 faction are the diamines, which include, in addition to cadaverine
 (pentamethylenediamine) and putrescine (tetramethylenediamine),
 other two isomeric with the former, but of different, as yet unknown,
 constituti0n—neuridine (C5H“N-_.) and saprine (C5H,4N,).
    With the exception of choline, all these bodies are non-poisonous;
 and choline only produces symptoms when given in very large doses.
    In this respect they di<U+FB01>er from another group which possess
 markedly toxic properties, e.g., muscarine (C,H,,NO,), an oxidised
 derivative of choline, and neurine (C,H,_-,NO), also obtainable from
 choline arti<U+FB01>cially by warming with baryta water; as also two other
 bodies to which Brieger gave the name of mydatoxine (C,,H,;,NO,) and
 mg/dine,  CEHHNO.
    While the poisonous      bases are oxidised,     the harmless   bases    are
 non-oxidised, a circumstance which led Brieger to conclude that
 oxygen plays an important part in the formation of poisonous
  alkaloids, and that a free access of oxygen favours the formation of
  ptomaines generallyfl‘
     The observations now recorded supply data for judging how far
 these conclusions are correct.
    Their chief result is to show that the formation of the ordinary putre
factive ptomaines is favoured by the entire absence of oxygen; the
 quantity formed under such circumstances being several times greater
 than when oxygen is admitted.
                              Method of Research.
    The method employed for the isolation of the ptomaines was that of
 Brieger. Equal quantities of extract of meat, obtained by extracting
lean meat with cold water, were allowed to putrefy, for periods
ranging from 5 to 8 days, under the three following conditions :—
    (1.) Free Supply of Ozz;ygen.—-—The <U+FB02>uid was placed in a large glass
 cylinder, open at both ends, kept in continuous rotation round a
 horizontal axis. The direction of rotation was alternately from right

agitation, and uniformly    distributed over the inner surface of the
cylinder.
   (2.) Moderate Supply of Oz;/gen.——The <U+FB02>uid was placed in a wide-v
mouthed jar, and stirred freely from time to time.
   (3.) Exclusion of Oatygen.—The <U+FB02>uid was placed in a narrow-necked
bottle which it nearly <U+FB01>lled; excess of oxygen at the outset was
driven out by a stream of hydrogen; the bottle was then tightly
closed by an india-rubber stopper through which passed a glass tube
suitably bent and opening externally under mercury.
   In (2) and (3), the vessels were maintained at a uniform tempera
ture of 32° by being suspended in a water tank. In most of the ex
periments, a certain quantity of extract of pancreas was added, to»
hasten putrefaction, with 10 grams of OaCO, to prevent the in
jurious action of the acids formed in the early stages of the process.
   The conditions of the experiments varied somewhat in other
respects, either as regards the quantities of material used, or its
nature, or the manner of dealing with it. The experiments made,
eight in number, thus divide themselves into three series, each made
up of two or three di<U+FB01>erent observations under the conditions above
noted.
   The attempts made in the earlier experiments to isolate the indi
vidual ptomaines in the form of their platinum or gold salts failed,
owing to the small quantities present.
   Attention was afterwards con<U+FB01>ned to the diamines, and accurate
quantitative results were obtained by use of benzoyl chloride——a
reagent which, as Udranzky and Baumann have shown, forms bulky
and stable derivatives with all bodies of this nature.
                                 Results.
   The results of the observations show :—
   (1.) That a free supply of oxygen prevents entirely the formation
of ptomaines, the only base found under such circumstances—and
that too from the very <U+FB01>rst—being ammonia.
        With one exception, all the experiments agree in showing
that, as judged by the relative quantities of diamines formed, the
greatest formation of ptomaines takes place when oxygen is entirely
excluded.
   The differences between moderate supply of oxygen and          entire
absence in this respect ranged from 2: 1 to as much as 27: 1      in the
observations made, the greatest formation always taking place    where
oxygen was excluded.
   The one exception to this can be explained by a difference    in the
procedure, the e<U+FB01>ect of which was probably to destroy a large number

 of the diamines in the observation in which oxygen was excluded.
 The relation in this instance was reversed, viz.,1:3'8, the largest
quantity being obtained where oxygen was admitted in moderate
 quantity.
    (3.) Observations were also made on the e<U+FB01>ect of lengthening the
 duration of the putrefactive process when oxygen was entirely
 excluded. The result showed that on the 13th day the diamines
  were reduced to one-fourth of the quantity present in a similar
 amount of <U+FB02>uid, exposed to the same conditions, on the 7th day.
    (4.) In all cases the bulk of the benzoyl compound obtained was
 made up of cadaverine, its melting point varying according to purity
 from 127°'5 C. to 129° C. Putrescine was only present in traces.
    (5.) The results of the observations on the quality of the bases
 present were not so de<U+FB01>nite.     The most de<U+FB01>nite symptoms of poison
 ing were obtained in one instance from the injection of a <U+FB02>uid which
 had putre<U+FB01>ed in the absence of oxygen.          They included prostration,
 increased peristalsis, and diarrhoea, and on another occasion rise of
 temperature.
                                 C'oncZu.sions.
    Certain conclusions are drawn from the above data, partly of a
 special, partly of a general, character.
    The results are interpreted as tending to support Pasteur’s original
 views as to the relation of fermentation processes to absence of
 oxygen, as against those more recently advanced by Schiitzen
 berger, Niigeli, Buchner, and others.      They show for the putrefactive
 bacteria at least that a free supply of oxygen prevents fermentation
altogether, as judged alike by absence of aromatic products and
 ptomaines, and by presence of ammonia from the very <U+FB01>rst.
    They also show that Brieger’s view before mentioned as to the
 necessity of the oxygen for the formation of ptomaines must be
-considerably quali<U+FB01>ed, the results obtained being entirely opposed
 to such a view.
    As regards the in<U+FB02>uence of oxygen on the quality of the ptomaines
 formed, the conclusion is drawn that the presence or absence of
 oxygen is not the chief factor in determining the formation of
 poisonous, as distinguished from harmless, ptomaines ; and that other
 factors, such as duration of putrefactive process and nature of
 material, are likewise incapable of doing so.
    Both the formation and the character of poisonous ptomaines must
 be referred to individual characters of the bacteria. present, probably
also to the in<U+FB02>uence of “ mixed infection,” rather than to the physical
 conditions under which they act, important as the present observa
tions prove certain of the latter to be in modifying in a very material
 way the fermentative action of bacteria generally.

   The Table at the end of this communication contains the results of
experiments made in October, 1889--February, 1890, on the elasticity
of various bodies.
   The measures relating to crystalline bodies are, I believe, new.
   The method used to obtain these results was applicable to very
small specimens.    This was a necessary condition in the case of most
crystals, because of the di<U+FB02>iculty of getting large specimens without
<U+FB02>aws.
  In    the experiments now to be described,                   I   am dealing only with
the values of Young’s modulus, but by a modi<U+FB01>cation of the apparatus
measures can be made of the simple rigidity, which will,  hope, form          I
the subject of a future communication.
  Of course, the simple rigidity must lie between one-half and one
third of the value of Young's modulus, according to the ratio between
longitudinal   extension   and lateral contraction (Poisson's                     constant)

     The fulcrum of D is the knife-edge K,, and a wire passing through
  A  connects the knife-edge K, with K3.
     The substance to be examined is formed into a small rectangular
 beam, rather longer than the distance between the <U+FB01>xed knife-edges
  K1, K2, and to the projecting ends of the beam the mirrors M1, M, are
  cemented.    These mirrors are mounted in brass frames, and from the
 back    of each  frame a. small brass tongue, EE' (<U+FB01>g. 2), projects,
 which is the actual part to which the cement is applied.
     The two other larger mirrors M3, M, are inclined to one another
  at an angle of 45° nearly. They are <U+FB01>xed in a rigid brass mounting,
 which rests on the horizontal <U+FB02>at surface FF, from which two studs
project, so placed that when the mounting of M3, M, is in contact
  with both, the intersection of the planes of M, and M, is parallel to
 the knife-edges   Kb K2.
    The horizontal width of the mirrors M1, M2 is less than half that
 of M3, M4, and the telescope and collimator are so placed that their
 axes of collimation graze the vertical edges of M, and M,.
    It is necessary that the planes of M, and M, should be nearly, but
 not quite, parallel, and this is e<U+FB02>fected by cementing the mirrors to
 the experimental beam whilst the former are held in the gauge shown
 in <U+FB01>g.  3.

    The cement is applied to E and E’ before the mirrors are placed in
the gauge; when they are in position, the beam is laid with one end
on E and the other on E’, and warmed.       When cool, the experimental
beam with the mirrors attached is removed from the gauge and laid
in the proper position on K1, K,.
    On looking through the telescope T, two images of the scales S
will be seen side by side. One of these images being formed by
successive reflection from the four mirrors M2, M4, Ms, M,, in the
order named, and the other by re<U+FB02>ection from M, and M, only.
    The course followed by the two sets of rays is indicated by the
arrows on the dotted lines in <U+FB01>g. 2.

 tion, the scale images would at times      exactly overlap one another,
 which would make readings difficult.
    As long as the condition of approximate parallelism of the inter
 sections of the pairs of mirrors is ful<U+FB01>lled, any shifting of one image
 of the scale past the other is due to an alteration of the angle between
 one pair or other of the mirrors, and to that alone, and since M3, M,
 are in a rigid mounting, any relative motion of the images is due to
 an alteration in the angle between M1 and M2.
    The experiments were made by noting the relative motion of the
 images when force was applied to the beam by the central knife-edge
 K3. The course usually followed was to start with no load on K3, and
 having noted the relative position of the scale images, to move W
 along D until the scales had moved relatively through one division.

The reading was then taken on D. W being then moved forwards
until another scale division had been reached, the position of W on
D was again read, and so on. The process was afterwards reversed
and readings of the same kind taken when the load was being
diminished step by step.
   All these results were then plotted, and the curve drawn through
the observations gave a measure of the angle between the ends of the
beam in terms of the force applied to its middle point. In nearly all
cases the lines drawn through the plotted observations were straight
lines, within the limits of errors of observation, but, in general, the
lines for each substance dilfered appreciably, according to whether
the strains were increasing or decreasing.        Some of the plotted
diagrams are appended to show the kind of accuracy attained.
   The actual linear motion of the central knife-edge was always very
small, not in any case exceeding 0'00016 inch.

    The numerical values of quantities involved in           A   were as follows   :—
           Focal length of collimator,     f
                                        = 8'87 inches.
           Length between knife-edges, K1, K2, Z = 034122 inch.
           Distance between division of scale 6 = 0'01.
           Distance between knife-edges K,, K, = 1'0.
  The values employed for b and t varied between 0'1 and 0'01 inch,
and for  W from 0'02 to 0'25 pound. The chief and indeed the only
considerable source of error in these experiments is in the measure
ment of t.    The measures were made with a screw micrometer
reading to 00001 by estimation.
  The average value of t was between 0'03 and 0'04, so that the
measurement was probably accurate to something like 1 in 400.
Hence, there may be an error in     approaching

  In the case of crystalline substances, beams out from the same
neighbourhood of the same crystals exhibit a constancy, in the results
obtained from them, of this order, but in passing to other specimens
more diiference was observed.
  In many substances, and notably         in the   case    of zinc, lead, and white
marble,   itwas found that the full de<U+FB02>ection             due to a given load was
not reached until   a considerable time had elapsed, and experiments
with such substances would of course lead to di<U+FB01>erent values for
Young’ modulus, according as the observations were made in rapid
succession or slowly.
   The behaviour of zinc in this respect was so marked, that                        a
separate set of observations were made with that material, the results
of which are shown in diagrams (10) and (11), pp. 394-395.
   It will be seen on examining these diagrams that, starting with a
freshly annealed piece of rolled zinc (and similar ‘results were ob
tained from a beam cut from    a  large crystal of cast zinc), that, on the
<U+FB01>rst application of the force, the bending immediately produced con
tinues to increase for many minutes, and that, when the load                        is
removed, the beam does not recover itself all at once, and also that
a  permanent set has taken place.
   On the second application of the force, however,        the force
                                                                 if     not  is
greater than that <U+FB01>rst applied, the behaviour of the zinc             quiteis
different.   It now very rapidly assumes its maximum de<U+FB02>ection and

drops back to its equilibrium position, on the removal of‘ the force, still
more rapidly, but little further permanent set being produced.
   On again increasing the force so as to exceed that <U+FB01>rst applied, a
further gradual extension, lasting a considerable time, takes place        ;
and additional permanent set is found when the force is removed.
   Diagram (11) shows that—
   (1.) The immediate elastic bending and the permanent set are pro
        portional in amount to the force causing them.
   (2.) That the increment of extension or de<U+FB02>ection which happens
        in time is something like a constant quantity.
   The method, however, described in this paper is not well adapted to
the investigation of these phenomena, as the state of strain in the
beam on which they depend varies from + through 0 to — on

opposite  sides of the neutral axis, and one cannot be sure that the
very slightly strained material of the central parts acts in the same
way as that near the upper and lower boundaries.
   In nearly all the substances experimented on, it was found that
work was done in bending and unbending the beams, i.e., for a given
de<U+FB02>ection the load was always less when the latter was being
diminished than when it was being increased.         This e<U+FB01>ect was gene
rally more apparent in metals than in hard crystals.
   On reference to the Table (p. 398), it will be seen that only ten of the
non-metallic substances examined at all approach steel in stiifness.
  I  regret that I   have not hitherto been able to get a specimen of
diamond of suitable form for measurement; but          I   hope to be able to
give Young’s modulus for this and some other crystals in a supple

                       Explanation of   the Diagrams.
   Diagrams (1) to (9) are examples of the diagrams used in determin
 ing the ratio R/n.
   The ordinate is the scale-reading on the arm D (<U+FB01>g. 1), and the
 abscissa the corresponding scale-reading of the images of the glass
scale seen in the <U+FB01>eld of the telescope.
   That the line through the observations does not in general point to
the origin is due to the fact that the mirrors were not quite parallel
in a vertical direction at the beginning of the experiment; in fact,
according to the position in which the spring holding the mirrors
against the faces of the gauge was placed while they were being
cemented to the beam, variations of rather more than a minute of arc
were produced between their planes.      The abscissa reading when the
ordinate  =  0 has of course to be subtracted from n in getting the
true ratio R/n.
   The spots indicate individual observations, and are marked
with arrows whose directions show whether the load was being
increased or diminished.

owing to the extreme brittleness of <U+FB02>uor spar, a displacement of only
about 1'5 of the ordinary division of the scale could be safely use
when the thickness of the specimen was about 0'03 inch, and many
beams of this substance were broken in attempting to produce greater
<U+FB02>exures.
  In this experiment       the greatestdeparture of the centre of the
beam from its unstrained position is about 000001 inch.
   Diagram ( 10) shows some of the properties of zinc.      The curves
numbered 1 to 8 are really one continuous experiment. A light
weight was allowed to act on a beam of sheet zinc, and the de<U+FB02>ections
caused by it were noted every thirty seconds for ten minutes.     These
de<U+FB02>ections are shown by the <U+FB01>rst part of curve 1. The weight was
then removed, and the recovery of the beam was observed for <U+FB01>ve
minutes. This forms the second part of curve 1.
   The experiment was then repeated with the same weight, and the
results are shown in curve 2. Additional weight being applied, the
same course of procedure gave curves 3 and 4, and in like manner by
still further additions of load curves 5, 6 and 7, 8 were obtained.

V. “On the Chief Line in the Spectrum of the Nebulae." By
       JAMES E. KEELER, Astronomer of the Lick Observatory.
       Communicated by WILLIAM HUGGINS, D.C.L., LL.D., F.R.S.
       Received March 13, 1891.
   As my paper on the Motions of the Planetary Nebula in the Line
of Sight"" did not give a <U+FB01>nal determination of the exact position of
the chief nebular line, and might therefore possibly be regarded as
leaving in abeyance the question as to whether that line could be
regarded as a remnant of the magnesium <U+FB02>uting,                 I  beg to be allowed
to state brie<U+FB02>y the results of some more recent observations, which
have enabled me to <U+FB01>x with great accuracy the true position of the
chief nebular line.
   At the time when my paper on the motions of the nebula was
            I
printed, had not been able to obtain any satisfactory comparisons
of the third nebular line with terrestrial hydrogen, all the nebulae
in my list having proved to be too faint for the purpose.                      I  was,
therefore, compelled to adopt the mean position of the principal line
for the ten nebulae observed as the normal position from which to
measure displacements, and it was for the reason that the ten nebulae
did not have the uniform distribution in the sky which was desirable
that the numerical results for their motions were stated as “ not to
be regarded as <U+FB01>nal.”
   In October, 1890, when the Orion nebula came within reach of the
telescope, comparisons of the third line with the H<U+FB02> line of hydrogen
were made without di<U+FB02>iculty, and on the same nights the position of
the principal line was determined.            One such double observation, if
perfect, completely solves the problem, since the displacement of the
third line gives the necessary correction to the position of the <U+FB01>rst.
The only question is in regard to the accuracy of the observations.
   It is evident from what has already been written on this subject
by Dr. and Mrs. Huggins, Professor Lockyer, and myself, that the
answer to the question whether the chief nebular line is coincident
with the edge of the magnesium <U+FB02>uting at N 50064 depends
upon very small differences of position, differences which would,
in fact, be considered small even in solar spectroscopy.                           But
their minuteness, although it increases the practical di<U+FB01>iculty of
observation,       does not detract from their importance,              since abso
lute coincidence of spectral lines is necessary (although not always
su<U+FB02>icient) to establish a claim to identity of origin.                  It is there
fore necessary to determine from a careful consideration of the
Lick Observatory measures whether they are of a su<U+FB02>iciently high

400                       Mr. J.  E. Keele1'.    On the             [Man 19,
order of accuracy to prove that the small observed interval between
the nebular line and the magnesium <U+FB02>uting is real, and not due to
errors of observation.
    A detailed account of all the tests to which the apparatus was sub
jected cannot be given here.          Nothing that suggested itself was
omitted.       The best tests, however, both for constant and for
accidental errors, are alforded by observations of the motion in the
line of sight of bodies whose motion is already known.                  As an
example     of  such   observations,  I may   refer to  the  measures   of the
 motion of Venus in the line of sight given in the table on p. 270,
 ‘
   Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Paci<U+FB01>c,’ No. 11, in
which the greatest error is one English mile per second. Similar
 measures of the displacement of lines in the lunar spectrum were
-seldom in error by more than two miles, and measures of the motion
of an-Tauri and a-Orionis, usually made on the same nights that the
nebula was observed, were of the same order of accuracy, as deter
mined by their agreement with each other, and with the photographic
results of Professor Vogel.
    In work of this character the periodic shifting of lines in the
spectra of the stars and nebulae due to the earth's annual motion is
of a magnitude not to be neglected, and it should appear in the com
parison of observations made at di<U+FB01>erent seasons.             So faithfully is
the orbital motion of the earth re<U+FB02>ected in my observations on the
nebula of Orion, that       I  would with some con<U+FB01>dence undertake to
 determine the month of the year, by measuring the distance of the
 principal line from the lead line used in the comparison spectrum.
    With these remarks on the degree of accuracy which characterises
the observations,    I  give below the results which have been obtained,
up to the present time, for the nebula of Orion.
    From sixteen complete measures, made on eleven diiferent nights
 (two of which were in the winter of 1889-90), the wave-length of
              i
the principal line, corrected for orbital motion of the earth, is
 K 500622        0014, the probable error corresponding to an uncer
tainty of 0'5 mile per second in the line of sight.                When two
measures were made on the same night, they were always in diiferent
spectra of the grating.
    Ten comparisons of the third nebular line with terrestrial hydrogen
were made on seven nights in 1890-91, showing, when corrected for
                            i
the orbital motion of the earth, a displacement of the nebular line
 toward the red of 0'28
 motion of recession     of the
                                0026 tenth-metres.
                                 nebula  from   the sun
                                                        This corresponds to a
                                                         of 107   i  1'0 miles
 per second.
    In recent   comparisons of hydrogen with the third nebular line,         I
 have not been able to attain the small probable error of 1§ miles per
  second for a single evening's comparison, given in my letter to the

 1891.]          C/Liéf Line in the Spectrum   of the Nebulae.          401
 ‘Observatory,’ as the <U+FB01>rst comparisons were made under exception
 ally favourable conditions.         Some small improvements in the
apparatus make it probable, however, that it can be reached in the
 future.
    Examination of the individual results for each night’s work shows
 that the errors are purely accidental; hence, the mean of the results
 for the third line will be used to determine a correction to the mean
of the results for the <U+FB01>rst line.
    A displacement of the third line toward the red of 0'28 tenth
 metre corresponds to a displacement of the principal line, in the
same direction, of 0'29 tenth-metre, which is the amount by which
 the principal line is seen to be too near the red end of the spectrum,
 on account of the recession of the nebula from the sun.
    Hence the wave-length of the principal line, if determined by an
observer at rest relatively to the nebula, would be X 5005'93, and this,
 therefore, is the normal position of the chief nebular line, according to
all the observations of the nebula of Orion which have been made, up
 to the present time, at the Lick Observatory. The probable error of this
 result is, by the theory of least squares, 0'03 tenth-metre. The posi
tion of the MgO <U+FB02>uting, on the same scale, is X 500636 or 0'43 tenth
 metre below the normal position of the nebular line.          An interval
of this magnitude is not only measurable with my apparatus, but
 noticeable at a glance in the telescope.
    An incident which occurred during the course of the work
may be mentioned here, as showing how much greater the above
stated interval is than any error which could be made under good
conditions of observation.        The measures of January 26, 1891, on
being    reduced   the  next morning,   made the interval between the
 nebular and lead lines 0'15 tenth-metre greater than it should have
 been according to previous measures.          This dilference led me at
once to infer that something was wrong with the apparatus, and on
examining the instrument        I  found that the observing telescope was
set to a reading 5° diiferent from the usual one, in such a direction
that a higher dispersion than usual had been employed.           On deter
mining the value of the micrometer for this position of the grating,
-and re-reducing the observations,      the discrepancy was then but a
few hundredths of a tenth-metre.
    In the ‘ Journal of the British Astronomical Association,’ Mr.
Maunder says, in reference to the possibility of my having over
measured the interval between the chief nebular line and the edge of
the magnesium <U+FB02>uting, “ Further, some allowance must be made for
the difficulty of comparing a line with a <U+FB02>uting ; we ought certainly
not to measure from the centre of the nebular line to the extreme
edge of the <U+FB02>uting.      This will apply a small, but a further, correction
in the same direction.”      Mr. Maunder’s criticism does not, however,

402      On    the   Chief Line in     the  Spectrum   of the   1Vebulw.     [Mar. 19,
apply to my own observations, which were made with this di<U+FB02>icnlty
in view. If the distance between the line and the edge of the <U+FB02>uting
could be measured with a slit-width vanishingly small, the true
interval would be obtained.                 With a practicable slit-width, the
position of the centre of the line is unchanged, but the edge of the
<U+FB02>uting is shifted toward the red by half the width of the line. In
my observations of nebulae, the slit-width used was such as to make
the bright, sharp lead line (and hence, also, the nebular line) just the
width of the coarse micrometer wire (about 0'4: tenth-metre). The
bright lines were observed by occulting them with the wire, the
observations        thus referring to their centres, but the magnesium
<U+FB02>uting was observed by bringing its extreme edge and the lower edge
of the micrometer wire into coincidence, the centre of the wire falling
therefore upon the edge of the <U+FB02>uting with in<U+FB01>nitely narrow slit.
Measures of the interval between the lead line and the edge of the
magnesium <U+FB01>uting, made with the <U+FB01>ne micrometer wire and as
narrow a slit as could be used, gave the same value as measures
made in the manner just described.* The correction mentioned by
Mr. Maunder is therefore unnecessary.
    It appears to me, from what has been shown above, that the non
coincidence of the chief nebular line and the magnesium <U+FB02>uting must
be regarded as proved.
    In regard to the character of the line, recent observations              at Mount
 Hamilton have shown nothing which does not con<U+FB01>rm the opinion                          I
have already expressed,1' that under no circumstances of observation
does the line tend to assume the aspect of the remnant of a <U+FB02>uting.
    The observations which have been made at Mount Hamilton
demonstrate        the incorrectness of the View that the chief nebular line
is in any way connected with the magnesium <U+FB02>uting at X 500636, for
reasons which may be brie<U+FB02>y summarised as follows :
    (1). The nebular line is 0'43 tenth-metre more refrangible than the
lower edge of the magnesium <U+FB02>uting.
           The nebular line has no resemblance to a <U+FB02>uting.
    (3).   Flutings     and lines of magnesium, which could not fail to
   *  I may call   attention to the fact that my own value of this interval (1'86 tenth
metres)   is 0'04  tenth-metre  smaller than the most reliable measures which have yet
been published.

three and one—half times the dispersion of the latter, and <U+FB01>nally a Rowland grating
of 14,438 lines to the inch. With all these different degrees of dispersion, and also
with other spectroscopes employed, the nebular lines appeared to be perfect mono
chromatic images of the slit, widening when the slit was widened and narrowing to
excessively <U+FB01>ne, sharp lines when it was closed up.      The brightest line showed no

I. “On Electrostatic Screening by Gratings, Nets. or Per
    forated Sheets of Conducting Material.” By Sir WILLIAM
    Tuomsos, D.C.L., P.R.S. Received April 2, 1891.
                                                 I. Grating.
  l.    Maxwell,  in his “Theory of a Grating of Parallel Wires"
(‘Electricity and Magnetism,’ Arts. 203-205,‘ and Plate XIII),
gives a very valuable and interesting two-dimensional investigation
of electrostatic screening, and a most instructive diagram of “ Lines
of Force near a Grating,” which powerfully helps to understand and
extend the theory, and to acquit it of an accusation wrongly made
against it in the last two sentences of Art. 205. It is only on the
supposition of the grate-bars being circular cylinders that the
investigation is less than rigorous: and that supposition nowhere
                                                                “ radius,"
enters into the investigation; it merely appears in the word
in the <U+FB01>rst line of the last sentence but one of Art. 204, and it is con
tradicted in lines 3 and     and by the rest of the sentence, and by the
                                        4-,
next sentence.     (See    below.)9'   6
  2.  The conclusion, “ a = —0'11a,” in the last sentence of Art. 205,
condemned as “evident-ly erroneous,”           quite correct, and very
                                                                   is

406        Sir    VV.      Thomson.                       On Electrostatic Screening                                  [Apr.              9
the equipotential surface 0 = %a, exceeds in electrostatic capacity a
plane metal surface through the poles of the diagram (Plate XIII,
reproduced in § 9 below), with the surroundings described in Art. 204,
 and supplies the datum requisite for <U+FB01>nding the exact amount of the
 excess.    The reason for the greatness of the excess clearly is that the
 surface 0 = =§a, which just touches the plane through the poles of the
 diagram midway between the poles, is everywhere nearer than this
 plane to the other plate of the condenser.      (See § 7 below.)
    3. For 0 = a/6 we have, by (11) of Art. 205, a = 0, and the corre
 sponding equipotential, partially shown in Maxwe]l’s diagram, is a
 set of curves concave towards z = -00 , and asymptotic to the lines
 2' = ('t'i})a,  '11
                  denoting any integer.     (See     10 to 13 below.)    For          §§
 every value of less than a/6, the equipotential
                       0                               a. row of ovals; and                is
 the grating formed by constructing these ovals in metal has less
 electrostatic capacity in the circumstances described in Art. 205 than
 a plane through the poles or the ovals (this being no doubt what                                                                        is
 meant by “ a plane     .  .      in the same position ” as the grating).
                                               .
    4. For every value of     exceeding u./6 the equipotential, instead of
                                              c
 being   the boundary  of    grating,    a continuous corrugated
                                         a                     is   surface,
 and its electrostatic capacity exceeds that of the plane through the
poles.

  as the potential due to the grating, and two parallel planes at equal
  distances, D, on its two sides, each uniformly electri<U+FB01>ed with half the
  quantity of electricity of opposite sign to that on the grating.
     6. It now we construct in metal, C, any one complete equipotcntial
  surface, V0, of this syslem, and electrify it with the same quantity of
  electricity as that which we gave originally to the in<U+FB01>nite row of
  in<U+FB01>nitely thin bars; and if we place metal planes, B, B’, at the two
  places of zero-potential (z = iD), we have an insulated conductor
  at potential V0, between two planes, B, B’, at zero potential, and at
  distance 2D asunder, on each of which the electric density is § p. For
  brevity, I shall denote the insulated conductor by I.
     Its electrostatic capacity per unit area of its medial plane (the
  plane of the original in<U+FB01>nitely thin bars) is p/V0.
     7. This conductor,    I, is symmetrical on each side of its medial
  plane, and consists either of an in<U+FB01>nite number of isolated parallel

the question, what then is the di<U+FB01>erence                   between the two cases,

unequably distributed over the outer and inner portions of the
complex surface in one case, and equably over the outside of the
smooth medial in the other?          There is a very important and interest

ductor, S, is less, in the ratio of 1 to 1 + k, than that of the medial

its screening e<U+FB02>iciency is the same as that of a grating of parallel

       This result is also applicable to     a hemispherical screen of radius R,
 simply placed      on the   ground.         For the particular proportions of
 § 27. it makes the force under the hemispherical cage % of the un
 disturbed force outside.  A cage of ordinary gardener’s (anti-rabbit)
 hexagonal wire-net (of 5% cm. from parallel to parallel) cannot be
 very different from this.       If, instead of the radius being 50 cm. it be
 200, but the cage_ still of the same net, the force inside would be only
 3 per cent. of the undisturbed force outside.

deserves more complete synthetic investigation, not limited by the
approximational conditions of §§ 21, 22, if for no other reason,
because of Hertz’s mouse-mill.         This must, however, be reserved for a
future communication.        Meantime, it is worth saying that sudden
variations of electric current, or alternating electric currents, distri
bute themselves between different straight parallel conductors in the
same proportion as static electri<U+FB01>cation is distributed in corre
sponding electrostatic arrangements, whenever the suddenness, or
the frequency, is sufficient to cause the impedance by mutual induc
tion of the separate parallel conductors (and therefore, a fortiori, the
impedance by self-induction of each) to be very large in comparison
with ohmic resistance.      Hence Hertz's mouse-mill screening follows
 (though by utterly different physical action), simply the electrostatic
law, except in any case in which his wave-length is less than a con
siderable multiple of the diameter of his mouse-mill.
 II. “On     Variational Electric and Magnetic Screening.”                By
          Sir W. THOMSON, P.R.S. Received April 1, 1891.
    1.  A  screen of imperfectly conducting material is as thorough in
 its action, when time enough is allowed it, as is a similar screen of‘
 metal.    But if it be tried against rapidly varying electrostatic force,
 its action lags. On account of this lagging, it is easily seen that the
 screening effect against periodic variations of electrostatic force will
 be less and less, the greater the frequency of the variation.       This is
 readily illustrated by means of various forms of idiostatic electro
 meters.    Thus, for example, a piece of paper supported on metal in
 metallic communication with the movable disc of an attracted disc
 electrometer annuls the attraction (or renders it quite insensible) a
 few seconds of time after a difference of potential is established and
 kept constant between the attracted disc and the opposed metal plate,
 if the paper and the air surrounding it are in the ordinary hygro
 metric condition of our climates.        But if the instrument is applied to
 measure a rapidly alternating difference of potential, with equal
 diiferences on the two sides of zero, it gives very little less than the
 same average force as that found when the paper is removed and all
 other circumstances kept the same.           Probably, with ordinary clean
 white paper in ordinary hygrometrie conditions, a frequency of alter
 nation of from 50 to 100 per second will more than su<U+FB01>ice to render the
  screening in<U+FB02>uence of the paper insensible. And amueh less frequency
 will su<U+FB01>ice if the atmosphere surrounding the paper is arti<U+FB01>cially
  dried. Up to a frequency of millions per second, we may safely say
  that, the greater the frequency, the more perfect is the annulment of

1891.]      On Variational  Electric and Mzgrzetic Screening.          41
screening by the paper; and this statement holds also if the paper be
thoroughly blackened on both sides with ink, although possibly in
this condition a greater frequency than 50 to 100 per second might
be required for practical annulment of the screening.
   2. Now, suppose, instead of attractive force between two bodies
separated by the screen, as our test of electri<U+FB01>cation, that we have
as test a faint spark, after the manner of Hertz.          Let two well
insulated metal balls, A, B, be placed very nearly in contact, and
two much larger balls, E, F, placed beside them, with the shortest
distance between E, F su<U+FB01>icient to prevent sparking, and with the
lines joining the centres of the two pairs parallel. Let a rapidly
alternating di<U+FB01>erence of potential be produced between E and F,
varying, not abruptly, but according, we may suppose, to the simple
harmonic law.      Two sparks in every period will be observed be
tween A and B.      The interposition of a large paper screen between
E, F, on one side, and A, B, on the other, in ordinary hygrometric
conditions, will absolutely stop these sparks, if the frequency
be less than, perhaps, 4 or 5 per second.          With a frequency of
50 or more, a clean white paper screen will make no perceptible
difference.   If the paper be thoroughly blackened with ink on both
sides, a frequency of something more than 50 per second may be
necessary; but some moderate frequency of a few hundreds per second
will, no doubt, Bn<U+FB02>ice to practically annul the e<U+FB01>ect of the interposi
tion of the screen. With frequencies up to 1000 million per second,
as in some of Hertz's experiments, screens such as our blackened
paper are still perfectly transparent, but if we raise the frequency to
500 million million, the in<U+FB02>uence to be transmitted is light, and the
blackened paper becomes an almost perfect screen.
   3. Screening against a varying magnetic force follows an opposite
law to screening against varying electrostatic force.    For the present,
I  pass over the case of iron and other bodies possessing magnetic
susceptibility, and consider only materials devoid of magnetic sus
ceptibility, but possessing more or less of electric conductivity.
However perfect the electric conductivity of the screen may be, it
has no screening e<U+FB02>iciency against a steady magnetic force.        But if
the magnetic force varies,   currents are  induced in the material of the
screen which tend to diminish the magnetic force in the air on the
remote side from the varying magnet.           For simplicity, we shall
suppose the variations to follow the simple harmonic law. The
greater the electric conductivity of the material, the greater is the
screening effect for the same frequency of alternation; and, the
greater the frequency, the greater is the screening effect for the same
material.    If the screen be of copper, of speci<U+FB01>c resistance 1640
 sq. cm. per second (or electric diffusivity 130 sq. cm. per second), and
 with frequency 80 per second, what I have called the “ mhoic e<U+FB01>ective

     Thus (as 63 = 2009) the range of current-intensity at depth 2'13 cm.
  is $5 of its surface value.       Hence we may expect that a su<U+FB02>iciently
  large plate of copper of 2} cm. thick will be a little less than perfect
  in its screening action against an alternating magnetic force of
  frequency 80 per second.

  on “ Electromagnetic Induction in Conducting Sheets and Solid
  Bodies” (‘Phil. Mag.,’ 1884, <U+FB01>rst half-year), makes the following
  very interesting statement:—-“ If we have a sheet of conducting
 matter in the neighbourhood of a magnetic system, the effect of a
-disturbance of that system will be to induce currents in the sheet of
 such kind as will tend to prevent any change in the conformation of
 the tubes [lines] of force cutting through the sheet. This follows
 from Lenz’s law, which itself has been shown by Helmholtz and
 Thomson to be a direct consequence of the conservation of energy,
 But if the arrangement of the tubes [lines of force] in the conductor
 is unaltered, the <U+FB01>eld on the other side of the conductor into which
 they pass (supposed isolated from the outside spaces by the conductor)
 will be unaltered. Hence, if the disturbance is of an alternating
-character, with a period small enough to make it go through a cycle                .
 of changes before the currents decay sensibly, we shall have the con
 ductor acting as a screen.
     “ Further, we shall also <U+FB01>nd, on the same
                                                       principle, that a rapidly
 rotating conducting sheet screens the space inside it from all magnetic
 action which is not symmetrical round the axis of rotation.”
     Mr. Willoughby Smith’s experiments on “ Volta-electric induc
 tion,” which he described in his inaugural address to the Society of
 Telegraph Engineers of November, 1883, afforded good illustrations
 of this kind of action with copper, zinc, tin, and lead, screens, and
 with different degrees of frequency of alternation.               His results with
 iron are also very interesting: they showed, as might be expected, com
 paratively little augmentation of screening effect with augmentation

    of frequency.        This is just what‘ is to be expected from the fact that
    a broad enough and long enough iron plate exercises a large magneto
    static screening in<U+FB02>uence ; which, with a thick enough plate, will be
    so   nearly complete that comparatively little is left for augmentation
    of the screening in<U+FB02>uence by alternations of greater and greater
    frequency.
        5. A copper shell closed around an alternating magnet produces a
    screening e<U+FB02>ect which on the principle of § 3 we may reckon to be
    little short of perfection if the thickness be 2} cm. or more, and the
    frequency of alternation 80 per second.
        6. Suppose now the alternation of the magnetic force to be pro
   duced by the rotation of a magnet M about any axis.             First, to <U+FB01>nd
    the e<U+FB01>ect of the rotation, imagine the magnet to be represented by
   ideal magnetic matter.          Let (after the manner of Gauss in his treat
    ment of the secular perturbations of the solar system) the ideal
    magnetic matter be uniformly distributed over the circles described
   by its di<U+FB02>ierent points.         For brevity call I the ideal magnet sym
   metrical round the axis, which is thus constituted.            The magnetic
   force throughout the space around the rotating magnet will be the
   same as that due to I, compounded with an alternating force of
   which the component at any point in the direction of any <U+FB01>xed line
   varies from zero in the two opposite directions in each period of the
   rotation. If the copper shell is thick enough, and the angular
   velocity of the rotation great enough, the alternating component is
   almost annulled for external space, and only the steady force due to I
   is allowed to act in the space outside the copper shell.
        7. Consider now, in the space outside the copper shell, a point P
   rotating with the magnet M. It will experience a force simply equal
   to that due to M when there is no rotation, and, when M and P
   rotate together, P will experience a force gradually altering as the
   speed of rotation increases, until, when the speed becomes su<U+FB01>iciently
   great, it becomes sensibly the same as the force due to the sym
   metrical magnet I. Now superimpose upon the whole system of the
   magnet, and the point P, and the copper shell, a rotation equal and
wopposite to that of M and P. The statement just made with refer
   ence to the magnetic force at P remains unaltered, and we have now
   a <U+FB01>xed magnet M and a point P at rest, with reference to it, while
  the copper shell rotates round the axis around which we <U+FB01>rst sup
  posed     M  to rotate.
       8.  A  little piece of apparatus, constructed to illustrate the result
  experimentally, is submitted to the Royal Society and shown in action.
  In the copper shell is a cylindric drum, 1'25 cm. thick, closed at
  its two ends with circular discs 1 cm. thick. The magnet is sup
  ported on the inner end of a sti<U+FB01> wire passing through the centre of
  a. perforated <U+FB01>xed shaft which passes through a hole in one end of

If the (triple compound) magnet inside is reversed, by means of the
central wire and cross bar outside, shown in the diagram, the magneto
meter outside is greatly a<U+FB01>ected while the copper shell is at rest;
but scarcely a<U+FB01>ected perceptibly while the copper shell is rotating
rapidly.
   9. When the copper shell is a <U+FB01>gure of revolution, the magnetic
force at any point of the space outside or inside is steady, whatever
be the speed of rotation; but if the shell be not a <U+FB01>gure of revolu
tion, the steady force in the external space observable when the shell
is at rest becomes the resultant of the force due to a <U+FB01>xed magnet
intermediate between M and      I compounded with analternating force
with amplitude of alternation increasing to a maximum, and ulti
mately diminishing to zero, as the angular velocity is increased with
out limit.
   10. If M be symmetrical, with reference to its northern and southern
polarity, on the two sides of a plane through the axis of rotation, I
becomes a null magnet, the ideal magnetic matter in every circle of
which it is constituted being annulled by equal quantities of positive
and negative magnetic matter being laid on it. Thus, when the rota
tion is su<U+FB01>iciently rapid, the magnetic force is annulled throughout
the space external to the shell. The transition from the steady force
of M to the <U+FB01>nal annulment of force, when the copper shell is symme
trical round its axis of rotation, is, through a steadily diminishing
force, without alternations. When the shell is not symmetrical round
its axis of rotation, the transition to zero is accompanied with alter
nations as described in § 8.
   11. When M is not symmetrical on the two sides of a plane through
                       I
the axis of rotation, is not null; and the condition approximated to
through external space with increasing speed of rotation is the force
due to I, which is an ideal magnet symmetrical round the axis of

   12. A very interesting simple experimental illustration of screening
against magnetic force may be shown by a rotating disc with a <U+FB01>xed
magnet held close to it on one side. A bar magnet held with its
magnetic axis bisected perpendicularly by a plane through the axis
of rotation would, by suf<U+FB01>ciently rapid rotation, have its magnetic
force almost perfectly annulled at points in the air_ as near as may
be to it, on the other side of the disc, if the diameter of the disc
exceeds considerably the length of the magnet.        The magnetic force
in the air close to the disc,-on the side next to the magnet, will be
everywhere parallel to the surface of the disc.

III.    “ The Measurement           of the Power given by any Electric
        Current to any (h'1-cuit.”             By W. E. AYRTON, F.R.S.,
        Professor of Applied Physics in the City and Guilds of
        London Institute, and W. E. SUMPNER, D.Sc. Received

                                          I.
    During the meeting of the Electrical Congress at Paris in 1881, one of
us’ devised a method of using an clectrometer for measuring the power
given to any circuit by any current. The accuracy of the method is
wholly independent of the nature of the circuit, which may possess
self-induction, mutual induction capacity, and an E.M.F., as well as of
the nature of the current, which may be constant, intermittent, or alter
nating, according to any function of the time. This method is the only
electrical one published up to the present date the accuracy of which
is not based on assumptions, either as regards the nature of the
current or as regards the entire absence of self- and mutual induction
from a circuit some portion of which is necessarily of a solenoidal
form, or as regards the nature of the circuit the power given to
which we desire to measure.
   In view then of the present wide use of alternating currents for
industrial purposes, it might have been expected that this electro
meter method of measuring the power given by any intermittent or
alternating current to an inductive circuit would have been extensively
employed.       Unfortunately, however, as pointed out by one of us in
conjunction with Professor Perry,1' the use of this method is re
stricted by the fact that Sir W. Thomson’s quadrant electrometers do
not generally obey the mathematical law given for these instru
ments in text-books,¢ as it was supposed they did when this
clectrometer method of measuring power was <U+FB01>rst suggested.                      And
hence the main result that has, up to the present time, followed from
the publication of this method has been the stimulation of inventive
minds to devise forms of electrometers in which the text-book law is
strictly ful<U+FB01>lled.
    In 1888, Mr. Blakesley published a very ingenious method for
 using three dynamcmeters to measure the power given by an alternating
   * This method     was  simultaneously arrived at independently by Professor  Fitz
gerald.

   I  We may mention that an investigation on Quadrant Electrometers       has been
 going on from time to time at the Central Institution for the last <U+FB01>ve   years, and
 we had hoped to have communicated the complete report long before this to the
 Royal Society.

 1891.]    Power given by any Electric Um-rent          to  any Circuit.  425
 current to the primary coil of a transformer.            His original proof, a
 geometrical one, was based on various hypotheses, amongst others,
 that the primary and secondary currents and the magnetic <U+FB02>uxwere
 sine functions of the time.
    Recently, one of us, in conjunction with Mr. Taylor, has published*
an analytical proof showing that Mr. Blakesley’s three dynamometer
 method of measuring power gives equally true results, whatever
 functions the currents and magnetic <U+FB02>ux be of the time. There still
 however, remains a serious objection to this method, viz., that it
assumes the absence of magnetic leakage in the transformer, or in
 other words, that the number of lines of force embraced by one con
 volution of the primary coil at any moment is the same as the number
of lines of force embraced by one convolution of the secondary.
 Further, the three dynamometer method cannot be used to measure
the power given to a single circuit, as the coils of one of the dynamo
 meters have necessarily to be put in different circuits.
    The employment of an electromagnetic wattmeter for the measure
 ment of electric power is well known, and investigators have con
 sidered the error that is introduced into wattmeter measurements
 made with alternating currents on account of the <U+FB01>ne-wire circuit
of the wattmeter possessing self-induction.              This <U+FB01>ne-wire circuit
 usually consists of a suspended coil in series with a so-called non
 inductive stationary high resistance, and various devices have been
 adopted by different experimenters to make the effective self-induction
  of this <U+FB01>ne-wire circuit nought. One of the simplest of these devices
_We
      venture to think is that proposed by one of us in conjunction with
 Mr. Mather, and which consists in winding the stationary so-called
 non-inductive resistance in such a way that the capacity of this
 doubly-wound coil practically neutralises the e<U+FB01>ect of the self-induc
 tion of the suspended coil.
                                       II.
    Several months ago, however, while working at alternate current
 interference, we noticed that it was possible to employ an extremely
 simple method, based on the di<U+FB01>erence of phase of the P.D. and the
 current, for measuring the power by any current to any circuit. This
 method, which has since been in regular use in the laboratories of the
 Central Institution, is quite independent of any assumptions as to the
 nature of the current, or of the circuit, the power given to which it is
desired to measure, and it has the further great advantage that the
only measuring instrument required is the ordinary alternate-current
 voltmeter of commerce.
    In series with the circuit at (<U+FB01>g. 1), the power given to which we
 desire to measure, connect a non-inductive resistance be of r ohms.

alternate current ammeter, of course, if alternate currents be em
ployed) can be inserted in the circuit. Let A be the reading of this
ammeter, and which represents the square root of the mean square of
the current, then, for 'r in (1) we may substitute 72/11, or

   When employing this last formula, the non-inductive resistance
be  may be that offered by incandescent lamps, since there is no objec
tion to the resistance varying with di<U+FB01>erent mean strengths of the
current employed.
   This voltmeter method of measuring power was arrived at quite
independently of the electrometer method referred to above, but an
examination of the electrometer method shows that it is practically
equivalent to simultaneous measurements of three P.Ds.
                                    III.
   The method which we have described for measuring the ‘power
given by any current to any circuit may be conveniently employed for
measuring the power given to an alternating-current are, or to an alter
nating-current arc-lamp.     It is known that an alternating-current arc
requires a greater current than a direct-current arc to produce the same
light with similar carbons; for example, a 10-ampere direct-current
lamp requires 12% amperes, or 25 per cent. larger current, when used
with an alternating current. In a masterly paper on “ The Theory
of Alternating     Currents,” read before the Society of Telegraph
Engineers, on November 13th, 1884, Dr. Hopkinson refers to a law
           J
given by oubert, that the di<U+FB01>erence of potential between the carbons
in an alternating arc is of approximately constant numerical value
throughout the period, and that it reverses sign discontinuously at
each reversal of the current.      Using this law as his basis, heyworks
out mathematically some very curious relationships between the
variations of current and P.D. with time.
   Three of our senior students, Messrs. Kolkhorst, Thornton, and
Weekes, have been making a number of experiments on the power
supplied to alternating-current arcs by using the method of measur
ing power described above. From these experiments it would appear
that the quality of the carbon employed a<U+FB01>ects materially the differ
ence in phase between the currents passing through the are and the
P.D. between the carbons. If the are be quite steady and only give
out the rhythmic hum that accompanies a good arc, such as can be
obtained with cored carbons of proper quality, the arc appears to
                                                  J
 act practically as a simple resistance, and M. oubert’s law does not
 hold.  But if the are be maintained between uncored carbons of poor

428         Prof. W. E. Ayrton and Dr. W. E. Sumpner.                [Apr. 9,
quality,   and  be hissing, there is considerable di<U+FB01>erence in phase
between the current and the P.D. between the terminals; further,
the experiments     show that current is very far from being a sine
function of the time, although produced by a dynamo          whose E.M.F.
                                                   I
normally   follows a harmonic   law.
   We do not purpose, in this communication, to enter at length into
these experiments on alternate-current arcs, but a few examples of
the experimental results that have been obtained will be interesting
as illustrating the ready applicability of this new method of measur
ing power to such investigations.
   In addition to the difference of phase of P.D. and current that may
be produced in the arc itself, there is the electromagnet         to be con
sidered by which the distance between the carbons is usually regu
lated in arc lamps. This electromagnet will introduce lag between
the P.D. at the terminals of the lamp and the current passing
through the electromagnet and the arc in series; and hence, even
although the are be perfectly steady, we <U+FB01>nd, even in the case of a
Brush lamp especially intended for alternate currents, that the true
power supplied to the electromagnet and are is 20 per cent. less than
the product of the readings of the ammeter and the voltmeter
attached to the lamp terminals, and which gives the square root of
the mean product of the squares of the current and P.D.
   If, however, the are be between common carbons and be hissing, the
difference, we <U+FB01>nd, is much greater.     With cored carbons this Brush
lamp requires a PD. of about 35 volts to be maintained between its
terminals, but if these cored carbons be replaced by common
carbons and the are be hissing, the P.D. between the terminals
of the lamp at once rises to 45 or even 50 volts, although the
current passing through the lamp and the amount of light given out
remain practically as before.     And then we <U+FB01>nd that the true power
supplied to the lamp may be only one-half of the square root of the
mean product of the squares of the current and P.D., so that the
readings of the ammeter and voltmeter alone make the apparent
power twice as great as the true power.
   For the purpose of easily estimating the ratio of the true to the
apparent power supplied, formula (3) may be thus written,
                        (_Vi'l'V2_‘V)(Vi'l"V2+V)      n e I I OQI  I IIQQ
from which we see that the expression in the brackets represents the
ratio of the true to the apparent power supplied to the lamp or other
circuit ab (<U+FB01>g. 1). Hence the percentage error made in assuming
that the power supplied to any circuit was the product of the am
meter and voltmeter readings would be in all cases, whatever the
nature of the current or of the circuit,

  The experiments   already described tell us that a hissing arc may
cause a considerable phase di<U+FB01>erence between the RD. and the
current, but they do not enable us to decide whether such an arc
causes the current to lag behind the P.D., or to lead in front of it. To
decide this point, that is, to ‘decide whether  hissing arcacts like an a
inductive coil, or a condenser, a variety of experiments were made by
putting induction or capacity in series with the arc. The following
gives the result of one such experiment :—In' series with a hand
regulated lamp (and, therefore, containing‘ no electrornagnet), was
placed a condenser of 89 microfarads (<U+FB01>g. 4).       Uncored carbons
were used, and they were adjusted so that the arc was very short at
<U+FB01>rst; the carbons were then not touched, and, as they burnt away,
the arc grew longer and longer until     <U+FB01>nally went out. The fre

           It is interesting to notice that the Lp for the hissing are alone is
       actually greater than the Lp for the regulating electromagnet.
           The values given above for 7', being obtained by dividing the two
       watts by the mean square of the current in amperes, are the effective
       resistances in ohms—whether the current follows a harmonic law or
       not.    Hence, by comparing the value of 1' for the regulating electro

       magnet alone with its resistance in ohms, measured with a steady
       current, we have a true measure of the waste of energy in the iron
       core of the electromagnet due to hysteresis and Foucault currents.
       Now the resistance of‘ this electromagnet for a steady current is only
       0065 ohm; hence 90 per cent. of the energy given to the regulating
       clectromagnet of this Brush lamp is wasted in heating its iron core
       when the frequency is 200. Here again we have a further illustration
       of the importance of being able to measure, by means of the simple
       method we have described, the power given by any current to any

 ordinary practice.    If then there were a positive or a negative error
 of 1 per cent. in each of the measurements of V, V], and V2, there
 would be a probable error of from 4 to 5 per cent. in the measure
ment of the power.      The probable percentage error in the measure
ment of the power being from 4 to 5 times the error in the
measurement of each of the P.Ds. arises partly from the fact that
the expression for VV, being
                                           W),

depends directly on the difference in the mean squares of the P.Ds.,
and not on the difference of the square roots of the mean squares.
And    as all instruments that are graduated for measuring the square
root of the mean square of an alternating P.D. such as a hot-wire
voltmeter, an electrostatic voltmeter, &c., really measure the mean
square and not the square root of the mean square directly, it would
be better, if such an instrument were to be employed for the method
of measuring power described in this paper, that it should be
graduated in mean squares of-P.Ds. and not in the square roots of
the mean squares.     In that case a similar line of reasoning to that
employed above shows that the probable percentage error in the
measurement of power by the method would be from 2 to 2'5 times
the error in the measurement of each of the P.Ds.
   It is, of course, clear that these errors to which we have been
referring are not errors in any way essential to the method proposed
for measuring power, since by the employment of an accurately
graduated voltmeter, by exercising care in taking the readings, and
if necessary, by repeating the measurements two or three times and
taking the means of the observations, the power can be measured to
any degree of accuracy desired.

   The calculation of the power from formula (1) is easy, especially
when the voltmeter is graduated to read the mean squares of the
P.Ds. and not the square roots of the mean squares. If, however, as
is usually the case. the scale is graduated in square roots, then even
the trouble of taking the squares may be saved, when V,-§-V does
not differ much from V, by using the following method :—

to 17,, and let

      ilfeasuring the Power given out                     by   an Alternate-Current Dynamo.
  In consequence of the trouble usually experienced in correctly
measuring the power given to an inductive circuit,   usual when                        it   is
measuring the power given out by an alternate-current dynamo to
use for the outside circuits various resistances, all of which are as far
as practicable non-inductive. But as the construction of adjustable
non-inductive high resistances that will take large currents a trouble                           is
some matter, we suggest the following as a convenient method of
overcoming the necessity of employing such a non-inductive circuit :—
  Let the circuit external to the dynamo be ac (fig. 1), only a
portion of which       non-inductive; then,
                               is                V,, V2, and    have the if                    V                 ~
values already given them,         easy to show that the power given to
                                               it   is
both the inductive and non-inductive portion of, an that is, to the
whole circuit external to the dynamo,                              is
                                         I

   And we anticipate that, only a small portion be of the circuit be
                                             if
strictly non-inductive, this voltmeter method of measuring the power
given out by an alternate-current dynamo will give more accurate

inductive circuit is really non-inductive, and, therefore, that the

force if the latter exceeds a certain minimum value.
   9. The author has investigated these phenomena by means of ring
cores constructed               of iron wire (annealed) covered with insulating
material overwonnd with insulated copper-wire coils, the latter being
wound in every case in a helix returning axially upon itself, so that
the current in‘ this copper wire should have null effect in directly
generating any induced electromotive forces along the iron-wire core.
   10. The e<U+FB01>eots obtained are considered by the author to be akin to
those obtainedbby Villari,"‘ in 1865, by the mechanical agitation of
iron bars through which electric currents had been previously passed,
and, like the effects of\ Villari, to be due to the production and sub
sequent disappearance of a circular magnetisation.                             They are also
akin to those observed by Hughesf with the induction balance.
   11. The author has beenable to imitate and reproduce these e<U+FB01>ects
by the use of copper-‘wires immersed in iron‘ <U+FB01>lings, and surrounded
by a magnetisilngwcoil wound so as to returmaxially upon itself.

 I. “On the Causes which produce the Phenomena of New
       Stars.”    By J. NORMAN LOOKYER, F.R.S.                  Received
       November 28, 1890.
                                 (Abstract)
   In   communications    to the Society during the last four years, I
 have produced evidence to show that many so-called stars are com
 posed of swarms of meteorites, and are increasing their temperature.
 Taking a normal case of an undisturbed.-swarm,         I have shown, by
              “              curve,”
 means of a     temperature           the spectra given by the same mass
of meteorites in its evolution from a nebula to a condensed and nearly
cold body.      In considering this question, the appearance of the so
         “ New Stars ” was
called                       referred to, and it was suggested that such
appearances might be due to the collision of meteor-swarms or
streams in space, an idea which I <U+FB01>rst put forward with regard to
Nova Cygni in 1877.
   It became obvious that a complete discussion of these phenomena
would afford a.valuable test of the general hypothesis, for thereason
that such bodies, instead of going forward along the temperature
curve, should go back as they -cooled and became invisible.
   All the observations have, therefore, been brought together and
discussed from this point of view, the investigation having special
reference to the sequence of spectroscopic changes from the <U+FB01>rst
appearance of a new star to its <U+FB01>nal disappearance.
   The various theories which have been put forward since the appear
ance of the new star of 1572 are referred to in the paper, and these
are followed by a general statement of the meteoritic theory of the
origin of new stars.     The remaining part of the paper consists of a
detailed discussion of all the observations of new stars which have
been made, and the <U+FB01>nal result is a complete justi<U+FB01>cation of the con
clusion arrived at from the <U+FB01>rst survey that “new stars, whether
seen in connexion with nebulae or not, are produced by the clash of
meteor-swarms.”      Some of the chief points may be referred to here.

444            Mr.  J. Norman Lockyer.            On    the Causes        [API‘. 16,
   The investigation has shown that there is a close relation between
the spectra of comets and the spectra of new stars, but whereas in
comets only one swarm has to be considered, in new stars there are
two swarms which may or may not be equally dense or of equal
dimensions.       The spectrum of a new star is therefore a compound
one.    We have, in fact, a mixed radiation and absorption spectrum
similar to that presented by a variable like Mira. Ccti when at its
maximum brilliaucy.                               I
                            In another paper have shown that variables
of the Mira type are really double swarms, and hence the conclusion
that the di<U+FB01>erence between this class of variables and new stars is
only a di<U+FB01>erence in the orbits of the subsidiary swarms.
    Omitting Nova (U) Orionis, which proved to be only a long period
variable, only three new stars have been spectroscopically observed;
namely, Nova Coronas (1866), Nova Cygni (l876—77), and Nova
                                                                             '
Andromedae (1885).
    In Nova Coronas, when <U+FB01>rst observed,           a spectrum of bright lines
was superposed upon       one  of  dark..lines.     The absorption phenomena
were similar to those characteristic of stars like 1 Orionis, and the
chief radiation was ‘that of hydrogen.           A discussion of the observa
tions suggests that two of the ill-de<U+FB01>ned lines in the blue may have
been due to carbon.       In the discussion of cometary phenomena which
I  have previously communicated           to the Society,      I  pointed out that
in many cases the blue band appeared to have two maxima, one at
>t 468 and one at X 473, and it is more than probable that the two
lines of the Nova were identical with those of comets?
    In comets, the blue band, whether. single or double, is generally
admitted to be due to carbon, from its association with the undoubted
carbon band in the green, and the same origin is therefore probable
in the case of the Nova. Whatever the origin of the two lines in
Nova Coronas, the fact of their being common to comets and a new
star is the point      I   am anxious to bring out.               The F line was
recorded throughout the whole period of observation, and another
bright line, apparently coincident with the chief nebula line, was
recorded by Messrs. Stone and Carpenter.
    The suggestion that a new star is produced by the collision of two
meteor-swarms or streams is fully borne.~out by the discussion of the
observations of Nova Coronas.           The mixed phenomena of absorption
and radiation which       were    observed    are simply and sufficiently ex
plained on this supposition.          An attempt is made in the paper to
   * Note, April 4.—Tl1e band in question is also probably identical with the one
seen in some of the stars of the Wolf-Rayet type.       Dr. and Mrs. Huggins have
recently made observations of some of these stars which have led them to conclude
that the band is not due to carbon (‘ Roy. Soc. Proc.,’ vol. 49, p. 33). I am not yet
convinced on thi point, but  I shall take another opportunity of replying to their
remarks.

 1891.]        which produce the Phenomena      of ‘New Stars.         445
show that the spectrum of the Nova can be reproduced by integrating
the spectrum of a comet at a certain temperature, and a nebula of a
certain degree of condensation.        The resulting spectrum di<U+FB01>ers only
very slightly from that of the Nova, and the di<U+FB01>erences can be
accounted for by dif<U+FB01>culties of observation.
   Nova Cygni is by far the most important new star which has
appeared in spectroscopic times.       Numerous observations were made,
and they are, on the whole, in reasonable agreement.             The most
complete observations were made by Vogel.         When <U+FB01>rst observed, the
spectrum consisted of several bright lines       and <U+FB01>utiugs, the lines of
hydrogen being very conspicuous.        As the star gradually faded away,
there was a general diminution in the number and brightness of the
lines, but the most striking feature was the brightening of the line in
the green, near X500, which is generally accepted to            the nebula
line, as the other lines faded. Finally, the spectrum consisted solely
of the line 500. The discussion indicates that, in addition to hydrogen,
there was the radiation of carbon vapour, the <U+FB02>utings seen being those
which are most frequently observed in comets. They are, however,
modi<U+FB01>ed by the superposition ‘of the spectra of other substances.
Practically all the lines and <U+FB02>utings seen in the spectrum of Nova
 Cygni can be explained by reference to laboratory work at low tem
peratures.    As in the case of Nova Coronae, the spectrum of Nova
Cygni    can be reproduced by integrating the spectra of bodies which
we have reason to believe are swarms of meteorites.      Several examples
of this are given in the paper. In the earlier stages, it is necessary
to integrate the spectra of at least three swarms of different degrees
of condensation, but as the spectrum became simpler, two are suffi
cient.     The compound origin and character of the spectrum of a
Nova is thus clearly indicated.      It is not to be supposed from these
integrations that   in the <U+FB01>rst instance there are really three or more
swarms engaged.       A Nova is probably produced by the collision of
only   two  swarms,  but the resulting mixed swarm is so complicated
that we can only represent it by assuming at least three temperature
conditions. There will be the temperatures corresponding to each of
the central condensations, and that corresponding to the outliers.      As
the swarm cools, the temperature becomes more equal throughout, and
<U+FB01>nally the swarm resembles a planetary nebula.
   The spectrum of Nova Andromeda: was at no time a very striking
one, and was always difficult to observe.      It was also further compli
cated by being superposed upon the then imperfectly recognised
spectrum of the Great Nebula, in which it was involved.               The
spectrum was almost continuous, with brighter portions here and
there, which could only be measured with dit<U+FB01>culty.         Consequently,
the results obtained by di<U+FB01>erent observers are somewhat discordant.
The discussion shows that what was really observed after the star had

4-L6                On the Phenomena     of lvew Stars.         [Apr. 16,
faded was nothing more than       the spectrum of the nebula itself‘, as
might-be expected. Owing to the difficulty of making the observa
tions, the apparent variations of the spectrum from day to day may
not be real, and it is hopeless to attempt to explain them by a
reference to the effects produced by a gradual fall of temperature.     As
the star only fell two magnitudes during the whole period of spectro
scopic observation,   the change of temperature would not be so great
as   in Nova Cygni, and the variations would not be so well marked.
No lines or bands, however, were on any occasion recorded in the
spectrum with which we are not familiar in other bodies which, there
is evidence to show, are meteoritic swarms.        A diagram shows that
 the spectrum of the Nova, as seen by Copeland, on October 1, can be
 reproduced by adding the spectrum of hydrogen to that of the
 nebula.
    It  is next pointed out that the theoretical sequence of phenomena
 in the spectrum of a Nova produced by- the collision of two swarms of
 different densities is in strict accordance with the partial sequences
 actually observed.
    A discussion of the colour phenomena shows also that in Nova we
 have to deal with mixed swarms, the colours at certain stages being
 compound ones.
    In my former    paper, I have  shown that carboniradiation is one of
 the chief characteristics of uncondensed meteor-swarms, and the dis
 cussion of the new stars has revealed the fact that carbon is also one
 of the chief characteristics of their spectra, though modi<U+FB01>ed by other
 substances.
    The observed changes in magnitudes of Novae are also in accord
 ance with the collision theory.    The .rapid .fading away demonstrates
  most conclusively that small bodies, and not large ones, are in ques
 tion.
    The observations with which      I have hadto deal have often been
 imperfect, owing to the di<U+FB02>iculty of observing this class of bodies,
 and dilferent observers have frequently disagreed with regard to some
 of the spectroscopic details, but still, as I have endeavoured to show,
  most of the discrepancies   can be reconciled  when di<U+FB02>iculties of obser
  vation are allowed for.

 II. “An    Attempt to determine the Adiabatic Relations of Ethyl
       Oxide.    Part I. Gaseous Ether.” By W. RAMSAY, F.R.S..
       Professor of Chemistry in University College, London, and
       E. P. PERMAN, B.Sc. Received March 16, 1891.
                                (Abstract. )
    The object of the research described in the memoir is the determi
nation of the behaviour of ether in the state of gas approaching
towards the state of liquid, when heat is communicated to it, so as to
alter its condition adiabatically.
    Previous researches by one of the authors in conjunction with
Dr. Sydney Young have yielded data regarding the relations of
pressure, temperature, and volume of gaseous and of liquid ether
from which tte values of the isobaric and of the isochoric differentials
are obtainable.    Such results lead directly to a knowledge of the
differences between the speci<U+FB01>c heats at constant pressure and those
at constant volume ; and these di<U+FB01>erences are not constant,‘ but vary
with varying volume, pressure, and temperature.
    The memoir contains an account of experiments made to determine
the ratio between the speci<U+FB01>c heats at constant pressure and those at
constant volume.       The velocity of sound in gaseous ether was
determined at various temperatures, pressures, and volumes; and by
means of the isothermal differentials, and the experimental results
for the velocity of sound, the ratios between the two speci<U+FB01>c heats
were calculated.    From the di<U+FB01>erences and the ratios of the speci<U+FB01>c
heats, the values of the speci<U+FB01>c heats were deduced.
    The general conclusion is that, for any constant volume, the speci<U+FB01>c
heat, whether at constant volume or at constant pressure, decreases
to a    limiting value with rise of temperature, and subsequently
increases; and that the change with temperature is more rapid, the
smaller the volume.
    At large volumes, the speci<U+FB01>c heats tend towards independence of
temperature     and volume, while at small volumes, the in<U+FB02>uence of
change of temperature and volume is very great.
    The authors are at present investigating similar relations for liquid
ether.

           Hi.   “ On the                      of the Lines in the Spark
                          Physical Characters
                 Spectra of the Elements.”    By W. N. HARTLEY, F.R.S.,
                 Professor of Chemistry, Royal College of Science, Dublin.
                 Received March 18, 1891.
              The properties of the atoms are         a       periodic function of their
           masses, and the physical characteristics of the spectra of the elements
           appear to be an expression of the properties of the atoms; for there
           is undoubtedly an intimate connexion between the rays emitted by
           the self-luminous vapours of the elements and their chemical and
           physical properties.
              If we photograph the spark spectra of thirty or forty of the
           elements and arrange the spectra in groups following the periodic
           law, the arrangement will be seen to be a perfectly natural one. This
           observation applies not only to the groupings of the lines, but also to
           the physical characteristics of the individual lines. In spark spectra,
           the three most striking characteristics are (1) an extension of certain
           lines above and below that part of the spectrum bounded by the
           points of the two electrodes; (2) the nimbus which surrounds the
           extremities of the lines, even to some extent those portions which
           form an extension; and (3) the continuous spectrum which forms the
           background to the lines.
              (1.) On the Extension   of    the I/ines.—The spark discharge, as shown
           by Perrot, is composed of two parts, of which the <U+FB01>ery track, or
           central portion,    is   a statical discharge, and the aureole, or <U+FB02>ame,
           is dynamical, and capable of electrolytic action.
              From careful observation          of the sparks, and photographs of
           spectra,I    have come to regard all those spectra with lines extended
           as spectra of diiferent discharges taken simultaneously.          The principal
           lines lying between point and point of the electrodes are spectra of
           the <U+FB01>ery path of the spark; the extension of the principal lines above
           and below the points of the electrode appear to be spectra of the
           aureole.   The principal observation which leads to this conclusion         is
           that the electrodes are seen to glow silently and continuously above
           and below the points of the upper and lower electrodes, and frequently
           slight roughnesses present the appearance of brightly but steadily
           shining dots; particularly    is    this the case with those metals which
           exhibit the most extended lines, as for instance, cadmium, thallium,
           and indium. The lines in many spectra are free from this extension,
           and no glow    is  observed on the electrodes.         A study of about thirty
           different spectra of the metals and semi-metallic substances has led
           to the following observation.
              Elements which are difficult    to  rolatilise, and those which are bad con
           ductors of  electricity, do not exhibit   spectra with extended lines; and, con

  36329 ; the last of these, which form a well-marked triplet, is by far
  the most extended.                 The pair of lines 31304 and 31245 are greatly
   extended, and the same remark applies to 29664 and 294166.

and mercury spectra were measured on my enlargements.                     The prin
cipal portion of the lines lying between point and point of the elec
trode was 42 mm. in all spectra.           The extension of the lines below was
22 mm. to 25 mm., extension above, 9 mm. to 10 mm.                   As the exten
sion is always sharp and well de<U+FB01>ned, it is an important feature in
these spectra. Even concentrated solutions of the metals, when photo
graphed with graphite electrodes, exhibit this extension in their
principal lines.         For instance a solution of beryllium chloride shows
a very remarkable extension above and below the points of the upper
and lower electrodes ; the dimensions of the principal line, wave
length 31302, are as follows : between the points, 42 mm.; below,
10‘-5 mm.; above, 17'5 mm.            It is at the upper or positive electrode
that the longest extension is observed, but at the lower or negative
electrode that it is strongest.         In the case of the cadmium lines, the
extension is smaller, but strong at the side of the negative electrode,
and very <U+FB01>ne and long at that of the positive!‘               The appearance of
lines due to impurities or traces of metals in the spectrum of the
negative electrode only, I have attributed to the oscillation of the
spark discharge, and the fact that the negative electrode is the h0tter.'l'
     (2.) The N imbus.—The nimbus is not apparently dependent on the
volatility or the oxidisability of the vapour of the elements, though
these properties are connected therewith.
    By far the largest nimbus is that of magnesium; those of cadmium
and mercury stand next in order ; the smallest are those of platinum,
gold, copper, and silver. It is thus evident that neither conductivity
nor vapour density controls it, for there is very little nimbus on the
lines of the thallium and iridium spectra; but volatility certainly
increases it.       There is a considerablenimbus on some of the lines in
the spectra of arsenic, antimony, and bismuth; also on a few lines of
tin and of lead. In the case of magnesium, the cause of the dense
and large nimbus is probably the intensity of the chemical action of
which the rays of the incandescent vapour are capable, together with
the large quantity of metal in the track of the spark, owing to its
volatility.                                                   ,
    The chemical activity of the zinc rays is less than that of the rays of
magnesium, but the e<U+FB01>ect of this is overbalanced by the density of the
vapour and the volatility of the metal being both greater; accordingly
the lines of zinc have a large nimbus. The nimbus is somewhat larger
on the lines of cadmium than on those of zinc, the volatility and the
density of the vapour are both greater.
   *  In a paper published in the ‘Scienti<U+FB01>c Proceedings of the Royal Dublin
Society,’ on the constitution of electric sparks, this does not appear in the litho

   The nimbus is evidently an expression of the quantity of matter
in the spark, and the intensity of the chemical action which the rays
emitted by its ignited vapour are capable of exerting.
    (3.) On the Continuous Spectrum which forms the Background to the
Lines of certain Spectra.-—This must be caused by the ignition either
of some solid substance or of a vapour which is not that of an
element but an oxide.        An examination of the spectra in which the
continuous background of rays is a conspicuous feature discloses the
fact that the metals which are not oxidisable do not possess                it,
                                                                           for
instance, gold, silver, and platinum.         Metals of the iron group show
it  near the points of the electrodes when the non-volatile oxides are
formed.      The very volatile metals with volatile oxides, such as
mercury, iridium, thallium, zinc, and cadmium, do not show it.
     Spectra of the metalloids, such as tellurium, arsenic, antimony, and
bismuth, which are not only volatile but which form volatile oxides,
show  it    very strongly.      Ordinarily, magnesium does not show it,
because the exposure necessary for photographing the spectrum of
that element       less by one-half the period of the others, and by one
                   is
quarter that of tellurium. When            a plateis  long exposed to the rays
of magnesium, the continuous spectrum appears at the points of the
electrodes where the non-volatile oxide would be formed.               It may
be considered that in the passage of the spark, the vapour of the
element <U+FB01>lls the track, and this vapour, on cooling, forms, for a
minute period of time, an incandescent oxide, and, the spectrum of
 this being a continuous spectrum, its photograph appears as            aback
 ground   to  the rays  emitted   by the  element.
    _But it   is nevertheless   the  fact that the continuous background
 is a very characteristic feature of the metalloids, though why the
 vapours of these oxides should produce this action more conspicu
 ously than those of the oxides of the volatile metals, there seems to
 be no su<U+FB02>icient or well-understood reason to be advanced at present.
 It may be that the vapours of the metalloids in cooling emit con       a
 tinous spectrum for short period prior to oxidation.

     On the Breadth      of1'/ines.~It     well known that, under identical
                                          is
 conditions, the principal lines in the spectrum of an element become
  stronger and broader as the rays forming the spectrum proceed from
  a larger quantity of material, that       isto say, form a denser radiating
  layer.   It     evident, then, that in any series of three or more
                  is
 elements of similar character, the intensity and the breadth of the
 lines in their spectra will depend upon (1) intensity of chemical
 energy, (2) volatility and vapour density, and (3) electric conduc
 tivity of the metal.
     In accordance with these conditions, the lines of cadmium are
  broader than those of zinc, and the lines of zinc broader than those
                                       '

         By Sir HENRY E. Roscoe, F.R.S., D.C.L., LL.D., and
         JOSEPH LUNT. B.Sc., F.C.S.         Received April 23, 1891.
                                    (Abstract. )
      The present research contains the results of experiments on the
   chemical and bacteriological examination of sewage micro-organisms,
   made with the object, in the <U+FB01>rst place, of ascertaining what species
   are there present, and, in the second, of determining some of their
   chemical characteristics.
      The authors have isolated from crude sewage, by methods which
   are fully described, a number of organisms which may serve as
  typical examples of those usually present in this material.         Some of
  these   have already  been   described,  whilst others are  believed    to be
                                                                        '
  new organisms.
'     The microscopic and macroscopic appearances of the organisms and
  their pure cultures have been carefully recorded by means of photo
  graphs, which give in a permanent form their morphological characters
  and the plate- and tube-cnltivations in their most characteristic stages
  of growth. This method of illustration the authors consider to be of
  much importance, as bacteriological descriptions of organisms are
  frequently of little value for the want of accurate representations of
  the microscopic preparations and pure cultures.
      The experiments described were undertaken with the object of
  studying the reactions 05 sewage organisms from a chemical point of
  view, and of gaining information as to the rationale, both chemical
                                                                2 H 2

 and bacteriological, of the two marked changes which sewage is liable
 to undergo, i.e., on the one hand puri<U+FB01>cation, or the gradual destruc
 tion of putrescible matter without the formation of offensively smell
 ing products, and on the other putrefaetion.         It was desired to
 ascertain which organisms are concerned in the <U+FB01>rst of these processes
 and which in the second, as likewise to gain an insight into the
 methods by which such changes are effected.
     For all the organisms described, the authors have determined the
 absorptive power for free oxygen when cultivated in a perfectly pure
 state, and also for which of the organisms free oxygen is a necessity
 of their activity and growth.
     Each organism has been examined as to its power of growth in a
 liquid medium from which every trace of free oxygen, both gaseous
 and dissolved, has been rigorously excluded.
     It is shown that anaerobic organisms associated with putrefaction,
 although able to grow in complete absence of oxygen, yet when that
 gas is present are able to absorb it rapidly, and thus prepare the con
 ditions for their anaerobic growth.
     The following methods for the isolation of micro-organisms have
been used :—
     (1.) The method of gelatine plate-culture.
     (2.) A method, fully described, for the isolation and cultivation of
anaerobic organisms.
           A method for the isolation of spore-forming organisms.
     (4.) The dilution method.
    The method used for the isolation of anaerobic organisms consists
in their cultivation in a specially devised form of <U+FB02>ask containing
sterile nutrient broth, through which liquid could be passed a stream
or pure hydrogen, freed from all traces of oxygen by passing over
 glass beads, in two Emmerling’s tubes, moistened with alkaline pyro
gallate.
    As the authors have shown in a previous paper (‘ Chem. Soc.
Journ.,’ 1889, Trans., p. 554), this treatment frees the liquid com
pletely ‘from dissolved oxygen.
    Crude sewage was carried through three cultivations in pure
hydrogen, when it was found that not only had all aerobic organisms
been eliminated, but only one form of anaerobic organism appeared,
viz., Proteus vulgaris, and this method may be used for its isolation.
Several other organisms, although isolated by di<U+FB01>erent methods to
the above, were found to grow in the pure state in nutrient broth
from which all traces of free oxygen had been excluded.        These are
fully described in the paper.
    In the method for the isolation of spore-forming organisms, all
others were eliminated by heating the sterile broth, in which
sowing had been made from crude sewage. to 80° C. for ten minutes.

   The still living spores were then further isolated by plate cultivation,
   either with or without previous incubation of the broth tube.
       For the purpose of studying the absorptive power for free oxygen,
   pure cultures were sown in sealed <U+FB02>asks with two necks, containing
   25 c.c. of nutrient broth and 250 c.c. of air.    These were incubated at
   20—23° C. for seven days, after which time the <U+FB02>asks were opened
   and the gases remaining abstracted for analysis.         It was seen that
   the various organisms exhibited great differences in their absorptive
   power for free oxygen, some showing the feeblest absorption, whilst
   others abstracted nearly every trace of oxygen from an atmosphere
   ten times_ as large as the culture liquid during seven days’ incuba
   tion.
       The rate of absorption of dissolved oxygen was also determined for
   a number of the organisms by sowing tap- water aérated under known
   conditions, and containing a de<U+FB01>nite amount of dissolved oxygen,
   with 1 per cent. of a pure broth culture of the organism which had been
   incubated for two days after sowing. It is shown, in the case of
   those organisms which absorb oxygen rapidly from the air, that the
   water is completely de-aerated in fourteen hours.
       It is shown that certain organisms which are capable of growing in
   an atmosphere devoid of oxygen, i.e., anaerobic, are yet incapable of
   liquefying gelatine without the presence of that element, although
    when grown in air such liquefaction is extremely rapid.
       Cultivations were made in the form of <U+FB02>ask referred to for
   anaerobic organisms, in which the organisms were sown in molten
    gelatine, through which pure hydrogen was passed for half an hour.
    The <U+FB02>ask was then sealed. After <U+FB01>ve days’ incubation, no liquefaction
    whatever took place, although, when exposed to air, the normal rapid
    liquefaction of the gelatine afterwards occurred.
       It is also shown, both in the case of aerobic and anaerobic organ
    isms, that a very appreciable diminution of the liquefying power of
   organisms takes place after repeated sub-cultivation in nutrient
    gelatine.
       The method employed for photographing the micro-organisms is also
    described.     In all cases the bacteria were stained with methyl violet,
    but, as this stain transmits chemically active rays, it was necessary,
    in order to obtain actinic contrast, to use a coloured screen and iso
    chromatic plates.      The screen adopted (a weak solution of potassium
    bichromate) was spectroscopically adjusted to the stain employed, so
    that the objects appeared black on a bright yellow background. The
    apparatus employed was of the simplest kind, and the source of illu
    mination was a common duplex para<U+FB02>in lamp.
       The organisms isolated from the sewage under examination are
    described and illustrated photographically, as regards microscopic
    preparations and plate- and tube-cultures.           -

                                         India-rubber Tubes and Balloons
        when distended by Fluid Pressure.”                 By A. MALLDOK.
        Communicated          by LORD     RAYLEIGH,    Sec. R.S. Received
        March 16, 1891.
     WVhen an      india-rubber tube is expanded by internal <U+FB02>uid pressure,
it preserves its cylindrical form until the increase in its diameter
bears a certain proportion to its diameter when unstrained; but, when
more <U+FB02>uid is introduced, the condition of the tube becomes unstable,
                                                                     ‘
and the internal <U+FB02>uid pressure diminishes.
     When more <U+FB02>uid, therefore, is introduced into a length of tube
than will su<U+FB01>ice to expand it to its stable limit, it no longer remains
cylindrical throughout its length, but assumes the form of a cylinder
with one or more bulbous expansions ; and the diameter of the part
which remains cylindrical, though greater, of course, than the un~
strained diameter, is less than that attained at the stable limit in
     In the case of an elastic hollow sphere, although the spherical
form is retained, whatever be the amount of <U+FB02>uid introduced, there is
a similar limit to the pressure which the elastic reaction of its walls
can cause within it.                                               _
     If the thickness of the walls of the tube or sphere is small com
pared with the radius, and if, further, the material of which they are
composed be considered as incompressible,             while the other elastic
constants are invariable for such extensions as are involved (assump
tions which are approximately true for india-rubber), the value of the
 radius when instability begins, may readily be found.                   Taking
 5.2:, 6y, 8:: as the sides of any small cube of the material of the walls,
 em and      By being parallel to the tangent plane of the surface and Bz

to become 105.22.
     Since     the   material is incompressible,     8y and    éz,   under   the

      Some experiments were made with india-rubber pipes and balloons
  to see how nearly their behaviour conformed to the theory just
  given.
      Fig. 2 (p. 461) shows the apparatus employed.
      The india-rubber to be experimented on was placed in a large
  closed vessel, B, full of water.        Two pipes C and D passed through
  the stopper of B; of these C communicated with the interior of
  the experimental tube or sphere A, and D immediately with the
  contents of B. A pressure gauge was connected with Cf
      When tubes were being experimented on, the ends were closed
  with hard Wood discs, covered with parai<U+FB01>n, through the upper one of
   which C entered.      Fixed into the centre of the lower disc was a long
   straight wire, E, which passed freely through C, and the position of
   whose upper end, E’, could be read on the scale S.
      Water could be introduced into A by means of the pipe H con
   nected  with C.
      When every part of the apparatus was <U+FB01>lled with water, and the
   pressure gauge showed that the internal and external pressures on
   the india-rubber were equal, more water was admitted through C.
   The volume of water thus introduced was measured by the amount
   expelled through D. The pressure gauge showed the internal pressure
   in A, and the descent of E’ gave the elongation of the tube.
      The analysis of the results thus obtained is given by the curves in
   Diagram I.
      The experiments on spheres were made in the same way, except
   that the wire E was not used.

    The Presents received were laid on the table, and thanks ordered
for them.
    The following Papers were read       :
1.   “Cloud Photography conducted under the Meteorological
      Council at the Kew Observatory." By Lieut.-General R.
      STRACHEY, R.E., F.R.S., and G. M. WHIPPLE, Superintendent
      of the Observatory.       Received April 23, 1891.
    In 1878 the Meteorological Council decided upon undertaking a
series of experiments with the view of attempting by means of photo
graphy to obtain a record of the height and velocity of the clouds, as
indicating the movements of the upper parts of the atmosphere.            For
this purpose a plain cubical camera was constructed, with its optical
axis directed to the zenith, and a number of pictures of clouds were
thus obtained.       The results were so far satisfactory as to establish
the possibility    of identifying points in the clouds which would admit
of the calculation of their height with considerable precision.           But,
owing    to the small  <U+FB01>eld  of View  of   the lens made use of, it was found
that the opportunities of photographing clouds in this manner were of
somewhat rare occurrence, and it was therefore decided, on the pro
posal of Captain Abney, to whom the Meteorological Council is
indebted for his valuable advice throughout the course of these
experiments, to construct two cameras so arranged as to enable them
to be directed to any part of the sky, and thus to photograph clouds
 in all positions.
    For this purpose the cameras were <U+FB01>tted with theodolite mountings,
 provided with altitude and azimuth circles. The dark slides for
 carrying the sensitised plates were <U+FB01>tted with glass plates, upon
 which cross lines indicating the position of the optical axis were
etched.     These lines were photographed simultaneously with the
 clouds, and the readings of the divided circles, recorded at the time of
 exposure, thus supplied the altitude and azimuth of the point of the
 cloud covered by the intersection of the cross lines at that moment.
     From a photographic picture of a series of staves erected at known
 angular intervals, a scale of angular distances was obtained, by means

  468           Lieut.-General Strachey and Mr. Whipple.           [Apr.  30,.
  of which the azimuth and altitude of any point in the cloud picture
  could be deduced from those of the intersection of the cross lines.
     Arrangements were made for erecting these cameras at the ex
  tremities of a base of known length (800 yards), between which an
  electrical communication was established.
     Spring shutters were placed over the lenses, which could be libe
 rated and again closed, at the will of the observer, by the passage of
 an electric current, so as to expose the plates for any desired interval
  of time.
     Captain Abney also, after numerous trials, devised a. suitable for
 mula for an emulsion for coating the plates, as special precautions
 were found to be necessary in order to obtain good cloud photographs.
     Captain Abney thus describes the photographic process he pro
 posed :—“My attention has been once more directed to the best
 photographic process to employ for the delineation of the clouds, a
 certain inconvenience having attached to the use of collodion-emulsion,
 which at <U+FB01>rst      I had not foreseen.   I  had then recourse to gelatine
 plates,  but  the  manner  in which they  are  ordinarily prepared induces
 a sensitiveness which becomes unmanageable, even when a diaphragm
 with a small aperture is used in the lenses. The great desideratum
 in the plates appears to be that a small variation in the intensity of
 the light proceeding from the sky or cloud shall produce a great
 contrast in the intensity of the developed image. A very rapid plate
 does not answer for this purpose; hence           I tried several modi<U+FB01>ca
 tions.    The   process which  at present  has  given the best results is as
 follows :—
    “ 150
           grains of bromide of ammonium and 10 grains of iodide of
 potassium are dissolved in 3 oz. of water, to which 80 grains of
 Nelson’s No. 1 photographic gelatine and 80 grains of C0ignet’s
 gelatine have been added.       This is dissolved by the aid of heat, and
 200 grains of silver nitrate dissolved in 1% oz. of water are added.
 The whole is warmed to 100° F. for <U+FB01>ve minutes, and allowed to set
after being poured out in a <U+FB01>at dish. The emulsion thus produced is
 washed (in the usual manner) from the soluble salts, and is then
re-melted and plates coated and dried, as is customary in the gelatine
process.
    “ This formula gives very constant results, and great contrasts of
image are obtained by careful development.”
    The years 1881 to 1884 were passed in working out the details
of the arrangements        above described, and in 1885, after numerous
preliminary trials, it was resolved to erect the two cameras at the
Kew Observatory.         One was placed on the roof of the Observatory
building, and the other on a stand in the Old Deer Park, 800 yards
from the other, on the road leading to the Observatory from Rich
mond; and a telegraph cable carrying two insulated copper wires of

    1891.                     Cloud P/zotogr-aphy.                      469
   low resistance, buried a few inches below the surface of the ground,
  was laid between the two stands.       Switches, attached to telephones
   as well as to an electric battery, were <U+FB01>xed to these stands, and wires
   were arranged on the cameras, so that the observers could either
   communicate with one another, or work the exposing shutters of the
   two cameras at will.
      Operations for the determination of cloud height and motion were
  then carried out on suitable occasions, as follows :—The two observers,
   termed for convenience A and B, proceeded to their respective
  stations, each provided with a box containing half-a-dozen dark slides
  charged with sensitised plates, and also an adjusted watch.           The
  cameras were set up on the pedestals,       levelled, and the connecting
                    '
  wires joined up. Locking plates of peculiar construction were pro
  vided, which ensured that the zero points in azimuth of both cameras
  were exactly directed to the same point of the horizon.
      The observer at A, when he saw B had reached his station and
  placed his camera on the pedestal ready for use, attracted B's atten
  tion by means of a <U+FB02>ag waved overhead, and directed him through
  the telephone to set the instantaneous shutter of his camera, setting
  that of his own camera at A at the same time.         A then, making use
_of the push, sent a current of electricity through the two cameras,
  which should liberate both shutters at the same instant of time. An
  enquiry was immediately made through the telephone of B, and, if
 the reply assured A that the shutters were working satisfactorily, the
 observers proceeded to the second stage of the observation, which
 was as follows :—
     A carefully examined the sky and, selecting a suitable cloud,
 directed the sights on his camera towards it, making a convenient
 setting of the horizontal and vertical circles, which he then read off.
 He then told B to set his camera to the same azimuth and altitude,
 and insert a loaded plate-holder in its groove, repeating the circle
 readings to ensure accuracy, and also at the same time to set his
 shutter. A, whilst directing B througlrthe telephone, conducted the
 same series of operations at his own instrument, so that, as soon as
 B telephoned that he was ready for action, A switched the battery on
 to the line, and, watching the cloud for a favourable instant, touched
the push, whereby the two plates were exposed simultaneously, the
instant of the exposure being recorded by both observers in their respec
tive note-books.    They then quickly exchanged their plate-holders for
others containing fresh plates, and again set the shutters, so that by the
time sixty or seventy seconds had elapsed since the <U+FB01>rst exposure was
made they were ready for a second, which was carried out as before
under the directions of A, both observers again noting the time.
After this, A, having switched on the telephones, enquired of B if he
had obtained the two pictures. If the reply was in the a<U+FB01>irmative,
     von. xux.                                                   2 1

470           Lieut.-General Strachey and Mr. Whipple.       [Apr. 30,
he was directed to read both his circles, and to enter the readings,
with the times of the two exposures and the numbers of the plate
holders in his book, A doing the same for his own instrument.
   Having deposited the plate-holders in the light-tight carrying box,
another charged pair were taken, and a fresh cloud in another part of
the sky selected, and the operations already detailed were repeated,
until the stock of charged holders was exhausted.
   The observers then, by means of the telephones, again compared
their watches, and noting their dilferences, if any, sighted their
cameras on each other, and read their mutual bearings and altitudes.
This was done in order: to be sure no displacement had taken place in
either the orientation or level of the instruments.        They then
unlocked the stands, dismounted the cameras, and put them away in
the lockers of the pedestals, ready for use on another occasion, con
veying the plates to the photographic laboratory for development and
subsequent treatment.
   From time to time,     the empty plate-holders were taken out, the
lenses directed    to each other, and settings made and circles read
with   the view of determining the true bearings of the <U+FB01>ducial lines
before described, from which the angular position of the cloud-points
dealt with were obtained.
   On removal of the exposed plates from the holders, the dates of
the observation having been written on each of the <U+FB01>lms in pencil, as
well  as a   register number, development proceeded.    This was con
ducted    in a wooden tray with a glass bottom specially adapted to
hold four plates.      The two A's and two B’s forming one set of
pictures were usually selected for simultaneous development, in order
that the negatives obtained might possess the same degree of in
tensity.    Before hydrokinone became an article of commerce, a
solution of pyrogallic acid or sulphate of iron was employed as the
developing agent, but, since 1889, Edwards’s hydrokinone developer
has been employed by preference, as being less liable to produce
fogged plates.
   Owing to the efforts of the Kew observers being chie<U+FB02>y directed to
photographing high cirrus clouds, very careful and slow development
was required, to produce satisfactory negatives, and it has been
generally necessary to continue the operation for about forty minutes
to bring out a successful result. In some cases of very thin <U+FB01>lmy
cirrus, the so-called mare’s tail clouds, the development occupied
 1% hours, before the picture appeared.
   For discussion of the photographs, in most cases prints were made
of the negatives by the ordinary albuminised paper process.
   Various methods of obtaining the heights and velocity of motion of
 the clouds from the photographs thus made have been attempted.
 The computation by the ordinary trigonometrical formulae from the

azimuths  and altitudes derived by measurement of a series of points
in the clouds, properly identi<U+FB01>ed in the sets of pictures, is very
tedious, and a graphical method was suggested by Sir G. Stokes,
 which, though very ingenious, was found to be troublesome in prac
 tice, and was not persevered in.
    From the nature of the process employed, the inde<U+FB01>nite outlines of
the clouds, and their incessant change of form, complicated by the
 e<U+FB01>ects of perspective distortion on an irregular and ill-de<U+FB01>ned surface,
 it is necessarily impossible to identify cloud-points in the different
pictures with much precision 01' make exact measurements;             and
approximate results, therefore, are all that can be sought for.      The
object of the enquiry is chie<U+FB02>y to determine the velocity of movement
of clouds at varying heights above the earth’s surface and to obtain
the heights of those observed at the greatest elevations, which appear
as cirrus.

similar process will be found the distance Du and a height of the
cloud determined from Z1.
   The position of the point vertically under the selected cloud-point
will be determined with su<U+FB02>icieut accuracy graphically, by the inter
section of the two distances measured from the ends of a line drawn
to represent the base.
    The repetition of this process for the second set of photographs will
in like manner give the position of the cloud-point after the interval
elapsed between the taking of the two sets of pictures, and the dis
tance travelled being measured on the diagram, the velocity can be
found, and the direction of motion will be shown in relation to the
direction of the base.
    Irrespective of the laborious nature of this process, it was found
that the angles on which it was based were often so small that the
results obtained were inconsistent and unreliable.
    In 1890, therefore, it was decided to try another method of
observing, which would admit of much simpler treatment.           This was
 to <U+FB01>x the cameras so that the optical axes were directed to the zenith,
and to photograph clouds which passed across the <U+FB01>eld of view which
is comprised within a circle described at an angular distance of about
 15° round the zeniths of the two stations.     The defect of this method
is that it very materially limited the scope of operations, arid reduced
the opportunities of taking pictures to a comparatively small number,
for it was found that a large proportion of the clouds which seemed
apparently favourable for photographing when viewed by re<U+FB02>ected
solar light incident upon them at oblique angles became almost
invisible when observed directly overhead.         This was notably the
case   with cirrus, some  forms of which,  especially those possessing the
nature of cirro-stratus, appear as practically structureless masses
when seen in this position.      But notwithstanding these drawbacks,
some of which, it is hoped, may be obviated, the advantages of this
method of observing seem to be su<U+FB02>icient to lead to its adoption in
preference to any other yet suggested.
    To adapt the cameras for work in this manner, both altitude and
azimuth circles were permanently clamped, rendering them immovable
in both vertical and horizontal planes, and the locking plates were
shifted on the pedestals, so that, while the <U+FB01>ducial lines on the
pictures intersect at the zenith, the direction of one of them is that
of the line joining the two stations, or the base, the other being at
right angles to it.
    With the object of ensuring the proper adjustment of the optical
axes of the cameras, a tripod stand 12 feet in height was made, which
was temporarily erected immediately over them.           A plummet was
suspended directly above the lens-centre, from the point of intersec
tion of two horizontal wires <U+FB01>xed at right angles to one another, one

 of them being carefully made to coincide in direction with the line
 joining the two cameras.                                             _
     The charged dark- slides, which are separately numbered, so that the
 correction for each of them may be ascertained and recorded, are then
 successively placed in the camera and photographs taken of the cross
 wires overhead, the pictures of which should coincide with the <U+FB01>ducial
 lines of the camera, the position of which is as nearly as possible
 adjusted to secure this coincidence.      The photographs thus made are
 preserved, to supply data for correcting the negatives for any error of
 the <U+FB01>ducial lines, should the slides not be properly adjusted so as to
 secure the coincidence before spoken of.
    Assuming, as may be done without objection      for this purpose, that
 the cloud surface photographed and the earth’s surface at the place
 of observation are in parallel planes, distances measured on the photo
 graphs from the intersection of the <U+FB01>ducial lines will represent
tangents      of angles measured from the zenith to radius equal to the
 height   of  the cloud.
    Again, if a pair of photographs made simultaneously at the
 extremities of the base are superimposed one on the other, so that the
 forms of the clouds coincide, which they will do accurately if the
 pictures are properly placed, then the line joining the intersections of
 the cross lines will represent, both in magnitude and direction, the
 line joining the zeniths of the two ends of the base, from which the
 observations are made, or the base itself.
    If the adjustments before described have been satisfactorily made,
the base, as thus indicated, should obviously fall on one pair of the
 tiducial lines, which, when the photographs are superimposed, should
 also coincide; otherwise, if the <U+FB01>ducial lines in the two pictures are
 made to coincide, then the separation of points properly identi<U+FB01>ed in
 the pictures will be the measure of the parallax or angle subtended
 by the base at such points.
    A scale of angular distance      having been prepared    as before ex
plained, the parallax thus measured may at once be converted into
 angular measure, and the height of the cloud is given by the
equation
                                H =   ,8/tan 1r,
where    1r is the angular parallax.
    In like manner, if two photographs taken from the same point with
an interval of time between them be superimposed, so that the cloud
pictures coincide, the line joining the intersections of the cross lines
will represent in magnitude and direction the movement or drift of
the cloud, and the velocity in miles per hour will be found from the
equation

where   5 and p are the  drift and parallax as measured on the photo
graphs, and the interval in seconds between the pictures being taken.
              t
    The method of reduction of the photographs <U+FB01>rst adopted and em
ployed during the early part of the past summer was as follows :—
Prints were made on albuminised paper of the set of four pictures,
two taken at each end of the base with an interval of time between
them, and they were mounted on stout cards in order to avoid the
usual curling up of the paper. When necessary, new <U+FB01>ducial lines
were then drawn in the proper direction through the points that had
been ascertained to represent the corrected position of the lines of
reference as before described, and these lines were extended to the
margins of the cards.
   If possible, <U+FB01>ve or six cloud-points were then selected in each print,
capable of satisfactory identi<U+FB01>cation.      A sheet of paper was next
procured, larger than the pictures, and lines intersecting at right
angles were drawn across it.      Punctures were then made, by means
of a needle, through all the selected cloud-points in the four pictures,
which were successively placed over the reference sheet (termed here
after the receiver), so that the <U+FB01>ducial lines upon the pictures coin
cided with the lines drawn upon the receiver, thereby ensuring the
points of intersection being directly superimposed, and, by means of
a needle passed through the pricked holes, the marked cloud-points
were transferred to the receiver.
    This having been done in turn for all the four pictures of the set,
the points thus pricked off were joined by inked lines, those obtained
from the pair of pictures taken simultaneously being drawn in black
ink, and those from the other pair in red, by which a series of
parallelograms was formed, equal in number to the number of points
selected for treatment.
    The black lines or sides of these parallelograms then represented
the parallax of the several cloud-points, being proportional in length
to the tangent of the angle subtended by the base line at the altitude
of the cloud, whilst the red lines forming the other two sides of the
quadrilaterals represented on the same scale the drift of the cloud
during the interval which elapsed between the taking of the two sets
of pictures.
    The measurement of these black and red lines provided the means
already explained of determining the height of the clouds and the rate
of their motion, the direction being given by the inclination of the
two lines, of which the black one represented the base.
    In dealing with the direction of the drift when thus obtained from
positive prints, it has to be remembered that by the printing the
right and left of the pictures are transposed, so that the east is on the
 left and the west on the right in a picture the top of which is directed
to the north.

    The necessary measurements were made on a scale of millimeters,
and the computations carried out by the help of logarithms.
    The operations thus described have lately been much abbreviated
in various ways. First, it has been found possible to carry out the
superposition   of the pictures by means of the negatives only, and to
work without either employing positives or depending on the identi
<U+FB01>cation of a few selected points whose positions were transferred to
a receiver.
    A  frame has been constructed which carries the glass negative
plates upon sliders in grooves running in parallel planes, one imme
diately over the other, but arranged so as to travel at right angles to
one another, the lower moving towards and away from the observer,
whilst_the upper traverses from right to left. A mirror, either a
silvered or an opal plate,'is employed to reflect the light of the sky
upwards to the eye through the negative photograph when the
apparatus is placed upon a table in front of a well-lighted window.
Stray or diffused light is excluded by placing a box, darkened on its
inner surface, over the negatives, and the observer views the com
bination through a tube <U+FB01>xed perpendicularly upon the top of the box.
The two photographs to be compared are placed one in each of the
sliding frames, which are <U+FB01>rst so adjusted that the <U+FB01>ducial lines which
follow the direction of the base pass exactly-over one another.          Next,
the bottom or backwards-and-forwards slider is moved until the cloud
 pictures, say a pair marked A and B, are seen to coincide, and the
distance between the intersections of the cross lines on the two plates
 representing the zenith points, which is the parallax, is then measured
 by means of a pair of compasses; but a scale could readily be <U+FB01>xed
 on the slides from which the parallax could be read 03 without
measurement.
    In order to avoid calculations, a standard      curve has been drawn
 (see  <U+FB01>g.  2),  from  which    the  height  of the  cloud may at once he
 graphically   determined   from  the  distance between   the intersections of
 the cross lines or parallax of the base as thus measured.
     On the axis of abscissse of this curve are marked oif the heights on
 a scale which makes 2400 feet, the length of the base, equail to the
 focal distance of the camera, and at regular intervals along this line
 ordinates are drawn of the length, as measured on the photographs,
 of the parallax corresponding to the several heights.           Through the
 extremities of these ordinates a curved line is drawn, which gives the
 locus of the equation

 tioned.

   The scales above described for the graphical determination of the
cloud heights and velocities are engraved and printed on sheets of
paper, which, after the computations are completed by their aid, will
serve as convenient                                    records of the observations.
   After a little practice, the whole of the processes requisite for these
determinations from the glass plate-negatives of a complete set of
four pictures will not exceed 20 minutes.       Quite su<U+FB02>icient accuracy
is ensured, and the labour and risk of error arising from the use of
tables is entirely avoided.
   Although the cameras now in use only embrace a circle of angular
diameter of about 30°, trials have been made with a lens which gives
satisfactory pictures of double that extent, which      probably as much                                is_
as could be desired.

Relative   Passivity of Wrought-iron and various Steel Bars, and the
      In<U+FB02>uence of Chemical Composition and Physical Structure on their
      Passive State in Cold Nitric Acid.
   The author is not aware that any previous experiments have
hitherto been made showing the relative passivity of the various
kinds of steel compared with wrought iron, or the in<U+FB02>uence of the
chemical composition and physical structure of such metals on their
passive condition in nitric acid.
   The passive state of iron or steel may have hitherto been regarded
by many as a sort of <U+FB01>xed property pertaining to iron and steel alike.
 when immersed in cold, strong nitric acid.        The following experi
ments were made to investigate if the passivity was of an universally
static character, or whether it varied with the chemical composition
and general physical structure of the metal and, if so, to what extent.
For convenience, this part of the investigation was divided into two
parts, one portion of the observations, Set 1, being made on drawn
 rods of metals of known chemical composition and structure, and the
other, Set 2, of experiments constituting a study of the relative

bars were cold drawn through a wortle, and were therefore diiferent
in physical structure to the rolled plates used in the second series of
the experiments.     An idea of their general properties will be obtained
on reference to    Part II, Tables IV and V. A polished bar, 8} inches
long, O'31O inch diameter, of the steel to be tested was placed in the
wooden stand W (<U+FB01>g. 5), along with a. polished wrought-iron bar of
equal size, and the pair were then immersed in 1} <U+FB02>uid ounce of
nitric acid 1'42 sp. gr., contained in the U-tube, the bars being in
circuit with the galvanometer.     The immersion was continued for
the periods stated, and with the electro-chemical results given on
Table VI.
   The wrought-iron bars used in each experiment were cut from one
longer polished rod, so as to a<U+FB02>iord a fair comparison of the relative
passivity of the various steels, compared with the wrought iron and
also with each other.    The results are the average of numerous
experiments   in each case.

      the cover holding the two plates was then carefully placed closely
      over a porcelain vessel containing 15 <U+FB02>uid ounces of nitric acid
      sp. gr. 1'42, the plates being fully immersed in the acid, and the
      protruding shanks of the bars connected in circuit with the galvano

        At the conclusion of each experiment on Table VIII, the nitric
      acid, though quite colourless at <U+FB01>rst, was found to be of a yellowish
.44   brown colour.    A small deposit of <U+FB01>ne black carbonaceous-looking
      matter was noticed at the bottom of the tank surrounding the
      wrought-iron bar in each set of these experiments.
         The hard Siemens-Martin steel plate and the wrought-iron plate,
      instantly after withdrawal from the acid, showed nearly their original
      bright polish, with the exception of a few <U+FB01>ne streaks or markings
      on the wrought-iron plate, indicating that the latter metal had been
      rather more acted upon than the steel plate, the hard Siemens-Martin
      steel plate presenting a slightly dull-greyish aspect.        Somewhat
      similar results were observed on withdrawing the soft cast steel, hard
      cast steel, soft Bessemer steel, and hard Bessemer steel series of plates
      from the nitric acid.                                           _
         The hard cast steel plate when taken out showed a dull lustre
      much removed from its original bright polish, but- there were no other

         Firstlg/.—The experimental observations of Part   I, Series 1,indicate
      that the in<U+FB02>uence of magnetisation on the passive state of steel rods
      in cold nitric acid sp. gr. 1'42    not very great, but

      with the delicate galvanometer and by the sensitive electro-chemical
      method pursued by the author in the investigation.
         The e<U+FB01>ect of magnetisation         more marked in warm nitric acid,
                                             is
      and when the iron      in a powdered state, as shown in the independent

      powdered iron in warm nitric acid, previously alluded to in Part       I,

      magnetism; their experiments also indicate that the passive state of

powdered iron cannot be fully overcome, even under strong magnetic
in<U+FB02>uence, until a temperature of about 51° C. is reached.
    Seaondlg/.—The author’s experiments of Part 1, Series 11, at -higher
temperatures con<U+FB01>rm those of Part I, and further tend to demonstrate
the in<U+FB02>uence of magnetisation in somewhat lessening the passivity of
 steel, showing that even previous to the critical temperature point of
transition from the passive to the active state, magnetised steel bars
 were rather less passive in warm nitric acid than unmagnetised ones.
    Thirdlg/.—The results in Part II, Series III, show that the passivity
of both unmagnetised wrought iron and unmagnetised steel in nitric
acid sp. gr. 1'4-2 is considerably and proportionately reduced as the
temperature of the acid increases, until the temperature point of
transition from the passive to the active state is reached at a tempera
ture of about 195° F., and it was also found that the wrought iron
was less passive in the warm nitric acid than cast steel; see also
remarks at foot of Diagram 1, in Part II.
    F0urthly.—~The results of the observations of Part II, Series IV.
indicate that Scheurer-Kestner was to some extent in error in regard
ing the passivity of iron as not dependent on the greater or less
degree of saturation of the acid.         The author’s experiments herein
recorded have shown that the passivity of the metals employed, viz.,
wrought iron, soft cast steel, hard cast steel, soft Bessemer steel, and
 tungsten steel, was very materially increased with the concentration
 of the nitric acid, and it was also observed that wrought iron was much
less passive in the nitric acid of less concentration than most of the
 steels, the soft Bessemer steel being found about equal in passivity to
the wrought iron under the conditions of experimentation.        A reference
 to Table     III shows that a considerable amount of                    was
 developed between the       different metals in every instance, which is a
circumstance of much interest in connexion with the passive state of
iron and steel.
   Fifthly.—The results obtained in Part 111, Series V and VI, on the
relative passivity of wrought iron and the various steels, soft cast
steel, hard cast steel, soft Bessemer steel, hard Bessemer steel, soft
Siemens steel, and hard Siemens steel, are of an important character,
showing, by the delicate electro-chemical           method employed, the
powerful    in<U+FB02>uence  of difference  in chemical  composition and physical
structure, &c., on the passive state of the metals. Generally through
out this series of experiments it will be observed that the wrought
iron was electro-positive to the steels with a considerable E.M.F.,
amounting in some cases to as high as one-tenth to one-seventh of a
volt, the wrought iron being thus shown to be less passive than the
steels.    In the experiments on the wrought-iron and various steel
bars on Table VI, which in course of their manufacture were drawn
cold through a wortle, and were hence in a different molecular. condi

tion to the plates (which were rolled hot) experimented upon in
Table VIII, it will be noticed that, in several instances with soft cast
steel and hard cast steel, the wrought iron did not assume the electro
positive position until two or three hours after immersion in the nitric
acid.     Subsequently the iron assumed its normal position, and became
during the long remaining period of the observations electro-positive
to the steels, with a considerable and increasing E.M.F,, showing
that the wrought iron was becoming gradually very much less passive
than the steels. In the case of the soft Bessemer and soft Siemens
plates, Table VIII, we have also a similar instance of these peculiar
and temporary interchanges and variations of relative passivity which
are not easily accounted for.       In the case of the tungsten steel,
Table    VI, the wrought iron was steadily in the electro-negative posi-,
tion, hence in the latter instance showing the wrought iron to be
permanently more passive than the tungsten steel.
    A reference to the experiments on the wrought iron and various
steel plates, on Table VIII, shows that the E.M.F. between the
passive wrought iron and the various soft steels, which contained
less percentage of combined carbon, in circuit in cold nitric acid
sp. gr. 14.2, was very considerably less than the          under similar
conditions between the Wrought-iron plates and the di<U+FB01>erent hard
steels having a higher percentage of combined carbon.         The latter
results, therefore, demonstrate the interesting circumstance         that
steels, of a higher percentage of combined carbon are more passive
than those of a lower percentage of combined carbon.           It will be
observed that the wrought iron was also electro-positive to most of the
steels, whether of a higher or lower percentage of combined carbon,
which shows that wrought iron may be regarded as generally less
passive than steels.

       Chromatin    by Micro-chemical Methods.”            By A. B.
      MAOALLUM, M.B., Ph.D.        Communicated by Professor H. N.
       MARTIN, F.R.S. Received April 23, 1891.
                                (Abstract.)
    The method of isolating what is called chromatin by the histologist
 yields compounds of fairly stable composition called nucleins, some
 of which have been shown to contain iron (Bunge and Zaleski). , My
 observations on haamatopoiesis in Amphibia led me to the conclusion
 that the chromatin, from which the haemoglobin of the haematoblasts
 is derived, is an iron-holding compound. Other observations indicated
 that the conclusion could, possibly, be made of general application,
 i.e., that iron is present in the chromatin of every cell, animal and

1891.]                            Presents.                              489
vegetable.      The ordinary method of isolating chromatin employed
in chemical and physiological laboratories cannot be readily applied
in testing the correctness of this supposition.       It is conceivable that
this substance absorbs and retains tenaciously iron-holding com
pounds as readily as it does some of the dyes used by the histologist.
It is not easy to remove such compounds without, possibly, decompos
ing the chromatin, and, when the latter is prepared in any quantity,
one cannot be certain that the iron which is present may not be an
impurity.      To overcome this di<U+FB02>iculty, one must prepare chromatin
from organs which are free from haamatin or like substances, or
from inorganic iron compounds, and, for this purpose, fairly large
quantities would be necessary for chemical manipulation.            There is,
apparently,     no organ,  animal    or vegetable,   which   offers such an
opportunity. There consequently remains but one other way by
which the view, that iron is constantly present in chromatin, can be
put to the proof, and that is the micro-chemical one.          I have found
that a certain method of employing ammonium sulphide as a reagent
for iron shows the presence of the latter in the chromatin of the
nuclei of a very large number of species of cells hardened in alcohol.
The iron in this case does not occur combined as an albuminate, but
rather in a condition which, as regards the <U+FB01>rmness of the combina
tion, is comparable to that present in potassium ferrocyanide or
haamatin. That the iron found is not due to the presence of haematin
is shown by the results of experiments made with vegetable cells, and
with animal cells which one would not naturally expect to contain
haamatin, as, for example, those of the corneal epithelium in Amphibia.
In support of this may also be mentioned the fact that where chro
matin is very abundant the iron reaction is very marked, while it is
feeble in cells poor in chromatin.           In the chromatin loops and
<U+FB01>laments     of  karyokinetic <U+FB01>gures    the   iron reaction is intense and
sharply con<U+FB01>ned to these structures.
    1 forego, for the present, any expression of opinion as to the general
application of the results obtained.      I would not even maintain that
the chromatin of every cell essentially contains iron, although my
studies have, so far, not furnished an instance which can support the
contrary view.

     The examination of these three cases was conducted at different
 times, the <U+FB01>rst partially in the presence of the Colour Vision Com
  mittee by Mr. Nettleship, and the two last, and part of the examination
  of the <U+FB01>rst, at diiferent times, in my laboratory, with the assistance
  of Mr. Nettleship.
     In all three cases the examination made was an ability to distin
  guish colour, luminosity of the different parts of the spectrum, and
  total sensation of light; and, in addition, in the first case, to range of
  colour sensation on the retina.
     Case I.—This patient, Alfred C., aged 36, a traveller, was su<U+FB01>er
 ing from rather severe tobacco amblyopia, and was brought to the
  Committee by Mr. N ettleship. The scotoma was a very marked one,
 and the loss of colour sensation most complete.         Mr. Nettleship has
 kindly   added  the following remarks  on the  case  :
     His acuteness of vision was {*3 with R. and -6-65with L. He smoked
 half-an-ounce of “shag” daily and drank about four pints of beer. His
 sight had been failing for about two months.       As is common in early
 stages of this disease, the ophthalmoscope revealed no decided changes
 at the optic discs.
    He was tested at the Royal Institution by Mr. Nettleship, in the
 presence of the Committee, with the following results :—
    He passed the test of the Holmgren wools satisfactorily, proving
 that the usual vision was normal for colour.       I   had prepared small
 pellets of moulde1"s clay, each weighing 4 grains, and about % inch
in diameter, and had had sets coloured with the same colours as those
of the Holmgren wools.       C. was told to pick out the blues, reds, and
greens.     The blue pellets he picked out without fail, and he never
made the least mistake in his choice, but he failed entirely to distin
guish the greens or reds, mistaking them for drabs and greys, which
 were amongst the pellets.     When told to look away some 20° from
the slab on which the pellets were placed, he at once saw all the
colours, but directly he turned his eyes to pick them out, all colour
perception, except for blue, disappeared.      This test indicated that he
had lost all perception of green and red in the central part of the eye.
He was next tested with small discs of diiferent colours by Mr.
Nettleship, keeping his eye <U+FB01>xed on a given point, and the loss of
colour sensation for all except blue, and perhaps a little yellow, in the
central part of the eye, was at once made apparent; the blue he would
distinguish with the greatest facility, and the sensation was appa
rently as strong as in normal eyesight.     A further test was made by
Mr. Nettleship with coloured lights to imitate signal lights, and he
named a brilliant red light, and an equally brilliant green light, when
side by side, both as white (see also p. 85).
    This man attended at my laboratory, at the meeting of the Com
mittee on Colour Vision, with Mr. Nettleship, and he was tested with

the colour-patch apparatus           described in “ Colour Photometry," in the
‘
  Philosophical       Transactions,’ 1886, by General Fasting and myself.
The objects <U+FB01>rst in view were to test his perception of the spectrum
colours,    and then his retinal <U+FB01>eld colour perception for the same.
A template was cut out after the manner described by General Festing
                                              of “Colour                          ”
and     myself    in the second        part                    Photometry           (‘ Phil.
Trans.,’ 1889), of such a shape that all the spectrum lying between
X4600 and X6600 was reduced to equal luminosity when it was ro
tated in front of the spectrum.                 Diaphragms containing holes of
different sizes were placed in front of the last prism, and thus a round
spot of monochromatic             light of the same luminosity was produced
upon the screen when a slit was passed through the spectrum.                           From
the red end to X5270 he called the whole of the colours white, and
from that point he began to see blue, called the colours bluish and
blue.    When the full illumination for all the colours was used, the
same results were obtained.             From this examination it would appear
that he was totally deprived of the sensation of any colour except of
blue.    A subsequent examination of his perception of the luminosity
of different rays, however, has to be taken into account, for in the
<U+FB01>rst examination he had no light of pure white with which to compare
the colours.        In the next experiments, a strip of white light was

his area of luminosity should be 1100. As it is 1400, the ordinates
of the above curve should be multiplied by 08, to compare with that
of the normal eye.
   It should be mentioned that his matches of luminosity were made
without any hesitation, and were concordant for each observation,
which is not to be wondered at, as the matches, except at the blue
end, were practically matching shades of black to white.
   From the foregoing, it will be seen that the white which C. sees as
white is the same as the D sodium light, and that the red he says is
yellowish.     The mixture of this yellowish-white with the blue
apparent makes white at X 5430.             He sees a little blue in the
spectrum colour at h 5720, so it must be taken that at that point of
the spectrum he begins to see colour, a point which is considerably
lower than that given by his preliminary examination of the spectrum
colour, and due, no doubt, to the fact that the white light used by
the comparison light was that of the positive pole of the electric
light. It seems probable that what C. called yellowish was really a
sensation of white mixed with a very small quantity of red sensation
 (as he saw no yellow in the orange,in which that colour would be
most easily distinguished on account of its luminosity), and red light,
when strongly diluted with white light, to the normal eye appears
slightly orange.
    Subsequently C. was tested for the illuminating value of white
light compared with my own and that of Mr. Nettleship. The appa
ratus used in this case (<U+FB01>g. 2) was,     I  believe, somewhat on the prin
ciple   of Dr.  F6rster’s  photometer,    with   which  I was unacquainted
 before  I made the instrument.     It is made as follows :

 changed at will, and on which are one or more black spots) slipping
 into a slot S from the top of the box. E is so arranged that the whole
 of the card can be viewed.               The observer places his eye at E, and the
 sectors, which at <U+FB01>rst are closed, are gradually opened until the
 observer can see that there are black spots on a white ground.                            The
 angle    of     the    aperture   of the   sector is  noted.     Each   eye    is tested.
     In this case my own right eye, agreeing with that of Mr. Nettle
 ship, was used as the standard, since it was with that that the normal
 luminosity curve was originally made.

standard is about half for the right eye, and two-thirds for the left that
of the standard.

is  told them as to the diiferent colours, and not from any real know

curve of    the  electric light spectrum, and this they did with the very
greatest ease.     Their readings for the same colour were occasionally a

the ordinates of their curve should therefore be multiplically 1‘37 for
a strict comparison with that of the normal eye.        We may therefore
take it that near F their sensation of light is 11‘83 times that of the
normal eye.
   In the three     patients we have cases of abnormal vision, one in
which practically the only sensations in the central part of the eye
are white and blue, and in the other two there is only one sensation.
In these last two cases we have apparently a curve of the funda
mental sensation, since     it must be the same as the luminosity curve,
and  it appears to agree with that found by Koenig. In regard to
Alfred C., it should be remarked that he begins to feel the blue
sensation    in the spectrum near the point where Koenig places its
origin.

  On Four Cases of Colour Blindness Examined       for the Colour Vision
                                  Committee.
   Case  III.—The     next case, W. S., is one of progressive atrophy of
both eyes.     When tested with spectrum colours—a patch of white
light being placed in juxtaposition with the colour—it was found that
he was absolutely blind to colour from 26‘75 (A 4733) on the scale of
the spectrum to the termination of the red of his spectrum, which was
close to 63 on the scale (A 7082).      Above scale No. 26‘75 W. S. saw
blue, and his spectrum was continued normally in the violet.           Mr.
Nettleship    has  promised to furnish a chart of his retina.    His lumi
nosity curve (<U+FB01>g. 4) was made without any difficulty, and, compared
with my own, is slightly de<U+FB01>cient, from the red to the yellow, but his
perception of luminosity increases as the blue is approached.
   The following is the table applying to his curve of luminosity :

normal sense.
   Case V.—This was a remarkable case, which Mr. Nettleship had
mentioned to the Committee.     He had stated that this lady, N. W.,
mistook  blue for  red, and it was  with some curiosity that this case
was examined.     Her <U+FB01>rst examination was as to colour sense with the
spectrum  colours,  a patch of mono-chromatic   light being placed in
juxtaposition with an equal patch of white light. At 625       6890)                                            ()t

as the white until 535 (X 6110), and after this point she said the
colour was brownish compared with the white.     The colour continued
of this hue to her till 48 on the scale (A. 5720), when she said the
colour was neither brown nor green, but both. From 48 on the scale
she described the colour as green till quite sharply at 31'5 (X 4905).
In the blue she again began to see grey ; the grey at this end of the
spectrum, and also of the white patch, she called brownish-grey.

504             Capt.   W.   de   W. Abney.      Examination      for          [May 14,
This name must evidently have                         distinction, as she
                                           been a mental
described the red end and the white as grey only, and not brown
grey ; and, indeed, she was tried again over that part of the spectrum,
and adhered to the previous naming.         It would appear to be due to
the low luminosity which made the grey appear brownish to her, and
not to any actual di<U+FB01>erence in hue.
   Her curve of luminosity in the spectrum was next taken, and her
readings are given in the table.     The curve is shown in fig. 5. The
shaded band beneath it applies to her curve.       My own readings were
1/1'375 of  the normal curve  as shown  in the  diagram.   The extinction
of a gas-light, in my own  case  and  that of  Mr. Nettleship, was 13°15.
That of N. W. was 16°, showing that her <U+FB01>nal perception of light wa<
13'5/16 of what we may call the normal.
   An endeavour was made to form a series of colour equations with her
eyesight by placing three slits in di<U+FB01>erent parts of the spectrum, but
without success, although a match with white was made in two posi
tions.  One slit was placed in the orange-red at about 52 of the scale,
another at E, and the third at G, and white light was formed, though
her match was so erratic that it was useless to measure the apertures.
When the slit in the violet was covered up, a white patch being along
side as a comparison, she called the mixture of red and green
“                       ”
                     when the slit in the red was covered she called
  brownish-green ;
                                               ”
the mixed light of green and violet “green ;     and when the green
slit was covered up she called the purple colour a “ di<U+FB01>erent kind of
brown.”
   When the <U+FB01>rst slit was moved into the red near the lithium line she
called the colours “green,” whenever the green slot was uncovered.
A piece of signal-red glass (London, Brighton, and South Coast
Railway) was placed in the white re<U+FB02>ected beam, forming a red patch,
and a patch of the blue scale at No. 30'5         4862) was placed
                                                           (7t
alongside, and she matched them in luminosity and in colour.      (The
dominant colour of the signal glass in question was       6220.)   She
                                                                   7\
<U+FB01>nally was tested with colour discs :—
      One being in red with dominant wave-length                   .   .   X   6150
      Another, emerald-green     ,,     ,,                          . .    X   5373
      And the third, French ultramarine ,,                         . .     X   4700.
To make white she required
          130   G-i-113     R+1l7 U =      72   W+288    B   (corrected).
    She was then tried      with the blue and green discs alone and made a
match—
                258   U+102    G   =   65 W-}-295   B   (corrected).
    An attempt was made to match with the green and red discs alone,
but this failed.

  She matched the red disc alone with black and white, and also the
blue disc alone—
                                           360             R=                   56               W-l-304 B (corrected),

With any proportion of R and U mixed together she matched a grey
                      I.

she would from the last two equations.

    Taking the intensity curve of the light re<U+FB02>ected from the red it was
 found to contain a great deal of the part of the spectrum which she
 called brownish, viz., from 53'5 to 48 on the scale, whereas the blue
 re<U+FB02>ected a tri<U+FB02>e of this portion of the spectrum, as did also the green,
 and this may account for her making a match to grey of U and G, and
 not of R and G, but it is hard to see why she matched U alone and
 also  R with   the grey.
    Reviewing the case,    it seems that any perception of colour is very
 small, and that the sensations are green and red, together with white.
                        I                                “
 Experiments which have described in my book on Colour Measure
 ments and Mixture,” 1891, show that a large proportion of colour may
 be  mixed with white without being perceived, but this colour so hidden
 has still the capability of neutralising a certain quantity of the com
 plementary colour thrown on the white, which, by itself, would not
 be masked by the white.        It would seem then that in N. W.’s case
 the two colours perceived were very much diluted, and at parts of the
 spectrum so diluted as not to be perceived, but that the latent colour,
if it may be so called, has the power of forming a grey with the green
which she sees more strongly.
    Case VI.—~This case is that of Miss W., who was brought before
the Committee by Dr. Lindsay Johnson, on April 29.               The right
eye   was   apparently   normal  for  colour, but with the  other  she saw
nothing but shades of white.
    Miss W., it appears, has had a slight stroke of paralysis, which
affected her left side, and subsequently she discovered that colour
sensation in the left eye had disappeared.          Mr. Brudenell Carter,
the day after the meeting of the Committee, examined her and pro
nounced hers to be a case of atrophy of the optic nerve.
    I examined her with the spectrum colours on the 5th May, and
found her left eye totally blind to every colour, though her per
ception of light was very fair.          She had very little di<U+FB02>iculty in
comparing     the  luminosity   of  the  most brilliant spectrum colours
with the white patch of light placed alongside them. In making the
measurements she experienced a certain amount of fatigue, but, by
resting the eye for short intervals, her readings were very constant.
The following is the table of her readings :—

    At  19 the  light perception was        so  diminished that she could not

show conclusively.

extinction of light by the same method as that described in my recent

0E, and the slit giving this brightness remained unchanged through
out the examination, and was moved through the spectrum till a

ception of the point of extinction was very acute. Rotating sectors
were placed in front of the apparatus, as described in the paper
referred to, set at different angles, so that the amount of reduction of

1891.]      Limit of Visibility of the Rays of   the Spectrum.        509
II.   “On the Limit of Visibility of the different Rays of the
       Spectrum.     Preliminary Note.”        By Captain W. DE W.
       ABNEY, C.B., R.E., D.C.L., F.R.S. Received April 29, 1891.
    In certain photometric experiments it became necessary to <U+FB01>nd the
limit of visibility of the different parts of the spectrum, and also to
ascertain what ratio this limit would hear to some <U+FB01>xed luminosity.
It should be borne in mind that this question is totally di<U+FB01>erent from
acuteness of vision, which some have confounded with it. The two
are independent one of the other, and can scarcely be compared.
    The instrument used in these experiments was similar to that
described in the note on the examination of a case of Tobacco
 Scotoma, &c., but the dimensions were modi<U+FB01>ed :—A square tube,
'3 feet long, had an aperture     of 2 inches cut in its side at 2 feet
'6 inches from one end, and covered over with ground glass.       Within
 the tube, and close to the ground glass, was a mirror, which re<U+FB02>ected
 the light coming through the ground glass on to the end of the tube,
-and if the ground glass was illuminated by any light the re<U+FB02>ection
illuminated a card placed at the end of the tube. The illumination
 of the card could be viewed through a circular hole at the other
end of the tube, in which was <U+FB01>xed a smaller tube, <U+FB01>tting closely
 into the eye. If a colour patch from the spectrum was thrown
 on to the ground glass, evidently the card at the end of the
 tube would be illuminated by the colour used, and its disappearance
could be effected by means of rotating sectors closing and opening
at will, placed in front of the patch.    This simple piece of apparatus
answered its purpose most effectively.
    The <U+FB01>rst point to ascertain was the ratio of illumination of the card
to that of the patch thrown on the ground glass. The following
arrangement was made to eifect this.             The end of the tube,
against   which  the card was   placed, was   removed,  and a card with
a square hole, of %-inch side, was inserted instead.           This was
 covered on the side away from the tube with a piece of Saxe
paper, and when viewed from the outside, and when illuminated
by the light from the ground glass, showed as a square patch of
light.    Outside of this, and of double the width, but of the same
height, a mask of black paper, with an oblong aperture, was placed
so that the illuminated square occupied one-half of the oblong, and
 the other half showed no white paper.       An amyl acetate lamp (08
of standard candle), placed at a <U+FB01>xed distance from this oblong, and
in a line with the axis of the tube, illuminated both squares; but a
rod placed in proper position cast a shadow on the translucent square,
allowing only the opaque white half to be illuminated. When the
 sectors above alluded to were placed in front of the lamp, the two
                                                             2 M 2

510             Capt. W. de   W. Abney.    On the   Limit of    [May 14,
brightnesses     could be equalised, and the intensities of the light
transmitted passing through the paper estimated.
   Now there is a ray very near D in the spectrum, whose colour is
very closely, if not quite, identical with the colour of the light emitted
by the burning amyl acetate, and for making the measures this ray was
used. When the measure had been made, the screen, with the square
aperture, was placed in the position of the ground glass, and the
amyl acetate lamp placed on the side of the screen, away from the
colour patch, and the rod placed in position to cast the shadow
necessary.      The rotating sectors were then placed between the
spectrum and the screen, and the light reduced so that the illumina
tion of the translucent and opaque white square, viewed from the side
of the lamp, was equalised.       Knowing the distance of the lamp in
the two cases, and the aperture of the sectors, the relative illumina
tion of the two surfaces was ascertained.          For convenience, the
aperture of the ground glass was limited by means of a diaphragm,
or by placing a diaphragm in front of the <U+FB01>rst prism.
                                                                              '
   Two sets of measures showed that if the illumination of the ground
glass be represented by 1, the illumination of the card at the end of
the tube was -7-35; that is, any light falling on the ground glass was
diminished to that extent.
   The actual measures were 3,1,5 and 7%? but we may take 7-55 as
su<U+FB01>iciently close to the truth.
   The colour-patch apparatus to which reference is made is described
in the Bakerian Lecture, 1886 (Abney and Festing, “ Colour Photo
metry”).       The only addition to it that was made was to use an
adjustable    slit  to move through the spectrum.      There was thus a
treble means of altering the intensity of the light, viz., by altering
the aperture of the slit of the collimator, by altering that of the slit of
 the slide, which was shifted at will into di<U+FB01>erent parts of the spectrum,
and by the rotating sectors placed in front of the spectrum.           The
mode of proceeding to measure the luminosity at which light
disappeared was as follows :—The dullest part of that portion
of the spectrum which it was desired to extinguish was allowed
to pass through the slit in the spectrum, and a patch was formed
 on the ground glass, which, it may be remarked, had a tube
 <U+FB01>tted over    it,to prevent any chance of extraneous light reaching it.
 The card at the end of the square box was viewed, and the slits closed
till all trace of light disappeared. (It may be as well to call to mind
 what is   well known, that faint light of all colours appears as white.)
In some sets of experiments the sectors were set at <U+FB01>xed angles, and
rotated in front of the patch, and the slit in the spectrum moved from
a position in which faint light appeared to one in which      just dis
                                                               it
appeared, the position in the spectrum being noted by the scale at the
back of the moving slide carrying the slit. In other cases the slit

1891.]       Visibility of the dzferent Rays of the Spectrum.           511
was placed at dilferent positions in the spectrum, and the rotating
sectors closed till all light had vanished, when the aperture was
noted.    The <U+FB01>rst plan is the more convenient of the two, and gives
very accurate results; though in some positions of the spectrum the
second method must be adopted, since the graphic curve formed
from the readings becomes almost a horizontal straight line at one
portion of the spectrum.       As will be seen from the table, it is quite
evident   that no  one  aperture of the slit of the collimator and of that
in the slide would su<U+FB01>ice to give the entire range of disappearance of
the spectrum, and that at least three settings are necessary.      At each
change the D light falling on the ground glass was measured, and the
necessary factors to make the readings on one scale were derived from
these measurements.
    Four sets of measures throughout the spectrum were made on
di<U+FB01>erent days. No one differed to any appreciable extent from the
other.    A mean of the four has been taken as representing the truth,
and the measures given in the <U+FB01>rst table are those of that which most
 nearly approaches this mean. It may be stated that very rarely did
one curve di<U+FB01>er more than 4 per cent. from another at any portion
of the spectrum.        The readings were taken when the eye had
 rested in darkness some time, and were often repeated a con
 siderable number of times, the <U+FB01>rst parts measured being re
 measured last.     That the eye was equally sensitive throughout the
 time may be judged from the fact that the two sets of readings
 scarcely ever di<U+FB01>ered.     The process of making these measures of ex
 tinction is very fatiguing, and probably rather detrimental to the
 eyesight; owing to the strain on the eyes, one set of readings is
 usually as much as can be properly carried out on any one day, if
accurate results are to be looked for.
                                         I
    It is now three years ago since began this research, and, after
 trying various plans, I have come to the conclusion that the method
now described is the most easy, as it is the most simple.
    There is one point in the method which might be open to criticism,
 and that is that the cutting off the light by rotating sectors might
 cause some error in the results.      This criticism, I may say,  I  raised
 in my own mind at its very commencement, and found that it was
 unnecessary.     Polarising the light entering the slit of the colli
 mator, and then dimming it by means of a Nicol’s prism placed in
 front of the colour patch, proved an unsatisfactory method for an
 swering the criticism, as in no case could a total disappearance of a
bright light be brought about; but by diminishing the area of the
colour patch by placing different apertures of diaphragms in front of
 the last prism of the colour-patch apparatus (and thus throwing on
 the ground glass discs of light of various areas), the truth of the results
 was readily veri<U+FB01>ed. The two sets of measures, one made in this way

 and the other as            just described, gave identical results within the
 limits of the errors necessarily due to observation.
      The method adopted gave the extinction of light on the whole
 retina, for not only was the central part used, but the extinction was-.
 carried so far that it was complete for every part of the eye. As
 there is a considerable absorption in the yellow spot this is necessary,
  but the absorption exercised in this part of the eye, which occupies
 from 4° to 6“ angular aperture, can be fairly measured if only the
 light on a small area be extinguished and this part of the retina
 be alone used.            A very simple way of seeing the absorption of the
 yellow spot      is    to  form a feeble spectrum some 3 inches long on a
 ground-glass screen.             If the eye looks at the green, 2. dark band ex

eye    is700 times greater for the latter colour than the former, and
this has bearing on the extinction of white light of different qualities.
            a
   It worthy of remark that the reduction of the rays from about
       is
C  to the visible limit of the red necessary to cause extinction from
the standard luminosity     ispractically the same, and points to the fact
that this part of the spectrum       probably monochromatic;
                                     is                        if   admix
ture of any other colour sensation were present, the curve would rise
or fall instead of remaining horizontal. The same apparently applies
to the violet end of the spectrum, though, owing to the small
luminosity, exact measures of         are less certain.
                                     it                    The experiments
show that the rays having the wave-length of about X4770 are the
last perceived.    The shift in the position of maximum resistance to

 1891.]       Visibility   of the diferent Rays of the      Spectrum.        517
 about X 4510, as shown in Table II, is due to the fact that equal
 luminosities of each colour have been considered as being reduced.
    Some interesting experiments were carried out by placing slits in
 di<U+FB01>erent parts of the spectrum, and forming a mixture of light on the
ground glass of the apparatus.              An intense D light mixed with a
 faint light near F formed a colour patch, and this mixed light was
 extinguished and found to require 9° of aperture of the sector. The
 D light was then shielded and the single ray of blue-green light was
 extinguished, when it was found that the same aperture was required
 to extinguish this beam alone.            Red and green and various other
 mixtures were tried, all showing that in the extinction of light the
green-blue light was the last visible, and was equivalent to extin
guishing that light alone, although it might be mixed with very much
brighter light in the red or yellow. In the blue the conditions
somewhat change, as will be seen in the diagram, but if slits of equal
aperture were used the same results were obtained.
    The diagram shows that in the spectroscopy of feeble light the rays
 in the blue and green are the <U+FB01>rst to be perceived, and that rays of
far greater intensity in the yellow and red may exist without ex
 citing the sense of light.        This may account for some of the varied
results recorded in eye spectroscopic observations of sources of feeble
 luminosity, in which the yellow and red lines are absent.
    In extinguishing white light, the fact of the total extinction of the
blue-green light is of importance.
    It is not the light at that particular wave-length which disappears
last, but some one sensation which is principally existent at that point,
but which extends over a great portion of the spectrum which has
to be extinguished.         For instance, in extinguishing the light from
the reflected beam of the electric light already alluded to, it was
found that the light illuminating the ground glass was 720 times
brighter than that reaching the screen.                   To extinguish 00141
of the light from an amyl lamp on the ground glass the sector had
to be closed to 21, that is the light of one amyl lamp luminosity,

                                    of the original light. Had the luminosity
of the unit of luminosity been due entirely to the colour at 7t 4776, it
would have had to be reduced to about m‘m of its luminosity before
it became invisible. Thus the electric light gives about half the
sensation of this light that the monochromatic light of that colour
and luminosity would give, and hence we may conclude that about
half the luminosity of the white light is due to this sensation, of
course distributed unequally through its spectrum.               This is a. very
close approach to the area of the green sensation curve of the
spectrum when the luminosity is taken into account.

  Itwould thus appear that by studying the extinction curves it may
be possibleto approximate to the three positions in the spectrum

                               (Abstract)
   The author distinguishes <U+FB01>ve zones of life in the Karoo rocks,
which are termed, counting from the bottom, Mesosaurian, Pareia
saurian, Dicynodont, Theriodont, and Zanclodont.            The Pareia
saurian zone extends between the Prince Albert Road station and the
Nieuwveldt range of mountains.          He obtained a nearly complete
skeleton from Bad, east of Tamboer, a less complete skeleton from
Tamboer Fontein, and a portion of jaw from near Klipfontein, on
the summit of the Nieuwveldt range.        These materials show almost
every part of the skeleton except some details of the carpus and
tarsus, and the number of digits.
   The skull shows in both specimens the structure of the palate,
which was closed in the median line, and almost covered with teeth,
which extend in four principal longitudinal rows on the vomera and
pterygoids.    The teeth are slender, cylindrical, and recurved.   There
are two oblique rows, half as long as the others, on the palatines.
They converge backward.        Other teeth occur in rows behind these,
and in front of them. The posterior nares open behind the pterygoids
onthe basi-sphenoid.        The pterygoid bones diverge backwards to
meet the quadrate bones, which are wedged in between them and the
bones of the cheek.     On the outer border of the side of the quadrate
is a perforation like that <U+FB01>gured ‘ Phil. Trans.,’ B, 1889, P1. 10, <U+FB01>g.    4:,
only smaller.    The brain case has the same sort of relation to the
roof bones of the skull, as in marine Chelonia.         The brain case    is
depressed    behind.   The   occipital condyle appears to be formed by
the basi-occipital in its lower half, and by the ex-occipitals in its
upper half.     It  is concave, and was margined       below by a semi
circular intercentral bone. A similar intercentral ossi<U+FB01>cation occurs
behind   it,below the atlas. The surface of the skull has no opening
except  the  nares, orbits, and the large parietal foramen. Its posterior
border   is concavely notched.      The surface shows the same pitted
and channeled ornament as in the specimen already described.
   The vertebral column   is  complete with the exception of a few small
terminal vertebrae of the tail. No neural arch has been found to the

1891.]     Organisation, and Classi<U+FB01>cation      of Fossil Reptilia.     519
<U+FB01>rst vertebra.      The processes for articulation with the dorsal ribs
have elongated facets, which are rarely divided into diapophyses and
parapophyses.       The sacrum includes four vertebrae, of which the <U+FB01>rst
is sacro-lumbar    and the last two sacro-caudal.    Chevron bones are well
developed along      the tail.
   The shoulder girdle is placed far forward; the precoracoid, cora
coid, and scapula are auchylosed together.        The scapula is expanded
and elongated, extending backward towards the ilium.              The clavi
cnlar arch includes <U+FB01>ve bones. The interclavicle has a descending
median bar, which expands transversely between the coracoids; its
transverse bar unites with the clavicles, which rest upon the scapulss.
They only extend half-way along the length of the superior margins
of the scapulze.      Beyond that point is another pair of bones which
represent the supraclavicles, as in Fishes and Labyrinthodonts.
   The pelvis is entirely Mammalian in form.         The puhes are almost
entirely behind the iliac bones, and unite with the ischia to form a
continuous sheet of bone, the two sides being inclined to each other
and meeting in a ventral symphysis.         There is only a small perfora
tion through the pubis, and no perforation between the pubis and
ischium, as in Mammals. The transverse processes from the four
sacral vertebrae meet the expanded blade of the ilium along its length
on each side.
   The limbs are massive and short ; the femur shows characters
which have previously been regarded as belonging to the humerus.
The distal end of the bone is perforated.          The lesser trochanter is
strongly developed.       The tibia is large and massive, and the <U+FB01>bula
slender.    These bones are much shorter than the femur.             The os
calcis is of large size, and articulates with both the <U+FB01>bula and tibia ;
the astragalus is small.       The tarsal bones of the distal row are small
and separate ; their relations to each other not de<U+FB01>nitely determined.
The metatarsal bones are strong and short; the phalanges are short,
and terminate in massive, long, <U+FB02>attened claws. In the fore-limb the
humerus is greatly expanded at both ends with a large deltoid crest.
The condyles of its distal end are well rounded ; the radius is short
and massive; the ulna expands at its proximal end, and is produced
according to the Mammalian plan so as to receive the distal end of
the humerus.        The carpus is imperfectly known. The digits were
stronger than those of the hind limb, and terminated in similar claws.
   The specimens show that in characters of the teeth and mandible
there is nothing to distinguish Anthodon from Pareiasam-us;             and
that the genus Propappus apparently has no existence, being founded
on a femur. One species is named Pareiasaurus Bainii, another is
Parciasaurus Russauwi.
   All the affinities hitherto attributed to Pareiasaurus with Labyrinth
odonts, Anomodonts, Procolophon, and Mammals are shown more

strongly in the several parts of the skeleton, by the new evidence.
The shoulder girdle is more Labyrinthodont than was previously
supposed, the skull is more Reptilian, and the pelvis and limbs are
more Mammalian, though with some resembance to Dinosaurs.
   From further evidence of the structure of the skeleton in Pr0c0l0
phon, the author regards that type as a member of the Pareiasauria,
rather than as forming a distinct sub-order.                         It also has four sacral
vertebrae.

 IV. “On      the      Theory of Electrodynamics.”              By   J. LARMOR,
                            J
       Fellow of St. olin’s College, Cambridge.                    Communicated
      by Professor J. J. THOBISON, F .R.S.                   Received May 11,
       1891.
    The electrical ideas of Clerk Maxwell, which were cultivated partly
 in relation to mechanical models of electrodynamic action, led him to
the general principle that electrical currents always <U+FB02>ow round com
plete circuits.
    To verify this principle for the case of the current which charges
a condenser,      it was necessary to postulate an electrodynamic          action
of the same type as that of a current for the electric displacement
across the dielectric, in which the excitation of the dielectric may be
 supposed, after Faraday, to consist.           The existence of such an action
has subsequently been deduced qualitatively from the general prin
ciple of action and reaction,‘ and has also been detected by various
experimenters.
    The principle also requires that the electric displacement shall not
lead to any accumulation of charge in the interior of the dielectric,
therefore that it shall be solenoidal or circuital,1' its characteristic
equation being of the type
                    d      dV       d      dV      d       JV
                   a(KJ2)+@(K<U+FB01>§)+a(K?-I.)-°’
where   V is the electric potential, and K a dielectric constant. The
surface density of the electricity conducted to a face of a condenser
must neutralise the electric displacement, and not leave any residual
effective electri<U+FB01>cation on the surface.            On taking the displacement
and the surface density each equal to KF/411-, where F denotes the
electric force, the value of K becomes unity for a vacuum dielectric;
and K represents the speci<U+FB01>c inductive capacity as measured by
electrostatic    experiments.
   When this principle of circnital currents is postulated, the theory
of electrodynamics          is reduced to the Ampere-Neumann theory of
complete circuits, of which the truth has been fully established.               It
leads, as shown by Maxwell, to the propagation of electrical action
in dielectric media by waves of transverse electric displacement,
which have the intimate relations to waves of light that are now well
known.

                           Generalised Polarisation Theory.
    The problem of determining how far these remarkable conclusions
 will still hold good when a more general view of the nature of di
 electric polarisation is assumed was considered by von Helmholtz*
 in   a series of memoirs.
    The most general conception of the polarisation of a medium
 which has been formed is the Poisson theory of magnetisation.        The
 magnetised element, whether actually produced by the orientation of
 polar molecules or otherwise, may be mathematically considered to
 be formed by the displacement of a quantity of ideal magnetic matter
 from its negative to its positive pole, thereby producing defect at the
 one end, and excess at the other end.     The element is de<U+FB01>ned mag
 netically by its moment, which is the product of the displaced
 quantity and the distance through which it is displaced.        The dis
 placement per   unit volume,   measured  by this product, is equal to the
 magnetic moment per unit volume, whether the magnetised mole
 cules <U+FB01>ll up the whole of that volume or are a system of discrete
 particles with unoccupied space between them.
      In   the electric analogue we replace ideal magnetic matter by‘ ideal
  electric matter; the displacement thus measured constitutes the elec
  tric displacement, and its rate of change per unit time represents the
  displacement current in the dielectric.     We have to consider whether
  a displacement     current  of this type suffices to make all electric
  currents circuital; and it will be sufficient and convenient to examine
  the case of a condenser which is charged through a wire connecting
  its two plates.    In the <U+FB01>rst place this notion of electric displacement
  leads to the same distribution of potential between the plates as the
  ordinary one, adopted by Maxwell;          for in the theory of induced
  magnetism there occurs a vector quantity of circuital character, the
  magnetic induction of Maxwell, of which the components are
   —p.(0lV/dw), -,u(dV/dy), —,u(dV/dz), and which, therefore, leads to
. the characteristic   equation of the potential

corresponding to the one given above.  If the displacement                                    in the
dielectric is —:c(dV/dx), —K(dV/dy), —x(dV/dz), then
                                            ;1.   = l+4mc.

                                                      be considered as a
 displacement across the opposite faces of the cube.
    Now, considering the case of a plane condenser, let   be the electric        F
 force in the dielectric between the plates; then the displacement                                is

  Thus the current is"not circuits-l, but there is an      excess of the surface
  density conducted to the surface over the displacement current from
  the surface, which is equal to'F/4vr.
      The specific inductive capacity, as determined by static experi
  ments on capacity, is here measured by ;1., the coe<U+FB01>icient in the
  expression for        0'.
      In addition tothis discontinuity at the~f'ace of a condenser plate,
  the induction in the mass of the dielectric will not be circuital unless
  the electric force is itself circuital, which it is not in the general
  electrodynamic theory to be presently discussed.
      The currentbecomes more nearly circuital the greater the value
  of   p..   If '11.,and therefore 1:, were in<U+FB01>nite we should attain the limit
  when the currents are circnital.          If the values of u for all dielectrics
  were multiplied by the same in<U+FB01>nite constant, so as to keep their
  ratios unchanged, the distribution of electric potential would not be
  altered, provided the charges on all conducting surfaces were also
  increased in that ratio; the displacement or induction, which is now
  the essential quantity in the theory, thus maintaining its original
  value.      This comes to the same thing as measuring the actual charges
   in  a.  unit which is diminished in that ratio.
      In this way the Maxwell scheme of circuital currents reveals itself as
  a limiting case of the more general polarisation theory. The in<U+FB01>nite di
  electric constant makes the excited polarisation of very great amount in
  comparison with the exciting cause; so that in the limit we may, in
  a sense, imagine the system as one of self-excited circnital polarisa
  tion, a point of view which approaches somewhat to that of Maxwell
   himself.
      This mode of connecting the two theories was pointed out by von
   Helmholtz. But his scheme takes for the new unit of charge the elec
  trostatic unit corresponding to vacuum with its new in<U+FB01>nitely great
   dielectric constant, so that this unit is reduced proportionally to the
   square root of the infinite ratio; the displacement is then in<U+FB01>nitely
   great, and the potential in<U+FB01>nitely small, according to the square root
   of this ratio.
       (This, however, should be expressed more precisely as follows :
      vot. xux.                                                        2 N

The absolute dimensions of electric charge and electric displacement
in K are both K}, those of electric force (static) Kfl. These dimen
sional relations must persist when the transition is made from von
Helmholtz’s system to Maxwell’s, so that the changes in the units are
as von Helmholtz indicates; and the ratio of the electrostatic to the
electrokinetic unit of quantity in an ideal absolute medium with K2
unity will now be the ascertained value of this constant for air or
vacuum multiplied by the square root of the value of K2 for air. The
electric pressure in a <U+FB02>uid dielectric, however, depends, in this limit
ing form of the theory, on the square of the value of the electric
displacement, as_ may be proved : thus the circumstances of ordinary
cases of statical electri<U+FB01>cation are those of <U+FB01>nite numerical value of
the displacement, notwithstanding the smallness of this absolute unit
of charge.)

   To obtain the general type of the modi<U+FB01>cation of which the theory
of electrodynamics is susceptible owing to the-existence of non
circuital currents, we start, following von Helmholtz, from the
ascertained laws for circuital currents, which may be developed
in the manner of Neumann and Maxwell from the electrodynamic
potential

variation due to  any virtual displacement of the system, a force acting
in the direction   of the displacement producing an increment of T;
the electric forces are derived according to Lenz’s law or Maxwell’s
kinetic theory.   The equations of the <U+FB01>eld are thus all expressible in
terms of this function T. When non-circuital currents are con
templated, the currents ¢, /, now varying with s,      must be placed                        s’,
inside the integral signs; and to     must be added the most general

1891.]                 On the Theory            of Electrodynamics.                                         527
  It  is to be observed that the form of ¢(r) a<U+FB01>ects only the forces (iv)
in this scheme of attraction, as one would expect from the fact that
¢(r) disappears if either current flows round a complete circuit.
   Not to refer to (ii) and (iii), we notice from (iv) that two changing
electri<U+FB01>cations attract each other with a force involving a, term which
is constant at all distances, unless-a special‘form of ¢(r) be assigned
differing from any of the values which oocur in the sequel. It is
di<U+FB01>icult to imagine the mechanical basis of such an action; the
remarks of von Helmholtz in justification (against Bertrand) may,
however, be referred             to.".'
   This investigation of the mechanical forces is equivalent to von
Helmholtz's with the exception that he takes atthe beginning ¢(r)
to be proportional to r, on the general gronnl that the potential
energy of two elements in all natural actions involves only the
inverse <U+FB01>rst power of the distance.- The validity of this consideration
seems to be weakened by the fact noticed above that ¢(r) occurs only
in the force (iv). For what follows it will not be necessary to restrict
the form of ¢(r).
   To discuss the propagation of electrical action in continuous media,
we have to translate T from the form suitable to linear distributions
to the form suitable to volume distributions.         Following the method
<U+FB01>rst developed by Kirchho<U+FB01>, and for this case the analysis of von
Helmholtz, the energy function for any <U+FB01>eld of currents is to be
obtained by summation -of the energy functions of all the pairs of
elementary <U+FB01>laments of currents that compose it, care being taken
that no pair is counted twice over. The proper form will be a.
volume integral ; instead of dc‘, 11.9’, the elements of the <U+FB01>lament, it will
involve d1, d1’, the elements of volume, and instead of 1,               the                          1',

The value of K1 in electromagnetic units is very small, the square of
the reciprocal of the velocity of light in the medium; so that there
are, broadly, two classes of media,        conductors in which K1 is
neglected, (ii) insulators in which ulvlwl are zero. The equations of
propagation for each case are. involved in the above equations.

  The simplest and most important case of this generalised theory,
as displacement currents in conductors are negligible, is that of
dielectrics.

 this is possible, for to determine S we have simply

 pears from them.          The propagation of S or V/41r has already been
 considered.
     For a system of non-condensational waves of this kind, propagated
 along the axis of a:, all the quantities must be functions of :0; there
 fore   f  must vanish; that is, the displacement must be perpendicular
  to the direction of propagation.            These Waves are therefore waves of
  transverse displacement.

1891.]             On the T/wary        of Electrodynamics.                      533
   We conclude that the propagation          of waves of transverse dis
placement with this velocity K," is not a characteristic of any special
 theory, but forms a part of any conceivable theory which admits
some sort of polarisation in the dielectric, and leads to the correct
results for Ampere’s case of circuital currents.
    This cardinal result will still follow, even if X is any function what
ever.    The degree of (mathematical)generality which this remark
imparts may be expressed as follows. In a complete circuit the one
thing essential to the established theory is that the electric force
integrated round the circuit should be equal to the time rate of
change of the magnetic induction through it, and, therefore, have an
ascertainable value, though its distribution round the circuit is a sub
ject of hypothesis.     The conclusion that waves of transverse dis
placement will be propagated in a dielectric with velocity K," will
hold good if we assume any form whatever for the electric force
which does not violate this one relation, and also assume an electro
static polarisation of the medium, equal at each point to the electric
force multiplied by a constant K,/41r.      For the indeterminateness that
may exist in the vector potential (or electric momentum) FGH is of
the same type as that which may exist in the electric force PQR,
and, therefore, as the equations show, may be merged in the latter.
It would, perhaps, be di<U+FB02>icult to conceive any more general hypothesis
than this.
   The increased generality which can be imparted to the theory
merely leads to various modes of propagation of a condensational
wave.

   Now, the results of various experimental investigations seem to
place it beyond doubt that for dielectrics of simple chemical consti
tution the velocity of propagation varies as Kfi. Thus, in the recent

long, guided by a pair of parallel wires, was measured by interference
experiments when a part of lhe circuit was surrounded by various
liquid dielectrics.    The great length of the wave compared with the
section of the conductor ensures that it travels with its front sensibly
in the direction of propagation, and, therefore, that its velocity is
 normal; while the presence of the return wire limits its divergence
into space. Their results are expressed in the following table which
gives K2‘, the index of refraction m for light waves of length 6.10'7
metres, and the index of refraction m’ for the observed Waves of
 about 6 metres long :—

 the substances tested, which; can only be the case in the limiting
 form of the polarisation            theory which constitutes Maxwell’s dis
 placement theory.      In     that case, as has been -seen, the currents are
 all circuital;     the Ampere-Neumann theory of electrodynamics
 su<U+FB02>ices for all purposes, and there is no condensational wave.
    The stand-point from which the theory of dielectric polarisation
 has been generalised in the theory here expounded is that of polar,
 elements attracting according to the law of inverse squares in the
 manner of small magnets.              In the results, however, this conception
 disappears and the. phenomena are allexpressed in the continuous
 manner by means of partial di<U+FB01>erential equations.
    It is also possible, in Maxwell’s manner, to ignore the attractions
 of the elements from the beginning, and simply to de<U+FB01>ne the displace
 ment as proportional to the electric force.               The statical theory of
 condensers shows that in the dielectric the displacement must be
 circuital, for the characteristic equation of the potential must hold
 good.    The displacement constant assumed by Maxwell is equal to
 the speci<U+FB01>c inductive capacity, in order to ensure that the charging
 current shall be continuous across the faces of a condenser. It might
 be proposed to take a less restricted form for this constant, with the
 result, of course, that the currents would be non-circuital.             The in
 vestigation of this paper, however, proves that in all cases the velocity
 of the waves of transverse displacement is speci<U+FB01>ed in terms of this
 displacement constant; and the experimental fact that in the simpler
 media it is determined in the same manner by the speci<U+FB01>c inductive
  capacity con<U+FB01>nes us to that value of the constant which is assumed

by Maxwell.‘ It is necessary to emphasise that it is of the very
essence of a theory of this kind that the current in the dielectric is
not circuital, and, therefore, that the electric volume density pro
duced by the electric displacement varies with the time.                  This is so
because the electrodynamic         part of the electric force is not derived
from a potential.        Any investigation which restricts the current to
be circuital is necessarily inconsistent with itself, except for the
limiting case which forms Maxwell's theory.
    A discrepancy of n per cent. (n a small number) between the
observed velocity and K," would involve, by the formulae at the
beginning of this section, a difference of about 2n per cent. between
 K, and K,—1, so that K, would be of numerical magnitude about
 100/2n; which determines the ratio in which the ordinary values of
 the inductive capacities of all media, including vacuum, would have
 to be multiplied, to make the polarisation theory not discordant with
 the observations.
    The amount of discontinuity in the current at the surface of a
 conductor is the fraction K,“l of the total current across the surface.
  At the interface between two dielectric media, denoted by the values
 K2 and K}, the normal        components    of the displacement         on the two
 sides are
                        (K,-1)}?/41     and   (K',-1)N',’4-F,
 where N, N’ are the normal components of the electric force, so that
                                  K,N = K’,N’.
    Thus the discontinuity in the displacement 'is (N'-—N)/41r or
  (K,/K’,—l) N/41r compared with a total displacement (K2-1)N/411‘;
 the ratio of these is (K,--K',)/K',(K,—1), which is less than the
 fraction K'f‘, which corresponds to the surface of a conductor.
    Thus, under the assumed circumstances,-‘ the ratio of the amplitudes
  of the condensational waves to those of the transverse waves would
.have a superior limit of the-order 211/ 100; in the observations quoted
  this limit is at 5 per cent.
     It is worth while to emphasise that if the polarisation theory were
  to take K2 equal to unity for a vacuum, K1 would be zero, and in a
  vacuum there would be nothing but action at a distance.                  It is thus
  an essential part of a theory like this that a vacuum has an absolute
  inductive capacity greater than unity, so that the ordinary value
  unity is merely a relative unit.         Thus the transition to Maxwell’s
  scheme, where the absolute coellicients are all assumed in<U+FB01>nite, does
  not involve any undue stretch of the original hypothesis.
     In the above, the relative velocities in different media of the

transverse waves have been considered.             The absolute velocity in a
vacuum must take account of the fact that the ratio of the electro
static and electromagnetic units of quantity has been altered by the
factor K',* in the transition to Maxwell's theory, where K’2 now
represents the assumed absolute inductive capacity of the vacuum:
thus the velocity for vacuum is (1—K’{‘)'* multiplied by the ratio
of the electric units in vacuum, agreeing with von Helmholtz’s result,*
on writing this inductive capacity K’; for his constant 1+41r60, and
exceeding the velocity of light unless K’, is very great.
   The theory of electrodynamics would thus appear to be, on all sides,
limited to Maxwell's scheme, which has also so much to recommend
it on the score of intrinsic simplicity.

        F.I.O.     Communicated        by Professor        G. JOHNSON,    F.R.S.
        Received April 28, 1891.
                                    (Abstract)
     The author has endeavoured to ascertain by careful experiments
                                                                       “
  how far the substances hitherto prepared from <U+FB02>esh are true educts,"
  and really present in the <U+FB02>esh itself, or merely products, due to
  (1) the action of chemical or physical agencies applied in the course
  of extraction, or (2) to bacterial action modifying the composition of
  the flesh before it comes into the hands of‘ the_ operator.

 1891.]       Dr. F. Evans’ Paper    on the Fungus    of Malaria.       539
     Preliminary    experiments are <U+FB01>rst described bearing chie<U+FB02>y upon
 the <U+FB01>rst-named source of error.
1
     Liebig’s process for extracting kreatine from the juice of <U+FB02>esh was
  modi<U+FB01>ed by omitting the use of baryta-water, with the result that
  abundance of kreatine was obtained, mixed with acid potassium
  phosphate (KH,PO,).         In Liebig’s process potassium chloride is
  obtained after the kreatine has been separated.
     A preliminary experiment is then described in which the author
  precipitated the albuminoid matters from the watery extract of fresh
  butcher's beef by means of solution of mercuric chloride, the <U+FB01>ltrate
  depositing    on standing a spherical precipitate, consisting of the
  mercury    salt of the sarcous kreatinin, from which a tabular kreatinin
  was obtained isomorphous with the tabular kreatinin obtained by
  the author from human urine in 1887.
      The special advantages of the method adopted by the author in
  isolating the kreatinin of urine are next detailed, after which a series
  of experiments are described in which muscle substance in different
  stages of freshness was extracted with water, the extracts treated by
  the mercuric chloride method, and the products compared.
      Among these products is sarcous kreatinin, whose properties are
  fully described and carefully compared with those of urinary
  kreatinins previously investigated       (vide ‘Roy. Soc. Proc.,’ vol. 43,
  pp. 493-534).
      The <U+FB01>nal conclusion drawn is that sarcous kreatine is not present
  in fresh muscle, but results from bacterial action, whereas sarcous
   kreatinin is probably a true “ educt.”
   II. “Note      on Dr. Fenton Evans’ Paper on the Pathogenic
         Fungus of Malaria.”        By W. T. THISELTON DYER, M.A.,
         C.M.G., F.R.S. Received May 12, 1891.
      The abstract of this paper published in this volume of the ‘ Proceed
        ’
   ings contains (p. 200) the following statement: “Alteration in the
   chemical composition of the nutrient medium            . . . elicited the
   interesting fact that, under these circumstances, the organism can
   pass to a. more highly developed state, displaying the structure and
   fructi<U+FB01>cation of a highly organised fungus, but differing in certain
   important features from any fungus hitherto described.”
      This statement will remain on record, and can hardly fail to cause
   some perplexity to future students of the aetiology of malaria.         I
   was present at the reading of the paper.       The fungus exhibited was
   undoubtedly “ highly organised.”       It was in point of fact a typical
   Mucor, and my friend Professor Marshall Ward, who was also
   present, was disposed to regard it as identical with the form known
      von. mix.                                                   2 o

  as Muoor racemosus.    The identi<U+FB01>cation was so unmistakable that I
  utterly fail to understand in what “important features” the fungus
  differed “ from any fungus hitherto described.”
     In the face of the undoubted fact that the fungus was a charac
  teristic Mucor, it seems to me very improbable that it has a genetic
  relationship with any of the organisms found in the blood, and much
  more likely that its appearance in the nutrient medium was due to
  some experimental    error.
  III.  “Method of indexing Finger-Marks.” By FRANCIS GALTON,
                    F.R.S. Received April 30, 1891.
     Sufficient proof was adduced by me in a memoir read November 27,
  1890,   before the Royal Society (‘ Phil. Trans.,’ B, 1891), of the
  extraordinary persistence of the papillary ridges on the inner surface
  of the hands throughout life. It was shown that the impression in
  ink upon paper of each <U+FB01>nger tip, contained on the average from
  twenty-<U+FB01>ve to thirty distinct points of reference, every one of
  Which, with the rarest exception, appeared to be absolutely
  persistent.   Consequently that it was possible to affirm with practical
  certainty Whether or no any two submitted impressions were made
  by the <U+FB01>ngers of the same person.
     In the present memoir     I  shall explain the way in which <U+FB01>nger
  prints may be indexed and referred to after the fashion of a dictionary, -
-and on the same general principle as that devised by A. Bertillon
  with respect to anthropometric measures, whose ingenious method
  is now in regular use on a very large scale in the criminal
  administration of France and elsewhere.     I desire to show how vastly
  the practical ef<U+FB01>ciency of any such method as that of A. Bertillon
  admits of being increased by taking <U+FB01>nger prints into account in the
  way about to be described.
     It must not, however, be supposed that the use of indexing <U+FB01>nger
  marks is limited to the above purpose, the power of doing so being
  equally needed for racial and hereditary inquiries.      I do not dwell
  upon these applications now, simply because    I am engaged in making
  them, and the results are not yet ready to be published.        I ought,
  however, to mention that a great increase of experience has fully con
  <U+FB01>rmed my earlier views, that <U+FB01>nger marks are singularly appropriate
  subjects of anthropometric     study owing to many distinct reasons.
 ‘The impressions are easily to be made by anyone who has the proper
  appliances at hand.    They are as durable as any other printed matter,
  and they occupy very little space.     The patterns are usually sharp
  and clear, and their minutiw are independent of age and growth.
  They are necessarily trustworthy, and no reluctance is shown in per

mitting them to be taken, which can be founded either upon personal
vanity or upon an unwillingness to communicate undesirable family
peculiarities.
    Without caring to dwell on many of my earlier failures to index
the <U+FB01>nger prints in a satisfactory way, my description shall be con
<U+FB01>ned to that which has proved to be a success. It is based on a
small variety of conspicuous di<U+FB01>erences of pattern in each of many
digits, and not upon the numerous minute peculiarities of a single
digit. My conclusions are principally based on a study of the im
pressions of all ten digits of 289 di<U+FB02>ferent persons, but the tables
about to be given refer only to the <U+FB01>rst 100 on my list.             These
are su<U+FB01>iciently numerous to serve as a fair sample of what we might
always expect to <U+FB01>nd, while they are not too cumbrous to print and
to discuss in full detail.
    I described in my previous memoir the way in which the impres
sions had been made that were then shown.            A plate of copper was
 blackened with printer’s ink, the ink being of a rather <U+FB02>uid cha
racter, and spread very thinly and evenly over its surface by a
 printer’s roller. The thumb, which was then the subject of discussion,
was pressed and slightly rolled on the inked plate, and afterwards on
the paper. In the present collection of all ten digits, four operations
 were used in each case.         First the four <U+FB01>ngers of one hand were
 simultaneously printed from, and then its thumb in the way above
 described ; afterwards, the other hand was treated in the same way.
    Though I have spoken and shall speak only of impressions, it is
 not really necessary for the purpose of compiling an index to make
 any impression at all.      The entries that are wanted for the index can
 be derived directly from the <U+FB01>ngers themselves.
    I rely, for the purpose of indexing, on the three elementary divi
 sions of primaries, whorls, and loops.        They are severally expressed
 by the numerals 1 and 2, 3 and 4, 5 and 6. The reason of this
double numeration is that most of the patterns have a de<U+FB01>nite axis.
 Those that are formed by ridges which proceed from only one side
 of the <U+FB01>nger, will necessarily lie in a sloping direction across its
 axis pointing to the one side or the other according to that from
 which the supply of ridges proceeds. The only patterns that are
 symmetrically disposed about a vertical axis are b and to a lesser
 degree a, c, h, and 1] in fig. 1. Usually, and, as we may say, normally,
 the slope of the axis of the pattern is (roughly) parallel to a line
 drawn from a tip of the fore<U+FB01>nger to the base of the little <U+FB01>nger.
All normal slopes, as well as all the patterns that have no de<U+FB01>nite
 axis, are expressed by the odd numerals 1, 3, or 5. All abnormal
 slopes are expressed by the even numerals 2, 4, or 6.         It cannot be
 too strongly insisted that the words right and left are ambiguous and
 should not be used here.

1891.]            Method   of indexing Fiwiger-Marks.                 543
patterns on the digits, is divided into two groups of three numerals
and two groups of two numerals, as 355, 455, 55, 35. The <U+FB01>rst group
355 refers to the <U+FB01>rst, second, and third <U+FB01>ngers of the left hand; the
second group 455 to the <U+FB01>rst, second, and third <U+FB01>ngers of the right
hand; the third group 55 to the thumb and fourth <U+FB01>nger of the left
hand; the fourth group 35 to the thumb and fourth <U+FB01>nger of the
right hand. The index is arranged in the numerical sequence of these
sets of numbers as shown in <U+FB01>g. 2 and in Table I.
   Before translating the patterns into numerals, I <U+FB01>nd it an excellent
plan to draw symbolic pictures of the several patterns in the order
in which they appear in the impression, or in the <U+FB01>ngers themselves,
as the case may be, con<U+FB01>ning myself to the limited number of symbols
shown in <U+FB01>g. 1, which have fairly well su<U+FB01>iced for my 289 sets or
2890 <U+FB01>nger marks, as well as for many others.     A little violence has
of course to be used now and then, in <U+FB01>tting some unusual pattern to
one of these symbols.   But we are familiar with such processes in
 ordinary spelling, where the same letter does duty for different sounds,
as a   in the words as, ask, ale, and all. The merits of this process
are many.      It facilitates a leisurely revision of <U+FB01>rst determinations;
it affords a pictorial record of the character of each pattern ; it
 prevents mistakes between normal and abnormal slopes ; it prevents
confusion when changing the sequence of the entries from the order
of the impressions to that used in the index; and, lastly, it affords
considerable help to a yet further subdivision of the patterns.       This
may be inferred from the <U+FB01>rst two lines of <U+FB01>g. 2, which have the same
index numbers, but whose pictured forms di<U+FB01>er in respect to the two
thumbs, and to the middle <U+FB01>nger of the left hand.
  I  will now describe the symbols in detail, and show how such small
di<U+FB01>iculty as arises from rare transitional or border cases is minimised.
   The primaries in their earliest and purest form are su<U+FB01>iciently
expressed by the symbol a, <U+FB01>g. 1. From this elementary type all
other sorts of patterns seem to be lineally descended. A fairly pure
form of this type is seen in b; this is not infrequent in <U+FB01>ngers, but I
have not once met with it among some thousands of thumbs.                A
nascent whorl, still so immature as to count as a primary, is sym
bolised by 0; similarly nascent loops, that should undoubtedly be
counted as primaries, by d and e. When, however, the loop form is
more pronounced and the pattern has been accepted as a primary only
after reasonable hesitation as to whether it was not a loop, a dot is
                             f
put inside the symbol, as in and g, to serve as a warning. In this
case, supposing another person to reckon the doubtful <U+FB01>nger-mark as a
loop and to refer and fail to <U+FB01>nd it under that head, he would make a
second reference by treating it as a primary. A dot always means :1
possibly transitional case; thus   '1'   and
                                          s     signify that they had been
accepted   as loops  after  some hesitation.

      The whorls include circles, ellipses, and spirals, both simple and
    compound, whatever may be the direction or closeness of their twist.
    These are so apt to be confounded together unless the impression is
    from a rolled <U+FB01>nger and is afterwards scrutinised and outlined (as
    explained in my previous memoir) that it seems best for the present
    purpose to group them all, with few exceptions, under the one
    symbol h. The exceptions are these. When two streams of ridges
    proceed from opposite sides of the <U+FB01>nger and interlock, the symbol 11
    is used, regardless of all other details.    Again, when the whorl is
    crozier shaped, as in and      jit   necessarily enclosed in a loop, but
                                            10,       is
    the loop     here ignored.

    mistakably to either of the plain eyes     u,     dotted for a warning,

    as in and m.
              Z
       The loops in their simplest and common forms are shown by 11. and
    0.   Frequently they have an internal offset which may be variously
    feathered or bent, short of being awhorl; all such cases are expressed
'
    by p,     They have sometimes a conspicuous eye due to an internal
               q.
    curvature of the ridges upon themselves, or even to an eye in the
    central ridge; these are all expressed by or u, in which the sur     t
    rounding loop     left out in order to avoid multiplicity of lines. When
                              is
    the eye approaches nearly to a crozier as in     m, the dotted symbols
                                                                         l,
    r, w are used.
       In making a large and complete index, the symbols would, of course,
    be cast as movable types, and be printed with the letterpress.         It
    will      be seen from <U+FB01>g.     2   that there          is   space    for   20 entries   in one 8vo
    page.
    I            expect from my own reiterated experiences that there
              do not
    would be much trouble due to transitional cases, after a standard
    collection of doubtful forms had been establised so as to ensure that

    uniformity in my own judgment.
    I    give an index of 100 cases they are the <U+FB01>rst that occurred in my

    and are consequently numbered      1'      2', in order; but there are a

    few blanks, so the numbers in the index happen to run from        to 56',                 1
    with some omissions, and not from     to 50'.          1
      These cases afford data for roughly measuring the increase in
    power of discrimination obtained by basing indexes on the patterns
    of   1,   2,   and 10 digits respectively.
                    3,   6,                      It appears from Table                             III
    that when all 10 digits are used, the number of different patterns
    observed in the 100 cases was 83; therefore the average number of
    references required to pick out a single well-de<U+FB01>ned case from among
    these 100 would be equal to 100 divided by 83, that is, to about 1;}.
       It will also be seen from Table                 III
                                           that, owing to the large effect of
    correlation, an index based on all the ten digits    not much superior         is

in e<U+FB02>iciency to      one  that is based on only six, namely, upon the <U+FB01>rst
three <U+FB01>ngers of both hands.           In the 100 different sets there are 83
varieties of pattern in the one case and 65 in the other, which roughly
accords with the relative e<U+FB01>iciency of 5 to 4.          When all the 289 cases
are similarly treated, the relative e<U+FB02>iciency comes out as 213 to 139, or
roughly as 3 to 2. This is a little better but not much. It is, there
fore, a fair question whether it is worth while to impress all the 10
digits. The chief advantage of doing so is to add to the volume
of evidence, and to supply data which mutilation, or bad scars, or
obliteration due to some exceptional cause might render of value. We
also see from Table      III  that the three <U+FB01>ngers of both hands are more
than twice as efficient for the purposes of an index as those of one
hand only; again, that three <U+FB01>ngers are nearly twice as useful as
two.    I  may mention that for my present inquiries into racial and
hereditary patterns I am, for various reasons, dealing only with the
three <U+FB01>rst <U+FB01>ngers of the right hand, and slightly rolling the fore
<U+FB01>nger, so as to obtain a       full impression   of its pattern on the side of
the thumb.
    The greatest difficulty in constructing a uniformly e<U+FB02>icient cata
logue lies in the troublesome frequency of plain loops, so that even the
method of picture writing fails to analyse satisfactorily the numerous
555, 555; 55, 55 cases.           When searching through a large number
of similarly indexed prints for a particular specimen, it is a very
expeditious method to <U+FB01>x on any one well-marked characteristic of a
minute kind, such as an island, or enclosure, or a couple of adjacent
 bifurcations, that may present itself in any one of the <U+FB01>ngers, and in
 making the search to use a lens or lenses of low power, <U+FB01>xed at the
end of an arm, and to con<U+FB01>ne the attention solely to looking for that
one characteristic.       The cards on which the <U+FB01>nger marks have been
made may then be passed successively under the lens with great
rapidity.     I   fear that the method of counting ridges (as the number
of ridges in the     AH    of my previous memoir) would be di<U+FB01>icult to use
 by persons who were not experts.           Anyhow,   I have not yet been able
 to devise a plan for doing so that       I can recommend.

       University College, Cardiff.               Communicated         by W. H.
      FLOWER, F.R.S. Received May 4, 1891.
                                     (Abstract.)
   The work which has resulted in the present paper was begun in
Freiburg in the summer of 1888, when the author was fortunate
enough, owing to the generosity of Professor Wiedersheim, to obtain
a number of fresh specimens for examination.                   As so many interest
ing points presented themselves at an early stage in the research, a.
short preliminary notice, without illustrations, was published in the
following autumn (‘ Berichte d. Naturforsch. Gesellschaft                        zu
Freiburg i.Br.,’ vol. 4, 1888).‘
   This notice merely forms the basis of the present paper, in which
the whole subject has been worked out in greater detail.                A number
of new facts are recorded, some of the author's earlier conclusions
modi<U+FB01>ed, and the paper illustrated with 11 plates containing 71
<U+FB01>gures.
   With the exception of certain special details, the structure of the
skeleton   and of the nervous and muscular systems is not described,
the paper consisting mainly of an account of other organs which
have not received so much attention from previous observers, and of
a comparison of Protopterus with the other genera of Dipnoi, so far
as  their structure is known, as well as with other Ichthyopsida.
   The author returns his sincere thanks to the Council of the Royal
 Society for the grant out of which various expenses connected with
the investigation were defrayed, as well as to Professor Wiedersheim,
not only for the gift of abundant fresh and preserved material, but
also for his continued help and advice during the progress of the
work. To Professor Howes the author is indebted for many valuable
suggestions.
   A number     of details with regard to the habits of Protopterus in
captivity are given, and reference is made to Stnhlmann’s observa
tions with regard to its mode of life under natural conditions.
   The paired extremities, the movements of which are more like
those of limbs than of <U+FB01>ns, show no connexion with the cheiroptery
gium, and, in spite of their considerable nerve supply, are evidently
greatly degenerated structures             as regards        their free portions.
Sensory organs are not present            on   them, and they therefore cannot
have a tactile function.      Their distal ends, like the apex of the tail,
are very variable, and can undoubtedly be reproduced when lost by
                       "‘ See also ‘

550          Prof. VV.  N. Parker.    On the Anatomy and      [May 28,
 accident.  The tail is almost certainly not primarily diphycercal,
and shows signs of a. possible origin from a heterocercal form.
   The epidermis on the whole most nearly resembles that of Perenni
branchiate Amphibians, and gives rise to simple multicellular glands
 (which are most numerous on the snout), as well as to very numerous
closely-packed goblet-cells, which produce the gluey secretion as well
as the main substance of the capsule which surrounds the animal during
the torpid state. The epidermis forms a regular and continuous
layer over the derma, in which the cycloid imbricating scales are
imbedded.    Pigment cells are present in both layers of the integu
ment,   and the derma encloses nests of leucocytes here and there,
small cells, apparently migratory leucocytes, being seen in places
amongst the ordinary epidermio cells.
   Integumentary sense organs, similar to those of Fishes and larval
Amphibians, are present not only on the head and lateral line, but
in various other regions of the trunk also; they are most numerous
on the head. In young animals they are all super<U+FB01>cial, and do not
project below the general level of the epidermis, and this condition
is retained in those situated on the trunk.         On the head, the
epidermis becomes involnted along certain lines to form grooves,
which then become converted into sub-epidermic tubes, in which the
sensory organs are situated, and which communicate with the exterior
by an aperture at one end. The relations of the sensory organs of
the trunk are therefore similar to those seen in young stages of Fishes
and in Amphibian larvae, while in the case of the head, they resemble
those which are typical for adult Fishes.         End-buds, similar in
structure to the taste-buds of Fishes and Amphibians, are present on
the tongue and oral epithelium, but are absent on the lips, and, as in
Amphibians, do not occur on the surface of the body.
   As regards its general structure, the olfactory organ most nearly
resembles that of Elasmobranchs, but the presence of posterior nostrils
raises it to a higher level.    The position of the anterior nostrils
beneath the upper lip is probably to be accounted for as an adapta
tion in connexion with the torpid state (vide infra).        The space
between the eyeball and its muscles and the orbit is <U+FB01>lled with a
delicate connective tissue; there are no orbital glands or eyelids.
Four straight and two oblique muscles are present. The cornea is
continuous with the derma on the one hand, and the sclerotic on the
other; the latter is <U+FB01>brous in young animals, and islands of cartilage
<U+FB01>rst appear at the points of insertion of eye-muscles, and then
gradually extend so as to chondrify the whole sclerotic.        The eye
resembles that of Amphibians; a processus falczformis and campa
nula Halleri are absent, and no ciliary muscles were observed, though
possibly present; almost all the pigment of the eye is ectodermic.
   No specialised glands are present in connexion with the greatly

1891.]            Physiology of Protopterus  anneotens.             551
folded epithelium of the oral cavity.     The lips contain no muscles.
The tongue, as well as the palate, is covered with blunt conical
papillae, on which the taste-buds are situated.        Beneath the epi
thelium the tongue is composed anteriorly to the hyoid of a simple
connective tissue, while posteriorly to the hyoid it is made up of
 extrinsic muscles, the main mass of which is continuous with the
ventral musculature of the trunk. A horny cap is developed over
 each tooth from the overlying epithelium, which apparently becomes
out through by the sharp edges and points of the teeth, and which
 probably corresponds to the cuticula deniis. The thyroid is a small
 bilobed organ imbedded in the tongue just above the hyoid symphysis,
 and has the characteristic structure.        The thymus consists of
 lymphoid tissue, and is situated dorsally and posterior to the
 branchial arches, surrounding the blood-vessels of the external
 gills.
    The alimentary canal extends almost in a straight line from the
 mouth to the vent.       A ventral, as well as a fenestrated dorsal,
 mesentery is present supporting the intestine. The so-called urinary
 bladder (“ cloacal caecum ”) opens into the cloaca dorsally to the
 intestine ; the author compares it with the “ processus digitiformis ”
 of Elasmobranchs.      A spleen and pancreas are present, imbedded
 in the thin walls of the stomach, and extending on to the proximal
 part of the intestine; they are covered externally by sparse muscular
 <U+FB01>bres as well as by the peritoneum.      The relations of the pancreas
 therefore most nearly resemble those met with in Ganoids and
 certain Teleosteans.     The pancreas is deeply pigmented, and its
 ducts open into the bile-duct. The pigmented walls of the intestine
 and the spiral valve are very thick, owing to the abundance of
 lymphoid tissue contained within them. With the exception of the
 bursa entiana, the internal walls of which are raised up into a number
 of deeply pigmented oblique folds, the whole of the mucous membrane
 of the stomach and intestine is perfectly smooth, and there is no
 indication of any diiferentiated gastric or intestinal glands.
    Cilia are present on the epithelium throughout the stomach and
 intestine.   The epithelium is columnar and strati<U+FB01>ed, and branched
 pigment    cells extend into it in the greater part of the intestine.
 Small leucocytes can be recognised among the epithelial cells here
 and there.     A layer of small-celled lymphoid tissue directly under
 lies the epithelium.     In the spleen and lymphoid organs of the
 intestine two kinds of tissue are present: (1) a large-celled tissue,
 which forms the greater part of these organs, and which somewhat
 resembles embryonic connective tissue; and (2) a smaller-celled
 tissue, similar to that lying directly beneath the epithelium,      and
 resembling that of ordinary lymphoid follicles.        Large migratory
 cells are present in both kinds of tissue, many of which enclose

552           Prof. VV. N. Parker.     On the Anatomy and      [May 28,
yellowish granules.     Gradations between these and rounded cells of a
deeper yellow or brown colour can apparently be made out; the latter
are arranged in larger or smaller groups, and cells appearing to be
intermediate forms between these and the ordinary black branched
pigment cells can also be seen.      The lymphoid tissue is penetrated
by networks of blood-vessels, and it seems probable that the yellow
granules   mentioned above are due to the disintegration          of red
corpuscles, which   are  ingested by leucocytes, and  then undergo some
change, whereby the latter gradually pass into the condition of black
pigment cells, which migrate through the epithelium, and are so got
rid of.   The muscular layers are very thin. A muscular-is niucosaa is
present, and the circular and longitudinal layers are represented, but
the direction of the <U+FB01>bres is in many regions di<U+FB02>icult to trace.
 Strands, only a few cells in thickness, extend throughout the
lymphoid tissue of the intestine, and some of these unite to form a
longitudinal band passing down the axis of the spiral valve.
    An analysis of the contents of the gut, for which the author is
indebted to Professor Baumann, while yielding negative results as
regards the stomach, proves the presence of peptones, in small
quantities, in the intestine.   The question as to the mode of digestion
and absorption of the food in Protopterus is discussed.
    The branchial apparatus shows signs of considerable reduction.
 Internal gills are present on the posterior face of the hyoid, on both
facesof the third and fourth branchial arches, and on the anterior
face of the <U+FB01>fth. Three pairs of external gills were present in all
specimens, even the largest, examined.     The pulmonary apparatus, on
the whole, more nearly resembles the air-bladder and its duct of certain
 Ganoids than the lungs and laryngo-tracheal chamber of Amphibians.
 The pulmonary branches of the vagus cross one another at the base of
the lungs.
    The blood is remarkable for the large size of its elements, which
is only exceeded in the case of Proteus and Si1'en, as Well as for the
large proportion of white corpuscles in comparison with the red ones.
Two forms of the former are described, in one of which <U+FB01>ne radiating
pseudopodia can be protruded, and different stages in the degenera
tion of the nucleus and cell-body could be observed. The chief points
of interest with regard to the blood-vessels are as follows :—(1) the
presence of a paired pulmonary artery, the left supplying the ventral,
and the right the dorsal, aspect of the lungs; (2) the presence of a
single true post-caval, along with a persistent left posterior cardinal
vein; and (3) the single caudal vein, giving rise to a right and a left
renal portal.
   No external sexual di<U+FB01>erences could be observed, and amongst the
specimens examined, females were the more abundant.           The urine
genital organs are surrounded by masses of tissue resembling the

 1891.]         Physiology of P1-otopterus annectens.                553
large-celled lymphoid tissue of the gut, but differing from the latter
in becoming largely converted into adipose tissue. The kidneys
probably represent the mesonephros, and their duct the Wol<U+FB01>an duct ;
nephrostomes    are absent.
    In unripe males, delicate Miillerian  ducts are present.   The sperm
is conducted to the exterior by a duct, which is probably formed in
connexion with the testis, quite independently of the excretory ap
paratus.    The seminal tubules are directly connected with it, and it
 opens into the base of the Miillerian duct, the rest of which ap
parently aborts completely.        Unlike most of the tissue elements,
which are very large, and closely resemble those of the Amphibia, the
 spermatozoa are very minute, and are remarkable in possessing 2‘/wo
vibratile <U+FB02>agella attached to the carrot-shaped “ head.” The genera
tive organs of the female bear a striking resemblance to those of
 Amphibians. The oviduct corresponds to the Mllllerian duct ; the
epithelium covering its internal folds shows signs of degeneration
similar to those which have recently been described amongst
 Urodeles.
    N0 traces of a sympathetic    were found.
    An account of the mode of life of Protopterus during the torpid
 period is given. The coccoon is provided with a “lid,” perforated by
 a hollow funnel-shaped tube, which passes between the lips of the
 animal, and thus forms     a passage for the respiratory current. The
source of nutriment during the summer sleep lies in the adipose
 tissue in connexion with the gonads and kidneys and alongside the
 notochord in the tail, as well as in the lateral muscles, some of which,
-especially in the caudal region, undergo a granular degeneration.
 Very probably the latter is the precursor of the fatty degeneration,
 and, in all probability, leucocytes are the active transporting agents
of the degenerated material.          This assumption would help to
explain the large development of lymphoid tissue in the body of the
 animal.
    An analysis of the muscles, by Professor Baumann, shows that
 they do not retain quantities of the products of nitrogenous waste,
as is the case in Elasmobranchs.
    The systematic position of the Dipnoi is brie<U+FB02>y discussed in the
 light of the new facts brought forward in the present paper. Although
 the Dipnoi present many points of resemblance to Fishes on the one
 hand, and to the lower Amphibians on the other, their connexion with
 any living forms of either class is probably a very distant one, and
 it is inadvisable to classify them amongst the Fishes. Owing to
 the absence of ontological evidence, and to the incompleteness
 of our knowledge of the palaeontological history of the Dipnoi, it is
 impossible to construct a genealogical tree which will show, with any
approach to accuracy, the probable connexion between them and other

Ichthyopsidan types. The most that can be said at present, with any
thing like certainty, is that the Dipnoi are the isolated survivors of
an exceedingly ancient group, which was probably related to the
ancestors of existing Fishes and Amphibians.              Amongst the former,
the connexion seems to be closest to the Elasmobranchs, more par
ticularly to the Chimaaroids on the one hand, and to such an ancient
Selachian type as Chlamydoselache on the other; but at the same
time, the Ganoids probably arose from the common ancestral stock
not very far off’.    Though retaining many primitive characters, the
Dipnoi, and more especially Protopterus and Lepidosireu, are in some
respects highly specialised, the specialisation being largely due to a
change of habit.

      OBITUARY NOTICES OF FELLOWS DECEASED.
   In Ansxmnna Jonx Ennis        the Society have lost an earnest and
useful worker in several important branches of knowledge.        He was
a learned mathematician, an accomplished scholar, an original
thinker, an indefatigable investigator, and an industrious writer;
and his contributions to some of the more obscure and unfamiliar
subjects of scienti<U+FB01>c study have been numerous, varied, and remark
able.
    He was born at Hoxton in 1814, and his original name was Sharpe,
having been changed to Ellis in 1825.        It is believed that this was
done in consequence of a bequest, made by a relative, to enable him
to devote his life to study and research, unhampered by pecuniary
cares; and if this was so, he certainly carried out most faithfully his
part of the bargain.
    He was placed first at Shrewsbury School, and then at Eton, after
 which he went to Cambridge, being elected a Scholar of Trinity
 College in 1835.    Here he worked with zeal, bearing his speci<U+FB01>ed
 career in mind, and in 1837 he came out Sixth Wrangler and First
 of the Second Class in Classics.    He entered the Middle Temple as
 a student, and remained a member ; but he appears to have had no
 serious intention of following the legal profession, and he was never
 called to the Bar.
    The work of Mr. Ellis’s life, as exhibited in his multifarious and
 voluminous writings, has been so extensive that it is impossible
 here to do it full justice.    It must su<U+FB01>ice to indicate some of the
 principal subjects to which his attention was given.
    He <U+FB01>rst made himself known as a writer on Mathematics, having
                                                                   “ Geist
 published, in 1843, a translation of Professor Martin Ohm’s
 der Mathematischen     Analysis.”    He afterwards continued to write,
 from time to time, papers on mathematical subjects, mostly published
 in the ‘ Proceedings of the Royal Society.’ Many of these were of a
 somewhat abstruse character, as “ On the Laws of Operation and the
 Systemization    of Mathematics,” 1859; “ On Scalar and Clinant
 Algebraical Coordinate Geometry,” 1860, I86], and 1863; “On
 Stigmatics,” 1865 and 1866: while others were more practical, such
      “ Problems in
 as                  Hypsometry,” 1865, and “On the calculation of
 Logarithms,” 1881.     He also published, in 1874-, a separate work con
 sisting of <U+FB01>ve consecutive essays, and entitled"‘Algebra identi<U+FB01>ed
 with Geometry."
    voL. xmx.                                                     b

                                            ii
   The chief snbject, however, of Mr. Ellis’s labours was a branch of
                                     “ Phonetics,” or the science of
philology which he called                                               pronuncia
tion.    A few years after leaving Cambridge, he associated himself
with Mr. Isaac Pitman in arranging a system of printing called
phonotypy, which, by the aid of several new letters added to the
Roman alphabet, gave the means of accurately representing the various
sounds used in spoken language.              In 1844-, he published a description
of this in a little work called         “ Phonetics ; a familiar System of the
Principles of that Science ”; and this was followed by several other
works, pointing out the disadvantages of the ordinary orthography,
and advocating a general adoption of phonetic spelling.                  For many
years   he   laboured     industriously,   and  at  considerable   cost, to further
this  “               Reform,” and, as a means of                  his views more
         Spelling                                      exhibiting
completely,       he  undertook      the transformation,    into the new ortho
graphy, of many well known and standard works, such as the New
Testament, the ‘ Pilgrim’s Progress,’ some of Shakespeare’s plays,
‘Paradise Lost,’ ‘ Rasselas,’ and so on. He also brought out on the same
plan a monthly magazine called the ‘Phonetic Journal,’ and after
wards a weekly newspaper entitled the ‘ Phonetic News.’                  The latter
<U+FB01>rst appeared on the 6th January, 1849, and it ran for three months,
attracting much public attention from the strangeness of its typo
graphy, and the boldness of the aim embodied in its design.
    The object aimed at was, however, far too gigantic to have a chance
of success, and Mr. Ellis afterwards contented himself with using his
system as a means of enabling him to describe and discuss pro
nunciation with greater accuracy of detail than previously, par
ticularly as exempli<U+FB01>ed in the varieties of existing dialects. With
this view, he modi<U+FB01>ed it considerably in order to simplify the print
ing arrangements.           In 1886, he produced what he called “ Pa-laeotype,
or the Representation of Spoken Sounds by Ancient Types ”; and in
 1870, he laid before the Society of Arts an elaborate paper with a
 more popular educational aim, “ On a Practical Method of Meeting the
 Spelling Di<U+FB01>iculty in School and in Life.” In this he proposed, not,
 as before, to abolish the ordinary spelling, but to use concurrently
 with it a phonetic orthography formed only of ordinary types, which
               “ Glossic ”
 he called                  ; the objects were, as he put it :—
   Too  fasilitait lerning too reed.
   Too  maik lerning too spel unnescseri.
   Too  asimilait reeding and reiting too hearing and speeking.
   Too   make dhi riseevd proanunsiaishen ov Ingglish aksesibl too aul reeders,
 proavinshel and foren.
    Mr. Ellis was not long in <U+FB01>nding             a worthy use for the phonetic
 instrument which he had thus elaborated.                  In the course of his
 work upon it, he had occasion to look into the history of Englis

pronunciation, and he was so fascinated by the novelty and extent of
the subject that be determined to devote himself to its study; and
it occupied him, more or less. all the remainder of his life. It resulted
in a great work, of which the First Part appeared in 1869. It was
entitled: ‘ On Early English Pronunciation, with special reference to
Shakespeare and Chaucer, containing an Investigation of the Corre
spondence of Writing with Speech in England, from the Anglo-Saxon
Period to the existing Received and Dialectal Forms,’ &c., &c.
    This part was, in a few years, followed by three others, but
Part V required so much labour, that it was only <U+FB01>nished in
1889.    The whole work contains about 2500 pages, and was published
jointly by the Philological, the Chaucer, and the Early English Text
Societies.    The Public Orator at Cambridge, speaking of it in 1890,
                                                                  '
said, very appropriately :—
   “ It may be con<U+FB01>dently predicted that the day will come when all
 the  varieties of our dialects, like the ancient languages of the
 Arcadians and the Cyprians, will have entirely faded out of human
 cognizance   ;  and then most certainly there will daily accrue increas
 ing honour to the works which this author has elaborated with such
 in<U+FB01>nite labour.”
   Mr. Ellis was President of the Philological Society from 1872 to
 1874, and from 1880 to 1882, and he wrote many other works and
papers on this and other kindred matters.
   Another subject in which Mr. Ellis took great interest was the
scienti<U+FB01>c theory of music.         During his phonetic investigations, he
had   wished    to obtain an accurate  physical explanation of the produc
tion of vowel sounds, and, on the suggestion of Professor Max Miiller,
he referred for this to the work published in 1863 by Professor
Helmholtz, “Die Lehre von den Tonemp<U+FB01>ndungen.”                 In this, he
found much more than he had sought for. He had studied music
under Professor Donaldson, of Edinburgh (a physicist as well as a
musician), and had acquired a desire to investigate for himself the
physical basis of the musical art. He had found but poor satisfac
tion in the existing theoretical works, but the novel expositions of
Helmholtz solved all his dii<U+FB01>culties.
   The <U+FB01>rst results of his study were three papers presented to the
                            “ On the
Royal Society in 1864-,                Conditions, Extent, and Realization
of a Perfect     Musical  Scale on  Instruments   with Fixed Tones,” “ On
the Physical Constitution and Relations of Musical Chords,” and
“ On the Temperament of Musical Instruments with Fixed Tones.”
But he had so high an opinion of the importance of Helmholtz’s
work that he undertook the laborious task of translating it into
English, and the translation was published in 1875, under the title
of “ The Sensations of Tone as a Physiological Basis for the Theory
of Music.”

                                        iv
    Of Mr. Ellis, however, it may       be   said that  nihil tetigit  quad non
 ornavit, and, not content with translating excellently the 640 closely
 printed pages of the original, he ornamented it with a mass of
 elaborate theoretical matter of his own, amounting, in notes and
 appendices, to about 60 per cent. more.               A second edition was
 published  in  1885,  to  which  large  further  additions  were made.
    He wrote other essays on musical subjects, among which were two
 important ones on the much-debated subject of musical pitch, read
 before the Society of Arts in 1877 and 1880, and rewarded by silver
 medals. The last paper he presented to the Royal Society, the end
                                                                        “ On the
 of 1884, was a joint one by himself and Mr. A. J. Hipkins,
 Musical Scales of Various Nations,” and this was followed, in March,
 I885, by a larger one on the same topic at the Society of Arts.              He
 further endeavoured        to  make  his  phonetic    knowledge      practically
 useful to the musical art by an excellent little work on Pronunciation
 for Singers.
    Mr. Ellis was elected into the Royal Society on the 2nd June,
 1864.    He had previously made several communications to the
 Society, and he was afterwards a frequent contributor to its Proceed
 ings.   He served on the Council from 1880 to 1882.
    He was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1870, and
 in June, 1890, he was presented by the University of Cambridge
 with the honorary degree of Doctor of Letters.
    It must be added that Mr. Ellis was highly esteemed by all who
 knew him or had transactions with him, for his amiability of
 character and his zealous, sincere, and unsel<U+FB01>sh devotion to the
 spread of knowledge.          But few men have possessed his depth of
 acquirements, or his power of application, and still fewer have used
 them so well.
    About six years ago, he issued a circular to his friends, intimating
 that the few years of his life he could reckon on would be fully
 occupied by the completion of his great work, and requesting them to
 disturb him as little as possible till it was done. The concluding
 volume appeared, as has been said, in 1889; and he immediately
 afterwards wrote an abridgement of it, which was published sepa
 rately in 1890.    He had had, however, a severe shock in the death of
 his wife;  his  health   began to give way, and he died on the 28th of
 October, 1890.
                                                                         W. P.
    Professor JOHN MARSHALL, F.R.C.S., died on the morning of the
 1st of January, 1891, at his residence, “Bellevue,” Cheyne Walk,
 Chelsea, to which he had removed in the preceding summer from the
 house in Savile Row where he had spent the greater part of his
 professional life. He had for some years been in failing health,

suffering from winter cough and occasional attacks of gout.         These
conditions doubtless predisposed him to the acute attack of bronchitis
which proved fatal after an illness of a few days’ duration.
   Professor Marshall was in his 73rd year at the time of his death,
having been born on the llth September, 1818, at Ely, where his
father practised as a. solicitor. After having received his education
at a. private school, John Marshall was apprenticed to a surgeon at
Wisbeach, and in 1839 began his medical studies at University Col
lrge and Hospital, then the largest and most popular school in
England. Here he speedily attracted the favourable notice of his
teachers—-more particularly of Mr. Quain and of Dr. Sharpey.          His
acquaintance   with Dr.  Sharpey speedily ripened  into a close intimacy
and a warm friendship which continued unbroken till his death.
   Mr. Marshall became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons
in 1844.    He now established himself as a practitioner in Camden
Town, was appointed Assistant Demonstrator of Anatomy in
 University College, and subsequently made Curator of the Ana
tomical Museum.       In 1848 he was appointed Assistant-Surgeon to
the hospital, and in 1849 became a Fellow of the Royal College of
 Surgeons. For many years he taught practical and operative surgery
at University College; but it was not until 1866 that he was ap
 pointed full Surgeon with charge of in-patients to the hospital.     This
important step was gained on Mr. Quain's retirement from the
hospital, and in the same year, on Mr. Erichsen being transferred
from the post of Professor of Surgery in the college to that of
 Holme Professor of Clinical Surgery in the hospital, Mr. Marshall
succeeded him in the college professorship.       Mr. Marshall held this
 appointment till 1885, when failing health and the pressure of other
work compelled him to resign his o<U+FB02>ice, both in the college and hos
pital. In recognition of his lengthened and distinguished services
in these institutions, he was appointed Emeritus Professor of Surgery
in the college, and Consulting Surgeon to the hospital.
   Onerous and important as weie his duties in University College
and Hospital, these institutions were by no means the only scenes of
Mr. Marshall’s professional activity. For four years he was the
Fullerian Professor of Physiology at the Royal Institution.       He was
early in life appointed Lecturer on Anatomy as applied to Art, <U+FB01>rst
at Marlborough House, and then at the Government School of Art at
 South Kensington; and on the death of Mr. Partridge he was ap
pointed to the honourable post of Professor of Anatomy at the Royal
Academy.     In 1873 he was elected a member of the Council of the
Royal College of Surgeons, and in 1883 he became the President of
that college.   He was elected President of the Royal Medical and
Chirurgical Society in 1883, and in 1887 became President of the
General Medical Council—an o<U+FB02>ice that he held at the time of his

                                      vi
death.     During the latter years of his life Mr. Marshall took an
active interest in the establishment of a teaching university for
London, and was chairman of the association established for the
promotion of that object. Mr. Marshall was strongly in favour of
the establishment of a. new teaching university for the metropolis,
and of leaving the present University of London to discharge its
duties as an Imperial examining body untrammelled            by teaching
functions.
   Mr. Marshall was elected a Fellow of this Society in 1857. He
twice served on its Council, viz., from 1868 to 1870, and again in
1880-81.       He has contributed two papers to the ‘ Philosophical
Transactions.’     The <U+FB01>rst of these (1849), published in 1850 (‘ Phil.
Trans.,’ pp. 135—-170), was “ On the Development of the Great An
terior Veins in Man and Mamlnalia, including an account of certain
Remnants of Foetal Structure found in the Adult; a Comparative
View of these Great Veins in dilferent Mammalia, and an Analysis of
their occasional Peculiarities in the Human Subject.” This paper,
which was the result of a laborious original research, formed a very
important addition to embryology and to our knowledge of the
morphology of the vascular system.         The second paper, published in
                                              “
18641(‘Phil.    Trans.,’  pp. 505—538),   was   On the Brain of a Bush
woman, and on the Brains of two Idiots of European Descent.”         This
paper was a most valuable contribution to our knowledge of the
 anatomy of the idiot brain.        In it Marshall mapped out the con
volutions, and in some measure may be said to have been a pioneer in
that <U+FB01>eld of research which has yielded such important results to
Ferrier, Horsley, and others of recent years.
    The bent of Professor Marshall’s mind was essentially and strongly
scienti<U+FB01>c.    Throughout his life he devoted much time, and paid close
attention, to the study and the teaching of anatomy and physiology.
As has already been stated, he was for a lengthened series of years
Lecturer on Art Anatomy at the Government Schools of Art at
Marlborough House and South Kensington; up to the time of his
death he held the Professorship of Anatomy at the Royal Academy of
Arts; and for four years he had been Fnllerian Professor of Physio
 logy at the Royal Institution.          As a lecturer he was clear and
precise;   his  hearers  felt  that he possessed a thorough mastery over
the subject on which he discoursed, and the enthusiasm with which
he treated his favourite studies could never fail to elicit a warm and
sympathetic response in his class.
   Marshall’s published works were chie<U+FB02>y on anatomy and physio
         “ The Human
logy.                      Body : its Structure and Functions” appeared
in 1860,     “Outlines of Physiology” in 1867, and “Anatomy for
Artists ” in 1878.       On surgery he wrote but little. His most im
 portant contributions to it were a paper in the ‘ Medico-Chirurgical.

                                          vii
 Transactions’ for 1851, on “The Employment of Electricity in
 Surgery,” and the Bradshaw Lecture delivered at the Royal College
 of Surgeons in 1883, on “Nerve-stretching,” and the Morton Lec
 ture, on “ Cancer.”
    Mr. Marshall took much interest              in hospital construction, and
                          “                    ”
strongly favoured the circular-ward system. Whatever may be the
merits or demerits of that system—a.nd on this point there is much
discrepancy of opinion, Marshall had the satisfaction of seeing it
introduced, mainly through his advocacy, into several hospitals in
this country.
    Few members of the medical               profession     can show so full at
record of public and official work          as could Professor Marshall, and
by none has such work been done              more thoroughly and more faith
fully than by him. Yet he has               been allowed to pass away with
services such as these unrecognised and himself unrewarded by any
public mark of dignity or of distinction.
                                                                        J. E. E.
    Holland has produced more, perhaps, than its share of men whose
names are likely to be held in lasting honour by mankind, and
 among them hardly one greater or nobler as a hero of science
than Fnnss Conssus DoNI>sRs.* In him rare gifts of nature were
 so happily blended, and turned to such good account for the
advantage     of his fellow men, as to make him an illustrious
example of how much may be accomplished for our race in those
 quiet paths of life in which he was well content to pass his days. He
 was, indeed, doubly fortunate, for, while he bore a conspicuous part
 in the extension of knowledge and its bene<U+FB01>cent applications, in <U+FB01>elds
 which he found already ripening for the discoveries with which his
-fame will be ever associated, he lived long enough to see the rich
results of his labours universally and gratefully acknowledged by his
 contemporaries.
    He was born the 27th May, 1818, at Tilburg, a manufacturing town
 of North Brabant, in the Kingdom of the Netherlands, in a com
munity almost exclusively Roman Catholic. His father was a simple
 burgher, kindly and studious, who, though he seems to have left
the cares of business very much to his more practical wife, while
he occupied himself apart with chemistry, music, and literature,
 was still 'full of active sympathy with the less studious life
around him. Eight daughters had been born to them, but, as
yet, no son, when the unexpected ful<U+FB01>lment of a long deferred
hope induced, it was thought, a congestion of the brain, under
which the poor father rather suddenly succumbed.                         The child
was tenderly reared by the mother and elder sisters, in narrow
 circumstances,    and was probably spoiled, for he became unruly,

                              the vicinity.     Here he rapidly acquired all that the humble master,
                              Mr. Panken, could impart, and showed such precocity, especially in
                              arithmetic, that the rustics would mount him on the table of the
                              village inn, and give him sums to solve for half-pence.       It was thus,
                              perhaps,    discovered   that he might be safely  entrusted with  the pay
                              ment of the weekly wages by an employer, who rewarded him by a
                              little pocket money. “ Imagine the little boy with the dark eyes peep
                              ing out of the black locks”-—the fond mother would say—“ sitting
                              behind the desk to give the coins to the big workmen !” He was also
                              made responsible for the steady going of the village clock.      They used
                              to call him    “ Master’s Frans.” In after years, when Donders, the great
                               Professor, was secretly requiting, by substantial bene<U+FB01>ts to a<U+FB01>zlicted
                              relatives, the love bestowed upon him in childhood, such tri<U+FB02>ing in
                              cidents as these were recalled and treasured up by loving hearts, and
                              they are, therefore, deemed not unworthy of a passing record here.
                                 As he grew to be eleven years old he became so useful in the school
                              that his mother was asked to allow him to remain there as a tutor for
                              two years more at a salary.        Thus early did the clever lad begin to
                              exercise that innate aptitude for teaching which he afterwards culti
                              rated to such perfection.        He was subsequently moved on to other
                              seminaries at Tilburg and Boxmeer, learned easily to converse in
                              Latin and French, and less <U+FB02>uently in Greek. English he acquireg_l,;-,_"”‘.;

                               after life. In music, too, he was an adept, taking the 2nd violin in
                              quartetts.
                                 His religious instruction he <U+FB01>rst received from a sister of charity
                              (béguine), who prepared the children for the priest’s teaching.     His
                              sister Therese seems to have been a remarkable woman.        He would     ~
                              relate of her that she was chosen abbess over a pauper establishment
                              by the bishop, although the youngest of the community, and there

                              haps, that his early reveries were of the priesthood; and some in

     lapse    of <U+FB01>fty years,                  impression made upon me here by the
     chemical lectures and experiments of Nicholas de Fremery. When,
     for the <U+FB01>rst time,       I  mastered the notion that all that exist-s, in its in
     <U+FB01>nite variety, is composed of a relatively small number of elements,
     which in certain proportions unite and reunite, it seemed to me as if,
     with the creation of the elements, the whole of nature had been given,
     and my imagination worked this out in its own way. Later on                          I
     became especially interested in Physiology, as taught by Schroeder
     van der Kolk.”
         The term prescribed for admission to his examination for his
     degree at Utrecht not having yet arrived, he anticipated it by at once
     proceeding to Leyden, where his unusual pro<U+FB01>ciency in Latin and
     his many accomplishments secured for him a brilliant reception from
     the academical body.‘             Thus accredited, he went immediately to
     Flushing as a military surgeon and health officer, and shortly after
     wards was promoted to headquarters at the Hague.                   Here he worked
     intensely in the hospital wards, made autopsies, contributed papers
     to the medical journals, and was favourably noticed by the Director
     General; who, being about to reorganise the Military Medical School
     at Utrecht, <U+FB02>atteringly invited him, then only in his twenty-fourth
7:
     year, to give the courses on Anatomy, Histology, and Physiology.
   '\ his was no light enterprise, for it included 18 lectures in the week
         r the 46 weeks which made up the scholastic year; but he under
     took it joyfully, “feeling teaching to be his true vocation.”                   Thus
     he came back already distinguished to his own University city, his
     home from that time onward.               There he was soon to become famous.
          G. J. Mulder, then recently appointed Professor of Chemistry in the
      University, was already powerfully contributing to give form to the
     new science of Physiological Chemistry, and his genius at once at
     tracted and was attracted by that of Donders.               The two soon became
     close friends and fellow workers, Donders occupying himself in every
     spare moment with microscopical researches in connexion with the
     chemistry of the elementary tissues, and publishing many original
      papers.1'     With Jae. Moleschott also, then very young, he established
     a lasting friendship, as well as with Opzoomer and others who, in
      their several ways, became eminent.              In those days of opening man
      hood, Donders plunged eagerly and discursively into every avenue
     of spiritual and intellectual activity.               Men of science, lawyers,
     divines, were alike his intimates,              while, in general society, his
         * His inaugural dissertation, based on original researches, was entitled “ Dis

“ Donders was then,” writes Moleschott with fervid
                                                                   admiration, “ a
swelling rose-bud, whose calix leaves signi<U+FB01>ed nothing but pure
science, the <U+FB02>ower leaves hidden glory.           In one word, he was a man
complete—perfect        for his time of life.” His bright intelligence,
indeed, was able to assimilate without apparent e<U+FB01>ort all that it saw
and read of in the active world around-—a world then agitated by novel
 questions, of absorbing interest, regarding the Constitution of the
Universe and the true import of Man's place and being in it.
    In those days very recent advances in the methods and aims of
exact research, as applied to various branches of science, had made it
possible to penetrate more deeply than ever before into many of the
profounder mysteries of nature, and some grand enlightenment
seemed near at hand.          During the years following 1840, one concep
tion in particular, that of the Conservation of Energy in Nature, long
foreshadowed, was rapidly assuming de<U+FB01>nite shape under the ordeal of
exact experiment pursued on many converging lines. It could hardly,
however, have been said to have become yet established, even in the
minds of the most advanced physicists, ere Donders had clearly
recognised its far-reaching importance in its special application to
the Science of Life, the foundations of which his keen gaze was then
freshly exploring.      In the winter of 1844, when but twenty-six, in
“only    a  lecture, not    pretending,” he modestly says, “to any high
scienti<U+FB01>c worth,” he casts a glance on the change of matter as the
source of animal heat.1'        Here we already <U+FB01>nd him embracing in his
view all nature,    and   looking con<U+FB01>dently to her most general and all
pervadiug laws for the explanation of the enigma of life. “Animal
                              ”
heat is chemical heat;          but the <U+FB01>nal and irreversible proof of this,
                        “
he shows in detail,        can only be given when science shall have proved
that the quantity of heat in the animal body answers absolutely to
the chemical change which takes place there,”

nature, all life on earth, rests on the change of the elements from
which it is formed, but side by side with this change of matter
stands a change of forces.         Both are inseparably bound up together.
As the change of matter is the condition without which no life exists,
so the change of forces is the condition without which no life gives
evidence of itself. An idea arises gradually in science, which <U+FB01>nds

at the Military School of Medicine, delivered in the Society of Sciences, Utrecht;
Van der Post, Feb. 1845. [In Dutch, never translated]

great and all-encompassing, fertile for the future development of
science, it is the Permanence of Forces.           No one molecule of matter
can be destroyed, but neither can a minimum of Energy.              Thus runs
the important hypothesis which may come to be the soul of natural
science.      The forces change and join, they appear under different
 forms, but no force is annihilated.          Determinate quantities of move
 ment, heat, light, electricity, magnetism, and nervous force respond
 to each other, and can pass from one into the other.” “There is
 therefore a sum of energy, just as much as there is a sum of matter;
 both are proportionate to each other, both remain always the same.”
    And Donders was hardly less prescient as he stood on the
 threshold of that other great achievement of our era, the doctrine of
 the Evolution of Organisms on our planet.               The knowledge of the
 elements and of the elemental forces, then rapidly extending, was
 being more and more applied to the elucidation of certain vital
 problems, on which the greatest minds had long speculated in vain.
  Standing as we now do in the fuller light of those crowning dis
 closures of the progression of living nature through past ages which
 we owe chie<U+FB02>y to the genius of Darwin and of Wallace, dealing with
 an opulence of new materials for thought, it is very interesting to
 notice how Donders, in that nascent period, regarded this momentous
 subject.     Already, in 1846,* he had brie<U+FB02>y contested the then all
 but universally accepted teleological notion of the origination of
 organic forms by separate creative interpositions, accounting it to be
 arbitrary and unscienti<U+FB01>c; and soon after, on being called to the
  Professoriate of the University, he deemed the topic “ weighty enough
  for a wider treatment, and because of its general bearing, well suited
 to an inaugural discourse.”1'           Herein, after passing in review the
 grander features of the material universe and of the earth, as then
 known, he strives to show that the harmony everywhere pervading
 living nature, then usually explained by the principle of design
 (conformity to an end), is simply a necessary result of the condi
 tions under which all organisms have come to be what they have
 been, or are. Though by no means denying the existence of a purpoe
 in the phenomena of nature, he insists that a doctrine of the purpose
 can never become science, and can indeed only tend to obstruct the
 progress of science by lulling to sleep the spirit of enquiry into the
 laws governing the phenomena.            These remain open to investigation
 in the <U+FB01>eld of life, just as in that of inanimate matter.
    It is remarkable how <U+FB01>rmly Donders here grasps the certainty
 that all life has been ever in process of being moulded into its
 speci<U+FB01>c forms by the continuous operation, through long ages, of laws

implanted in matter and the forces of matter; and that these laws
have gradually but necessarily at every stage been operative on the
plastic organisation, adapting it continuously to the new conditions
which it was ever encountering; in default of which adaptation and
renovation      of the disturbed harmony, the organisation itself could
not have survived.        The laws must be studied in thezphenomena;
and     he  particularly discusses and illustrates the operation of three
laws, which for shortness’ sake he calls those of habit, of exercise, Of
inheritance.      But it is not enough, he adds, to deduce the necessity
of the harmony from these laws; we must endeavour to fathom these
laws themselves more deeply.             The two former, those of habit and
of exercise, mutually interacting, continually tend towards a restora
tion of the harmony between the organism as a whole and its sur
roundings, and between the several component parts of the same
organism, as the harmony becomes by little and little disturbedin
 lapse of time by the intercurrence of altered conditions.                  The last
law, that of inheritance, carries over into the future the accumulated
modi<U+FB01>cations of the past, so far as they have survived in the latest
o<U+FB01>spring, thus preserving the continuity of life through successive
generations, but only by essential changes in its forms.                  “Already
some light dawns in science on the causes of the phenomena. we
referred to, the laws of habit and of exercise; and thus, ascending
from cause to cause, without ever losing ourselves in dreams about
the purpose, we approach, slowly it is true, but with <U+FB01>rm step, the
 ideal point of view, according to which all the phenomena of nature
 will be seen proceeding from the attributes of the elements and
 elementary forces.       And if once by an All-wise Omnipotence these
 elements and forces have been created for a predetermined purpose,
 andif the conditions of the whole future have been enshrined in
 their attributes, then also not a single drop of blood flows without
 purpose through our veins, but it is a purpose which lies outside the
 science of nature.”
     As Donders had originally approached physiology from the side of
 medicine, so now he had evidently come to meditate deeply on this
 great theme of the procession of organic forms down the tracts of
 time on independent grounds of his own, and rather as a physiologist
 than as a naturalist. As other matters were engrossing his attention,
  he did not pursue this one to further conclusions;              but he welcomed
  with delight the publication, in 1859, of Charles Darwin’s book, ‘The
  Origin of Species ;’ became, subsequently, the friend and correspond
 ent of its illustrious author; and visited him at Down. He also, some
 years later, undertook, at his request, more than one elaborate inves
 tigation,* designed to elucidate obscure questions relating chie<U+FB02>y to

his work, ‘On Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals,’
then under preparation.
     Almost casually, in one of his letters to Darwin (14th March, 1871),
thanking him for a copy of ‘The Descent of Man,’ Donders thus
summarises in our language his own views of 1847 : “I always took
a great interest in the question of the origin of organised beings.
Even in 1847 I wrote and published an essay (om-tic inauguralis) on
the subject ‘ Harmony of Animal Life, a Manifestation of Laws,’ con
taining, from the physiological point de cue, a further development of
the doctrine which had been indicated by Lamarck, although the
communications on this subject of Lamarck were as unknown to me
as almost to every one, in that period.              Fully excluding <U+FB01>nal causes
from scienti<U+FB01>cal research and theory,            I tried to show how the in<U+FB01>nite
 harmonical relations, on the one hand, between animals and sur
 rounding nature, on the other hand, between the diiferent parts and
 organs of every organism, are to be deduced from the laws of adapta
 tion by habitude and by exercise, and from the laws of transmission.
 I applied the same on the psychical actions. I admitted the gradual
 evolution of the highest orders of plants and animals from more
 simple forms of spontaneous origin, and the origin of different species
from the same source.              I indicated the changes which are obtained
by     arti<U+FB01>cial   selection,   found   the cause of continual progress in the
 circumstance that every not well adapted form necessarily is con
 demned to perish, but still was not aware of the in<U+FB02>uence of natural
 selection, your great and immortal discovery, the mighty factor,
 which alone allowed to give a full and special demonstration of the
 theory of descent. As            I  began to write,   I had not the intention to
 mention to you my little book, but, telling about my special interest
 in the subject,       I   rather involuntarily inclined to explain it. And
 now, although it is written in Dutch,             I  could not resist my wish to
 send you a copy, in the hope that you will benevolently accept it.

 interested in what you tell me about your views, published in 1848,
 and     I       I

    But to resume the tenour of Donders’ life. In 1847, that his ser
vices might the better be secured to his University, he was named
Professor Extraordinary, there being no vacancy among the ordinary
chairs; and such was the con<U+FB01>dence inspired by his character that
he was asked to select his own subjects for lecture.             He chose four,
viz., Forensic Medicine, Anthropology (especially for students in
theology and law), General Biology, Ophthalmology.               To this last he
had been drawn, not only by its own intrinsic charm, but from his
having, in the preceding year, in order to eke out his slender resources
(for he had now wife? and child), undertaken a Dutch translation of
the great German treatise of Ruete on that subject, and from having
thereupon thrown himself, as was his wont, heart and soul into what
ever lines of original research this work, as it proceeded, had sug
gested to him.        It is impossible here to particularise, but several of
these were among the more subtle problems lying on the borderland
of physiological optics, problems remaining to perplex even the most
observant practitioner, until by their solution the path is made clear
to all alike.      Suffice it that Donders in this way became more and
more attracted towards Ophthalmic Practice; for with readiness he
gave all the help in his power to the physicians and patients who
were eagerly approaching him, as they heard of his discoveries in the
physiology of vision.        And when it was proposed to him by some of
our passing countrymen that he should acquaint himself with English
methods of treatment, then much esteemed abroad, he came to London
in 1851, on the occasion of our <U+FB01>rst “Great Exhibition,” return
ing by way of Paris. Some of the incidents of this journey he himself
soon after placed on record,I and he always spoke of it as having had
a great in<U+FB02>uence in moulding his life. It was his <U+FB01>rst travel, and it
brought him, at least, one thing for which he had great reason to be
thankful—-the        personal friendship of Albrecht von Graefe, an asso
ciation soon to be fraught with splendid results for the expanding
science of Ophthalmology; for these two men, both of the <U+FB01>rst
capacity, laboured ever afterwards to advance it as brothers in
council, and alike fruitfully; freely communicating               their ideas to
each other, always in perfect harmony of aim.              While von Graefe, a
 stranger in London, was able to tell Donders of the European hos
pitals he had been visiting, and of the new clinical ideas he was

maturing, as well as of the construction in that year, by Helmholtz,
at Konigsberg, of a dioptric apparatus for rendering visible the
fundus of the eye, Donders, a stranger there too, could, on his side,
explain many discoveries of his own in the physiological <U+FB01>eld, and,
among other things, declare the true nature of the act of accommoda
tion, quite recently disclosed with certainty by his countryman
Cramer, under, it may be added, his own inspiration and in his own
laboratory.      It was somewhat later, though independently, that
Helmholtz arrived at the same conclusion.
   It is not wonderful that Donders, on his return to Utrecht, should
have already decided on adding to the abounding work ofihis four
fold lecturcsbip, including the theoretical side of Ophthalmology,
the onerous responsibility of its daily practice.               He had, in fact,
been gradually led to recognise more and more that this department
of the healing art, from the very nature of its subject-matter, a<U+FB01>ords
an ampler scope and a <U+FB01>rmer ground than any other for the applica
tion and exempli<U+FB01>cation of those scienti<U+FB01>c principles which must
eventually bear sway in all its departments, if vagueness and uncer
tainty are to disappear under the slow but certain advances of exact
knowledge.‘        But in addition he was then swayed by a special
impulse   hard   to  be resisted.  It had long been known that in animals
having a tapetum luc/Tclum the rays of light entering the eye through
the pppil are in part re<U+FB02>ected outwards by that shining surface along
the lines of entrance ; and in 1846 our countryman Cumming, too early
lost to us, had shown that in man also such a re<U+FB02>ex was in a certain way
demonstrable.       But, in 1851, Helmholtz discerned that it must surely
be possible, by an optical contrivance, to render visible the re<U+FB02>ecting
fundus itself by bringing these emergent rays to a focus upon the
retina of an observer; and, as just mentioned, such means he had
devised.      The Ophthalmoscope was thus given to mankind, a dis
covery   rather   than an -invention, as Helmholtz has himself remarked
—a revelation transforming ophthalmology, and of itself entitling
that great man to our ever grateful remembrance.                   In the words of
Donders,    “ the whole world spoke of it; every one wanted to see the
ophthalmoscope, which revived long-lost hope.”                  But Donders felt
that a sphere for its employment in Holland was still needed ; and his
fellow citizens, appealed to for this, and <U+FB01>red with some of his own
enthusiasm, provided him with a temporary hospital; a few years
later subscribing funds for a permanent one?                   “That result,” he
remarks, “ was obtained through the in<U+FB02>uence of the discovery of the
                                                                                “ In

   those days       (he proceeds) ‘‘—I may here tell what I have kept
   secret till now—I was invited by the medical faculty of Bonn to be
   the successor of Helmholtz [as professor of physiology].            It was the
   unanimous     wish of all the members of the faculty, including Helm
   holtz himself, then about to leave Bonn.          The offer might have been
  tempting.       With   a  gift of 40,000    <U+FB02>orins in my hand, for a purpose
  marked out by myself, it could not be thought of.             The Ophthalmic
  Hospital thus founded was to be an institution for patients, but also
  for investigation and research in Ophthalmology in its widest range,
  in connexion with the University, by which both science and practice
  might be advanced; and not only did our students share its ad
  vantages, but foreign fellow practitioners made their appearance to
  witness our proceedings and to participate in our enquiries.”
      These last had reference to a variety of problems presented in the
  course of the practical work which Donders now entered upon, but

  to admit in large measure of exact de<U+FB01>nition and correction.                  In
  1858, there appeared the <U+FB01>rst of a long series of essays, in which,
  during six years, he was able to propound a complete doctrine, com
  plete as it left his hands, both as to theory and practice, of the
  employment and prescription of corrective glasses, a subject never
  really mastered till then, and yet of the widest importance in every
  day life, for the young, the middle-aged, and the old of all classes,
  and for all future time.          His results, elaborated down to their
  minutest details, were then arranged and collected into a volume,
  which it was his wish to offer to the world <U+FB01>rst, in its entirety, in an
  English form, as a reminiscence perchance of the welcome he had
  experienced here in 1851.           This volume, as translated from the
 Dutch MS. by Dr. Moore, of Dublin, and revised by himself, was

 into several languages, and must remain the permanent classic, both
 as to theory and practice, on the topics embraced by it.            To attempt
 an analysis of it would be beyond the scope of the presentnotice. It
 constitutes the title on which. its author takes rank above all his
 contemporaries as the main founder of a very large province of
 modern Ophthalmology.

 were, stood alone among the achievements of Donders in those fertile

years.    He was also enriching Physiology in other directions, even
though well-nigh exhausting his strength in doing so: for he had
been also serving the University as Rector, an office which he re
linquished in 1853.! In conjunction with Dr. Bauduin he undertook
a Manual of Physiology, which, however, he could only carry as far
as the <U+FB01>rst volume, ‘Special Physiology’       (18-53)—for its time a
work of authority, and still the best record of contemporary teaching.
In 1857, he discovered that in each vowel sound the mouth is tuned
to a de<U+FB01>nite pitch, alike in men, women, and children using :1
-common speech, and differing only with di<U+FB01>erence of dialect ; this was
con<U+FB01>rmed by Helmholtz. Again, in 1865, Donders took the <U+FB01>rst step
in a new <U+FB01>eld of research, by determining the rapidity of perceptions
of Thought and of the Will. Others had arrived at the physiological
time, or that required for reacting by a movement on a nervous irri
tation.    But in the next succeeding years he carried these exquisite
investigations much further, analysing the time taken in simple, and
also in many and various complex, psychical processes, by a most
ingenious and re<U+FB01>ned method, which he explained in 1876, at one of
the Conferences at South Kensington in connexion with the Loan
 Collection of Scienti<U+FB01>c Apparatus.1'      Others of his physiological
                                                                   “ On
papers deserving special mention, among a great number, were :
the timbre of the Vowels,” “Muscular Work and Development of
Heat in relation to the necessary Elements of Food,” “ On the
Tongue-instruments in the Organs of the Voice and Speech,”
“In<U+FB02>uence of the Vagus Nerve on the Cardiac Movements,” “ On
Associations, congenital and acquired” (the latter are the result of
habit in the individual, the former represent habit in the species),
 “ The Chemical Phenomena of
                                 Respiration are a Process of Dissocia
tion;”——indeed, to the close of his life he remained indefatigable in
the domain of Physiology, almost continuously winning new laurels
in one or other of its departments.
   In 1862 an event had occurred having an important in<U+FB02>uence in
this direction. By the death of Schroeder van der Kolk the chair of
Physiology fell vacant, and it was immediately pressed upon his
acceptance,   with the understanding that a new Physiological
Laboratory should be erected for his use. This was an appeal he
could not withstand, though aware that it would involve a partial,
and, gradually, an almost complete, relinquishment of his ophthalmic
practice.   But Physiology in its widest range, with the ample <U+FB01>eld
it presented for Research, had been his <U+FB01>rst love, and to this his
inclination now gradually led him back. His esteemed pupil, Snellen,
became his colleague at the Hospital, and eventually succeeded him
there; while Thomas W. Engelmann, who was to be in course of

time his much loved son-in-law, became his assistant in the Labora
tory, and <U+FB01>nally, his eminent successor. Donders continued in these
new circumstances to display the sam-e marvellous productiveness as
heretofore, and to animate, by his in<U+FB02>uence and example, the younger
men attracted to him, often from distant countries.                He delighted, as
 he had ever done, to make them taste the joy of becoming themselves
the authors of some original work of value, and to engage their
interest and help in his own laborious and systematic inquiries into
whatever promised to bene<U+FB01>t mankind in the sphere of the sciences‘
he was cultivating.
    No better example of this generous ardour of pursuit could be
 adduced than his method of dealing with the subjects of the Colour
 Sense and of Colour Blindness, then more and more attracting atten
tion in relation to the public safety. It exhibits very aptly his many
 sided excellence.        While acquainting himself with the ideas of his
predecessors, he <U+FB01>rst statistically ascertained, with accuracy for him
self, the broader facts, engaging for this the aid of his younger
colleagues and pupils. The delicate instruments which he was from
time to time contriving in the course of his researches bearing on the
theory of the Colour Sense and its defects, as on other subjeotsfl‘
 were constructed in a special department of his laboratory by the
 mechanician Kagenaar, whom he had reared from a youth and made
his friend. His theoretical conclusions, as they were reached, were
published in papers of permanent valuesl"                 Meanwhile he was also
calling    the  attention of the higher o<U+FB02>icials of the railway and sea
services, of his own and other countries, by all the means within his
power, to the responsibilities they lay under for the lives of the com
munity, in the matter of Colour Blindness; was framing rules for
their acceptance, which they might suitably enforce; and pressing his
 conclusions to their <U+FB01>nal consequences in practical life, with such
directness, moderation, and good sense, as compelled the attention
and assent of administrators and statesmen.                And that he might not
fail in his immediate object of effecting a present bene<U+FB01>t, he further,
for many years personally undertook, without remuneration, the very
considerable labour of superintending the carrying out of this matter
on the railways of Holland, examining scrupulously into the more
doubtful instances of supposed defect, so as to prevent injustice to
individuals, and in every way facilitating the adoption of the new
rules which he had suggested.                No Wonder that his countrymen,.

even the humblest, followed him with grateful recognition when         he
appeared at the stations or moved among them.
   Indeed, his      life was one of    incessant labour and benevolent
endeavour to turn to useful ends each new insight into nature which
he and others were acquiring.         Sympathising with all, seeming to
understand the sentiments and interests of all, he was generous
as   well  as   just in his judgment of others, yet ever courageous
and <U+FB01>rm in the as<U+FB02>ertion of whatever be deemed to be right and
true.    Indefatigable in the pursuit of truth, be was as able in
imparting it. Eloquence, the graces of style, and the mastery of
several languages combined to make him a great teacher.         Even in
his youth he had become conscious that to teach was to learn, and
that to learn was the purest of intellectual enjoyments.
   “ I was
            already in correspondence with Donders," says von Helm
holtz, in a letter to the present writer, “ before 1856, when    I  lived
in Konigsberg. He had sent me his physiological treatise on Animal
Heat and his handbook on Physiology, and as I had then made the
<U+FB01>rst experiments on the change of form of the crystalline lens in
accommodation, he told me about the somewhat earlier experiments
made by Cramer in his laboratory. As far as         I know, I <U+FB01>rst made
his personal acquaintance during my stay at Bonn, between 1856 and
1859. He used to go in summer, with his then already ailing wife,
to Cleve, to breathe purer air in that hilly country, as was then the
fashion in Holland. From thence he came over to Bonn.             I  have
also paid him a visit of a few days, in Utrecht, at that time, and lived
in his house. . . . The loveablcness, openness, and honesty of his
character you know—I need not portray them to you.        We have then
and afterwards discoursed very much on scienti<U+FB01>c questions, as we
many times and independently had taken the same problems in hand.
He had, in Ophthalmology, the greater experience of patients, and I
have learnt much from him in that respect; but even where it seemed
to me that    I  must maintain my own opinion, I never observed in him
the least sign of sensitiveness, or of too great warmth in defending
his position.     In his way of talking he had then already, as a young
 man, something of stateliness; he loved choice expressions, remind
 ing one somewhat of the antique eloquence of the French Academy.
 But he was never prolix, indeed, rather concentrated, in his conversa
tion, and   I  have always loved to listen to him, though in Germany
 we are very little accustomed to attend much to the artistic oratorical
element in speaking.         He was clearly a warm-hearted man with
great   ideal   views, and he thought it his duty to give utterance to
these ideal views before the world, and to show them in their height
and signi<U+FB01>cance.         Moreover, he was aware of his capacity of im
pressing this with great force upon his auditory.      Very beautiful in
 this respect was his last speech in handing over the Graefe Medal at

                                         XX
Heidelberg.”*       .  .    .  “Our friendship has remained unclquded to
the last.”
   Donders     took, from time to time, a very conspicuous part in the
assemblies and congresses of Science.             Here he shone as a star of the
<U+FB01>rst lustre.     By universal consent he was a most admirable President,
particularly where men of many nationalities were met together; for
his wide and accurate knowledge and accomplishments, his tact, the
grandeur of his simple earnestness, and his magni<U+FB01>cent personal
bearing acted as a spell on all.         If the occasion seemed to demand it
he would give an address, sentence by sentence, in two or more
languages, with perfect mastery.            He presided over the fourth Inter.
national Congress of Ophthalmologists in London, 1872, and again,
for the last time, over the seventh meeting of the same at Heidelberg,
in 1888; over the sixth International Medical Congress, at Amster
dam, 1879 ; and he was Vice-President, as well as Royal Medallist, of
the seventh International Medical Congress in London, 1881.                     In his
own country, from 1865 onwards, he annually presided over the
Physical Section of the Royal Academy of Sciences, and (alternately
with the President of the Literary Section), was President in plane.
   But in 1883 he expressed the wish to withdraw from some of the
more arduous of his many engagements.                He was soon, alas ! to cease
from the service of the University for which he had done so much
By the law of the Netherlands a Professor must retire at seventy.
He was approaching that age, apparently in full vigour, though
indications of gouty congestions had more than once occasioned some
idisquietude to his friends.         His Jubilee was celebrated at Utrecht,
on the 27th and 28th May, 1888, amid the universal applause of his
countrymen and of men of science everywhere.                    He was decorated
by   the  King,  and  in   his honour   a  commemorative        medal   was struck.
Forty of his former pupils communicated each an original scienti<U+FB01>c
paper to a memorial Festival volume, published by a committee.1' The
Royal Society of London, which had elected him a Foreign Member
in 1866, asked three of its Fellows, Sir Joseph Lister, Mr. Jonathan
Hutchinson, and Dr. Hughlings Jackson, to convey to him its con
gratulations; our Physiological and Ophthalmological Societies also
sent deputations.        Indeed, hardly one civilised country but was in
some way represented.          A  large sum had been subscribed, and was
placed at his disposal.           He assigned it to the establishment of
Travelling Fellowships         in   Physiology and Ophthalmology, to be
attached to the Universities of the Netherlands, with Utrecht as
a centre; not without          a glance, perchance, at an early incident
in his own fortunate career. That career he now passed in review

before   his  assembled friends and    pupils in a speech of touching
simplicity and eloquence—a lasting and truthful survey of the
lifework he had been enabled to accomplish.          “I  may be thank
ful,” he concluded, “for the life granted me.              I stand here
comparatively strong, and also ready to do what may be given
me to do.      I stand here, having reviewed my life, and having seen
how manifold were the advantages that have been allotted to me.
All this makes me grateful, fervently grateful, especially to the
Eternal Source of all that exists, of which it is not given to man—a
speck in the in<U+FB01>nite space, a breath in the in<U+FB01>nite time—-to form an
idea; he can do no more than bow reverently in absolute submission.
This submission has been asked of me more than once.         I  hope also
to <U+FB01>nd the strength to submit to what may be required of me in the
future.”
    Some sorrowful bereavements had indeed befallen him : in the loss,
in 1870, of his only child Marie, after giving birth to twins; and
more recently, in 1886, of the beloved and admirable partner of many
years, after a long and distressing illness, through which he had
nursed her with the tenderest assiduity. But he remained steadfast
and full of trust, and he had many compensations.         The retrospect
of his life was happy; his contemporaries loved and honoured him
as few men have been loved and honoured, recognising in him in a
rare degree the possession and harmonious, fruitful, and lifelong
exercise of some of the greatest and best attributes that can adorn
human nature.
    The last illness of Donders was sudden, as his father’s had been,
and in him, too, it was the circulation of the brain that failed. That
 powerful organ of sweetest feeling, high aspiration, and self-restrained
 will, which had enabled him to accomplish so much, even measuring
for us the velocity of thought, was now itself to give way.- He had
 come on a visit to England in October, 1888, and seemed to be
 supremely happy in the renewal of his domestic life. Most interest
 ing was it to listen to the themes he opened as to the work he might
 soon undertake in the studio of his re<U+FB01>ned home, tracing the springs
 of Art to their most secret source in the very constitution of man’s
 bodily organisation, subject in all respects to the conditions and
 limitations imposed by physiological laws. The operations of these
 laws he had long delighted to track out to their remotest conse
 quences, and to communicate his conclusions to masters in art of the
 quality of his friends Sir Fred. W. Burton and G. F. \Vatts. His
 studies had always inclined him in this direction, and he now hoped
 to execute a design he had long cherished, of illustrating his concep
 tions and views by reference to the life of Leonardo da Vinci, the
  great artist with a scienti<U+FB01>c turn of mind, to whose <U+FB01>gure he had
  ever felt himself especially attracted.  In such a <U+FB01>eld, had his days

                                        xxii
 been prolonged, it is probable that he would still have left behind
 him rich legacies of thought (for who so capable     in which rigidly
                                                          F),
 exact de<U+FB01>nitions  of  scienti<U+FB01>c truth would have been seen to be in
 truest harmony with the most exquisite sensibility to every form of
 beauty, natural or artistic.
    But the joy of anticipation was    perilous joy, and could not be
                                          a
 long supported.       Pathetic were the circumstances of the last fatal
 seizure,  for in  the  intervals of illness he knew and weighed as in a
 balance of the laboratory all its phases, with unimpassioned serenity
 and resignation, though not without sadness, while witnessing the
 grief of those who loved him, and recalling the scenes in which he
 had acted so conspicuous a part.        He rallied sufficiently to be able to
 return   home    under   the  escort of his brother-in-law, who had been
 summoned to his bedside in England.             But relapses recurred, with
 varying   alternations    and  pauses.  During   these weeks of suspense, so
 agonizing to his friends, he often spoke of the insoluble riddle of exist
 ence, and of the hope of a future reunion.     One afternoon he had walked
 with assistance in front of his house (it was his last walk), and he
 seemed refreshed.       “We have had a nice walk, and you are better,”
 said one.
             "‘ Yes,” he replied, “ a beautiful walk—is        not
                                                               it   abeautiful
 walk ?—t0 Eternity!” He died on the 24th March, 1889, within a
 year of his jubilee.
    The day of his burial was indeed one of gloom in Utrecht.
    The second wife of Donders was Bramine, daughter of Mr. P. F.
 Hubrecht, Secretary of the Home Office at the Hague, sister of Pro
fessor Hubrecht, of Utrecht, a lady of noble disposition and of wide
culture.   We owe to her remarkable talent several <U+FB01>ne portraits of
 him, for one of which, a three-quarter length, painted for his jubilee,
 she received the award of a gold medal at Munich in 1888.          It      is
destined for the National Museum at Amsterdam.       Others are,   half a
 length, with his decorations, in the Hall of the Professors at the
University; one at the Ophthalmic Hospital, representing him as in
1864, soon after the foundation of the hospital; and a fourth, as
seated in his study, with the bust of von Helmholtz at his side, in
the last year of his life, painted for his twin grandchildren, Frans
and Paula Engelmann.       There are also two life-size heads by Mr.
Watts, R.A., painted in 1873-75, during some of his brief visits to
England. One of these, never completed, but remaining a grand
sketch, forms one of Mr. Fred. Hollyer’s series of Mr. Watts’s por
traits, and has been reproduced                       to the present

     JOHN CASEY was born at Kilkenny, co. Cork, in May, 1820, and
  died 3rd..January,.~.1891, -in “Dublin. He was educated at <U+FB01>rst in a
  small school in his native village, and afterwards in a larger school in
 Mitchelstowm.       He became a teacher under the Board of National
  Education -in various schools, including Tipperary National School,
  and ultimately Head Master of the Central Model Schools, Kilkenny.
  He thembegan to devote ‘himself to mathematics.             Being asked to
  solve   “Poncelet’s     Theorem,”  he  solved  it  geometrically, having, in
  doing so, discovered for himself much of the science of modern
  geometry.      In connexion with this he began a lifelong correspond
  ence with Dr. Salmon and the late Professor Townsend, at whose
  suggestion he entered Trinity College, Dublin, in 1858, and obtained
  Sizarship in 1859, and Scholarship in 1861, and his B.A. degree in
  1862.
      From   1862   to 1873 he was Mathematical Master in Kingstown
  School, which during that time obtained a reputation for training
  successfully for the Indian Civil Service Examinations. From 1873 to
  1881 he was Professor of Higher Mathematics              and Mathematical
   Physics in the Catholic University, and from 1881 until his death was
   a Fellow of the Royal University, and Lecturer in Mathematics in
   University College, Stephen’s Green. In 1866 he was elected a member
   of the Royal Irish Academy, and a member of its Council in 1872, and
   was aVice-President thereof for <U+FB01>ve years. In 1869 the University of
   Dublin conferred on him the degree of LL.D. Hon. Cans. He was

                                   XXV
elected a member of the London Mathematical Society in. 1874-, and a
Fellow of the Royal Society in 1875, member of the Sc. Soc. of
Brussels in 1878, Corr. Memb. of the R. Soc. of Sciences of Liége in
1887, member of the S00. Math. de France, 1884, and LL.D. Hon.
Cans.   R.U.l. in 1885.    In 1873 Trinity_ College, Dubliu,.o<U+FB01>‘ered him
a Professorship of Mathematics, but h'o~relirctantly preferred to
further the advancement of Catholic education by working for the
Catholic University.     In 1878 hewas a Secretary of Section A of the
British Association meeting in Dublin, and in the same year the RI.
Academy conferred on him a Cunningham Gold Medal.
   In 1881 he commenced a series of mathematical class books for
University and college students, which have acquired a deservedly
high reputation, and some of which have been translated.        From 1862
to 1868 he was one of the editors of the ‘Oxford, Cambridge, and
Dublin Messenger of Mathematics,’ and for several years was Dublin
correspondent for the ‘Jahrbuch iiber die Fortschritte der Mathe
matik.’ The Norwegian Government presented him, in 1881, with
the works of Abel. He carried on an extensive correspondence with
most of the leading European mathematicians,           all_.of whom held
Casey’s work in high esteem.
    His work was almost wholly con<U+FB01>ned to plane geometry, in which
 his papers have earned for him an -established reputation. . Professor
 Cremona has well described them as exhibiting the great elegance
and ability with which he treated the most difficult and interesting
questions.    John Casey will ever be remembered as one of the very
small band of eminent mathematicians who, self-taught, raised
themselves from the grade of elementary teacher to University
 Professor.
    In the Royal Society’s Catalogue of Scienti<U+FB01>c Papers (1800—1883)
there are eighteen titles under Professor Casey‘s name, their dates
 ranging from 1861 to 1880.
