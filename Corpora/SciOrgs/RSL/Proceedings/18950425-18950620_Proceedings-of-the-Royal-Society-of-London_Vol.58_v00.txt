                     A.  Object and Method       of the Research.
    1.  Introduction. — This piece of work was undertaken at the sugges
tion of Professor V. Horsley, who devised the apparatus employed,
                  I
and to whom am indebted for advice and suggestions.
    In view of the great frequency of compression of the brain as a
pathological condition, it seems very advisable to attempt to obtain
knowledge of some of the elementary factors conditioning the physical
 changes in the brain substance dne to mechanical pressure.
    The general plan adopted was (a) to compress the living brain (t.e.,
the brain substance plus lymph and circulating blood) by a given
weight for a given time, to measure the amount of direct compression,
and, after removal of the pressure, to measure the elastic recoil ;
(6) to investigate the influence upon the recoil of varying conditions
of the vascular and respiratory systems.
    Finding in an early stage of the investigation that the elasticity of
the brain is very far from being perfect,            I was further led to investi
gate the conditions, vascular, &c, which favoured more complete
recovery of the brain surface to its normal level, especially after
periods of prolonged compression.
    The following, therefore, are records of an investigation                  of the

Association on the recommendation of the Scientific Grants Committee of the
Association.

2          Mr. A. G. Levy.            On the Elasticity  of the Living
physical properties of the brain substance, and deductions drawn
from my observations must not be immediately applied to explain the
changes in the brain seen in cases of meningeal haemorrhage, tumours,
&c, because, in order to ascertain the fundamental facts, the experi
ments in the present case have of necessity been made with the
cranial cavity open, the dura mater partially reflected, and a certain
quantity of the cerebro-spinal fluid consequently drained away. In
pathological conditions the pressure is exerted in a closed, fluid-con
taining cavity, and hence any local compression must evoke a reac
 tion from all parts of the cerebral environments, and all parts of the
 intracranial contents are at an equally exaggerated pressure. In my
 experiments, the cranial cavity being opened, the influence of the
cranial walls is limited, and the pressure is directly exerted upon, and
principally confined to, the part of the surface compressed and the
mass below     it.
    I may mention that        I  started with the generally accepted premise
that the elasticity of the brain is more or less proportional to the
central blood pressure, and many of my earlier experiments were per
formed with the object of testing what at first sight seems an exceed
ingly reasonable view.
    2. Historical Introduction. —       I  have throughout my experiments
taken as an indisputable fact what was demonstrated by Grashey,*
viz., that the cerebral tissue itself is practically incompressible (in
fact, its coefficient of compressibility being rather less than that of
water), and that any reduction in volume of the living brain must
therefore be due to the squeezing out from its blood vessels, lympha
tics, and ventricles, of blood, lymph, and cerebro-spinal fluid.
    Grashey's experiments consisted of a careful estimation of the com
pressibility of the dead brain by hydraulic pressure in a delicate
piezometer. His experiments conclusively showed what had indeed
 been the general teaching, but he was led to make this demonstration
by reason of the extraordinary assertion of Adamkiewiczf that the
 brain tissue itself bears the brunt of the diminution of the intracranial
 space.
    The records on compression of the brain substance are numerous,
 and the methods employed by the investigators (Cooper, Duret,
 Kahler, Pick, Leyden, Adamkiewicz, Spencer and Horsley, Dean,
 Hill, &c.) are very various ; but these experiments have been arranged
 from the clinical point of view, i.e., the effect of compression upon
 the functional activity of the nerve centres.
     Some observers have noted the structural changes produced ; thus,

         Brain and     the  Conditions   of Recovery after Compression.       3
 Adamkiewicz investigated the structures microscopically, and Dean*
 by quantitative analysis, with special reference to cedema.
    I  can find, however, no systematic investigation into the immediate
 recovery of the brain after compression.           Dean, in the course of his
 experiments, gavo attention to the recovery after the compression by
 plass discs, but his observations were made by the unaided eye.
  Further, the majority of his experiments, in which the brain was
 examined several days after compression was removed, when secondary
 changes had taken place, fall into another category than those which
 I  have carried out, for in no case were my observations prolonged for
 more than an hour after compression, and usually the period was
 much shorter.        Moreover, contrary to the methods adopted by the
 just named observers, the influence of the cerebro-spinal fluid in the
 present research was excluded ; the dura mater being opened, the
 fluid is released from all tension, and some of it escapes during the
 procedure described below, my object being to investigate the change
 in the brain mass alone.
    3. Description of the Apparatus for Measuring the Compression and
 Recovery                — An apparatus      was desigued for the purpose of
             therefrom.
 applying known weights vertically to the brain surface, so that the
 amount of depression of the surface could be accurately measured,
 and also the recoil after the removal of the weight.
     This apparatus is shown in front and back view in figs. 1 and 2.
  It consists essentially of two supports for screwing into the skull, a
 plunger through the medium of which to apply the weights, and a
 dial to indicate the excursion of the plunger.
     To consider the parts in detail : the supporting pillars consist of
 three portions, see fig. 1 (a, b, and c). The foot (a) screws into the
 hone, and (6) is a cap which screws on to it. The two when fitted
 together form a socket to receive the globular end of (c) the pillar,
 which thus acts in a ball-and-socket joint, and can be firmly fixed in
any position by screwing down (6).            By this means the pillar may be
 made to    assume     a   perpmdicular position when the screw has to be
inserted into a portion of the skull which is not horizontal.
    The pillars support the dial through the medium of the slots (d, d),
and are fixed by screws (e, e), the slots themselves being firmly fixed
in position by the thumb screws             (/,/).  These slots allow, among
other movements, of lateral shifting of the dial.         These arrangements
conveniently give great range          of movement    of the dial, so that the
plunger may be placed into a position of accurate perpendicularity.
    The plunger consists of a straight rod, carrying above a weight
pan (j), and, passing through the body of the dial, it has attached to
it by a special arrangement a thread which, looping round the axis

of the dial, rotates this in its excursions up and down. An index
hand attached to the axis indicates tenths of millimetres on the
 dial.
    Below, the plunger has screw arrangements (h), by which discs
 (i) of varying     sizes  can be applied.   In all experiments   a disc of
 1  cm. diameter was used     unless otherwise   mentioned, and it was by
 the screw attachment correctly adjusted to the surface of the brain.
 The weight of the plunger was accurately counterbalanced by a
 weight which acts over a pulley (j), so that the disc remains at rest
 in any position, e.g., on the brain surface, without exerting any
 pressure when there is no weight in the pan.
     This suspended     counterbalancing   weight also acted as a plumb
 line by which the perpendicularity of the plunger was secured, this
 position being essential to avoid all friction.         The figures show
 the apparatus applied to a horizontal surface.
     4. Method of Experiment. — The animal, invariably a dog, was kept
 under ether through the medium of a glass cannula, inserted into the
 trachea and attached by india-rubber tubing to a funnel, this latter
 being plnci-d over cotton-wool saturated with ether.         The narcosis
 must be maintained equably throughout the experiment, to avoid
 irregularity in respiratory movements. The head was firmly sup

       Brain and   the Conditions   of Recovery after Compression.        5
ported in the usual holder. The skull was exposed on one side, and the
median and fronto-temporal ridges chiselled away as far as necessary,
so as to give a flat surface for inserting the screws.     The skull was
trephined close to, but carefully avoiding, the longitudinal sinus.       I
found haemorrhage a very troublesome accident, and that it was
essential to stop it by means of wax and amadou before proceeding
with the experiment, as the presence of even a thin layer of blood on
the cortex marred the result. The object of applying the compression
 as near as possible to the middle line was to arrange the line of pressure
perpendicularly downwards, so as to avoid any elastic reaction from.
the falx cerebri ; this seemed to be more important in using large
weights, which evoke larger excursions.        I enlarged the opening in
the skull with bone forceps, so as to allow of easy insertion of
the plunger, and give sufficient margin to observe the condition of
the brain surface.     The next step was to reflect the dura mater, insert
the screws (using a guarded bradawl to make preliminary holes), and
 then to erect the apparatus so that the disc of the plunger rested flat
on the surface of the brain, and the plunger itself was absolutely
perpendicular.
    The blood pressure was recorded by means of a mercurial mano
meter connected with the femoral artery.            The respirations were
traced by means of a Paul Bert receiver and a Marey recording
tambour.
    In performing   an experiment    I noted the moment of applying the
weight to the pan, and then recorded the figures the index pointed to
at intervals of so many seconds during and after compression, and
also read off the blood pressure at stated intervals.
    5. Considerations Affecting the Plan of Experiments. — A few remarks
on special conditions observed during my experiments may now be
briefly noted.
    (a.) Various conditions of the cranium and its contents, affecting
the apparent elasticity of the brain, and requiring attention, are
as follows : —
    Adhesions of the pia mater to the dura mater, as, for instance, by
vessels running from one to the other.
    The Falx Cerebri. — This is not large as a rule in the dog, often not
more than 5 or G mm. broad in a small dog, and is not likely to have
ranch influence, but large weights applied in a direction fairly per
pendicularly to its surface might reasonably be expected to be
limited in effect by its elasticity.
    The Tentorium. — This is generally almost totally ossified in dogs,
but in some dogs there exists sufficient membrane to prove a factor
in causing some elastic reaction from the base of the skull.
     The Shape of the Cranium.- — It seems probable that the vertical
 depth of the skull cavity should modify results somewhat, as with a

  (i          Mr. A. G. Levy.       On the Elasticity   of the Living
  deep     skull a greater depth of brain substance comes directly under
  compression than in the case of a flat skull, but this and the fore
  going conditions have but a subsidiary influence upon the effects
  observed, the main factor which influences the more immediate recoil
  of the brain surface, in experiments performed upon the organ in
  situ, being the rigidity of the bony floor it rests upon.
       (6.) Moulding.— After a compression of thirty seconds or so there
  frequently results a faint ringed impression of the disc — this usually
  disappearing in about half an hour.        After several experiments have
  been performed upon the same spot, a considerable saucer-like
  depression in some cases ensues.
       (c.) (Edema.
                     — On several occasions a curious phenomenon .was ob
  served, which most probably has its origin in local cedema.             It is
 more especially marked in experimenting with small weights, 20 to
  50 grams, applied for a couple of seconds only.           When the weight,
 after compression, has been removed, and the brain surface, in re
 covering, has ceased to push the disc up farther, then if the passively
 resting disc be removed from the surface, the latter will start a
 further rise almost immediately, so that in a few minutes it may even
 be at a higher level than that at which it stood when the ex
 periment was started. After more severe compression this is not
 observed.
      (d.) Powerful respiratory movements, as will be shown directly,
 are liable to vitiate results by aiding recovery after compression,
 through the medium of increased venous pressure.                   Hence the
 necessity already mentioned of maintaining a fairly deep narcosis.
      (e.) The direct effect of compression upon the blood pressure and
 respiration.
                                                                   I
     I found that the local compression by any weights that employed
 was, in view of the cranium being freely opened, insufficient to
 produce any effect, either upon the blood pressure or respiration,
 this being so far fortunate as then could be no indirect influence
from this cause upon the elasticity of the brain. The minimum
 weight which can affect respiration, even slightly, was 200 grams.
    B. Results of Compression Experiments       on the  uninjured Brain, the
                           Blood Pressure being normal.
     (a.) Definitions.    I                                       "

that no previous experiment has been performed on the same brain ;

brain) on a weight being applied.         Fig. 3  (a6).

 8           Mr. A. G. Levy.         On the Elasticity  of the Living
    i. Excursion. — The character of the excursion evoked by a compres
 sion of 50 grams for one minute is as follows : —
    Firstly, there is a rapid fall of the index in the first few seconds ;
this being followed by a very much more gradual compression
 (fig. 3). So that three-fourths of the whole excursion may take
place in the first two seconds.
    The absolute extent of the excursion varies in different dogs very
considerably (the time of compression being equal) ; thus the amount
in one minute varied in two separate cases from 4"5 mm. to 7-3 mm.
Variation in the absolute amount of depression of the brain surface is
to be expected where differently shaped heads were experimented
upon.
    There appeared to be some relation between the size of the dog and
the extent of the excursion, probably because there is in a large brain
a greater depth of collapsible mass beneath the plunger.              On the
other hand, it was very noticeable that the extent bears no relation
to the height of the blood pressure ; in fact, it is curious that often
the largest excursions accompanied a normally high blood pressure
(i.e., a well-filled, highly collapsible brain).
    Observations were also made with a very short time of compres
sion, such as of two seconds' duration.            Under these circumstances
the absolute excursion is notably less, viz., 2-4 to 3-5 mm.           I have
already mentioned the rapidity of the development of the first part of
such a curve.          The actual curve is shown in fig. 5.
    ii. Recoil.   —   The character of the recoil after one minute compres
sion    with    50  grams is well shown in fig. 3. As a rule it is nearly
completed in a few seconds, but develops further during one to two
minutes, and then usually stops.            After this point the process un
doubtedly continues          in many cases, but it is too gradual to record.
After half to three-quarters of an hour, the brain in most cases will
be found to have resumed its normal level.            The recoil was measured
at the point at which it became apparently stationary.
    For convenience of expression, to denote the relation of the recoil
to the compression,           I employ a fraction, the numerator of which
is the numerical value of the recoil expressed as unity, and the
denominator is the value of the excursion compared to the recoil-
Thus, where the excursion is twice the recoil the fraction = 1/2 ; and
to the ratio        I  apply the term
                                        "
                                          proportionate recoil." The smaller
the fraction the less the elasticity; the nearer it approaches unity the
mor9 perfect the elasticity.
    We are now in a position to see the degree to which the brain
recovers itself after a compression of 50 grams for one minute.           The
proportionate recoil is very constant, i.e., nearly 1/2, in many cases
almost exactly so, but varying within the extreme limits of l/l"8 to
1/2-3    {e.g.,  fig. 3 = 1/1-9,  fig. 4 = 1/1-8).

     If, however, the pressure    be kept up for only two to five seconds the
 recoil is more perfect. In fact, the immediate recoil which takes place
 in the first two or threo seconds may give a ratio of 1/2 or even 1/1*5 ;
 after au interval of thirty seconds or so it may be 1/1*4 or even
 nearly 1. E.g., Experiment 12a = 1/1*2 (fig. 5), Experiment 14a
  = 1/1*5 (immediate).

     If  the pressure be prolonged, say, for six minutes, the fraction be
 comes smaller, and      this is shown in fig. 6, where the ratio = l/2-74,
and the surface does not further recover after a long interval — more
than half an hour.
     Thus we see that although the elastic reaction of the brain is very
fair when the compression lasts only a few seconds, longer compres
sion affects the brain in such a fashion that it does not recover so
readily.
    Thus, also, we    see  that for the same weight and same length of
compression, the elasticity is very much the same in different brains ;
i.e., with a large excursion there is a proportionately large recoil, and
vice versa.
    iii. Results of Experiments with varying Weights. — A few experi
ments performed with a weight of 20 grams show a comparatively
small excursion, but the ratio is similar to that obtained with a
50 grams weight.        Weights such as 100 grams and over seem to be

  C. Consideration  of the Relation of the foregoing results to the Blood
                                  Pressure.
   We may first take in this connexion the experiments in the series
just described, and compare the reaction to the height of the blood
pressure, to test the influence of the latter as a possible factor in the
establishment of the recoil of the brain.
   (a.) Comparison of Experiments on the uninjured Brain in different
Dogs with individually different, but normal, Blood Pressures. — Below is
a table of experiments performed        on the normal brain in the course
of which the blood pressure was measured.
   It will be seen  that there is absolutely no relation to be found
between the individual

                                                     pressures.

    The most noticeable of these is Experiment 8a, in which, although
the pressure was comparatively very high, the reaction was almost at
its minimum.
    It is clear, then, that the recovery of the volume of the brain is not
 due to the pressure at which it is irrigated with blood.
    Though these facts appeared to be thoroughly demonstrative,                    I
 established a number of control observations to further test the
 question.
    The first method which           suggested itself was naturally that of
 lowering    the    blood  pressure very markedly by bleeding.          This pro
 cedure, however, of necessity involves the measurement of the recoil of
 the brain thus rendered anaemic being taken from a preparatifn which
 had already been compressed once ; this, of course, introduces an
 error, and hence the further question has to be considered how far
 does one compression experiment have an influence on a consecutive
 one.
     When compression has lasted for thirty seconds                 or more it is
 obviously necessary to allow a sufficient interval to elapse to allow the
 damaged brain fairly to recover — such an interval as half to three-
  quarters of an hour, sometimes more ; that is to say, I waited till the
  surface had regained its normal level. Sometimes it is impossible to
  wait for complete recovery, and, of course, in such a case an element
  of error is introduced ; but when the time of compression is short,
 ten miuutes is quite enough to allow so as to avoid any appreciable
  vitiation, of which fact I have satisfied myself experimentally.
     (b.) Comparison of Experiments performed on the same Brain before
  and after lowering the Blood Pressure by bleeding. — After an experi
  ment, conducted as above described at normal blood pressure,               I bled
  the animal from the carotid artery.
     As a rule, a large loss may occur without much fall of pressure,
  and the fall, when it does occur, takes place very suddenly.               If the
  splanclmics     be   previously    divided, the  fall   takes  place earlier  anil
  more regular^. Usually I bled to the extent of 150 to 300 c.c.
     By this means there could be produced an enormous fall of blood
  pressure, sometimes as much as 100 mm. (e.g., from a normal pres

       Brain and    the Conditions   of Recovery after Compression.        13
sure of 125 mm. down to one of 20 mm.).         But, under these circum
stances, the fall is due to a draining of blood from all parts of the
body, the brain included, and hence the latter begins to collapse soon
after the bleeding has been started.        This collapse, however, is not
always great. Thus, in one experiment (fig. 4), after allowing the
brain to recover from the trial experiment, and then bleeding 150 c.c,
the fall of blood pressure of 60 mm. thus produced only caused the
brain to collapse so tbat its vertical thickness was reduced by not
more than 2-4 mm.
   Of course, this collapse produces a new set of intracranial condi
tions, e.g., the brain contains less fluid, and hence its texture is altered ;
it does not fit its surroundings so closely — its vertical depth is less.
These new conditions act in diverse ways as regards its elasticity.
   But we cannot disregard the fact that the fall of blood pressure
measured in the femoral artery is very great, and, were there any
measurable direct relation between the elastic reaction and the blood
pressure, this fall, especially when the brain collapse was not great,
would make itself evident in spite of the altered conditions under
which the second experiment ha.1? to be performed.
   The following table gives the results of experiments of this
kind (p. 14).
   Summary. — In Nos. 4 and 8 there is a distinct diminution in recoil.
In No. 6 the recoil is exactly the same in both experiments, and these
being conducted under comparatively favourable circumstances as
regards the fall of brain surface, this result is of more value than the
others.
   In   No.  7 there is an actual increase in " elasticitv-"
   In   every case the excursion is diminished after bleeding.
   It will thus be seen that there is no constant relation between the
fall of blood pressure and the proportionate recoil, and that in those
cases in which a lowered pressure is accompanied by a lowered elas
ticity, the diminution is very small, and in no way commensurate
 with the fall.     A  series of bleeding experiments, performed without
 registering the exact fall of blood pressure, gave results similarly
 divergent.
    (c.) Comparison of the Results of -Experiments in which the Blond
Pressure was Varied by means of Amyl Nitrite. — It was now evident
that, if possible, a method should be found of reducing or raising the
central arterial pressure without causing an alteration in the level of
the brain surface. In order to do this, the blood supply to the brain
must be kept up or diminished according as the central blood pres
sure falls or rises, i.e., when the pressure falls the cerebral vessels
 should dilate, and vice versa.

 action, brain arteries being included, here we shonld have the condi-

tion required.     The presence of vaso-motor fibres to the cerebral
arteries has been denied, or, at any rate, they have never been demon
strated ; bnt Roy and Sherrington* have shown that the calibre of
the cerebral vessels may be altered by certain substances, notably
acids and alkalies, and they consider this a direct action on the vessel
walls. It occurred to me to try the effect of amyl nitrite, and                      I

found that could obtain a good fall of blood pressure, whilst the
brain surface would remain at the normal level, or, if previously de
pressed, it would rise.
   It is an interesting fact, and one which has a bearing on the vaso
motor question just referred to, that the subsequent recovery of blood
pressure is accompanied by a fall of the brain surface.    This is well
shown in fig. 6.

 general   blood pressure  of from 20 to   30 mm. of mercury, and yet the
brain surface remained at a constant, or nearly constant, level.
    The chief difficulty in this method lay in the short time during
which the fall lasted, thus necessitating very prompt action so as to
apply the compression at the right moment.
    The results of four experiments are tabulated below (p. 16).
    It seen that in each case we find that with the lowered blood

pressure the elasticity is increased, markedly so in Nos. 17, 18,
and 20, thus still further emphasising the fact that the elasticity
does not, or at any rate need not, depend on central blood pressure.

of the nitrite that the excursion       less.

      To render this part of the paper more comprehensible, it is neces
  sary to give a short description of the vessels providing for the
• outflow    of blood from the dog's skull, as their anatomy presents
  many points of difference from that of the human being.                   The
 details are chiefly as stated by Ellenberger and Baum.*
     The greater part of the venous blood leaves the skull through the
 foramen magnum by route of the inferior occipital sinuses, and enters
  the venous plexus of the vertebral column.
     The vein next in individual importance is the superior cerebral,
 which finds exit from a foramen situated, on either side, between the
 post-glenoid protuberance and the external auditory meatus.                  It
 communicates, through the medium of the meatus temporalis, with
 the lateral sinus of its own side. It is often of considerable size, and
 is one of the chief sources of the internal maxillary vein.
    The internal jugular receives, along with other branches, the
 inferior cerebral vein, which runs in the carotid canal and opens into
 the cavernous sinus.
    The internal jugular is very small, and carries away bat little
 cerebral blood.
    Running through the orbital fissures are important veins (oph-
 thalmo-cerebral and cerebro-facial),          which connect the cavernous
 sinuses with the external maxillary veins.                           t
    In addition to these, there are numerous emissary veins, and
 between all the channels of exit named there is free anastomosis.

 viz., the external and internal jugnlars, and internal maxillaries ; the

 latter followed nearly to their termination in the superior cerebrals.
I   then blocked the various veins in succession by clamps, and per
 formed the usual experiment upon the congested brain.
    To make the experiments more complete in one case, measured    I
the change in the venous pressure in the lateral sinus by means of a
cannula inserted into one superior cerebral vein and connected with
 a water manometer.          Directions for dissecting out this vein are given
by    Gartner      and Wagner          I
                                ,f but always found it necessary to remove
the angle of the lower jaw in addition.
    In the following table        I have noted the degree of elevation of the
brain surface, denoting the amount of congestion following blocking
of the main venous outlets.

   Thus we    see that, out of three experiments (246, 25c, and 266) in
which both     external jugulars were blocked, in only one (viz., 246)
is there an appreciable increase in recoil.         (In this case, to be sure,
the internal j agulars were also included, but, in the light of experi
ment 24a, I cannot believe that these insignificant veins are a factor
worth considering.)       Experiments 25a, 256, and 26a show no increase
of elasticity on blocking one or both superior cerebrals in any one of
the cases, and hence are in strong contrast to 23a, in which the
increased recoil is quite noticeable.        This last experiment is also of
importance, from the fact that the rise in venous pressure accompany
ing the increase in elasticity was actually measured, and it shows
what a very considerable rise in the pressure (double the normal in
this case) is necessary to inflnence elasticity at all, and is an indica
tion of how far we may disregard the effect of small changes of
venous pressure as factors vitiating results set forth in former
 sections of this paper.

         Brain and  the Conditions    of Recovery after Compression.     21
    Experiments 25e and 266 show that a venous congestion of brain
(as indicated by its expansion) is not necessarily accompanied by an
increase of elasticity.
    The failure to obtain changes in elasticity in every case must, I
think, be attributed to the variation in calibre of the various channels
of outflow, chiefly, probably, as regards the communications with the
vertebral plexus ; the common occurrence of variations in the size of
 the superior cerebral is patent after a few dissections.
 B. Experiments illustrating the In0uence which varying Vascular Con
    ditions have in Restoring the Volume of a Brain which has undergone
    Prolonged or Severe Compression.
    (a.) Influence of a Rise of the General Blood Pressure. — After the
 brain has been compressed as described for six minutes, the elas
 ticity, as before mentioned, is considerably reduced, and the brain
 surface continues depressed for a long period.        If now the etherisa
tion be diminished, the blood pressure may be caused to rise
 gradually, but considerably, without anything more than a com
 paratively insignificant rise in the level of the brain surface accom
 panying it (see fig. 10, in which the blood pressure rose 35 mm. in
 the space of 12 minutes).          Thus we find a notable difference in
 the reactions of normal and compressed brains to increase of blood
 pressure.     As is well known, in the uninjured brain the surface
 rises and falls concurrently with variations in the blood pressure.
                                                                       — In
    (6.) The Influence of Venous Congestion produced by Asphyxia.
cases of prolonged or severe compression the brain surface may
 nearly always be made rapidly to recover by inducing asphyxia
 In an experiment (fig. 11) the brain had been severely compressed
 by repeated experiments on the same spot, so that the recoil was
 small and had become stationary in one minute.             A rise of blood
 pressure of 30 mm., induced by diminishing the degree of etherisa
 tion, had no appreciable effect, but total recovery rapidly supervened
 with the development of asphyxia.               This recovery cannot be
 ascribed to the rise in the general blood pressure induced by the
  asphyxia (in this case only 10 mm., which contrasts with the 30 mm.
  produced by diminishing the ether supply). This is also borne out
  by the fact that the recovery of the surface may be obtained when
  there is no rise of the blood pressure, as sometimes occurs during
  asphyxia, or the expansion may actually progress whilst the blood
  pressure is in its stage of fall.
    Frequently the surface commences to recover when the asphyxial
  gasps are at their strongest, but recovery will go on when the respi
  rations are small or even when they cease, as they will sometimes,
  directly the trachea is clamped.

    The* extent of recovery varies in different cases ; rarely it fails to
take place at all.
    It is important to notice that not only does the general surface
of the hemisphere rise, but that the saucer-shaped depression due to
compression is obliterated.
    To obtain a definite idea of the extent to which the pressure in the
cerebral veins rises during asphyxia,             I  took the venous pressure
during asphyxia         from  the  superior cerebral in two dogs. In one case
in^ which the normal pressure was very low, about 1-5 of water, it
quickly rose to 8 cm., and in the other in which the normal was
6-5 cm. water, after the usual preliminary fall, it rose again to 7-5 cm.
The asphyxial gasps when strong may cause a variation in pressure
amounting to       1  cm. water.

                              DESCRIPTION OF DIAGRAMS.
    The continuous lines represent the curves of the variations in level of the brain
 surface produced by pressure and otherwise.          The dotted lines represent the height
 of the blood pressure.
    The times in which compression and recoil are measured are noted above the
 diagrams in seconds.        The enumeration of seconds always commences afresh at the
 point at which the weight is removed.

   The temperature of the positive pole of the electric arc, which is
now generally believed to he the boiling point of carbon, is usually
taken, on the authority of Violle,* as approximately equal to 3500° C.
Violle's method of determining it was as follows : — The carbons of
the arc were placed horizontally, and the positive pole was so arranged
            * Violle, 'Jour,     de Phys.,' 3rd Series, vol. 2, 1893, p. 545.

  that pieces of its substance could be detached while the arc was
 passing ; these white-hot pieces fell into a calorimeter, and from the
 amount of heat given up, the temperature was calculated, assuming
 the specific heat of carbon at this point to have its theoretical
 value. The method does not seem at first sight a very reliable
 one, and Violle states that the result is only to be regarded as an
 approximation.
    The method adopted by the authors of this paper is exactly the
 same as that which they employed last year in their " Experimental
 Investigations on the Effective Temperature of the San,"* in the
 account of which full descriptions of the apparatus used, <fcc., are
 given.
    A  Brockie-Pell arc lamp was employed in the experiments, the
 current being obtained from a dynamo worked by a gas engine. It
 would have been preferable for some reasons to have worked the arc
 off the 26 Epstein accumulators which we had at our disposal, but
 the current from these was used in heating the platinum strip, and we
 did not wish to run the cells off too quickly.           Platinoid resistances
 were inserted in circuit with the arc until it burnt steadily.
    The general arrangement of the apparatus is shown diagram-
 matically in Fig. 1.
                                    Fig. 1.
    P is the platinum-strip radiator (our modification of Joly's meldo-
meter), the dotted line representing the water-jacket which is placed
over the strip.      B is the radio-micrometer ; A and B are tubes
through which radiation can pass to fall on the receiving surfaces
within. The diameter of the aperture at A is accurately known ; as
also is its distance from the receiving-surface, so that the apparent
area of platinum, as seen from the latter, may be calculated.
   L is the lamp, which is placed inside a wooden box, lined internally
with tin-plate, both wood and metal being pierced with small holes
opposite to the arc.
   A screen, S, hangs in front of the box, and contains a small,
carefully-measured hole, which can be adjusted until the brightest
(or any) part of the glowing carbons shines directly into the tube B.

The size of the hole in the screen S, and its distance from the radio-
micrometer, then give the apparent area of hright carbon as seen
from the latter.
    The screen S is made of copper, and is really a flat box (Pig. 2)
                                  Fig. 2.
provided with an inlet and an outlet tube, so that a continual stream
of water from the ordinary house supply could be kept running
through it— a precaution        necessary from its proximity to the
arc.    In the experiments, a plentiful stream was kept running
through this box, and thence on to the water-jacket round the
radiator, the supply being sufficient to prevent any perceptible
heating of the screen.
    A small hole cut in the side of the wooden box enabled us, with
the aid of mirrors, to use a pencil of the light of the arc for reflection
from the mirror of the radio-micrometer, thus obviating the necessity
of a lime-light, or other bright source, while an incandescent lamp-
filament provided us with an extremely sharp band of light on the
scale of the radiator.   (A larger and better mirror had been affixed
to this since its use in our work on the solar temperature, and this
mirror, with an incandescent lamp, gives a band of light with edges
so sharp on the
                    " temperature scale," that it could, if necessary, be
read to the tenth of a millimetre, which is beyond our ordinary
requirements.)
    The theory of the method is very simple ; essentially it is the same
as that which applies to the estimation of the effective temperature
of the sun, without the complications arising from atmospheric
absorption, &c.
    In the case of the sun, we can only hope to find (at least at present)
the effective temperature, as we know little of the radiating power of
the photospheric substances, but in the case of the carbons of the arc,

          Temperature   of the Carbons    of the Electric Arct fyc.    27
we   may assume     that we are dealing       with a "black" surface of
approximately    unit emissive power.
   Let then
        Ti = absolute temperature of bare platinum-strip at balancing
                 point,
         e =  ratio of emissive power of a black surface to that of the
                 bare metallic surface at this temperature,
        A =   ratio of the area subtended by the platinum to that sub
                 tended by the glowing carbon, at the receiving surface
                 of the radio-micrometer,
and  q  =/(T)    be the "law of radiation" for     a black surface, where
q = quantity of radiation     as a function   of the absolute temperature
T] of the radiating surface.
   Then the radiation from the carbon is A/e times the intensity of
that from a black surface at a temperature TV

whence Ta may be obtained, when we know (1) the law of radiation,
(2) the ratio of the emissive powers of bare and blacked platinum.
   We go on to discuss these two points together, as the experiments
on the first give us information on the second.
       The Law of Radiation and     the Ratio of the Emissive Powers.
   In our  paper already quoted we have given a series of experiments
on the radiation from bare platinum at temperatures up to 1600° C.
approximately, and we have shown that a simple fourth-power law
expresses the results very closely, so that for these experiments the
" law of radiation " is =              — T04), where T = absolute tem
                           q     a(T4
perature of radiating surface, T0 = temperature of surrounding
medium, a = a constant, and q = radiation in arbitrary units.          At
high temperatures T04 becomes unimportant, and the expression
simplifies still further to q = oT4.
   Experiments on a blackened surface are difficult to carry out at

28          Messrs. W. E. Wilson and P.        L. Gray.   On the
anything      beyond moderately       low temperatures ; we therefore
assumed    in our former work that the form of the law was the same
for a blackened as for a bright surface, there being good grounds,
both theoretical and experimental, for such a belief.      Further inves
tigations, however, indicate that this assumption is not correct, as
will be seen from the experiments detailed below.
   A series of experiments on the radiation from bare platinum was
made first, exactly in the same way as those described in our work
of last year, that is to say, the radiation from the platinum at
different temperatures was allowed to fall on a radio-micrometer         of
the ordinary form, the sensibility of which was reduced sufficiently
to give a readable deflection      at the highest temperature used, the
deflection as given by the scale-readings being then taken as propor
tional to radiation. This proportionality has been shown before to be
strictly true for deflections up to and greater than those obtained in
these experiments.
   The platinum-strip was next blackened on one side with black
oxide of copper, which was ground very fine, mixed up with methy
lated spirit, and laid on with a camel's-hair brush ; this, when the
liquid had dried off, gave a very good, even, dead-black surface, the
emissive power of which may be taken as approximately equal to that
of an ideal black surface.
   Lampblack, of course, is useless for these experiments, since it
burns off at something under 500° C. ; it could only be used if the
 radiator could be placed in a vacuum, or in an atmosphere having no
 action on the carbon, for which purpose we are having apparatus
 specially constructed.
   At about 900° C. the black oxide of copper begins to suffer a
 change ; its surface becomes somewhat shiny, and an alloy is formed
 with the platinum ; this puts a limit to the temperature at which the
 radiation may be taken as that of a " black " surface.           Our first
 strip was   spoiled in discovering this limiting temperature ;  the second
 strip (after calibration, &c., and radiation experiments with the metal
 bare) was covered on both sides and examined during the progress of
 the experiments, which was stopped as soon as the black surface
 showed any signs of change of physical condition ; these were not
 only apparent to the eye, but were also immediately indicated by a
 variability of temperature, due to the alteration of emissive power, as
 the reduction of the oxide crept over the surface of the strip.
    Platinum-black would have no advantages in this connection over
 the copper-oxide, as it reverts to the metallic condition at very nearly
 the same temperature as that at which the oxide changes in the way
 mentioned above.

the lowest temperatures, thus confirming our work of last year, but
in the case of the blacked platinum. the curve is much less steep than that
giv-n by a fourth-power law. In fact, after several trials it was found
that the exponent 3-4, in the expression q = aTx followed the curve
fairly well, but that a formula of the form
                         2 = a(T3-T03) + b(T4-T04),
would fit both curves, the values of a and 6 being obtained from the
respective experiments in the two cases.
   In this expression, as before, q represents quantity of radiation, T
the absolute        temperature       of the radiating surface, T0 the

           Temperature       of the Carbons     of   tlie  Electric Arc, fyc.       31
 temperature     of    its   surroundings,       while a and 6 are constants
 determined in any case from two experimental                       points at some
 distance apart.      When these have been calculated, the expression
may be simplified by writing aT03 + oT04 = a third constant, c say,
so  that we have
                                   q = aT3+oTt-c,
c  being very small and         unimportant when any but very low values
of T are concerned.
   The curves (fig. 3) and figures (Table                  I and Table   II)  already
given were obtained from expressions of this form ; for bare platinum
the constants were calculated from
                            T=      804° abs., q    =   22 5  1

both a and       6   being + , while c = 4-6, so that for calculating              the
radiation, in our arbitrary units, at any temperature, we have

 Fig.   4. — Curve showing   the ratio of the emissive powers     of blacked and bare
                           platinum at different temperatures.
    The curve (fig. 4) shows the same results graphically.
    It will    be seen at once that the ratio diminishes as the temperature
 increases, but less and less rapidly.            The observations agree fairly
 well with the old experiments generally described in the text-books
 — experiments made at 100° 0. and thereabouts — in which the ratio

           Temperature    of  the Carbons  of the Electric Arc, §c.        33
 is given as from 10 to 12.      They differ slightly from Schleiermacher's
 series, the ratio in his being a little lower than in ours at the same
 temperature.
    There is a fair agreement with Rossetti's result at high tempera
 tures; he obtained 2-9 at about 1500" C, which is very little lower
 than the value which would be reached by a theoretical continuation
of our curve (fig. 4).
    The tendency of the curve appeal-s to be to approach a constant
 value of about 3, but it is impossible to dogmatise on this point, from
the physical limitations of the inquiry.         The fact that the ratio does
diminish shows that the physical nature of one or both of the surfaces
is different at different temperatures ; probably it is the bare platinum
which changes, and it is possible that the constant value of the ratio
is just attained at the melting-point of the metal. Experiments with
a molten surface would be interesting, but very difficult to carry out.
                         The Balancing Experiments.
    We may now                         " balance
                     pass on to the               experiments," from which
the temperature      of the carbons of the arc may be calculated. The
principle of the method has already been described in the earlier part
of the paper.
    When the arc was shining on the top receiving-surface of the radio-
micrometer, and the incandescent platinum on the lower, the position
is denoted as Position A, the reverse, by Position B.
    The angle subtended by the area of incandescent platinum, in both
cases, was 5°-301.
    The diameter of the hole in the screen (fig. 2), through which
the radiation of the arc passed, was 0337 cm.             In position B, its
distance from the receiving surface was 57-0 cm. ; in position A it
was 58-2 cm., giving angular apertures of 0 339° and 0-332° respec
tively.    The screen was close enough to the arc to mako it certain
that the hole was completely filled with the brightest part of the
crater of the + pole. The hole was sufficiently small to form a rough
"            "
   pin-bole     image of the carbons, by ireans of which it could be seen
during an experiment that the brightest part of the + pole was shining
directly into the tube of the radio-micrometer, and so on to tho
receiving surface.
    In position B, the ratio of the areas of platinum and carbon, as seen
from the receiving-surface, was
                            (5301/0-339)2 = 245,
and in position    A, the ratio was
                             (5-301/0-332)3 = 255.

    The results in position A are not so concordant as those in
position B, but the arc was not quite so steady ; the first low
                                                                  reading
 (862°) was probably taken when the growth of condensed carbon on
the —pole was partly shading the receiving surface from the heat of
the crater, while the high reading (985° C.) probably corresponds
to one of those sudden " bursts " of high temperature which we
                                                                     have
frequently observed to take place, although we cannot offer any
explanation of them.
   The current in the above experiments was about 14 amperes ; a
few observations were subsequently made with less resistance in
circuit, and a current of about 25 amperes ; the temperature then
appeared to be a little higher than with the smaller current, but the
arc in this case was so unsteady as to prevent the observations being
made very    carefully.
   [Later experiments with a higher voltage (110 volts) and a current
varying from 10 to 40 amperes indicate an exact equality of tempe
rature, which confirms the usually-accepted view. — April 8th,

   Working out the results of the two positions separately, we have,

 p. 31, i.e.,
                           20350  = aT2 + 5T4-5.
 This is  most easily solved by trial, T coming out as 3520°.
    To this about 100° must be added, owing to the curvature of the
radiation curve (for full reason, see Wilson and Gray's paper already
quoted, p. 387), giving approximately

as the temperature of the hottest part of the + pole of the electric
arc,  a result surprisingly near Violle's estimate, 3500° C.
        The Comparative Radiation from Different Parts of the Arc.
   After    the above experiments had been finished, an attempt was
made to obtain comparative values of the radiation, and hence the
temperatures, of different parts of the carbons of the arc. For this
purpose, a radio-micrometer of the ordinary form was employed, on
to the receiving-surface of which radiation could fall through a large
pin-hole.
   An    image of the carbons was then formed by an arrangement
shown diagrammatically in the figure (fig. 5). in which L is the arc

         Temperature   of the Carbons   of  the Electric Arc, Sfc.    37
                                 Fig. 7.
   The numbers are scale divisions on the scale of the radio-micrometer,
and therefore represent the radiation in arbitrary units : —

                    — pole.   Radiation = 21-8,
so that the radiation from the hottest part of the + pole was about
three times as great as that from the hottest part of the — pole.
   Taking the temperature of the former as 3300" C, this would give
a temperature of about 2350° C. for the latter.
   In a case where a " blob " had formed on the — pole, as in fig. 7,
the following readings were obtained     : —
             + pole.   Radiation 57-0, 56-0, 56-6, and 55-5
                                  Mean = 56-3
             — pole.   Radiation of hottest part = 38-3.
   Again, taking 3300° C. for the former, this gives about 2700° C.
for the latter, or 350° C. higher than that of the — pole just after
the arc is started.
    We may say, then, that if the temperature of the crater is about
 3300° C, that of the — carbon is ordinarily about 24,00° C. in its
 hotter parte.
    As for the temperature of the arc itself, we can say nothing.
 Allowing the pale violet glow between the poles to fall on the aper
 ture of the radio-micrometer, we obtained deflections of from 1 to
 2 per cent. of those obtained when the hottest part of the crater was
 used, which seems to indicate a comparatively high radiative power
 for the hot gases which lie between I he carbon poles.

38     On the Temperature      of the Carbons  of the Electric Arc, ftc.
               Note on the Effective Temperature   of the Sun.
   In the authors' work on this subject, radiation experiments were
made with bare platinum, at temperatures up to 1600° C. approxi
mately, and it was assumed that a formula of the same form as
expressed   these results   would also hold for a blacked surface, while
the ratio of the emissive powers at high temperatures was taken on
Rossetti's authority as about 2-9.
   The new work, given above, appears to show that the curve for
the black surface does not, however, follow a simple fourth-power law
so closely as does that for the bare platinum, and that, taking the
law   as given on p. 31 of the present paper, a correction must be
made to the result obtained by the earlier work.
   The approximate value of this correction may be obtained by taking
the figures given as a typical case on p. 386 of last year's pnper, and
applying the new law to them.
   In this case, the corrected ratio (i.e., the ratio corrected for atmo
spheric absorption, and for loss by reflection from the glass of the
heliostat) of the apparent areas of the bare platinum and the sun was
approximately 1295 : 1, and balance was obtained with the platinum
at a temperature of 1514c Abs.
   Now by the formula on p. 31, the radiation of bare platinum at
this temperature
                   = a  . 15143 +6  . 15144-027 = 31177
                   a and  6 having the values given on p. 31.
   The radiation from the sun therefore
                        = 1295x311-77 =403,450.
   To find the effective temperature     of the sun, we have, therefore,
to solve the equation
                          403,450 + 4-6 = aT2 + &T4,
where a and 6 now have the values corresponding to the curve for the
black surface.    This gives T = 7800° Abs., approximately, instead of
7000°, as given by the older method of working.
   That is to say, supposing the new formula to be correct, our esti
mate of the solar temperature would have to be increased by some
thing like 800°.
   If, however, the ratio of    the emissive powers approaches a constant
value, as the figures and curves on p. 32 make possible, the expres
sion for the curve of the black surface would be somewhat altered,
in such a direction as to reduce the correction, so that we may say
finally that, taking Angstrom's estimate of the atmospheric absorp
tion, which gave in our former work an effective solar temperature of
7400° C, its more probable value would now be not very far from
8000° C.

   On the " stress-difference   theory of rapture an objection to the
application to the earth of the results obtained by applying the
elastic solid theory to a perfect sphere, is that the surface values of
nn—<fi(f>         and nn—tt would, for ordinary values of     be simply enor
mous.*             This objection, however, ceases to hold when the earth is
treated as incompressible and truly spherical, because tt and 00 then
vanish, as well as nn.   It is thus important to know what happens
in the case of an incompressible material when the surface is slightly
spheroidal.   To do so, put 1y = in (15), and we find       \
                         nn =      0,                                                      1

  Over the surface the maximum stress-difference,                                                       IS,   is   the equa
torial value of   00, and  given by                is
                                        S     = 87rw2(a2-c2)/95                                                        (17).
Substituting for               p, a,    c   values suitable                   to the case of a homogeneous
" earth," we find that approximately
                         S    =   9-4 tons         weight per square inch                                              (18).
     This is large enough to show that even                                       if the earth be supposed
incompressible, the consequences   of                                        its mutual gravitation cannot
safely be ignored.
   The strains and displacements in the general case of gravitation in
a nearly spherical ellipsoid may easily be deduced from (6) and (7).

  Taking the numerical value (18) for S, and for E the high value
20 X   106   grammes weight per square centimetre, we should get from
(22) for a spheroid the shape and size of the earth, a shortening of
some 5 miles    in equatorial diameters and a lengthening of some 10
tniles in the polar diameter relative to what these lengths would have
been in the absence of gravitation.

     yy is got from xx, and yi from za: by interchanging P with Q and
 a with b.

term in the coefficient of each has been retained.

approximation        the three        stresses    xx,    yy, and xy alone            need be
retained.      To a first approximation a*, yy, and xy are constant

 are so   far in harmony with the assumptions usually made in theories
 of thin plates.        It  should be noticed, however, that dzxjdz is of the
 same    order of magnitude as dxxjdx, and so of equal importance in
 the first body-stress equation.
    When R alone exists, or the forces are parallel to the small dimen
 sion,   zz    at points in the interior is of the same order of magni-
 tude as xx, yy, and xy.
    If  there be bodily forces both parallel             and perpendicular          to the
 small dimension, and the two sets be of the same order of magnitude,
 then to a first approximation the stresses due to the former set of
forces may be neglected.

    It  is easy to prove 46/6 positive, and Bcjc negative, for all values of
tl and bja ; thus, of the axes perpendicular to the axis of rotation, the
longer lengthens and the shorter shortens. The axis 2o of rotation
is always reduced.

the long axis according as they act outwards from it or towards it.

the axes of whose elliptic section are 2a and 2b, rotating about the
cylindrical axis. To deduce results for the elongated ellipsoid from
those found for the infinite cylinder, we write 1— z2/c2 for 1 in the
constant terms in sz, sy, sc, and A, in the coefficient of x in « and in
that of y in p ; and we multiply the expression for 7 by 1 — ^z2/c2.
   The strain and displacement parallel to the long axis are of special
interest; they are

   Denoting by 2l the length of the long elliptic cylinder, we have
                     Sc/c  = -i(«V»/B)(a'+V) = -l(Hll)                                  (61).

strain relations the same values of sx, sy, s, as in (SI), and thence by
integration the correct first approximation values of the displace

    A special instance of this last       case is presented by an elongated
cylinder rotating       about   a  perpendicular to its length through its
centre.     Putting R = <u2, we have

    Comparing the several cases of rotation, we have an interesting
illustration of how the effects of the " centrifugal " force increase as
the mean distance of the substance of the solid from the axis of rota
tion becomes larger.        If the limiting angular velocity permissible in
the elongated ellipsoid rotating about a short axis be taken as 100,
then the limiting angular velocities in the thin elliptic disc and the
elongated cylinder rotating about their short axes — the material, and
the length of the long dimension being the same for all — are approxi
 mately   87   and   71  respectively, both on the stress-difference and
greatest strain theories.        A caution must, however, be added that in
bodies of    such   elongated form rotating about a short axis, a sudden
change in the angular velocity may prove disastrous.

  Micro-Metallography of Iron. Part I." By THOMAS Andrews,
      F.R.S., M.Inst.C.E. Received December 15, 1894,— Read
      January     24, 1895.
          Secondary Micro-crystalline      Structure in Metallic Iron.
   The term metallography           appositely describes, in one word, that
department of metallurgical science which deals with the accurate
stndy and delineation of the ultimate formation or structure of
metals, a knowledge of which is of the utmost importance.
   This development of the science of metallurgy is destined to prove
of incalculable value in the study of the ultimate micro-structure
of iron and steel.
   Experiments on the microscopic structure of iron and steel appear
   • This it more exact for a long beam of rectangular cross section than the result
I                 '                   '
  obtained in the Quarterly Journal for 1888, p. 29.

                              Mr. T. Andrews.
to have been    first initiated by Dr. H. Clifton Sorby, F.R.S., about
thirty years ago, and the author about the same time commenced
some investigations     in this direction.      Strange to say, the subject
has since then lain almost dormant, and only recently have scientific
investigators resumed the study of the ultimate microscopic struc
ture of metals.      Comparatively     little progress has yet been made
in this important and fertile field of research, and our knowledge of
the true structure of metals is, consequently, at the present time
limited.    Excellent work in this direction is now, however, in pro
gress   at the  hands of several investigators, and it is hoped that by
moans of further careful detailed observation with accurate modern
microscopic appliances valuable and reliable results will accrue.
   In the course of a research with high microscopical powers (includ
ing 300, 500, 800, 1200, and upwards to 2000 diameters) on the micro-
crystalline structure of large masses of wrought iron, the author had
the privilege recently to observe the following novel metallurgical
facts.
   When large masses, several tons in weight, of practically pure
wrought iron were allowed to slowly cool from a white heat, a
secondary or subcnstallisation of the metallic iron occurred. The
normal primary crystals of the iron, or those which have hitherto
been regarded as constituting the ultimate structure of the metal,
were found to inclose a subcrystalline formation consisting of very
minute, and much smaller, crystals of pure iron also belonging to the
regular order of crystallisation. These crystals sometimes manifested
the hexagonal form, the predominant angle being about 120°, and
often they assumed the form of simple cubes.                  The secondary
crystals   were   contained     within  the   area   of  the larger primary
erysoals.
   Typical illustrations of this duplex crystallisation found in two
large iron forgings are given in figs. 1 and 2, and the relative
dimensions of a number of individual crystals are given on Tables I
and  II.
   The results of twenty measurements of the primary crystals and
twenty measurements of the secondary crystals taken on each forg
ing are given on these tables.
   The markings of the intercrystalline spaces or junctions of the
secondary crystals       were very clearly         defined, but they were
exceedingly minute.        The general form, contour, and relative size
of the primary      and secondary crystals, as seen in section, will bo
noticed on reference to the accurate tracings, figs. 1 and 2.
   Judging roughly from the indications of the average micro-
measurements on Tables        I and II, there would appear to be approxi
mately 1,000,000,000 of the secoudary crystals in a cubic inch of the
metallic iron.

   In the case of both the primary and secondary crystals the pre
dominant well-defined angles of the facets of the crystals hovered more
or less about the angle of 120°.            The majority of the angle readings,
made with the goniometer attached to the microscope, indicated
generally a hexagonal structure or form of crystallisation.                      There
were, however, also perfect cubical crystals observed.
   The observations were made with a Ross' first-class microscope.
The micro-measurements afford an indication of the comparative size
of the primary and secondary crystals.                These measurements were
carefully    taken    by  a  Jackson     micrometer     and in some cases by a
Ramsden screw micrometer, both accurately calibrated with a standard

   In the case of both the primary and secondary crystals the pre
dominant well-defined angles of the facets of the crystals hovered more
or less about the angle of 120°. The majority of the angle readings,
made with the goniometer attached to the microscope, indicated
generally a hexagonal structure or form of crystallisation.                      There
were, however, also perfect cubical crystals observed.
   The rationale of this duplex crystallisation has apparently been as
follows : — The mass of metallic iron on cooling having reached the
crystallising point at about 740° C, the periphery or skeletons of the
larger or primary crystals were then formed.                     As the period of
cooling was, however, very slow, the semi-fluid or viscons metal in
the interior of these primary crystals was, on finally consolidating,

64                      Micro-Metallography of Iron.
apparently further broken up or subdivided into a considerable
number of smaller crystals, inclosed within the boundary or peri
phery of the primary crystals.
    In the course of further experiments on the cooling of large masses
of wrought iron, the author has also found, by the use of high power
objectives, that the secondary crystals sometimes inclosed a still more
minute form of crystals of pure iron, of the cubical form, which may
hence be regarded as constituting a tertiary system of crystallisation
in pure metallic iron. These experiments therefore indicate that large
masses of heated wrought iron, on cooling from above the temperature
of the crystallisation of metallic iron, viz., 740° C.,* are capable of
crystallising in three distinct modifications, which may tentatively be
called the primary, secondary, and tertiary system of crystallisation
in iron, these various crystalline modifications being all, however,
connected with the regular system of crystallisation.                      The author
has microscopically      examined      numerous large masses            of  practically
pure   wrought    iron  varying     in weight    from     about   2   tons   to 4 cwt.,
and even less, and he finds these subcrystalline formations to be
frequently present, consequent on the slow cooling of such large
masses.
    The crystals of this secondary formation are not often distinctly
discernible in smaller masses of metallic iron, such as rolled rods,
plates, or sheets, as these in the course of manufacture rapidly cool,
and are frequently manipulated during the finishing processes at tem
peratures below the crystallising point of wrought iron (740° C.).
 The author has, however, observed the presence of this subcrystalline
structure in small masses of iron, but, in these instances, the sub-
crystals are generally smaller in size and not always so distinctly
marked as those found in larger masses of metallic iron.
    The microscopical examinations were made on carefully-prepared
 and polished samples, etched in nitric acid (1 part HN03, sp.gr. 1*20,
 and 49 parts water), and by the use of high microscopical powers
 (i inch to      inch, and other objectives).           The drawings were accu
 rately made with the camera Lucida.
    In each observation the etching was prolonged, under constant
 observation with lenses, a suitable time to develop tho accurate
 structure of the metal.
    The varied forms of crystallisation observed in this research and
 referred to in this paper appear to be of such novel metallurgical
 interest, that the author felt it desirable at once to record the obser
 vations, and he hopes to be able to furnish the results of further
 investigations in this direction.

positive proof that the gas he obtained by boiling various samples of

formation of ammonia on sparking with hydrogen, analysis of the

to doubt that any compound of nitrogen, when boiled with acid,
would yield free nitrogen.       The result has justified the scepticism.
    The mineral employed was cleveite, essentially a uranate of lead,
containing rare earths. On boiling with weak sulphuric acid, a con
siderable quantity of gas was evolved.       It was sparked with oxygen
over   soda, so as to free it from nitrogen and all known gaseous bodies
except    argon ; there was but little contraction ; the nitrogen removed
may well have been introduced from air during this preliminary
experiment.       The gas was transferred over mercury^ and the oxygen
absorbed by potassium pyrogallate; the gas was removed, washed
with a trace of boiled water, and dried by admitting a little sulphuric
acid into the tube containing it, which stood over mercury.              The
total amount was some 20 c.c.
    Several vacuum-tubes were filled with this gas, and the spectrum
was examined, the spectrum of argon being thrown simultaneously
 into the spectroscope.      It was at once evident that a new gas was
 present along    with argon.
     Fortunately,  the argon-tube was one which had been made to try

                  On a Gas showing the Spectrum                       of Helium.      [Apr. 2b,
 whether      magnesium-poles             would free the argon from all traces of
 nitrogen.       This it did ; but hydrogen was evolved from the magne
 sium, so that its spectrum was distinctly visible.                                   Moreover,
 magnesium usually contains sodium, and the D line was also visible,
 though faintly, in the argon-tube.                         The gas from cleveite also
 showed hydrogen lines dimly, probably through not having been
 filled with completely dried gas.
     On comparing the two spectra,                    I  noticed at once that while the
hydrogen        and  argon       lines     in   both       tubes accurately coincided, a
brilliant line in the yellow, in the cleveite gas, was nearly but not
quite coincident with the sodium line D of the argon-tube.
     Mr. Crookes was so kind as to measure the wave-length of this
remarkably brilliant yellow line.                         It is 58749 millionths of a
millimetre, and is exactly coincident with the line Ds in the solar
chromosphere, attributed to the solar element which has been named
helium.
     Mr. Crookes has kindly consented to make accurate measurements
of the position of the lines in this spectrum, which he will publish,
and I have placed at his disposal tubes containing the gas. I shall
therefore here give only a general account of the appearance of the
spectrum.
     While the light emitted from a Pfliicker's tube charged with argon
is bright crimson, when a strong current is passed through it, the
light from the helinm-tube is brilliant golden yellow. With a feeble
current the argon-tube shows a blue-violet light, the helium-tube a
steely blue, and the yellow line is barely visible in the spectroscope.
 It appears to require a high temperature therefore to cause it to
appear with full brilliancy, and it may be supposed to be part of the
high-temperature spectrum of helium.
     The following table gives a qualitative comparison of the spectra
in the argon* and in the helium-tubes.

    It ia to be noticed that argon is present in the helium-tube, arid
by the use of two coils the spectra could be made of equal intensity.
But there are sixteen easily visible lines present in the helium-tube
only, of which one is the magnificent yellow, and there are two red
lines strong in argon and three violet lines strong in argon, but barely
virible and doubtful in the helium-tube. This would imply that atmo
spheric argon contains a gas absent from the aryon in the helium-
tube.     It may be that this gas is the cause of the high density of
argon, which would place its atomic weight higher than that of
potassium.
   It is idle to speculate on the properties of helium at such an early
stage in the investigation; but           I   am now preparing fairly large
quantities of the mixture, and hope to be able before long to
give data respecting the density of the mixture, and to attempt the
separation of argon from helium.
   (Note added June 14. — It is now practically certain that the pre
sence of so many of the argon lines in the helium spectrum must
have been due to the accidental introduction of air.               But there still are
coincidences, chiefly in the red lines, which would justify the suppo
sition that there is some constituent common to the two gases.)
II. " On the new Gas obtained from Uraninite. Preliminary-
       Note."       By J. Nobman Lockyek, C.B., F.R.S. Received
       April 25, 1895.
   On the 28th of March, Professor Ramsay was so good as to send
me a tube containing a new gas obtained by him from uraninite
(cleveite), showing a line in the yellow which was stated to be of the

r,8                      Prof.      J.   Norman Lockyer.            [Apr. 25,
same   wave-length as D3, which I discovered in 1868. This line
Dr. Frankland and myself shortly afterwards suggested might be a
line of hydrogen, not visible under laboratory conditions ; but solar
work subsequently showed that this view was untenable, although
the gas which produced it was certainly associated with hydrogen.
   Subsequently, other chromospheric lines were found to vary with
the yellow line, and the hypothetical gas which gave rise to them
was provisionally named "helium," to differentiate it from hydrogen.
   It was therefore of great interest to me to learn whether the new
gas was veritably that which was responsible for the solar phenomena
in question, and I am anxious to express my best thanks to Professor
Ramsay for sending the tube to enable me to form an opinion on this
matter.   Unfortunately, it had been used before I received      and    it,
the glass was   so blackened that the light was invisible in spectroa
scope of sufficient dispersion to decide the question.
   On March 29th therefore, as Professor Ramsay was absent from
England, in order not to lose time, determined to see whether the
                                              I
gas which had been obtained by chemical processes would not come
over by heating in vacuo, after the manner described by me to the
Society in 1879,* and Mr. L. Fletcher was kind enough to give me
some particles of uraninite (broggerite) to enable me to make the
experiment.
   ThisI   did on March 30th, and      succeeded; the gas giving ihe
                                              it
yellow lino came over, associated with hydrogen, in good quantity.
I    have since obtained photographs of the spectrum of the gas, both
in vacuum tubes while the Sprengel pump has been going, and at
atmospheric pressure over mercury.         To-day     limit myself to
                                                               I
exhibiting two of these photographs.
   One of the photographs exhibits a series of spectra taken during
the action of the pump.    The two lower spectra indicate the intro
duction of air by a leak after the capillary had cracked near one of
the platinums, giving us on the same plate the banded and line
spectrum of air.    These prove that there was no air present in the
tube when the fourth spectrum was taken. This photograph has not
yet been finally reduced, but a preliminary examination has indicated
that most of the lines are due to the structure spectrum of hydrogen,
but not all of them.
   Among the lines which cannot be referred to this origin are two
respectively near 4471 and 4302, which have been observed in the
                 X                    X
chromosphere, 4471 being as important as D3 itself, from the theo
retical point of view, to students of Solar Physics.

than C, and so -near it that when both were showing brilliantly the
pair appeared double, like D in a spectroscope of moderate dispersive
power.*
    Later,  I discovered another line at 6678-3 (Rowland), which was
observed to vary with D3.      There is a line in this position, with the
dispersion employed, in the spectrum of the new gas. This line has
also been seen by Thalen, as stated by Professor Cleve in a com
 munication to the Paris Academy (' Comptes Rendus,' April 16th,
p. 835), but the other lines given by him (with the possible exception
 of the one at 501 6) have not been recorded by me.
                I
     Although have, at present, been unable to make final comparisons
 with the chromospheric lines, the evidence so far obtained certainly
 lends great weight to the conclusion that the new gas is one effective
in producing some of them, and it is suggested by the photographs
that the structure lines of hydrogen may also be responsible for some
 of them.
     I may state, under reserve, that      I  have already obtained evidence
 that the method     I have indicated may ultimately provide us with
 other new gases, the lines of which are also associated with those of
 the chromosphere.
     Messrs. Fowler, Baxandall, Shackleton, and Butler have assisted
 me in the various stages of the inquiry.

     Several years ago an opportunity was given to one of us to
  examine poisoned arrows and the poison used in smearing them, of
  the Wa Nyika tribe of East Africa.              While the pharmacological
  action of this poison was found to have a close resemblance to that

 of Strophantus seeds, its physical and chemical properties enabled the
 conclusions to be drawn that the poison was not made from these
 seeds, but was chiefly composed of an extract prepared from a wood.
 These conclusions have been confirmed by the examination of further
 specimens of the Wa Nyika arrow-poison, and of the wood from
which it is prepared.
    Specimens of the Wa Gjriama and of the Wa Kamba arrow-poisons
and of the wood from which they are prepared have also been
 examined.
    We have been enabled to refer all these specimens of wood to the
 genus Acokanthera, which, therefore, supplies the arrow-poison     used
over an extensive area in East Africa.
    Leaves, flowers, and fruit, each taken from the same individual
tree, having also been sent to us, we have been enabled to determine
that the wood of the species Acokanthera Schimperi, Benth. and Hook.
 (Carissa Schimperi, A.DC), is used by the Wa Nyika and the Wa
 Gyriama and other tribes in preparing their arrow-poison.
   The tribes inhabiting the coast regions near Mombasa have long
been known to use an arrow-poison, but the botanical specimens
received by us are apparently the first that have been completely
identified.
   The arrow-poison of these tribes usually contains a crystalline
glucosidal active principle, which, in its chemical properties and
pharmacological action, is identical with the active principle also
separated by us from the wood of Acokanthera Schimperi.
   This active principle crystallises from water in the form of colour
less, transparent, quadrangular plates, and from alcohol in colourless,
thin, needle-shaped crystals, which usually group themselves in tufts
and rosettes. At a temperature of 13 — 15° C. it is soluble to the
extent of 0-93 per cent. in distilled water, and of 2-4 per cent. in
diluted alcohol of sp. gr. 0-92l).      At higher temperatures much
larger quantities are dissolved by water and by alcohol.      It is alto
gether insoluble     in ethylic ether and  in chloroform.   A  saturated
solution in cold water is tasteless and neutral in reaction, and is
affected, in an obvious manner, by very few chemical reagents.
Strong sulphuric acid produces immediately a red colour, and subse
quently a green colour is developed.        The melting point is about
18G° C.      When treated with dilute sulphuric acid it gives the
reaction of a glucoside.
   Concordant combustions made for us by Dr. Dobbin of the
Chemical Laboratory of the University show that, dried at 100° C,
it contains (ii) C 58-46 per cent., H 7-71 per cent., which corresponds
with the formula CsoHwOi3.

glucoside from the root of an unknown species of tree used in North

 Somaliland to prepare an arrow-poison.       This glucoside, dried at
 120°  C, on combustion  yielded C 48-3 per cent., H 6-5 per cent., and
 to it the name ouabain was given.
    In 1888 Arnaud obtained from the wood of an unidentified species
of Acokanthera, provisionally named Acokanthera ouabaio, Cathelineau
 (Carissa ouabaio, Franchet and Poisson), used in North Somaliland
to prepare an arrow-poison, a crystalline glucosidal active principle,
which, dried at 140° C, on combustion yielded (i) C 58-14 per cent.,
H 7-67 per cent., corresponding with the formula C^H^Ou, and
 dried at 100° C, with the formula C3oH<sOu,H3O ; and to it the name
 ouabain was also given.
    In 1893 Lewin, and also Merck, separated from the wood of another
Acokanthera, named Acokanthera D'flerrii, Schweinfurth, an amorphous
glncosidal active principle, which, dried at 100° C, on combustion
yielded C 58 32 per cent., H 8-01 per cent. ; and which is also named
by Lewin ouabain, and erroneously stated to be the active principle
of Acokanthera Schimperi.
    The complete recognition of the species of Acokanth-ra is of
primary importance, because several supplies of the wood of uniden
tified species of Acokanthera sent to us from East Equatorial
Africa yielded only a glucosidal active principle, which was amor
phous.
    The characters of the crystalline active principle which we have
separated from the wood of the fully identified species Acokanthera
Schimperi, Benth. and Hook., agree with those of the crystalline
active principle separated by Arnaud from the wood of the uniden
tified species of Acokanthera, provisionally named ouabaio; and also
from the seeds of an unidentified species of Strophanthus, obtained
from West Africa.
    As, therefore, the name ouabain is used for three quite different
substances, and is itself derived from merely a vernacular word
" wabayo," which is used in a restricted district, we would
                                                               suggest
that, in accordance with a usual custom, the crystalline active
principle of Acokanthera Schimperi should be named acokantherin
and not ouabain.
    In the Preliminary Notice of this paper there was appended a note,
making brief mention of some of the most important general obser
vations made by several investigators upon the pharmacological action
of those arrow-poisons which, at the time when the investigations
 were made, were not known to be derived from the Acokanthera
species, and upon several non-crystalline and crystalline glucosidal
substances to which the arrow-poisons owe their action.         In the
present paper the work accomplished by Arnott and by Haines in
 1853, by Ringer in 1880, by Rochebraune and Arnaud in 1881, by
Laborde in 1887, by Langlois and Varigny, by Gley and Rondeau,

 1895.]   its Natural History, Chemistry, and Pharmacology.           73
and by Gley in 1888, by Sailer in 1891, by Paschkis in 1892, and by
Lewin in 1893, has been more fully described.
   The group of arrow-poisons which owes its activity to extracts of
Acokanthera plants has been found to possess a qualitative identity of
action with Strophanthus, but some of the authors mentioned
emphasise an action upon the cardio-respiratory         centres in the
medulla, and others a direct action upon the heart.
   A detailed examination of the pharmacological action of acokan-
therin has not led to the discovery of any important qualitative
differences between its action and that of Strophanthus hispidus and of
its active principle strophantbin, which was described by one of us in
1870, in 1872, and in 1890.
   As, however a special interest must be attached to the effects upon
the circulation, the experiments upon the heart, blood-vessels, and
blood-pressure are described with more detail than those upon other
systems.     Our experiments show that small and carefully-regulated
doses can produce a great slowing of the rate of the heart, even when
the vagi nerves are divided, or when atropine is administered ; and
that a great increase in the extent of the diastolic and systolic move
ments of the heart can be obtained without the average blood-
pressure being at all affected, or affected only to a very small extent.
Any rise of blood-pressure which follows the administration of such
doses is accompanied by so great a slowing of the rate and by so great
an increase of the extent of the pulse movement that constriction of
blood-vessels seems contra-indicated ; and the rise of blood-pressure
mast therefore be attributed to the increase in the amplitude and
vigour of the heart movements and the greater quantity of blood
propelled into the arteries. Large doses produce a rise of blood-
pressure, which is probably due to an action upon the vaso-motor
centres or peripheral ganglia, and probably not upon the muscle of
the blood-vessels, because perfusion experiments in frogs show that
dilute solutions of acokantherin of 1 in 100,000 to 1 in 10,000 in
normal saline do not produce contraction of blood-vessels, and with
even so strong a solution of acokantherin as 1 in 5000 the contraction
is very slight ; whereas a solution of disntalin of 1 in 100,000 to 1 in
20,000 in normal saline rapidly reduces and arrests the flow through
the blood-vessels.
   The predominant action of acokantherin is that exerted upon
striped muscle, and, because of this action, with possibly an action
upon the intrinsic cardio-motor ganglia, the chief effect is produced
upon the heart, while the influence exerted upon the cardio-respira
tory centres in the medulla is relatively slight or secondary.

         Chemistry in University College, London.                     Received

                                  § 1. Introductory.
 Ix   seeking for a clue which would guide to the formation of com
pounds of argon, Mr. Miers, of the British Museum, kindly informed
me that a gas, supposed to be nitrogen, was obtainable from certain
minerals containing the metal uranium, and notably from cleveite, a
Norwegian mineral discovered by Nordenskjold. The gas evolved
from a number of such minerals had been examined by Dr. W. F.
Hillebrand, of the United States Geological Survey, and was pro
 nounced by him to be nitrogen.          The gas, which is evolved from some
uraninites by the action of weak sulphuric acid, or by fusion with
sodium carbonate, gave, in the hands of Dr. Hillebrand and Dr.
Hallock,* the usual fluted nitrogen spectrum, and on sparking with
 hydrogen in presence of acid, or with oxygen in presence of alkali,
contraction ensued.         From the first of these experiments they were
able to prepare a weighable quantity of ammonium platinichloride.
    In a private letter from Dr. Hillebrand, from which he allows me
to quote, he states : —
    " The circumstances and conditions under which
                                                                my work in this
line was done were unfavourable ; the chemical investigations had
consumed a vast amonnt of time, and              I  felt strong scruples about
taking more from regular routine work.               I was a novice at spectro
scopic   work   of   this  kind,   and was   thereby   led  to attach too little
importance to certain observations which in the light of your dis
coveries deserved the utmost consideration.             Among other things, it
puzzled me that the formation of ammonia should have proceeded so
slowly, and that only a comparatively small amount of the gas should
have been converted at the expiration of even several days' passage
of the current. But, having had no previous experience, was unable I
to judge whether this was especially abnormal or not ; it might have
been due to insufficient current, or to some other cause.             A similar
observation applies to the sparking with oxygen, which was only
carried far enough to prove a contraction, and to obtain the tests for
nitric acid.

that they should have escaped my observation.               They did not. Both
Dr. Eallock and        I  observed   numerous      bright lines on one or two
occasions, some of which, apparently, could be accounted for by
known elements — as mercury, or sulphur from sulphuric acid ; but
there were others which         I could not identify with any mapped lines.
The well-known variability in the spectra of some substances under
varying conditions of current and degree of evacuation of the tube,
led me to ascribe similar causes for these anomalous appearances, and
to reject the suggestion made by one of us in a doubtfully serious
spirit, that a new element might be in question."
    It appeared to me unlikely that any substance should give free
nitrogen on treatment with an acid ; and on examining a sample of
gas evolved from         cleveite, which   I  procured from    Mr. Gregory, the
conclusion was confirmed.
    The mineral is imbedded in felspathic rock, and forms black nodules
and veins in the light reddish felspar. A considerable quantity of the
pure mineral could be picked out ; but it was found more advan
tageous to powder the whole rock and to boil it with dilute sulphuric
acid (1 to 8). Under this treatment the mineral rapidly disinte
grates, and an abundant evolution of gas takes place, even in the
cold.
    The gas is most conveniently collected by the device shown in the
accompanying woodcut.            The mineral is placed in the flask A, which
is exhausted of air by means of a Topler pump ; to expel the last
traces of air, some water is admitted so as to moisten it. Acid which
has been boiled is run in hot through the funnel B, and the con
nexion with the gas-holder, C, is opened. After half an hour's boiling
with the mineral all gas had been evolved. The stop-cock communi
cating with the gas-holder was closed, the remaining gas taken out
by means of the air-pump, and restored to the gas-holder through the
arrangement depicted at D.
     The gas-holder is, of course, filled with water, thoroughly boiled in
vacuo, so as to avoid contaminating the gas with nitrogen, oxygen, or
argon.
    The method of extracting the gas on a small scale is practically
identical, the difference consisting solely in the size of the vessels
employed.*
                          § 2.  Preliminary Experiments.
     These experiments are described in the Preliminary Note com
 municated to the Society on March 26, 1895.              I  shall only add that
it appears pretty certain, in the.light of subsequent experiments, that

this sample of ga3 was largely contaminated with atmospheric air.
On sparking with oxygen in presence of soda, the nitrogen was, ot
course, removed; but it will be seen subsequently that the complete
argon spectrum is not visible in the new gas.
                         § 3. Sources of Helium.
   I  owe   to the kindness of Dr. Hillebrand some grams of the
 uraninite which served for his experiments. It is a hard, black
mineral, containing, according to his account (loc. cit), the oxides of
uranium, lead, thorium, yttrium, and allied metals in smaller amount.
It is attacked by acid with great difficulty, and gas is very slowly
evolved.   A quantitative experiment was made by boiling 2-808
grams for      hours, when 24 c.c. of gas were evolved. After further
boiling for ten hours, an additional 13-5 c.c. were ohtained, in all
37 5 c.c.
   The first portion of this gas was mixed with oxygen and sparked
for a short time. The volume of the mixture was 34-3 c.c, and
after sparking it had diminished to 33-9 c.c.     This appears to show
that very little nitrogen is present if care be taken in collecting
the gas.    I must reserve to the second part of this paper a further
account of this specimen.
                       I
   The cleveite which bought from Mr. Gregory is much more easily
decomposed, for in the course of half an hour the mineral is com
pletely disintegrated, and all gas is evolved. Mr. Travers found that
3-662 grams of the pure black mineral, free from felspar, yield 26 c.c.
of gas.
   This gas when mixed with oxygen and sparked did not contract to
any great extent. The actual measurements are : —

It  appears therefore that this gas contains some, but not much
nitrogen, and practically no free hydrogen.        It must be concluded
that the hydrogen obtained in such large quantity from the crude
felspathic mineral (see below) must have been derived from some free
metal which it contained.
   An attempt was also made to extract gas from Cornish pitchblende,
a large sample of which        I owe to the kindness of Mr. Kitto. It is
decomposed by acid very slowly, and it also evolves gas when heated
in vacuo, but in exceedingly small quantity.       From 50 grams only a
few cubic centimetres are evolved.
   Similar results were obtained with a sample of pitchblende of
unknown origin which I happened to possess.           The amount of gas
obtained was quite insignificant.
                  § 4. Density of various Samples of Gas.
   It has been stated in the preliminary note already referred to, that
the spectrum of the gas extracted from cleveite is characterised by a
brilliant yellow line, which, according to Mr. Crookes' measurement,
has the wave-length 587-49 millionths of a millimetre, and is identical
with the line D3, to which Mr. Lockyer many years ago gave the
name " helium," from its occurrence in the spectrum of the sun's
chromosphere.       As the line D3 is observed high in the chromo
sphere,  it  has  been inferred that the density of the gas should be
very low.     Special interest therefore attached to the determination of
this important property.
   The gas used for the first experiment was the crude gas from the
felspathic rock containing cleveite.
   About 300 c.c. confined over strong caustic potash solution, which
has been well boiled to expel all air, were used.        The globe, which
was the same one that served for weighing argon, had a capacity of
162.843 c.c.    The data are as follow : —

This gas, as will be afterwards       explained, contained free hydrogen.
In order to purify it from this constituent, it was       passed from one
gas-holder to another several times over red-hot copper oxide. The

 volume     of the residue, unaltered further by copper oxide, was 183 c.c.

 and phosphorus pentoxide.              This sample gave the result : —

    This gas, however, when examined spectroscopically,                 was seen
still to contain nitrogen, but obviously the amount was diminished.
I must reserve to a later date a more accurate determination. But
judging by a preliminary experiment, in which a small quantity of
this gas was sparked with oxygen until no further contraction
occurred, and until it gave a spectrum absolutely free from all
trace of nitrogen, no great reduction in the density is to be expected.
 The number 3-9 may, therefore, be taken as a maximum number for
the density of helium.

     The tube used and the method employed for this experiment were
 the same as those used for argon by Lord Rayleigh and myself, t
 The half- wave-length of air in the tube at 15° was 34-45 mm. ; that
 of the new gas (sample of density 4-84) as a mean of twelve readings
 was 69-33 at 13-6°.            This gives a ratio of l-863, which is obviously
 too high.        But it must be remarked that the heaps of lycopodium,

although some were -well marked, were not symmetrically arranged.
Every attempt was made by altering the length of the india-rubber
tubing which connected the wave-length tube with the supply of gas,
to induce appropriate echoes.       This plan works well with denser
gases.   But     Ifound it of no avail.   The half- wave-lengths were
always   between    67  and 71 mm.,  and there appears no reason which
would justify choosing the lower figure, which would give the ratio
of specific heats 1 : T74.
   One conclusion, however, may be drawn : that the gas has a high
ratio of specific heats, and that it is probably monatomic, if this
inference is legitimate for argon.*
      § 6. 7s the Gas evolved        from Cleveite a Hydride or an Element ?
     It
     was soon discovered that the gas evolved from cleveite by treat
ment with dilute sulphuric acid contained a not inconsiderable amount
of hydrogen. Now if the element helium is in combination in cleveite
with the uranium, or the lead, or the yttrium, it is to be expected
that it will be evolved as a hydride.   It is true that a hydride might
be  unstable, in which  case  free hydrogen should be mixed with the
helium.
   An attempt was made to decide which alternative is correct by
absorbing the free hydrogen by palladium.        A measured quantity of
the gas was treated with palladium sponge, hammered on an anvil,
so as to avoid the introduction of air into the gas as much as possible,
and it was passed up into the tube containing the gas.      The numbers
obtained are these : —
              Original volume of crude gas                           12-20 c.c.
              Residue after absorption of hydrogen.              .     2-40   ,,
              Hydrogen absorbed                                        9-80   „
   The gas therefore consisted of 107 per cent. of a substance un-
attacked by palladium, after standing for a night in contact with                          it,
and 80-3 per cent. of hydrogen.     The residue was transferred to a
sparking-tube, and sparked with oxygen over caustic potash.        The
volume then decreased to 2-20 c.c, and the residue     18-0 per cent. of
                                                                      is
the total.  The  contraction    too  small
                                        is to allow of  the hypothesis
that a hydride of helium has been decomposed on sparking, although
if the formula of the hydride were HHe, decomposition and removal
of hydrogen might take place without change of volume.
                 §    7.   The Spectrum      of   the Gas   from Cleveite.
     A careful comparison was made between the spectra of various

   had to content myself              with throwing the two spectra into the same
   field of vision.          By using two coils and adjusting current until the
   luminosity       of the   common lines in the two tubes becomes equal, very
  accurate conclusions can be drawn regarding the spectra.
      A description has already been given of the first sample of gas
  examined (see Preliminary Note). In all probability a considerable
  amount of air had leaked in during its extraction, for it showed
  practically the whole of the argon spectrum in addition to lines to be
   ascribed to helium.
      The gas prepared on a large scale, which consisted chiefly of
  hydrogen, was first examined. There is nothing in the spectrum
  which calls for special notice, unless it be that the helium yellow (Ds)
  and violet lines were visible, even in presence of 80 per cent. of
  hydrogen.          These and other helium lines were brought out more
  intensely after a large portion of the hydrogen had been removed by
  means of palladium. . The argon red pair were, however, invisible in
  the helinm-tube.
      On sparking this gas, all hydrogen and nitrogen were removed.
  And after a vacuum-tube had been filled a careful comparison was
  made between the spectrum of this gas and that of argon.

    This table may be taken as giving the most striking lines of helium.
Those which at once catch the eye are first the yellow line D3, wh ich
enormously surpasses the rest in brilliancy. Next in intensity, but
still brilliant, is the violet line ; next the peacock-green, and fin ally
the red.     All  other lines are comparatively faint.
    That the argon spectrum is reproduced with variations                  in the
helium-tube might lead to the conclusion that argon is present in the
helium.      But that argon was derived from atmospheric sources or
from the water is excluded by the method of extraction.                Even sup
posing that a few cubic centimetres of air had entered by leakage,
the amount of argon contained therein, compared with the large
volnme of the helium, would make it practically impossible that the
spectrum of argon should be visible. But there is no reason to suspect
such a leakage.       On the other hand, the helium spectrum reproduces
one of the characteristic red lines of argon more intensely than it is
seen in the argon-tube ; and the other is absent. , The faint orange-red
line,* a faint blue-green, and three violet lines are also present in both.
Can it be that both these gases are mixtures ? That there is no helium,
or at least no gas giving the line D3 in atmospheric air is certain,
for its brilliancy would lead at once to its detection in the spectrum
of atmospheric argon if it were present.
                             § 8. General Remarks.
    So far as these experiments go, they show that a gas can be
extracted from cleveite, and probably from some allied minerals,
lighter than any known gas except hydrogen. Whether or not this
gas is a mixture or a single substance remains undecided.                 The fact
of its spectrum possessing some of the lines of argon and not others
may point to the conclusion that argon is a mixture, but until some
methods of fractionation have been tried it is premature to speculate.
 Only one remark may be permitted of a speculative nature: the
general similarity of helium (applying this name to the gas from
cleveite) to argon, iu not being affected either by red-hot magnesium
or by sparking with oxygen in presence of potash, makes the infer
ence probable that they belong to the same natural group.                    If the
atomic weight of argon be 20 (a supposition which may be supported
 by some lines of argument), then, on subtracting 16, which is the
 average difference between the atomic weights of members of the
 first line, beginning with lithium and continued to fluorine, and the
 second line, beginning with sodium and ending with chlorine, the
 number 4 is obtained ; and this closely approximates to the found
 density of helium, if that number is not too high. On the other hand,
    * Subsequent experiments have shown that this line is strong in helium near the
 negative electrode.

 if the atomic weight of argon be 40, on subtracting 32, or twice the
average difference, the number 8 is obtained, which closely approxi
 mates to 3-9 X 2.       Which of these views is correct time must decide.

     The paper deals experimentally with the currents induced in the
coils and in the cores of the magnets of alternate current machines
by the varying currents in and the varying positions of the armature.
It    is shown that such currents exist, and that they have the effect of
diminishing to a certain extent the electromotive force of the machine
when working on resistances as a generator without a corresponding
effect upon the phase of the armature current.            It is also shown that
preventing variations in the coils of the electromagnet does not, in
the machine experimented upon, greatly affect the result, and that
the effect of introducing copper plates between the magnets and the
armature has not a very great effect upon the electromotive force of
the armature, the conclusion being that the conductivity of the iron
cores is sufficient to produce the main part of the effect.            A method
of determining the efficiency of alternate current machines is illus
trated, and the results of the experiments for this determination are
utilised to show that in certain cases of relation of phase of current to
phase of electromotive force, the effect of the local currents in the
iron cores is to increase, instead of to diminish, the electromotive force
of the machine.

         TON BASTIAN, M.D., F.R.S., Professor of Clinical Medicine
         in University College. London. Received April 5, 1895.
     In   a recent communication to the Royal Society by Drs. Mott and
 Sherrington, entitled " Experiments upon the Influence of Sensory
 Nerves upon Movement and Nutrition of the Limbs," results of a
 most important and hitherto unsuspected character were brought
 forward.        In this communication they have shown that " section of

or lower, immediately produces a lasting motor paralysis in the limb
thus apaesthete.
   The interpretation of these results seems at first sight very difficult.
The authors of the paper, after referring to views which I have put
forward in reference to the fundamental importance of sensory
impressions in the production of voluntary movements, give expression
                                      "
to the following explanation : — We think these experiments go even
further than his arguments in pointing to the influence of sensation
upon voluntary movement, inasmuch as they indicate that not only
the cortex, but the whole sensory path from periphery to cortex cerebri,
is in action during voluntary movement."
   This interpretation of their interesting experimental results is one
which I cannot accept because it is opposed to other thoroughly
ascertained facts. Clinical investigation has established the fact that
in cases of complete hemianaesthesia due to lesions or functional
defects in the posterior part of the internal capsule, there is not only
no paralysis but little or no impairment in the ability to perform,
under visual guidance, even the most delicate movements with the
apaesthcte limbs.       This shows therefore that it is not         necessary,  as
                      " the whole sensory path from periphery to cortex
they suggest, for
         "
cerebri     to be in action during the performance of voluntary move
ments. It was the knowledge of these facts, made known by clinical
investigation, that caused me to be much perplexed when Dr. Sherring
ton kindly showed me some of the animals on which he had been
experimenting.       The reality of the paralysis was obvious, but how
were    we   to account   for the fact that the interruption of the sensory
channels from a limb in one part of their course produced this almost
complete paralysis, whilst the interruption of these channels higher
up (in the brain itself) gave rise to no such results ? I was for a
time quite unable to explain the apparent discrepancy,                     though
further consideration seemed to remove the difficulty.
   A brief exposition will,       I hope,  suffice  to throw light upon this
question, as well as upon the extent to which afferent impressions and
the activity of their related centres are really needed for the produc
tion of voluntary movements.
    I have for some years contended, in opposition to very generally
accepted views, that there is no evidence to prove the existence of
 motor centres in the cerebral cortex; whilst, on tho other hand,
 there is much evidence to show that the cortical regions supposed to
 be motor, are, in reality, sensory centres of kinaesthetic type.*             The
postulation of the existence of motor centres in the cerebral cortex
had its origin in, or, at least, derived its principal support from, the

  doctrine (now generally admitted to be erroneous) that " feelings
  of movement" were, in the main, "concomitants of the out-going
  current."
      Further, I have endeavoured to show th at sensory impressions and
  the activity of sensory centres are the real guides for volitional
  :iction, that they, in fact, do just such work as has been attributed to
  supposed cortical motor centres, and that it is a fundamental error to
  imagine that cortical motor centres exist for the performance of
  voluntary movements, altogether apart from the other motor centres
  that are concerned with the production of reflex or secondary
  automatic acts.*
      I  have contended, in short, that true motor centres exist only in the
  pons bulb and spinal cord, which may be called into activity in
 different ways, according as the stimulus comes, in the one case (a)
 from the cortex, for volitional movements ; or as it comes (6) through
 afferent nerves and lower sensory centres, as in reflex acts.
      In regard to movements of the latter category (b), there is no
 room for difference of opinion, and the results of the experiments
 of Drs. Mott and Sherrington are thoroughly in harmony with what
 is generally admitted.           Section of all the sensory roots proceeding
 from a limb must abolish, as it has been found to do, all reflex move
 ments in this limb.
     We may turn therefore at once to the consideration of (a) move
 ment* initiated          from     the cerebral cortex (so-called voluntary
 movements),        and    strive  to ascertain in what various modes such
 movements may be rendered impossible, or, in other words, how
paralysis of such movements may be occasioned.
     It   may be noted here that the writer was the first, in 1869, in
opposition to then prevalent physiological notions, to postulate the
existence of various sensory centres in the cerebral cortex,f and that
some years before any experimental evidence was brought forward on
the subject.        About the same time he showed how this hypothesis
sufficed to throw light upon the nature of various forms of speech
defects,J an<^ m thi8 ^e was followed by Broadbent,§ still before any
attempt had been made to localise such centres. jj

   From the point of view of sensory guidance, cortically initiated
movements are divisible into two categories : — (I) Speech movements,
which are now known to be produced under the guidance of co-active
auditory and kin-sthetic centres ; and (II) Limb and other bodily
movements, which are equally well known to be produced under the
gnidance of co-active visual and kinaesthetic centres.                     In each case
the kinaesthetic centres do not seem to act independently, but only in
response to the primarily initiated activity in the auditory or in the
visual centres respectively — these latter in all cases seeming to take
the lead.
   I. Speech Movements. — Words appear to be revived in thought, in
the main, in the auditory centres, and, if they are to be spoken,
stimuli from these centres must pass along associational fibres to
related portions of the kinaesthetic centre, that is, to what                    I   have
                "                           " centre, in and near the
termed the glosso-kinaesthetic                                                 posterior
part of the third frontal convolution.                 If   we assume, as clinico-
pathological      evidence      seems    to  warrant,    that   the portion of the
auditory centre concerned with the registration of the sounds of
words is situated in the posterior part of the upper temporal con
volution, the associational fibres in question would pass in their
course from the auditory centre beneath the Island of Reil in order
to reach the glosso-kinaesthetic centre.              From this region the com
bined stimuli would pass off from the cortex (and through the
internal capsule), so as to evoke in appropriate ways the activity of
the proper motor centres for speech situated in the bulb (fig. 1).
   It has now been ascertained that speech movements may be
paralysed by lesions in any part of this tract from the auditory centre
to the bulb.       Lesions in either of the two sensory centres will pro-

duce such paralysis      just as certainly as lesions in the bulbar motor
centres themselves. If the lesion be situated in the auditory word
centre (AC) it will produce "word-blindness" as well as loss of
speech ; though if it be situated in the glosso-kinaest-hetic       centre
(GKC)     it will produce  loss of speech alone.   In opposition, however,
to the doctrine as to the strict localisation of aphasia, as a symptom
resulting only from lesions in the third frontal convolution (Broca's
convolution), I have long maintained that precisely similar defects
would result from destruction of the commissural fibres (x) in any
part of their course— thus affording an explanation of the many
cases recorded by Meynert and others in which aphasia had been
                              "
caused by a lesion in the Island of Reil."
   Again, it has long been known that damage to the internuncial
fibres (y) in any part of their course would also cause loss of speech
(i.e., paralysis of speech movements), similar in kind to that caused by
lesions in the bulbar motor centres (BMC).
   In what has been said above we have illustrations of the importance
of afferent impressions and the revived activity of afferent centres for
the production of the voluntary movements occurring in articulate
speech.     And        if,
                    instead of looking to the processes which occur when
our own thoughts reveal themselves in spontaneous speech, we turn to
what happens when we read the recorded thoughts of another,           will       it
be found that a further relation with sensory centres has to be
established before such reading aloud can occur.
   The impressions from the printed page impinge upon the visual
centre (fig.  VC), and are thence transmitted across commissural fibres
                 2,
to related portion of the auditory centre, whence the stimuli pass, as in
spontaneous speech, to the glosso-kinaesthetic centre and thence on to
the bulb.    The consequence is, that where lesions occur in the course
of these visuo-auditory fibres (z), the individual       unable to read
                                                                   is
aloud, and he        unable to name objects or even single letters,
                          is
although he will immediately repeat words or letters as soon as he
hears them.     He cannot carry out the voluntary movements con
cerned with speech at the instigation of the visual sense, though he
can do so at the instigation of auditory impressions.       We get thus
at the roots of Will and find them definitely localised in sensory
centres.*

lesions or by functional defects.

  If   the kinaesthetic centres in relation with the limb are destroyed,
 paralysis of the limb results, together with loss of muscular sense
and kinaesthetic impressions generally.       This has now been deter
 mined by clinico-pathological     evidence, as well as by the results
following excision of portions of the cortex by reason of disease
occurring therein.
    As yet we have no evidence from man of paralysis of limb move
ments following extensive disease of the visual centre, or of the
commissures existing between it and the kinaesthetic centres for the
limbs, comparable with the paralysis of speech movements following
disease of the auditory centre or the audito-kinaesthetio commissural
fibres, except in the case of writing movements.        It     however,       is,
certainly true that with destruction of the left visual word-centre
the individual      no longer able to write words or even
                        is                                        single            a

of limbs as that which results from destruction of the kinaesthetic
centres themselves. Thus, Maiique* has found, and his results have
been confirmed by Exner and Paneth,f that isolation of the kin
aesthetic centres, by section of the fibres that connect them with the
other sensory centres of the cortex, produces a paralysis of precisely
the same character as that which occurs when these so-called motor
centres are extirpated. Marique, moreover, found that the same kind
of muscular contractions were produced on electrical irritation of the
respective kinaesthetic centres after, as before, isolation, showing that
these centres still retained their excitability and their connection
with the pyramidal tracts.

 %           Dr. H. C. Bastian.          On the Relations   of Sensory     [May   2,
    (a.)   Cerebral Functional Defects. — To this cerebral category belong
cases of the so-called hysterical type, in which there appear to be
 temporary defects in the nutritional condition of the kinaesthetic
 centres leading to various temporary and curable forms of paralysis
 (either monoplegias, hemiplegias, or paraplegias), such as                 I  have
 elsewhere     described,*     always   associated   with a corresponding loss of
 muscular sense and, more or less, of defect in common sensibility.
 These forms of functional paralysis are often combined with well-
 marked complete hemianaesthesia, either single or doable, presumably
 due to a co-existing nutritional defect in the sensory region of the
internal capsule.
    Strangely enough, in one class of these cases the patients are
 found to be capable of performing movements so long as their eyes
are open, though they are quite unable to perform even the simplest
movements with the affected limbs as soon as the eyes are closed ;f
results which are,         I think, to be explained by the existence of a minor
degree of that nutritional degradation of the kinaesthetic centres
which, in the other class, produces paralysis whether the eyes are
open or closed. The minor degradation would seem to permit of the
kinaesthetic centres being roused by a slightly stronger stimulus
coming to them from the visual centres of a person whose eyes are
open, though they are no longer capable of being roused by the
hypothetically weaker stimulus coming from the visual centres of a
person whose eyes are closed.
                                             — It is into this category that, in
    (£i.) Spinal Functional Defects.
my opinion, the forms of paralysis fall that have been produced by
Drs. Mott and Sherrington as a result of section of all the sensory
roots of a limb.
   We have been long familiar with forms of paralysis due to struc
tural lesions affecting the great ganglion cells in the anterior cornua
of the cord ; those, for instance, due to polio-myelitis or to focal
lesions of different kinds involving the anterior cornua.
    Three years ago, moreover,           I gave reasons for believing that there
are   cases    of  functional      paralysis  of spinal type, due to defects in
these same regions of the spinal cord (examples of which were
recorded), that ought to be distinctly separated from those of cerebral
origin commonly known as
                                       " hysterical.
                                                     "J We have now, as am    I
inclined to maintain, in the experiments of Drs. Mott and Sherrington,
an experimental proof of the existence of one of these forms of
functional paralysis of spinal origin.

centres (interfering with volition), we have here a lowered functional

activity in the motor centres themselves situated in the spin al cord
by reason of which their molecular activity is so altered that they are
no longer capable of responding to ordinary volitional stimuli coming
from the cerebral cortex.        This, at least, is the explanation that I
would suggest, instead of supposing, as the authors do, that volitional
power itself
                " has been
                             absolutely abolished by the local loss of all
                       "
forms of sensibility in the paralysed limbs.
     As I  have already stated, a local loss of all forms of sensibility
caused hy a lesion in the brain in the region of the internal capsule
causes no such paralysis.         There is therefore no ground for sup
posing that the animal's power of willing is interfered with by section
of all the posterior roots coming from the limbs ; while, on the other
hand, all the details furnished by Drs. Mott and Sherrington are
quite in harmony with the interpretation that the animal's ordinary
will power is unable to excite the spinal motor centres to action
when their molecular condition has been altered by cutting off all the
different stimuli proceeding to the corresponding region of the cord.
 The immediate result of this may be presumed to be a lowering of
the habitual sub-activity of the motor centres upon which the con
 dition of tonus in the muscles depends.
     The fact that the results are produced only when all the sensory
 roots are cut, and that
                              " the defect in motility increases from the
 attached base to the free apex of the limb," so that
                                                          " the independent
 and more delicately adjusted movements which employ preponderantly
 the smaller and more individualised muscular masses of the hand and
 foot
       " are those which are most severely   affected or abolished, although
 they may appear confirmatory of the interpretation of Drs. Mott and
 Sherrington, are, in fact, no less in accordance with that here given.
 This will be seen to be so if we bear in mind the overlapping of the
 fields of distribution of the sensory roots in the spinal cord (as shown
 by Sherrington), and the fact that the most delicate stimuli going to
 the smaller muscles might be expected to be those which would prove
 most impotent to rouse the sluggish spinal centres into activity. Again,
  when the authors say : " We find, however, that forcible and rapid
 movements, even of the fine joints at the end of the limb, can be
                                                    '
  induced in the animals by causing them to struggle ;' for instance,
  while recovering from ether inhalation or while trying to free them
  selves on being held awkwardly, the whole limb at all its joints may
  exhibit movements," we have facts quite compatible with my inter
  pretation.    Muscles may not respond to ordinary volitional stimuli,
  and yet may respond when the stimulus is strengthened under the
  influence of emotion. In a similar manner may we explain the fact
  that when the kinaesthetic centres corresponding with an apaesthete
   limb are stimulated by electricity, movements of the previously
   paralysed limb are produced just as easily as they are in a normal
                                                                   I 2

limb.*      Such results may, as the authors say, be considered to point
to the " profound difference between the production of the fine move
ments of the limb in volition, on the one hand, and by experimental
stimulation of the cortex, on the other."    This explanation is as valid
for the one as for the other interpretation.
   The stimulation by electricity may, and probably does, involve a
very different kind of stimulus from that which normally emanates
from the cortex during a voluntary act, and how subtle are the
differences that exist between the conditions leading to paralysis or
not in different instances may be judged from the functional cases of
paralysis of cerebral origin, previously referred to, in which there
may be in the same person, in immediately successive periods, com
plete paralysis of the limb so long as the eyes are closed, and no such
paralysis when the eyes are opened.
   What has been said above shows, moreover, how much removed we
are from the position assumed to be true about twenty years ago,t
when centres " immediately concerned in effecting volitional move
ments" were considered to be " as such truly motor."

     In
      my paper on the hippocampus, published in the Philosophical
Transactions of the Royal Society for 1893 (vol. 184, B, pp. 389—429),
I stated as a subsidiary conclusion, resulting from my investigation of
the brains of marine mammals, that " there is no reason for associating
the fascia dentata with the striae longitudinales (nervus Lancisii),
gyrus supracallosalis, and gyrus geniculi, or for supposing that all
these four structures belong to a single organ, which forms a part of
the cortical centre for the sense of smell."
   This conclusion was based upon the following observations : — A. In
     * This factshows that the cutting off of the afferent impressions by section of
the sensory roots does not entail a lowered excitability of the kin-sthetic centres
in the cortex, but rather the reverse, if we look to the really lowered activity in
the spinal centres which the absence of tonus implies.     In the ease of complete
cerebral hemianffisthesia, however, there   is,
                                            over and above the absence of any such
lowered activity of the spinal centres, another important difference between the
conditions existing and those which obtain in the experiments of Drs. Hott and
Sherrington, viz., no cutting off of cerebellar influence, so that the activity of the
cortex and of the sub-cortical centres       less interfered with.

tend,  I  think, to explain the presence of paralysis with section of the posterior
roots, and its absence with cerebral hemian-sthesia.      (May  4, 1895.)

certain aquatic mammals completely destitute of olfactory apparatus,
e.g., Hyperoodon (bottle-nosed whale), the stria longitudinalis lateralis
is present in its usual form, and enlarges anteriorly into supra-callosal
and geniculate convolutions, which are unusually distinct, although
minute.     B. In megosmatic animals the fascia dentata is continued
far beneath the corpus callosum, and only ceases to accompany the
fimbria where this body turns downwards in the anterior pillar of the
fornix.    C. Coronal sections carried through the back of the corpus
callosum of an ox-brain revealed no trace of a recurrent fascia
dentata.     On these grounds     I  assumed that the fascia dentata is a
sub-callosal structure.     In this conclusion  I was, however, completely
mistaken, as investigations in progress at the time when my paper on
the hippocampus went to press have clearly proved.
    The fascia dentata is continued on to the dorsal surface of the corpus
 callosum.
    A series of sections carried through the corpus callosum with the
 underlying fimbria and fascia dentata, in the brain of a cat, show that,
 just as the fornix is turning downwards in its anterior pillar, the
 fascia dentata is folded on itself, and retraces its course back towards
 the splenium corporis callosi, almost along the middle line of the
 brain.   In this folding the trough of fascia dentata, into which the
 pyramidal cells of the margin of the cortex are received, remains
 open dorsally ; at the fold the margins of the trough are slanted some
 what forwards.
    A coronal section taken a short distance behind the fold (fig. A)
 shows the fascia dentata cut twice.       On the outer side it is large and
 well-developed ; on the mesial side the recurrent fascia is small and
 narrow.     Between the two parts of this folded ribbon is pushed a
 rounded tubercle of cortex (callosal convolution of Zuckerkandl),
  which is continuous with the gyrus fornicatus.
    Slightly farther back the trough of fascia dentata is rednced
 to a curved plate (fig. B). This extends but a little way, for,
 at about half the distance between the folding of the fascia
 dentata and the splenium corporis callosi, the stratum granulosum,
  which has invested the margin of the cortex from the temporal
 extremity of the hiatus ventriculi to this point, comes to an end.
  Near the splenium the layer of pyramidal cells which represents the
  general cortex is reduced to a fold with a bevelled edge, and no indi
  cations of its retaining in its tissue any remnants of the characteristic
  granule layer of the fascia dentata are to be seen. My sections
  through the corpus callosum of the ox were not carried sufficiently
  far forward.
     In a certain number of human brains the continuity of fascia
  dentata and stria longitudinalis through the medium of an interven
  ing band, the fasciola cinerea, may be seen very distinctly.

mesial stria is the continuation of the fasciola cinerea, while the
lateral stria belongs to the circumcallosal convolution, which is
 destroyed in most parts, although it may be developed in front into
gyrus geniculatus, above into gyrus supracallosalis, and behind into
gyrus callosalis (or sub-splenialis).             It is, however, very difficult
to follow the atrophied fascia dentata and circumcallosal convolutions
through the indusium griseum which clothes the back of the splenium,
and I prefer to wait for a brain in which these foetal structures may
cbance to be unusually well-developed, before expressing a decided
opinion as to their homology.

rate of change per unit of sulphate per unit of iodide is constant
when an unit volume contains quantities of sulphate ranging from 45
to 515 iPSO4.* This increment is again constant for the range 515
to 762 iFSO4, but has a higher value.                       For quantities of sulphate
greater than 762 H2 SO1 this increment, which again becomes con
stant, is further increased in value. The explanation given of this
discontinuity in the successive values of the increment, is that the
gradual addition of the sulphate to the water gives rise to the gradual
formation of one hydrate at the expense of another, and the increment
per unit of sulphate is the resultant of the increment per unit of each
of the hydrates.
    For the range 515 to 762 H2SOl the hydrate which is decreasing,
is H2S04, 106 IPO, and the hydrate which is increasing, is H2S04,
71   H20.

    Theoretically the rate 1230 x 10-6 is the rate with water and
hydrogen iodide only, present in amounts per cubic centimetre
55400 H20, 1HI.            The increments per unit of hydrogen sulphate
are in the three cases 18-1, 22-4, and 26-5 millionths.
    When the medium consists of water, hydrogen iodide, and hydro
gen sulphate, and the ratio of the numbers of WSOl and HI falls
below 20, the rate with unit of HI has a value different from 1230 x
10-*; but the value of the increment per unit of sulphate is the same
for the range of numbers of IPSO4 from 45 to 515.
                           Variation of Hydrogen Chloride.
    It  is shown from the results of one set of experiments at a tem
perature of 30° that the increment in the value of the rate of change
per unit of chloride per unit of iodide is constant when a cubic
centimetre contains 14 HI, and quantities of chloride ranging from 70
to 280 HCl, the value of the increment being 16-8 x 10-6. An examina

 upon temperature, and of the experiments recorded in a previous
 paper, made to determine the law of variation of the rate of change
 with iodide, shows that when the ratio of the numbers of HCl and         HI
 is higher than it is in the set quoted above, the value of the increment
 per unit of chloride per unit of iodide falls to 16-2 X 10-6. This lower
 value is the same for values of the number of HCl, ranging from 190
 to 547, and for values of the ratio of the numbers of HCl and HI,
 ranging from 20 to 210.
     The formulas for a in these two cases in a solution containing in
 1 c.c. 1 HI and c HCI are at a temperature of 30°,

                                Variation of Iodide.
    It was shown     in a previous paper that when quantities of iodide
 are introduced   into  the medium sufficiently small in amount, in com
 parison with other substances not participating directly in the
reaction, the rate of chemical change varied directly with the amount
 of iodide. It was conjectured that when the amount of iodide is
 large enough to modify considerably the character of the medium, it
 would have the same kind of effect upon the reaction as hydrogen
sulphate and hydrogen chloride. It is now shown that the increment
of the rate per unit of hydrogen iodide per unit of iodide is 19-4 x 10-*
at a temperature of 30°, the rate with 1        HI   at the same temperatur-
being   1210  x 10~*.   The    formula  for the rate  with  iHI is
                         ec — l{l210 + 19-4(2 — l)}l0-e.
    It will  be observed      that the actual rate with unit of hydrogen
iodide in a medium consisting of water and hydrogen iodide is
approximately the same as the theoretical rate with unit of iodide in
a medium consisting of water, hydrogen iodide, and either hydrogen
sulphate or hydrogen chloride when the ratio of the numbers of
H2S04 and      HI  and of the numbers of HCl and           HI exceeds 20. It
has been shown above that this rate is 1230         x 10-6.
                 Variation of Sodium Hydrogen Carbonate.
    In  a medium     consisting mainly of water and sodium hydrogen
carbonate the increment of the rate per unit of NaHCO3 per unit of
iodide is 40 x 10-5 at a temperature of 15°, the formula for the rate
with 8\59 Nal and quantities of the carbonate ranging from 25 NaHCO*
to 227 NaHCO', being at this temperature

   The rate with    1 Nal and      bNaHCO3 is
                                  a =  (155 + 40 6) 10-6,
  so that the theoretical rate     with  1 Nal only, in this medium,  is 155 x 10-6
  at a temperature of 15°. At the same temperature the actual rate
  with 1  HI    in a medium consisting of water and hydrogen iodide is
  356 x 10~*, a rate more than twice as great as the corresponding rate
   with the neutral iodide. The increment of the rate per unit of
  carbonate per unit of iodide is more that four times the highest
  increment per unit of sulphate per unit of iodide at the temperature
  of 15°.
  Variation of Potassium Iodiile, Sodium Iodide, and Sodium Chloride, in
     a  medium      consisting    mainly      of  Water   and Sodium     Hydrogen
     Carbonate.
     In this medium at a temperature of 15°, the increments of the rate
  per unit of these substances per unit of iodide are (1) for the range
  10  KI   to 30 KI, 415 X 10~6; (2) for the range 10 Nal to 30 Nal,
  4-84 x 10-6 ; (3) for the range 1 NaCl to 14 NaCl, 27-7 x 10-6. In this
  medium sodium chloride has a considerable effect on the rate, but in
  a medium consisting of water and hydrogen chloride its effect is
  almost nil.
     General Conclusion as      to the effect  of the Medium upon  the reaction.
     Each constituent of the medium produces an effect on the rate of
  change of unit peroxide and unit iodide, proportional to the mass,
  and varying with the nature of the constituent.              The increment of
 this rate per unit mass of each constituent is constant so long as the
 quantity of the predominant constituent present in the medium is
 sufficiently large, in comparison with the other constituents of the
 medium, to render the media in successive experiments practically
 homogeneous. For example, when the ratio of the numbers of H'SO1
 and HI in the medium exceeds 20 the formula for the rate at a given
 temperature is
                              a — i{a + b(i—     l) +ds},
 a  being the theoretical rate with unit of HI, b the increment per unit
of hydrogen iodide per unit of iodide, and d the increment per unit of
hydrogen sulphate per unit of iodide. If the ratio falls below 20 the
formula is
                             a = i{a + b'(i— l) + d's],
in which 6' and d' depend upon the relative masses of sulphate and
iodide present in the medium.

 112      Condititions   of Chemical Change and its Amount.     [May 9,
                          Variation of Temperature.
    The discussion of the numerous experiments made at temperatures
 ranging from 0° to 50°, in media in which the quantities of iodide
 range from 3-64 HI, to 23 HI, the quantities of hydrogen sulphate
from 45 H'SO1 to 468 IPSO4, and the quantities of hydrogen chloride
from 70 HCl to 547 HCl, leads to the following law of connexion
between chemical change and temperature.
   If «! is the rate of chemical change at a temperature t° in a homo
geneous medium consisting of given constituents per unit volume,
and a3 is the rate at a temperature t° in the same medium, the ratio
of «i to *i is {(273 + i1)/(273 + ia)}"'. m being a constant depending
upon the character of the constituents of the medium. When the
temperatures are measured from the absolute zero —273°, and ar-
denoted by Ti, Ta, the formula assumes the simpler form,
                               «,/«r= (T./T<)-.
The constancy of the value of m for a particular medium is secured
when the quantity of the predominant constituent of the medium is
sufficiently large in comparison with the quantities of the other con
stituents to make the medium practically homogeneous.         When this
is not the case    to has some value intermediate to the values which it
has when one or other of the constituents is sufficiently predominant
to secure a constant value.
   In media in which hydrogen sulphate is sufficiently predominant,
the value of to is 20-38 ; similarly for hydrogen chloride the value of
to is 21-17.     When the medium consists of water and hydrogen
iodide, the value of m is 24-l. The introduction of sodium sulphate
in large quantity into a medium otherwise consisting mainly of
hydrogen sulphate reduces the value of to from 20-38 to 18-1. In
a medium in which the main ingredient is sodium hydrogen carbo
nate, the value of to is approximately 10.
   A further   confirmation   of the law of connexion between chemical
change and temperature is obtained from the discussion of experi
ments on the rate of change of hydrogen chlorate and potassium
iodide made by W. H. Pendlebury and M. Seward.          The value of to
is in the case of this chemical change 40-5.
   It follows from the law enunciated above that at the temperature
of absolute zero no chemical change can take place.
   If the smallest value of m, viz., 10, is taken, a chemical change
which is completed in one minute at a temperature zero, would
require for its completion at a temperature of —200° a little more
than a year. If 20 is taken as the value of m, the minute would be
increased to more than half a million of years by the same reduction
of temperature.

      The law enunciated above may also be stated in the following
  form.
     The increment of each unit of chemical change due to a rise of
  temperature varies as the increment of each unit of absolute tempe
  rature.
     This law is expressed by the formula

 which is given in an appendix to the paper. These equations are
 employed to interpret the results of experiments published by Dr.
 Gladstone in the Transactions of the Royal Society (' Phil. Trans., '
 vol. 145). They had been previously applied to the case of chemical
equilibrium investigated by Professor Dixon in a paper published in
 vol. 175 of the Transactions of the Royal Society, the reactions in
 that case being
                            H20 + CO =H2 + C02,

I. " On the new Gas obtained from Uraninite. Second Note."
       By J. Nobman Lockyer, C.B., F.R.S. Received May 8,
        1895.
    Since   my   communication on the gas obtained from uraninite
 (broggerite)   was sent into the Society, on the 25th ultimo,           I have
 been employing the method          I  there referred to in several directions,
among them to determine whether the spectrum of tho gas indicates
a simple or a complex origin.
    I  was led to make this special inquiry on account of the difference
in the frequency of the appearance of D3 and the other lines to which
I referred in the previous communication in the solar chromosphere.
For instance, if we take the lines D3, 4471, and 4302, the frequencies
are as follows, according to Young* : —

 Hence we might be justified in supposing that D3 and 4471 are pro
 duced by the same gas, while it was probable that 4302 owed its
 origin to a different one.
    But further experiment has given me one case in which D3 shows
 bright, while 4471 is entirely absent.      I may now add that an equally
 important line to 4471, one at 4026-5, with the dispersion em
 ployed, appears in the spectrum of broggerite, and both these lines
 are wide and fluffy, like the lines of hydrogen, and are apparently
 reversed.
    The line 4026-5 has not been recorded by Young, though, as hav-  I
 stated, the frequency of appearances of 4471 represents the maximum ;
 still, while this is so, the intensity of both these lines in the spectra
 of the hottest stars is not surpassed even by those of hydrogen.
 Hence, opinion as to their representing the same gas must be sus
 pended.
   Further,   I have photographed a line at 4388, apparently coincident
 with another important line in the same stars. Whether coming
from one source or two, in these three lines seen along with D3 in the
gas obtained by me from broggerite, we have, it would seem, run
home the most important lines in the spectra of stars of Group III,
in which stars alone we find D3 reversed. Should these results b-
confirmed, the importance of the gas or gases they represent, at a
certain stage of the evolution of suns and planets, will be gathered
from the photograph of Bellatrix, accompanying the following Third
Note.
   Another case is afforded by a line a X 667 ; this is associated with
D3 in broggerite and cleveite, but the yellow line has been seen in
monazite without X 667. It is almost certain, then, that these two
lines represent two gases.     Certainty cannot be arrived at till a larger
quantity of gas has been obtained.
   Again the red line at X 6575, close to C, referred to in my previous
communication, is seen both in gummite and broggerite, but in on-
case (gummite) it is seen without D3, and in the other with it ; in
one case (broggerite) without X614, and in the other with it. The
above conclusions hold here also.
   This line X 614, possibly coincident with a chromospheric line, has
been recorded in gummite and broggerite.         It has been seen with
(iu broggerite) and without it (in gummite).
   I have said enough to indicate that the preliminary reconnaissance
suggests that the gas obtained from broggerite,        by my method,     is
one of complex origin.

   I now  proceed to show that the same conclusion holds good for the
gases  obtained  by Professors Ramsay and Cleve from cleveite.
   For this purpose, as the final measures of the lines of the gas as
obtained from cleveite by Professors Ramsay and Cleve have not yet
been published, I take those given by Crookes,* and Cleve, t as observed
by Thalen. These are as follows, omitting the yellow line : —

   The most definite and striking result so far obtained is that in the
                                                         I
spectra of the minerals giving the yellow line have so far examined,
I have never once seen the lines recorded by Crookes and Thalen in
the blue.    This demonstrates that the gas obtained from certain
specimens of cleveite by chemical methods is vastly different from
that obtained by my method from certain specimens of broggerite,
and since, from the point of view of the blue lines, the spectrum of
the gas obtained from cleveite is more complex than that of broggerite,
the gas itself cannot be more simple.
   Even the blue lines themselves, instead of appearing en bloc, vary
enormously in the sun, the appearances being —
                          4922 (4921-3)      =   30 times.
                          4713 (4712-5)      = twice.
  These are not the only facts which can be adduced to suggest that
the gas from cleveite is as complex as that from broggerite, but
while, on the one hand, the simple nature of the gases obtained by
Professors Ramsay and Cleve, and by myself, must be given up,
reasoning on spectroscopic lines, the observations              I have already
made on several minerals indicate that the gases composing the
mixtures are by no means the only ones we may hope to obtain.
   This part of the inquiry will be more specially considered in a
subsequent communication.

impossible.      The wave-lengths therefore, especially in the visible
spectrum, are approximations only ; but the view that we are really
dealing with gases operative in the solar atmosphere, like the helium
which produces D3, is strengthened by the fact that of the sixty
lines so far recorded as new in the various minerals examined, about
half occur near the wave-lengths assigned to chromospheric lines in
 Young's table. T am aware that most of the chromospheric lines have
been recently referred to as due to iron,* but              I  believe this result
does not depend upon direct comparisons, and it is entirely opposed
to the conclusions to be drawn from the work of the Italian observers,
as   well as from my own.
 II. " On    the new Gas obtained from Uraninite. Third Note."
       By J. Nobman Lockyeb, C.B., F.R.S. Received May 9,
       1895.
    In my preliminary note communicated            to the   Royal Society on the
25th ult.,     I  gave the wave-lengths of the lines which had been
observed both at reduced and at atmpspheric pressure in the gas (or
 gases) produced by the method to which             I  then referred of heating
the uraninite mineral (broggerite) in vacuo.
    As a short title in future, I shall term this the distillation method.
    Since then the various photographs obtained have been reduced,
and the wave-lengths of the lines in the structure spectrum of
 hydrogen observed beyond the region mapped by Hasselberg.                     I have
 further observed the spectra of other minerals besides uraninite for
the purpose of determining whether any of them gave lines indicating
the presence of the gas in uraninite or of other gases.
    I now give a table of the lines so far measured in the spectra of
eighteen minerals between XX 3889 and 4580 (Rowland), the region
in which, with the plates employed, the photographic action is most
intense.
    On this table   I  may remark that of the lines given in my paper of
April 25, the final discussion has shown that the following lines are
hydrogen structure-lines          in the region beyond that mapped by
 Hasselberg,    XX 4479,    4196,  4156, and 4152-5.      The line 4368 is also
omitted from this list as it has not been finally determined whether
it coincides with a line of oxygen.
    In the table, besides the wave-lengths on Angstrom's and Row
land's scale, 1 give lines which have been observed in the sun's

not of two or three, but of many of the lines which so far have been
classed as
             " unknown " by students both of solar and stellar chem
istry, and, if this be confirmed, we are evidently in the presence of a
new order of gases of the highest importance to celestial chemistry,
though perhaps they may be of small practical value to chemists,
because their compounds and associated elements are for the most
part hidden deep in the earth's interior.
   The facts that all the old terrestrial gases, with the exception of
hydrogen, are spectroscopically invisible in the sun and stars — though
they doubtless exist there — and that these new gases, scarcely yet

glimpsed, have already in all probability supplied us with many
points of contact between our own planet and the hottest part of our
central luminary that we can get at, and stars like Bellatrix, are full
of hope for the future, not only in relation to the possibility of more
closely correlating celestial and terrestrial phenomena, but in indi
cating that terrestrial chemistry, founded on low density surface pro
ducts in which non-solar gases largely enter, is capable of almost
infinite expansion when the actions and reactions of the new order of
gases, almost, it may be said, of paramount importance in certain
stages of stellar evolution, shall have been completely studied. With
regard to the differences indicated between the results of the
chromospheric and eclipse observations in the above table, it may
be useful to remark that Professor Young's " frequencies," invaluable
though they are, must necessarily be of less importance from the
present point of view than the eclipse observations obtained, it may
alnfost be said, at the same instant of time. There may be, and
doubtless are, two perfectly distinct causes for the appearance of the
so-called chromospheric lines. First, the tranquil condition of the
lower strata of the sun's atmosphere, which gives us the pure spectrum
 produced at a constant — and the highest that we know of in the sun
— temperature. Secondly, the disturbed condition which fills the
spectrum with lines of a so-called prominence.                 Formerly it was
universally imagined that the prominences were shot up from below,
and, in that case, the lines added would indicate a temperature
 higher than the normal.        But    I  have sent many papers in to the
 Society indicating the many arguments against this view,* and to me
at the present time this view is almost unthinkable.                If these dis
turbance lines are produced from above, they may represent the effect
of many stages of lower temperature.                Hence a list of chromo
spheric lines loses most of its value, unless the conditions of each
observation are stated, and the phenomena appearing at the same
place at the same instant of time are recorded.
   Now this same place and same time condition is perfectly met by
eclipse photographs, and hence         I  attach a great value to them ; but
 the comparison between such eclipse observations and the spectra of
certain stars indicates that the latter afford the best criteria of all.

                                          Chemistry of the Sun,' which I published
in 1887.

III. "Action        du Fluor sur l'Argon." By M. Henbi Moissan.
       Communicated by Professor Ramsay, F.R.S.                     Received
       May     9, 1895.
    La belle découverte de l'argon par Lord Rayleigh et M. Ramsay
vient de nous démontrer que les corps gazèux, comme les corps solides
que nous rencontrons dans la nature, peuvent renfermer en très petites
quantités des éléments ignorés jusqu'ici. Ce gaz argon présente d-
plus un caractère tout spécial, car son activité chimique est à pea
près nulle. Ce sont ses proprietés physiques qui en ont permis la
recherche, la préparation et l'étude.
   M. Ramsay ayant eu la complaisance de me confier 100 cm. d-
cet argon pour essayer de le combiner an fluor, j'ai pu faire sur c-
nouveau gaz quelques essais que je rapporterai brièvement.
    Depuis plusieurs années j'ai eu l'occasion d'étudier plusieurs corps
simples qui dans des conditions de température déterminée se com
binent à l'azote avec une grande énergie. Tels sont, en particulier,         l-
bore et le titane.
    J'ai chauffé du titane aussi pur que possible dans une atmosphèr-
d'argon à la température de ramollissement du verre ordinaire, et
après 30 minutes de chauffe il n'y a pas eu de diminution de volume,
par conséquent, pas de combinaison vraisemblable.            Le titane n'avait
pas changé d'aspect.
    Le bore pur préparé par le magnésium chauffé dans une cloche
courbe de verre de Bohème ne s'est pas davantage combiné à l'argon,
tandis que dans les mêmes conditions, il s'unit à l'azote pour donner
l-azoture de bore solide.
    Cet argon chauffé en présence de lithium* ne diminue pas de
volume, et l'on sait que dans ces conditions, l'azote fournit rapidement
un azoture solide de lithium ainsi que M. Ouvrard l'a démontré.f
    La curieuse décomposition de la clèveite par l'acide sulfuriquc
m'a amené à rechercher si l'uraninm n'aurait pas d'action sur l'argon.
Un volume d'argon mesuré sur la cuve à mercure a été chauffé dans
une petite cloche courbe en verre ordinaire eu présence de plusieurs
fragments d'uranium.          Après vingt minutes de chauffe, le volnme
gazeux n'a pas été modifié. Cet uranium avait été préparé au four
électrique et renfermait 3-9 pour cent de carbone.
    Pour étudier l'action du fluor sur ce nouveau corps simple, je me
suis servi de l'appareil suivant : —
   *  Je dois ce lithium métallique à l'obligeance de M. Guntz. Ce métal a été
 préparé par le procédé d'electroljse indiqué par ce savant.

  1895.]                 Action du Fluor *ur V Argon.                          121
     Un cylindre      de platine   de  10 cm.   de longueur      et de   2 cm.   de
 diamètre      est  fermé par deux montures metalliques portant des
 disques de fluorine transparente, à faces parallèles.              Latéralement
 deux petits tubes en platine peuvent amener l'un               du   fluor, l'autre
 de l'argon.      Ces deux tubes de platine se trouvent en face l'un de
 l'autre.    Un troisième tube placé à l'extrémité du cylindre laisse
 écouler    le  mélange gazeux.        De petits robinets métalliques per
 mettent de fermer l'appareil, sans cependant pouvoir exercer une
 pression un peu forte. Enfin une tige métallique isolée par la lame
 transparente de fluorine qu'elle traverse, permet de fairo jaillir à
 l'intérieur, l'étincelle d'une bobine d'induction.
     Les montures métalliques qui contiennent les disques de fluorine
 transparente ainsi que les extrémités des tubes sont serrées au moyen
 d'écrous qui écrasent une petite couronne de plomb placée sur le
 rebord des deux tubes à réunir.
     Ce tube séché avec soin a été placé à la suite de l'appareil* qui
                                                                      '
 m'a servi à préparer le fluor pur et qui a été décrit aux Annales de
 Chimie et de Physique,' 6e série, Tome xxiii.
     On a balayé tout l'air qui se trouvait dans le cylindre de platine en
y faisant passer trois ou quatre litres de fluor, et l'on fait arriver par
l'autre petit tube de platine le gaz argon déplacé lentement par du
 mercure au moyen d'une petite cloche à robinet. Lorsque le courant
très lent de gaz argon est arrivé dans l'atmosphère de fluor aucun
 phénomène visible ne s'est produit.            En tenant le tube dans les
doigts on n'a ressenti aucun changement de température.
     Dans ce mélange d'argon et de fluor on a fait jaillir l'étincelle
électrique qui n'a pas produit de réaction sensible.                        t
     L'expérience a été recommencée deux fois de façon à faire varier
la proportion d'argon, et les résultats ont été aussi négatifs.
     La difficulté de manier le fluor ne nous a pas permis de reconnaitre
si par l'action d'une série d'étincelles il y aurait eu à la longue un
changement de volume.
     La conclusion que nous pouvons tirer de ces expériences est la
suivante : —
    À la température ordinaire ou sous l'action d'une étincelle d'induc
tion un mélange de fluor et d'argon n'entre pas en combinaison.
    * L'appareil producteur  de fluor était muni d'un petit réfrigérant et de deux
tubes à fluorure de sodium.

       Professor of Mechanism and Applied Mechanics in the
       University of Cambridge.         Received April 24, 1895.
    Many forms of "extensometer" have been devised for measuring
the  small strains of extension or compression which precede yielding
in materials subjected to stress by direct pull or push.      Such instru
ments are employed, in the testing of metals,            for determining
Young's modulus and for observing the behaviour of the material as
the limit of elasticity is passed.       Apparatus of the same general
kind has also been applied to examine the strains produced in the
members of bridges and other structures by the application           of load
to the structure as a whole ; the amount of stress in any member
being in that case inferred from observation of the strain.      Professor
Unwin, who has himself designed more than one form of extenso
meter, has described in his work on the ' Testing of Materials of
                '
Construction      a number of instruments of this class, and has pointed
ont that a first condition of accuracy is that the measurements of
extension be made on both of two sides of the piece, in such a way
that a mean is obtained representing the extension of a central line.
In practice, a rod always bends more or less on being pulled.          Even
when the rod is initially straight the pull is rarely, if ever, so sym
metrically applied or the elasticity so uniform as to make the exten
 sion equal  at all parts of the section.   Hence, to avoid errors which
would be great relative to the quantity under examination,               the
extensometer must be arranged in such a fashion that its indications
depend only on the change of distance between two points on the-
axis of the rod, and are independent of those inequalities which are
 found to exist in the strains as measured on the surface.              The
 condition is met either by taking two separate observations of the
 strain on  two sides of the rod and averaging the two, or by making

  the extensometer itself indicate a mean strain.     Banschinger's appa
  ratus, in which two mirrors are used to indicate separately the
  strains on opposite sides of the rod, is an example of the first
  method.     Professor Unwin's extensometer, in which the rod is
  grasped by a pair of clips at the extremities of two parallel
  diameters, the change of distance between the clips being measured,
  in an example of the other.
     The object of the present paper is to describe an instrument of the
  same class, but embodying some novel features, and to mention a
  few results that have been obtained by its means.
     The instrument is self-contained, is entirely supported by the rod
  under test, and touches the rod only at the points where the clips are
  attached — a feature which is of advantage in view of the tendency
  the rod has to bend.    The principle of the construction will be seen

the piece under test, the two pieces B and C are attached each by a
pair of set screws. Each of these pieces has, separately, one degree of
freedom with respect to the rod, namely, freedom to rotate about the
axis of its set screws. Hence, B has two degrees of freedom re la

 18i)5.]   Strains in the Testing of Materials and Structures.             125
tively to C, so long as the two are not otherwise connected.          But the
piece B has fixed to it an ami B', which ends in a rounded point P, and
this point gears in a \/-slot cut transversely across the end of the piece
C      The contact of P with the two sides of this slot removes the two
degrees of freedom which B would otherwise have relatively to C,
and makes the position of the pieces definite.            Then, when the rod
extends, the point P acts as a fulcrum, and the opposite end of C,
namely, Q, moves down through a distance proportional to the mean
displacement of the two pairs of set screws. The displacement of Q
 is a multiple of the strain, in the ratio of PQ to OQ.              This dis
placement     is measured    by   means  of a microscope, which hangs from
B and sights an object at Q. The strains to be observed are so
small that it is easy, without making the piece C inconveniently
long, to prevent its angular movement from becoming sufficient to
prove troublesome or to affect the accuracy of the indications.            The
arm B', which carries the point P, must be so attached to B that, as
regards oscillation about the set-screws of B, the two pieces B and
B- move as a rigid whole.           But B' may be flexible in the direction
which would give P motion at right angles to the plane of the paper,
and by giving it flexibility of this kind (while preserving its rigidity
as regards motion in the plane of the paper) the point P may be
made to gear in a hole instead of a slot in C.             There is a practical
advantage     in doing  this,  for if P gears in a slot any unequal extension
of the front and back of the specimen makes P work along the slot,
and it is difficult to secure that no error will result in consequence of
the slot not being perfectly parallel to the axes of the set-screws.
This consideration has led the author. to adopt the plan of putting a
transverse joint between the pieces B and B', with the object of
giving P freedom to adjust itself to a hole (instead of a slot) in C, by
movement about this joint in a direction perpendicular to the plane
of the sketch.       Incidently, such a joint has the further advantage
that it allows the whole apparatus to be more conveniently and
 quickly applied to the rod under examination.
     The displacement of Q due to the strain is measured by means of
 a micrometer in the eye-piece of the microscope.               A micrometer
 scale engraved     on  glass   is convenient for the purpose, and by esti
  mating  tenths   of a division   on such a scale readings are readily taken
 which correspond to Ta^o6 of an inch of extension on the part of
 the specimen,      with an objective which allows the whole of the
 elastic extension to occur without displacing Q beyond the field of
  view.
     There is a fine screw with a divided head between B' and the point
  P.   This serves to bring Q into a convenient position for sighting,
  and also to determine what is the absolute amount of extension corre
  sponding to a division of the eye-piece scale.        Should a strain occur

126      Prof. J. A. E wing.    On Measurements   of small   [May  16,
exceeding the range of the eye-piece scale, Q is brought back into the
field of view by turning P through a distance which is observed by
means of a divided head.

   Fig. 2 is a view of the complete instrument, taken from a photo
graph.    The clips B and C are in this instance set at 8 inches apart,
and B is jointed to B' by a transverse joint, giving P freedom to
accommodate itself to a hole in C. The joint between B and B
consists of two upright pins fixed in B, one of which presses up into
a hole and the other into a slot in B', the line of this hole and slot
being perpendicular to the axis of the set-screws by which the clip is
attached to the rod under test.    Hence, so far as movement about
the axis of the set-screws    is concerned, B and B' act as a rigid
whole. This movement is prevented by the gearing of P in the hole
in the lower clip C. The piece B' is a frame consisting of two

    1895.]    Strains in the Testing of Materials and Structures.        127
   parallel steel rods united by a cross-bar at top and bottom, and carry
   ing, besides the screw P, the microscope, which is hinged to B' about
   the point E vertically above Q, and is provided with a focussing
   screw at F.     The counterpoise D, which is also attached to the piece
   B', serves to balance the weight of the microscope and make the
   pressure vertical between P and the hole into which it gears.       There
   is a supplementary counterpoise D' for adjusting the balance about
   the axis of the joint between B and B'.        These counterpoises are
   adjusted   until  when the heavy end (Q) of C is raised, so that P
   ceases to be in gear with C, P has no tendency to move in any
   direction.    The excess of weight on the right hand side of C suffices
  to produce the requisite pressure at the point P.         The frame BB'
  with the microscope may be lifted off, leaving only the two clips
  attached to the rod.
     The object sighted is one side of a wire stretched horizontally
  across a hole in a plate at Q, and illuminated by a small mirror
  behind.     The. distances OP and OQ are in this instance equal, with
  the effect that the movement of Q is double the extension of the rod.
  The eye-piece scale aud the length of the microscope are chosen so
  that the numbers read on the scale correspond to ,0ouo of an inch of
_ extension.     This adjustment is tested by turning the screw P, which
  has a pitch of -Jg inch, through one revolution, and observing that
  the displacement of Q is 500 units of the eye-piece scale.          In the
  instrument illustrated in fig. 2 the whole scale comprises 1,400 units,
  and calibration tests show that throughout the middle 1,200 of them
  the proportionality of the scale readings with the real movements of
  Q is practically perfect.
     To facilitate the application of the apparatns to any rod a clamp or
  distance piece, H (fig. 3), is added by which the two clips, B aud C,
  may be held at the right d istance apart, and with the axes of their
  set screws parallel.     This makes it in many cases unnecessary to
  prepare the rod beforehand by punching or drilling holes for points
  of the set screws ; the clamp is readily held so that the clips stand
  fairly round the rod ; the set screws are advanced to grip the rod, and
  the clamp is then removed by releasing the screws, GG.           The con
  nection of the clamp to each of the clips is by means of three points
  gearing with a hole, slot, and plane. The clamp is specially con
  venient when the strain of the specimen has been carried beyond
  the elastic limit, and it is desired immediately to reset the clips to the
  standard distance apart after the length between them has been
  materially changed by the permanent extension of the specimen.
     Another form of the apparatus designed for use on the members of
  actual structures, is shown in fig. 4.   There are essentially the same
  parts, but the arrangement is altered in order to make all the appa
  ratus lie on one side of the piece under examination — a desirable and

often necessary condition in the application of the instrument to such
pieces as the girder flanges.    The clips are (as in Professor Unwin's
extensometer) adjustable to wide or narrow bars. The pieces B and C
engage by means of a screw-point in a hole, the necessary pressure
being supplied by springs, with the effect that the apparatus can b-

Tho sighted wire Q, is on a prolongation of C beyond P, giving a
mechanical multiplication of three to one. Between the objectiv-

of two totally reflecting prisms, which turn the line of sight through
two right angles.     This arrangement keeps all parts of the instru
ment compactly together on one side of the bar or plate under test.

   The following are examples of tests made with the author's exten-
someter in its laboratory form.          The pieces were loaded, in tension,
 by means of the 50-ton Wicksteed single-lever testing machine of the
 Cambridge Engineering Laboratory.            The machine is worked by a
ijdraulic intensifier, which affords a particularly convenient means
of varying the load gradually without shock and without setting the
weigh beam into oscillation.         Except when otherwise stated, the
increments of load were made at intervals         of about one minute, that
interval sufficing for the adjustment of the load to a new value, and
for reading the extensometer.         The unit of the exteusometer scale
readings    is in all cases 66^66 inch.

    Here each ton of load corresponds to 2-56 tons per square inch.
 The mean extension up to 10 tons is 84"7 per ton, and corresponds
to a Young's modulus, E, of 13600 tons per square inch.                     The
extension per ton increases slightly, but perceptibly, with the later
toads, although the almost complete absence of set after 12 tons,
and even after 14, shows that there was no very clear passing of an
elastic limit, even under the greatest strain of 35-8 tons per square
inch.    There is just a trace of hysteresis in the relation of strain to
stress which shows itself in tho removal of the load.
   These two examples, relating as they do to cases where Hooke's
law of the proportionality of strain to stress is very approximately
true, may be taken to serve as tests of the sensibility and accuracy of
the extensometer.
   In the examples which follow, the limits were passed within which
Hooke's law applies.       In augmenting the stress so as to pass these
limits, it very generally happens that one of the first evidences of
overstrain is a time effect — a creeping up of the extensometer reading —
while the load is kept constant for a few minutes.              This creeping,
which is a familiar phenomenon in the measurement of strains, can
usually be detected a good way before the yield point is reached.             It
is associated with failure in proportionality of strain to stress, and
also with permanent, or semi-permanent set.            In certain conditions
of the material as regards previous treatment, this creeping is far
more marked than in other conditions.           It shows itself most when
the piece has, immediately before the test, been subjected to a load
 sufficient to cause permanent yielding to occur.            But if the same
 piece is allowed to rest for some days, and is then re-tested, the
 tendency to creeping is found to have disappeared or to be much

    These figures show how widely different are the elastic qualities of
an iron bar in its primitive annealed condition, and in the condition
in which it is put by overstrain.         In the first condition there is
                                      "
almost no evidence of creeping or elastische nachwirkung " up to say
5 tons of load, and       Hooke's law is nearly valid.           Immediately
after an overstrain there are distinct evidences of creeping at lower
loads, and when these lower loads are removed, there is the same
kind of thing in the unloaded state, namely, an apparent set which
disappears in whole or in part when time is allowed for the creeping
to take effect.     And further, after the overstrain there is no longer
nearly so close an agreement with Hooke's law ; a given increment
of load produces notably more strain at high loads than at low ones.
 In loading and unloading there is now much hysteresis in the relation
 of strain to stress.
    In the overstrained state the lowest loads produce not much more
 strain than they did in the primitive state; the value of Young's

 modulus     so   far as very small strains         are concerned is scarcely
 changed. But if the modulus be calculated by reference to the effects
 of higher loads, it will bo much smaller in the overstrained bar.
 This has been noticed by Bauschinger, who has also observed the
tendency, illustrated in tests to be described below, which iron and
steel show to recover their elasticity with the lapse of time, after
overstrain has taken place.*
    On resuming the above experiment, 45 minutes after the previous
load had been removed, the influence of the overstrain was still
conspicuous.

    The tendency to creep       has now practically disappeared so far as
this range    of load  is concerned ; the strain is very nearly proportional
to the stress, and there is no set. It will be remembered that 6 tons
was the greatest load formerly applied, and that it brought the piece
to the yield-point in the original test.
   The loading was then resumed, and was carried a stage further to
see how far the new yield-point would be above the old one.

    Immediately    after passing yield-point (3b), the diameter was
reduced by the set to 0 693 inch, and the section to 0-377 square
inch.

         Mean extension from 0 to     6 tons =   99  ; E=    12060.
    Similar results have been obtained in tests of other bars, of mild
 steel, comparatively hard steel, and Lowmoor iron.           In every case,
 overstrain has produced a like fatigue of elasticity, and elastic
 recovery has followed during an interval of some days or weeks of
rest.
    In several examples the process of passing the yield-point has been
 watched in the extensometer and has been seen to take place in the
 same manner as in test (3a).        Creeping, which has been slightly
 visible under lower loads, takes place at first slowly, then it gradually
 gets faster, though no change is made in the load.         This may go on
for a minute or two before the crepitation of oxide begins. The
 following is an instance noticed in testing a bar of mild steel. The
 load having been increased a step, and kept constant, there were
              3 scale-divisions of creep in the first    minute
              9          „            „          second     „
           320           „            „          third      „
after which the index of the extensometer raced off the scale.            In
another case the writer noticed creeping going on quite slowly, when
a sound of crepitation was heard. On looking at the bar it was seen
that the crepitation had begun near one end, beyond the clips.           As
soon as it spread  far  enough to reach the clip there was, of course, a
rapid movement of the index.
   The following test will suffice in further illustration of the

    As in the example already given, the influence of overstrain is
                                                   "
apparent (1) by the presence of creeping or nachwirkung," and (2)
by the progressive growth of the differences as the load increases. The
first ton or so produces little more strain than it did before the over
strain took place, but the eighth ton produces a quarter as much
again.
    An hour after the yielding had taken place the load was again re
applied in stages of 1 ton as follows, and the extensometer readings
nl ready show something of elastic recovery through rest.              They are
given   in the following  table, along with   readings  taken     on the follow
ing day and on subsequent days. It is interesting to notice the
rather slow progress of the elastic recovery from day to day. It takes
place much less rapidly in this comparatively hard metal than in
milder steel or in wrought iron.             To facilitate comparison the
readings taken immediately after the overstrain are repeated            >here : —

   These figures fihow that even after three weeks the elastic recovery
is still somewhat incomplete. This is the more remarkable when it
is borne in mind that the testing is done here with a load of 8 tons
only, a considerably smaller load than that which had been applied
to prodnce permanent set (namely 11 tons).           The imperfection which
the elasticity still shows after three weeks of rest would be more
conspicuous if the loading were extended beyond 8 tons.
   Throughout this group of tests evidences were seen of much elastic
" nachwirkung."       If a load exceeding, say, 4 tons, was left on for a
few minutes there was continued extension, amounting sometimes to
as much as five scale divisions.        And when the load of 8 tons was
removed there was, as the table indicates, a gradual retraction which
in a few minutes destroyed the apparent set observable at the
moment of removing the load. In the final observation (4h) this
action had almost wholly disappeared, but even then a trace of it
could be detected.
   As elastic recovery goes on in the days or weeks following over
strain there is a gradual return towards Hooke's law, or as it might
be described in other terms, a gradual straightening out of the stress-
strain curve.     So long as the recovery is incomplete there can scarcely
be said to be any elastic limit, in the sense of a point below which
there is strict proportionality of strain to stress.
   For the Young's modnlus of this bar the tests give the following

        Minchin, M.A. Communicated by Professor Fitzgebald,
        F.R.S. Received April 29, 1895.
   The method employed in these experiments for measuring the
intensity of the light which reaches the earth from the stars and
planets consists in the determination of the electromotive force gene
rated hy such light in certain photo-electric cells, the square of this
electromotive force being proportional to the energy of the incident
light.
   It will, then, be well to describe first the nature and construction
of these cells.
                            The Photo-electric Cells.
   In  these cells the surface on which the incident      light is received  is
formed by depositing      a  thin layer of selenium on a surface of clean
aluminium, and immersing the sensitive layer in a glass cell filled
with oenanthol.
   The mode of formation of the sensitive surface is as follows : —

    Take a tube, AB, of soft glass, the diameter of the bore of which
 is 1 mm., or smaller if desired ; take a short length, AL, of aluminium
 wire, which nearly fits the tube, and to one end, L, of this piece
 of aluminium attach a platinum wire, LP, which emerges from
 the end, B, of the glass tube, the contact at L being made by
 boring a fine hole through the aluminium and pinching the two
 metals together; then, in the flame of a Bunsen burner or a blow
 pipe, melt the glass well round the aluminium, until the glass fits
 round the aluminium as tightly as possible.           The contact of the
 glass and the aluminium should be perfect, or, at least, liquid-tight,
 and, unfortunately, it has been found hitherto impossible to realise
 this condition.   If this condition could be attained, the photo-electric
 cells would remain constant in their action for a very long time, if
 not, indeed, permanently.       At present, owing to this want of liquid-
 tightness, about four weeks seems to be the limit of constancy.
 (There is also another condition essential to constancy, which will be
 presently mentioned.)
    The next step is to grind the end A of the tube on fine sand or
 emery-paper until a flat surface is formed by the end of the aluminium
 wire and the wall of the glass tube, the end of the aluminium wire
 being then scraped clean.
    Now place the tube AB, with the end A uppermost, between two
 nearly vertical plates of asbestos, the end A just appearing beyond
 the edges of the plates of asbestos ; on the middle of the aluminium
 wire at A place a very small piece of selenium (about the size of a
 very small pin-head) ; heat the asbestos by means of a spirit lamp or
 a Bunsen flame until the selenium melts on the end A of the tube.
 Care must be taken to keep the flame away from the selenium, so
that the latter melts in virtue of the heat of the aluminium wire.
 The selenium now lies as a very black little liquid globule on the end
of the tube, and    it must  be spread uniformly over the end of the tube
by means of a heated glass rod.       The layer of selenium should not be
a thick one.      The flame being removed, allow the selenium to cool
into a hard black layer.       When it reaches this condition, apply the
heat again, as before, until the black surface changes into one with a
uniform brownish-grey colour, the heat being continued after this
with great care nntil the selenium is on the point of melting again
into a black liquid. On the first sign of this latter change, instantly
remove the heat and blow over the surface of the selenium.           This
will at once stop the tendency to melt, and the surface will then be
in its most sensitive state.    There should be no glossy streaks on the
surface ; if there are, it must be heated over again and the whole
process repeated.      Screen the tube from light and allow it to cool
for a few minutes ; it will then be ready to put into the cell with
tcnanthol.

   The cenanthol cell is a small glass tube, represented in fig. 2.
It consists of a glass tube about 3 cm. long, and nearly a centimetre
in diameter, with two short glass tubes fitted into it on opposite sides ;
oue of these is ground flat, and has a thin quartz window, QQ,
cemented to it with gelatine and acetic acid, or glue and glycerine,
or any cement that will withstand the action of cenanthol ; the other
is tightly closed by a cork, CC, through which passes the glass tube,
AB, which contains the aluminium and platinum wires above
                                   Fio. 2.
                               s
described. The cell is closed at one end by a ground glass stopper,
S, and through the other end passes a platinum wire, P', sealed in.
The two poles of the cell are the platinum wires P and P'.
   The light of a star is destined to shine through the quartz window
QQ on the centre of the sensitive surface A, which is placed in focus
of a telescope, or rather a little behind this focus, so that the light of
the star may cover the whole of the selenium area.
   The covering of the whole area A by the light is essential, for the
following reason : —
   The seat of the electromotive force is the surface of contact of the
liquid and the selenium, the selenium receiving a positive and the
liquid a negative charge. If, now, P is connected with one pole of
an electrometer and P' with the other, and if there is any portion of
the selenium surface which is not exposed to the light (and conse
quently not the seat of an E.M.F.), this inert portion will act simply
as a conductor conveying a portion of the positive charge to the
 wrong pole of the electrometer, and thus giving a diminished effect.
   The truth of this is easily verified with any kind of photo-electric
 cell, e.g., one formed of a sensitive tinfoil surface divided into two

 1895.]          The Electrical Measurement    of Starlight.            U5
portions which can be metallically joined together outside the cell or
kept separate.     If, while the portions are joined, one is exposed to,
and the other screened from, incident light, the E.M.F. indicated is
much less than it is when both are exposed, or when one alone is
exposed while the other is disconnected from it.         (A description of
                                          '
such tinfoil cell will be f onnd in the Philosophical Magazine
                                                                      '
                                                                        and
in the 'Proceedings     of the Physical Society.')
   This fact now enables us to see the importance of preventing the
liquid from entering the glass tube AB, which contains the conducting
wire P, for it is clear that, when the light is incident at A, the liquid
which has crept into the tube round the aluminium wire will convey
a portion of the negative charge imparted to the liquid in the cell to
the wrong pole of the electrometer, and will thus diminish the effect
of the light.
   The capillary entrance of the liquid into the tube AB may, of course,
be prevented by sealing into the tube a platinum instead of an
aluminium wire, and coating the end of it with the selenium layer.
But, unfortunately, platinum is not so good a base for the selenium
as is aluminium, owing, almost certainly, to the fact that selenium
enters into chemical composition with platinum, while it does not do
bo with aluminium, or with some other metals which, possibly, may
yet be used.
   The entrance of the liquid could also be prevented by nsing a
platinum wire instead of an aluminium one, and then coating the
end of the platinnm wire at A with a deposit of aluminium ; but,
 althongh this is doubtless possible, success in the attempt has not yet
been   attained.
   Air-tightness is another essential condition of the constancy of
these photo-electric cells, for it is found that in cells which are not
quite air-tight the resistance of the oenanthol increases very much
after a few weeks, probably owing to the oxidation of the liquid by
the air ; and this great increase of resistance promotes sluggishness
in the response of the cell to the action of light.
    An examination of a seleno-alnminium cell with the various portions
of the spectrum of lime-light shows that the cell is sensitive to all the
rays from the end of the red, and below it, to beyond the violet, the
maximum      E.M.F. being produced in the yellow : but the magnitude of
tbe  E.M.F. does not vary very greatly until the violet is reached.      In
this respect the seleno-alnminium cell difEers from all other photo
electric cells, for the sensitiveness of most of the latter is almost
wholly confined to the blue. It may be mentioned, however, that
a cell formed by immersing clean silver plates in a solution of eosine
 gives electromotive forces of opposite signs for tbe red and the blue
 rays.
    The energy incident on a photo-electric     cell has been found to be

different distances from the cell, the difference of potential will be

    As the electromotive force produced by the light of the sun falling
directly on the cell is probably too large, it will be desirable to
diminish its intensity by taking it through a small measured aperture
and placing the cell at a known distance behind.
                          The Electrometer employed.
    The instrument    employed for measuring the electromotive forces
generated     by the light of different stars is a quadrant electrometer
differing from the forms in ordinary use in having its quadrants
made of aluminium, two of these being supported on brass pillars
connected with the case of the electrometer and always earthed, while
the other two are supported on pillars of melted quartz.         The quad
rant box is about 2 cm. high and 5 in diameter ; the needle is of
thin aluminium foil, cut into the peculiar shape figured in Clerk
Maxwell's ' Electricity and Magnetism,' and is suspended by a quartz
fibre about 9 cm. long.       The needle and quadrants are surrounded
by  a thick   metal case, and  the instrument is both air-tight and induc
tion-tight.
   It had been intended to use with the electrometer an air condenser
consisting chiefly of two gilt brass plates, each about 15 cm. in
diameter, to multiply the potentials indicated by the electrometer ;
bnt at present there are difficulties        in the way of its employment,
and the measures made on this occasion were made by the electro
meter    alone.
   Both instruments were constructed with the aid of the' Government
Grant administered by a Committee of the Royal Society and were
made by Mr. Paul of Hatton Garden.

   This was Mr. Wilson's 2-feet reflector, which was at first used as
a Cassegrain instrument,      and subsequently as a Newtonian, the cell-
carrier being in each case fixed to the telescope in place of the eye
 piece.

    A thin plate of brass AA with      a circular hole of about -75 cm.
 diameter in the centre of its vertical face (not represented in the
figure) is fitted with a screw, S, at one end.       This screw pushes
 forward another thin brass plate, DD, which moves backwards and
forwards in a grooved space in the plate AA. The plate DD has
likewise a hole in its centre and is moved in one direction by S and
in the opposite direction by the finger applied to a screw F, attached
to DD near one end.     A small thin brass plate, gg, is attached to
DD, and can move up and down (i.e., at right angles to the plane of
the figure) in a grooved space in DD by means of a screw which is
not represented in the figure. This plate gg has also a hole in its
centre over which is cemented a thin circular glass plate carrying
crossed spider lines, represented in the figure by + . The point of
intellection of these cross-lines is capable of being brought into any
desired position by means of the horizontal motions of the plate DD
and the vertical motions of gg.
    To the face of AA opposite to that on which DD moves is attached
a thin brass plate, BB, which moves in a grooved space in AA.
Through BB passes a screw, s, which penetrates a short distance into
a special groove in BB which is terminated at the points marked 1
and 2. These points are, therefore, stops to determine the extreme
positions of the sliding plate BB on the fixed plate AA.
   The plate BB has a circular hole of about -75 cm. in diameter in its
middle, and also another, h, a little to the side.   Over h is cemented
a thin plate of glass on which can be marked two cross-lines marked
 + in the figure, or a dot.
   An ebonite block with a cylindrical hole, C, into which fits the
cell represented in fig. 2 is screwed to BB just over the central hol-
in BB.
    The plate BB is moved backwards and forwards by        a  projecting
handle, H.
   The fixed plate AA is screwed to a stout cylindrical tube about
two inches long (not represented), and this tube fits on the telescope
instead of the usual eye-piece.      AA can be adjusted, if necessary,
to various positions relative to this tube, i.e., relative to the
telescope.
   To set the apparatus for a star, the procedure is this : move th-
plate BB (and with it of course the cell) by the handle H until it is
stopped by the stop 2 ; move the intersection of the cross-lines on gg
by means of the screw S and the screw which moves gg vertically
until this point of intersection is exactly opposite the centre of the
sensitive surface of the cell (which is, of course, visible through all
the holes in the plates) ; bring back BB by means of H until it is
stopped by the stop 1 ; the glass plate covering the hole h is now
visible opposite gg — or rather through 7i we can see the intersection

 1895.]          The Electrical Measurement of Starlight.                  149
 of the cross-lines on  gg ; mark on the glass at h with a fine brush
 point  a dot exactly opposite the intersection of the cross-lines of gg ;
 remove gg out of the field of view by the vertical motion of the screw
 attached to it and to the plate DD — this being done in order that the
 light of the star may not have to pass through the glass plate on gg.
 This completes the adjustment.
    To use the instrument with a star, keep BB stopped by the stop 1 ,
 so that the mark or dot at h is in position to receive the image of
 the star.   Suppose, then, that by the adjustment of AA relatively to
 the telescope the image of the star falls exactly on this mark.          Now
 by  means   of the handle  H  move   BB    until it is stopped by the stop 2.
 This brings the centre of the sensitive surface into the position occu
 pied by the mark at h, i.e., the image of the star is now falling on the
 sensitive surface of the cell.
    When we desire to throw oft" the star, we can do so by moving BB
 with the handle H until it is stopped by the stop 1 ; but it is better
 to effect this by moving the telescope itself in declination, without
 going near the cell, until the star is out of the field, as indicated by
 the finder ; in this latter way the cell suffers no disturbing effects of
 temperature, &c.
                    Connection   of Cell with Electrometer.
    One pole (the insensitive) of the cell was connected with earth by a
 wire attached to a gas-pipe, while the other (that of the sensitive
surface) was attached to a fine uncovered copper wire, carefully
insulated throughout, which passed down through a shellac plug
in the floor of the observation room to the electrometer in the room
below.
    The readings of the electrometer deflections caused by the light of
the stars were made in the lower room by Professor Fitzgerald, while
                    I

the  work the services of my two colleagues were of very much greater
use  than mine.
                               The Observations.
    Kegulus was the first star taken, on the night of the 11th April,
and only two observations of the deflection on the electrometer scale
produced by its light were made before proceeding to an examina
tion  of Arcturus for comparison.        It  is thought desirable to show   in
tabular form a few of the results obtained.              A Leclanche cell pro
duced on the scale a deflection of 530 mm., the scale being about
7 feet from the electrometer.
    Every photo-electric cell of the type previously described and of
maximum sensitiveness has a certain native or disturbing E.M.F.,

   These observations were somewhat irregular, because the sky was
not quite clear during most of the observations, but was getting
clearer as they proceeded.
   The last was probably the best observation, and in that case
Arcturus produced a voltage of about 0-02.
   An experiment was made to try whether, if the cell were exposed
to the sky in the neighbourhood of the star, but not to the star itself,
any effect was produced, and a deflection of about 0-5 mm. in the
direction opposed to that of the deflection caused by light was con
stantly observed.

   The glare from the moon was now         very distinctly apparent, and
its effect seemed to be a deflection of    about 0-5 mm., which must be
deducted from Saturn's effect.        This latter would, then, be repre
sented by about 3-25 mm., or a voltage     of 0-009.
   TI14 next observations were made on the      night of Friday, the 12th,
and on this night the atmosphere was very hazy, although many
stars were visible.     It is not necessary to enter into the details of
observations on such a night ; nevertheless, it may be interesting to
see the effects which were observed.
   For the following bodies the mean deflections were as tabulated : —
                     Jupiter                 6-33 mm.

   A  standard candle placed at a distance of 9 feet from the cell pro
duced a deflection of 11 mm.
   Nothing of a quantitative nature can be deduced from these results
owing to the presence (and unequal distribution) of haze, the effect
of which was to make Vega produce a deflection less than that of
Arcturus.
   On the night of the 14th the sky was clearer, and while Arcturus
gave a very fairly constant deflection of 4-5 mm., Regulus gave
l-85 mm., e Bootis 0-32 mm., a Coronae 0-6 mm., and /3 Herculis
something less than 0-2 mm.
   The night of the 15th was, for a short time, much clearer, and
during this time the following more reliable measures were made : —

                  Comparison with   the  Photometric Method.
    In the ordinary method of comparison of " magnitudes," if B         and
 B-  are the brightnesses of two stars whose magnitudes are m and m,
respectively, we have, by definition,

    Now, taking Arcturus and Regulus as of the magnitudes 0-3 and
m', respectively, and the electromotive forces of their lights as 8 and
4-75 (determination of April 11, previously cited), we have
                                    = A(m'-0-3),

                               .-. m' =   1-43.
    The magnitude of Regulus, as a matter of fact, is variously cited
as  from T42 to 1-7 ; thus the amount of correspondence between the
photo-electric and photometric methods is seen.
                           Concluding Remarks.
    Among the few bright stars which we found available was Procyon,
and even this star offered an opportunity for observation during a
very limited time, owing to mechanical hindrances in the Observatory.
The stars in the Great Bear shone brilliantly, and, under favourable
circumstances, their light could have been easily measured. The
constellation was, however, so nearly vertical, that the aperture in
the roof of the Observatory was not sufficiently wide to suit the
aperture of the telescope, and hence no observation of any of these
stars was attempted.
    On one night observations of Procyon and Regulus were taken. The
readings were much smaller than had been anticipated from the great
sensitiveness of the cell and electrometer.        When these observations
were completed, the cell was exposed to a candle at 9 feet, and the
effect was so small, that it was evident that some accidental circum
stance was intervening.      The cell was, therefore, taken down from
the telescope and examined, with the result that we found an opaque
movable    portion of the cell holder covering a portion of the sensitive
surface in the cell.   This was at once removed, and then the candle,
Arcturus, and Vega gave the large deflections quoted in the observa
tions of the 15th.     It was, however, then too late to get Procyon
again.    But the observations which had been made with this star
and Regulus, while the partial obstruction of the cell remained, gave
the mean of their deflections as
                     Regulus                    1-27 mm.

 154             The Electrical Measurement      of Starlight.     [May 16,
    Now, although the accidental obstruction renders this
                                                                 comparison
 unsatisfactory, it is remarkable that these numbers accord fairly
 well with the " magnitudes " of the two stars, as given by Miss
 Clerke    ('System of the Stars,' Appendix, Table III). Thus, the
 "              " of
   magnitude         Regulus is given as 14, and that of Procyon as
 05.
    Now, in equation (5), if we put B/B' = (190/127)3, and assume the
 magnitude of Regulus = 14, while that of Prccyou = m, we have
                             5logH? = l-4->",
                                 .-. m  =  0 53,
 which is a rather close coincidence.
    On the same data equation (4) gives the result
    Intrinsic energy of Regulus = 3-6 x intrinsic energy of Procyon.
    It is hoped that these measurements will be resumed about the end
 of next September, at Daramona, by the same observers ; and, in the
meantime, some improvements will be effected in the cell- holder
 which will facilitate observation.        An endeavour will also be made
to improve the cell itself   in the   directions indicated at the beginning
of this Report.
    The experiments prove conclusively that there is little difficulty in
obtaining fairly accurate measurements of the light of stars of the
first and second " magnitudes," even without the employment of a
multiplying condenser or a larger telescope. A telescope with an
aperture of 5 or 6 feet would certainly annex a very great number of
stars to the list.
   It is right to put on record the fact that the first photo-electric
observations of planets and stars were made by Mr. Monck, in Dublin,
in the year 1892, in conjunction with Professor Fitzgerald. My cells
were at that time much less sensitive than the present ones ; and, for
reasons set forth in this paper, their sensitiveness fell off after about sis:
hours.     The liquid in those cells was acetone, and the aluminium on
which the selenium was deposited was not insulated from the liquid..
Nevertheless, Mr. Monck and Professor Fitzgerald were able to observe
electromotive forces due to the light of Venus, Jupiter, and, think, I
Mars.      Mr. Monck's telescope is a refractor of 9 ins. aperture, so
that large results were not to be expected.        These observers were not
quite certain whether Vega and Capella produced measurable effects
or not; but their observations were much interfered with by draughts
of air, and other things, in their observatory.

III. "The      Complete System of the Periods of a Hollow Vortex
        Ring." By H. C. POCKLINGTON, B.A., Fellow of St. John's
        College, Cambridge. Communicated by Professor Labmob,
        F.R.S. Received April 23. 1895.
                                  (Abstract.)
    The author discusses the stability of a hollow annular vortex in an
infinite perfect liquid, and also the effect of an electric charge on the
steady motion and the stability of such a vortex.      It is known that a
hollow vortex ring (without electric charge) is stable for such small
deformations as are symmetrical about the axis of symmetry of the
ring, and for such as consist in displacement of the axis of the hollow
without alteration of the size or shape of its cross section. This
investigation shows that, in addition to the fluted and sinuous vibra
tions above referred to, the vortex is capable of beaded vibrations, in
which the hollow is enlarged and contracted at regular intervals
along its length, and also of vibration of a more general type, in
which the displacement at any moment consists of waves on the
surface of the hollow, of which the crests are circles parallel to the
axis of the hollow, and the amplitude a sine or cosine of a multiple
of the azimuth angle. The periods of these vibrations are found and
proved to be real. Since, as is easily seen, any displacement of the
surface can be compounded by displacement of the various types here
 mentioned, the vortex is stable for all displacements of its surface.
    When an attempt is made to explain matter as composed of atoms
which consist of such vortex rings, a difficulty is found at the outset
 if the theory is applied to gases. On the kinetic theory of gases, a
 theory which, over a wide range, gives results in accordance with
those of experiment, the energy of an atom varies as the square of its
 velocity.     The energy of a vortex ring, however, decreases as its
 velocity increases.      Thus the single vortex atom theory is likely to
 yield  results  that disagree with experimental results when applied to
 gases.    If, however, the electric charge is taken into account, this
 defect can be, to a certain extent, remedied.
    The case where the electricity resides on the surface, supposed
 conducting, of the hollow of the vortex ring is worked out on the
 hypothesis that the period of an electrical oscillation is so small that
 the electricity has at any time its equilibrium distribution.       It is
 found that, in the case of such a ring, however small the charge may
 b-, the velocity of the ring can be decreased, made to vanish, and
 finally to change sign by decreasing the radius of the ring. At the
 same time, the energy diminishes, attains a minimum when the
  velocity of the vortex is zero, and then increases. If therefore the

vortex atom always has nearly the size that corresponds to minimum
energy, its energy, neglecting a constant terms varies as the square
of its velocity.     This relation, however, only holds through a small
range. On investigation of the periods of the electrified vortex it is
found that it is always unstable for some types of disturbance.
   The method employed throughout the investigation is to refer the
circumstances of the motion to toroidal co-ordinates.                    The steady
motion of the fluid is then expressed by means of a Stokes' current
function, and the disturbances of the steady motion, in the case of
vibration, by means of a potential function.                 The periods of the
different oscillations, when real, are given as 2*r|p, where p is

throughout by processes of calculation which are fully set forth in
the published accounts of the operations.         Brief statements of the
discrepancies   which   were met   with at the base-lines and the sides of
junction of the chains of triangles, and the average values of the
angular corrections which had to be applied to satisfy the discre
pancies and produce harmony and consistency throughout, are given
to  indicate the extent to which the triangulation may be relied on for
geodetic investigations.      Then the astronomical determinations of
latitude, and those of differences of longitude by the electro-
telegraphic method, are described and the results are compared with
the corresponding geodetic determinations from the triangulation.
   All the facts of observation having been given, the question is
considered of the exteat to which the astronomical determinations
have been influenced by local deflections of the plumb line.          The
views which have been put forward as regards the attraction of the
great Himalayan Mountains on the plumb line are considered ; it is
shown that the magnitudes of the attractions computed on the theory
of gravitation are considerably greater than is necessary to explain
the discrepancies between the astronomical and the geodetic results,
and this fact is fully explained by the Indian pendulum operations,
which have thrown great light on the constitution of the earth's
crust. They indicate that there is an excess of density under the
sea-level and a deficiency above that level which increases to a very
notable magnitude at a high altitude in the Himalayas ; thus,
therefore, there must be a condensation of matter under ocean beds,
and an attennation under mountains ; and consequently points must
 be sooner or later reached at which the positive attraction of a moun
 tain mass is cancelled by the negative attraction of the mass under

the mountain.      The geodetic operations of the survey show tho same
thing in the Southern      Peninsula, which is the part of India closest
to the ocean.     Here the latitude stations almost invariably show
deflection of the plumb-line towards the ocean, instead of away froin
it,  as might naturally be expected.         Here, too, the astronomical
amplitudes of the longitudinal arcs are all too small, with one excep
tion, which can be readily explained, thus also showing deflection
of the plumb-line towards the ocean at the stations on the coast
line.
   It is   not difficult to draw a line beyond which Himalayan
attraction need not be feared.          Excluding all stations obviously
under Himalayan influence, 148 latitudes and 50 lougitudinal arcs
remain for employment — with similar data obtained in other parts of
the world — in determining the figure of the earth. But on com
paring the astronomical with the geodetic determinations       it   is seen
that the former are often grossly influenced by deflections         of  tho
plumb-line     at  points   where   there
                                        is    nothing  visible to  suggest
 disturbance.     Thus, at the Colaba Observatory, Bombay, there
is   probably 8" deflection to the north, while at the Madras
 Observatory there  is   probably as great deflection to the south, neither
 place having any apparent source of meridional attraction; here the
 astronomical amplitude    is   16" less than the geodetic, a difference
 which  is fully twenty times greater than any error that can have been
 made in the triangulation.       There are also discrepancies of corres
 ponding magnitude      in the longitudinal arcs at places where there        is
 no apparent source of attraction on the prime vertical.
    Clearly, therefore, no single astronomical determination can be
 regarded as sufficiently free from deflection of the plumb-line to be
 safely employed in an investigation of the figure of the earth. But
 all investigations hitherto made have rested on single determinations.
 This, however, must be almost certainly due to the paucity of data           ;
 had a sufficiency of astronomical results been forthcoming to indicat-
 the presence of large local disturbances of the plumb-line and
 emphasise the necessity to eliminate these disturbances as far as
 possible before proceeding to employ the astronomical results, there
 can be no doubt that some attempts at elimination would have been
made.
   There      only one way of eliminating these errors, and chat
             is                                                       to is
combine the astronomical observations together in groups, each con
taining determinations at as many places in a given belt of latitude
as possible, and to take the mean of the group     ;for the mean astro
nomical latitude of a number of points may certainly bo assumed to
be far more free from deflection than that of any single point.      The
geodetic  latitudes  of the same  points, as obtained from  the trianga-
         wonld be similarly combined     ;and thus the most accurat

data   for a mathematical investigation of the earth's figure would be
obtained.
   In this way eight meridional arcs, extending from latitude 8° 43' to
latitude 30° 9', have been produced for India ; they rest on an average
of over sixteen stations for each of the fundamental latitudes, and
not, as usual, on one more station than the number of arcs.             The
amplitudes of these arcs vary from 2° 23' to 3° 38', ranging in magni
tude with the magnitudes of the mean ultimate local attractions, in
accordance with a rule which has been derived from the formula
which expresses the error of a geodetic arc in terms of the errors of
the major and minor axes.         Two great longitudinal arcs, exceeding
24° in amplitude, have been produced by summations of the observed
smaller arcs, thus eliminating all errors caused by deflections of the
plnmb-line at the intermediate stations, and retaining only those at
the eastern and western extremities of the entire arcs.
   These eight meridional and two longitudinal arcs are put forward
as the most valuable data for the investigation of the figure of the
earth which have yet been published.          They are the result of opera
tions which have been made in India during a period of over ninety
years, always with the cordial support and approval of the Govern
ment    of India.

    § 1. The experiments described in this communication were under
taken for the purpose of finding temperature variation of thermal
conductivity of some of the more important rocks of the earth's crust.
    § 2. The method which we adopted was to measure,              by aid of
thermoelectric junctions, the temperatures at different points of a flux
line in a solid, kept unequally heated by sources (positive and nega
tive) applied to its surface, and maintained uniform for a sufficiently
long time to cause the temperature to be as nearly constant at every
point as we could arrange for.          The shape of the solid and the
thermal sources were arranged to cause the flux lines to be, as nearly
its possible, parallel straight lines ; so that, according to Fourier's
i-lementary theory and definition of thermal conductivity, we should
have
                     k(M, R)   _  KM)-«(T)]-~MT         '
                     fc(T, M;     0(B)-v(M)]-t-BM
where T, M, B denote three points in a stream line (respectively next
to the top, at the middle, and next to the bottom in the slabs and
columns which we used) ; v(T), c(M), ti(B) denote the steady tern

peratures   at these points ; and k(T, M), fc(M, B), the mean conduc
tivities between T and M, and between M and B respectively.
   § 3. The rock experimented on in each case consisted of two equal
and   similar rectangular pieces, pressed with similar faces together.
In one of these faces three straight parallel grooves are cut, just
deep enough to allow the thermoelectric wires and junctions to be.
embedded in them, and no wider than to admit the wires and junctions
(see diagram, § 8 below).      Thus, when the two pieces of rock are
pressed together, and when heat is so applied that the flux lines are
parallel to the faces of the two parts, we had the same result, so far
as thermal conduction is concerned, as if we had taken a single slab
of the same size as the two together, with long fine perforations to
receive the electric junctions.    The compound slab was placed with
the perforations horizontal, and their plane vertical.   Its lower side,
when thus placed, was immersed under a bath of tin, kept melted by
a lamp below it.     Its upper side was flooded over with mercury in
our   later experiments (§§ 6, 7, 8), as in Hopkins' experiments on
the thermal conductivity of rock.       Heat was carried off from the
mercury by a measured quantity of cold water poured upon it once a
minute, allowed to remain till the end of a minute, and then drawn
off and  immediately replaced by another equal quantity of cold water.
The chief difficulty in respect to steadiness of temperature was the
keeping of the gas lamp below the bath of melted tin uniform.         If
more experiments are to be made on the same plan, whether for rocks
or metals, or other solids, it wiH, no doubt, be advisable to use an
automatically regulated gas flame, keeping the temperature of the
hot bath in which the lower face of the slab or column is immersed at
as nearly constant a temperature     as possible, and to arrange for a
perfectly steady flow of cold  water to carry away heat from the upper
surface of the mercury resting on the upper side of the slab or column.
It will also be advisable to avoid the complication of having the slab
or column in two parts, when the material and the dimensions of the
solid allow fine perforations to be bored through it, instead of the
grooves which we found more readily made with the appliances
available to us.
   § 4. Our first experiments were made on a slate slab, 25 cm. square
and 5 cm. thick, in two halves, pressed together, each 25 cm. by 12 5,
and 5 cm. thick.      One of these parts cracked with a loud noise in
an early experiment,     with the lower face of the composite square
resting on an iron plate heated by a powerful gas burner, and the
upper face kept cool by ice in a metal vessel resting upon it.      The
experiment indicated, very decidedly, less conductivity in the hotter
part below the middle than in the cooler part above the middle of
the composite square slab.     We supposed this might possibly be due
 to the crack, which we found to be horizontal and below the middle,

164           Lord Kelvin and Mr.    J. R. Erskine Murray.      [May  30.
and to be complete across the whole area of 12£ cm. by 5, across
which the heat was conducted in that part of the composite slab ; and
to give rise to palpably imperfect fitting together of the solid above
and below it. We therefore repeated the experiment with the com
posite slab turned upside down, so as to bring the crack in one half
of it now to be above the middle, instead of below the middle, as at
first. We still found for the composite slab less conductivity in the
 hot part below the middle than in the cool part above the middle.
We inferred that, in respect to thermal conduction through slate
;i cross   the natural cleavage     planes,  the thermal conductivity
diminishes with increase of temperature.
     § 5. We next tried a composite square slab of sandstone of the
same dimensions as the slate, and we found for it also decisive proof
of diminution of thermal conductivity with increase of temperature.
We were not troubled by any cracking of the sandstone, with its
upper side kept cool by an ice-cold metal plate resting on it, and its
lower side heated to probably as much as 300° or 400° C.
     § 6. After that we made a composite piece, of two small slate
columns, each 3-5 cm. square and 6-2 cm. high, with natural cleavage
planes vertical, pressed together with thermoelectric junctions as
before; but with appliances (§ 10 below) for preventing loss or gain

dimensions (7 cm., 3-5 cm.) might require, but which were manifestly
unnecessary with the larger horizontal dimensions (25 cm., 25 cm.)
of the slabs of slate and sandstone used in our former experiments.
 The thermal flux lines in the former experiments on slate were per
 pendicular to the natural cleavage planes, but now, with the thermal
flux lines parallel to the cleavage planes, we still find the same result,
 smaller thermal conductivity at the higher temperatures.      Numerical
 results will be stated in § 12 below.
     § 7. Our last experiments were made on a composite piece of
 Aberdeen granite, made up of two columns, each 6 cm. high and
 7 6 cm. square, pressed together, with appliances       similar to those
 described in § 6 ; and, as in all our previous experiments on slate
and sandstone, we found less thermal conductivity at higher tem
peratures.     The numerical results will be given in § 12 below.

0-2 cm. of their lower ends immersed.       The top of each column was
kept cool by mercury, and water changed once a minute, as described

       Communicated by Professor Cotterill, F.R.S.                        Received

                                     (Abstract.)
   In this paper the author regards a machine as an embodiment of
a  movement.      The method of construction and the proportions of the
parts are not taken into consideration, except so far as may be neces
sary to explain the conditions requisite for the kinds of motions with
which they are supposed to be endowed.                      All other considerations
relating to form and proportion are omitted, as belonging to the sub
ject of machine design.       Neither does the author take account of the
forces   which actuate and oppose the movement of the machine, such
matters    belonging to the subject Dynamics of Machines.
    The object of the paper is to analyse the movements only, and to

 show the likeness and the differences between machines in similarities
 in the movements or the contrary.
    It is claimed by the author that in those movements the principal
 feature of a machine resides, distinguishing it from other engineering
 constructions.
    It is shown that all movements, however complex, are derived
 from the association together of some of a comparatively limited
 number of kinds of more or less simple motions, which take place
 between consecutive directly connected pieces.
    Certain geometrical laws are enunciated, from which are derived
 the conditions necessary for the association of those motions together
in one machine. It is shown that those laws preclude the existence
of certain combinations of motions, and it is suggested that one may
be enabled by this analysis to enumerate an exhaustive list of the
possible combinations which must include all existing machines, and
suggest the design of others not in existence. Moreover, by attaching
 to each kind of motion a suggestive symbol, a method of expressing
 the constitution of a machine movement by a simple formula is
 proposed, whereby similarities and differences between machines may
be exhibited at a glance.
    The author commences by considering a very simple mechanism,
consisting of four bars united iu one continuous linkage by four pins
which have parallel axes.     By imagining the length of the links to
undergo variation from zero to infinity, it is shown that this simple
mechanism is representee of all the simple plane mechanisms, and,
by imagining other variations to occur, this same mechanism is
shown to be representive of still further classes of mechanisms,
in which the parts   do not move in or parallel to one plane. In this
simple mechanism the relative motions of consecutive pieces are
either turning, when one piece revolves completely around relatively
to the other, the representative symbol being the letter 0, or swing
ing when one piece turns through a limited angle relatively to the
adjoining one, represented by the letter U.
    The first law enunciated, which governs the association of the O
and U motions, is founded on the geometrical fact that the. sum of
the three angles of a plane triangle is constant, and the sum of the
four   angles of the quadrilateral therefore also constant. After a
complete revolution the angle between the bars is considered to have
been increased or diminished by 2 ir. With this extension of the pro
position the constancy of the sum of the angles is unimpaired.
   From this it is seen to be impossible for only one motion to be turn
ing and the other three swinging, otherwise the sum of the four
angles would increase or decrease by 2 it each revolution.
   The second law, which governs the association of the motions, has
  o do with the proportions between the length of the links necessary

                        The Kinematics of Machines.                 109
  to permit   of complete turning. This is founded on the fact that
 one side of a triangle cannot be greater than the sum of the other
 two.    From these two laws together it is shown that it is impossible
 to have two O's alternating with two U's.
    Next it is pointed out how the TJ motion may be provided for by
 constructing a circulnr slotway in one piece, and shaping the other
 piece to fit the slotway, so that by imagining the radius of curvature
of the slotway to be indefinitely increased a relative movement of
reciprocating sliding motion, represented by the symbolical letter J,
 will be substituted for the swinging motion U. A slide being con
ceived to be a swing through a zero angle about an infinitely distant
centre, the previously mentioned laws will apply to associations con
taining    I motions, and it will follow that a combination of three
slides and one swing is precluded by the first law.
    If four slides are associated, in which all four of the links of
the original mechanism are to be conceived to be infinitely long,
au indeterminate motion will result comparable to the motion which
would be possible if five bars were joined by pairs in a closed circuit.
    One of the slides may be suppressed, and a definite motion will
result from three slides.
    If the foregoing analysis be compared with that due to Reuleaux,
to which it bears a close resemblance, it will be seen that Reuleaux
conceives that the elementary essential components of machines are
the pairs of consecutive links which are in mutual contact, whereas
it is here proposed that the relative motions of consecutive links
should be regarded as the essential elements or components of a
machine movement. Whilst the pairs of surfaces of contact of con
secutive pieces should be formed to suit the kind of relative motion
which those pieces are required to undergo, yet the forms of those
surfaces do not themselves entirely govern the character of the
motion.
    Reuleaux assumes that what he calls a turning motion and the       I
motion are    entirely governed by the forms of the surfaces of mutual
contact, but shows that to ensure a more complex motion a restraint
is required to be imposed by means external to the two links.     Those
additional means     of  constraint have to be included with that due to
the forms of the surfaces of mutual contact in the conception of a
complete pair, and often the whole mechanism is required to complete
one pair contained in it.
    Reuleaux does not attempt to discriminate between a turning and
a swinging pair ;       the same pair of surfaces of mutual contact is
suitable for both ; the difference consists of a difference only in the
rest of the mechanism, yet the difference in the two motions is most
apparent, and is very important, both kinematically and also from
 the practical engineer's point of view.

170                        Prof. T. A. Hearson.                  [May 30,
   No advantage is* derived from analysing a machine into parts such
as pairs    it it requires the whole machine to complete one of the
parts.
   The enunciation and the explanation of the influence of the first
law previously mentioned, of the constancy of the sum of the four
angles of a quadrilateral in governing the association of the OU and
I  motions in one mechanism, is one of the important original features
of this paper.
    The influence of the second law, viz., that the two sides of a
triangle are together not less than the third, in limiting the associa
tion of the O, U,    I motions, is now also for the first time pointed out,
though Reuleaux and others have, without formally enunciating the
law, made use of the fact to determine the proportions necessary for
certain suggested movements.
    By the application of these governing laws one is able to write
an exhaustive list of all the possible combinations in one simple
mechanism of the three simple O, U,       I  motions, and to explain why
other combinations are precluded.
    Fourteen distinct combinations are possible, and only fourteen.
 They are exhibited by the following formulas, in which a large O
 associated with a small o signifies that in one case adjacent links
 turn relatively to one another so as to continuously increase the
angle between them, and in the other to continuously diminish the
 angle. The double © signifies that two complete revolutions accom
 pany one complete to and fro swing or slide.

    Following Reuleaux, the author applies the principle of the " in
 version of the kinematic chain," considering it to be a continuous
 sequence of links in a closed circuit containing a sequence of
 elementary motions.      In explaining what is meant by inversion, it is
 pointed out that relatively to an observer or user of a machine one
 piece is fixed.   This is called the frame of the machine. Each one of
 the four links may in turn be made the fixed or frame link, and

although the relative motion of the four links will in all cases remain
unaltered, the absolute movement, or movement relatively to the
user of the machine, will in general be different for each fixing, and
constitute a new machine movement.        Changing the fixed or frame
link is called the "inversion of the chain.-'
   The author makes use of the term " primary pieces," originally
suggested by Rankine for those links which are in sequence with
and directly connected to the frame link, and shows that               if,
                                                                   after
inversion, the new primary pieces have the same kind of motions as
the previous primary pieces had, the consequent machine movement
is not a new one, but a repetition of   previous one.

     From the mechanisms                an^            only can four different
machine movements be obtained by inversion.    From the others               3,   2,
or only  1 can be derived.
   They  are distinguished from one another in the formula by using
a thick line for the frame link. Thus
             signifies a machine movement like that employed in -the
                crank and connecting-rod engine.
             is   exemplified in the oscillating engine much used in paddle-
                  wheel steamers.
             is   found in Stannah's pendulum pump, and
             is   the movement adopted by Rigg in the design of his high
                  speed engine.   The intimacy of the relation of this engine
                  to the preceding ones is here for the first time indicated.
In all, thirty-two and only thirty-two distinct machine movements
can be derived      from the fourteen previously enumerated mechanisms
by inversion.
   It is shown that Reuleaux's principle of inversion can be applied
with more advantage and consistency           a machine movement
                                                if                                is
analysed into its component motions than if a machine          analysed
                                                                  is
into its component pairs, and the notation lends itself to a very clear
exhibition of the effect of inversion.
   The author next discusses the relation of cams and spur-wheel
mechanisms to the foregoing kinematic chains, showing that they
are the result of the suppression of one of the previous four links and
the amalgamation of the two adjoining simple motions into one more
complex.    A comparison      also made with belt gearing and expres
                               is
sive fonnuloB suggested.
    The author then passes to the consideration of machines the parts
 of which, do not move parallel to one plane.

 172                         Prof. T. A. H-arson.                 [May 30,
     Reuleaux was the first to show that if the links of the previously
 mentioned kinematic chains be bent to the form of great circles of a
 sphere the axes of the connecting pins will be radial, and the pre
 viously mentioned machine movements will be possible under the
 modified circumstances.
     In spherical motion the counterpart of what is a slide in plano
 motion could be obtained by a swinging motion about a pole of
 which the bent link is the equator.       The motion is to be conceived
 as due to the use of two bent links, the length of one of which is a
 quadrant of a great circle of the sphere.
     In these so-called spherical mechanisms, Law      I has to be modified
 as follows : —
     The sum of the four angles of the spherical quadrilateral varies,
having a value of 3it for a maximum and 2tt for a minimum.
     This and Law II, which is the same as before, will preclude the
 same combinations in spherical mechanisms which were precluded in
 plane mechanisms.
           I
    Law explains at once why in Hooke's joint, which is the spherical
 counterpart of Oldham's coupling, the angular velocity. ratio of the
 connected shafts is not constant, whereas in Oldham's coupling it is.
     The author points out that the kinematic chain containing three        -
 slides cannot be adapted to give a movement on a sphere. The
 virtual construction would consist of a spherical triangle between
the links of which no relative motion is possible, and there is not
room on the sphere for a movement at each joint of a bent quadri

a three-slide     mechanism   can be adapted to give motion  on the surface
of a cylinder, and it is the only one of the fourteen kinematic chains
which can be so adapted, and examples of it are found in the various
helical motions so largely used.       (The letter V is used to represent
hehcal motions.)         This method of showing the relation between
screw motions      and plane motions is a novel feature of the paper.
    The remaining mechanisms consist of those in which the axes of
the turning and swinging motions neither meet nor are parallel.
They include the motion which occurs at a ball-and-socket joint
represented by @. The method of classification according to the

    All simple machine movements may be ranged in four divisions,
viz.   :

    1.   Consisting of plane mechanisms, in which the pieces move in or
parallel to the surface of a plane.
    2. Spherical mechanisms, in which the pieces move in or parallel
to the surface of a sphere.
    3. Cylindrical mechanisms, in which the pieces move in or parallel
    the surface of a cylinder.

    4. The remainder, to which the name conoidal mechanisms is given,
in  which the axes of the swinging and turning motions neither meet
nor are   parallel.
    The mechanisms in each of these divisions are classed         in two sab-
divisions.
       Sob-division S, with surface contact of consecutive links.
       Sub-division P, with point contact of consecutive links.
    The mechanisms of sub-division         S of divisions 1 and 2, 1, and 2,
will consist of those in which     OUI      motions only are used.
    Those of 3, will include the helical or V motion, and
    Those of 4, will include the motion @ requiring the use of a ball-

    To the pairs of links which have the relative motions O, U,          I, V,
Renleaux has given the name lower pairs.              Reuleaux claimed     two
characteristics    for lower pairs, viz. : —
    1.  Definiteness of motion derived from the surfaces of mutual con
tact themselves.
    2.  The possibility of distributing the contact over an area which
may be extended as much as desired.
    If it is desired to differentiate between the O and U motions,
Reuleaux's turning pair cannot possess the first characteristic.
    The second characteristic is of considerable value in relation to the
liability to abrasion and wear, but the advantage of greater immunity
against wear has to be purchased at the cost of a more complicated
construction and a more restricted character of movement.
    As examples —
    The   mechanism consisting of a pair of spur wheels turning in
bearings which are at a fixed distance apart will belong to lp.
   A pair of bevel wheels will belong to 2P.
   The so-called cylindrical cam motion will belong to 3P, and the
worm-and-worm wheel mechanism to 4P.
   The mechanisms in each of the eight sub-divisions are still further
sub-divided into combinations.         The combinations of 1„ 2„ and 3„
are exhaustively enumerated, and it is suggested that an extension of
the methods of applying the geometrical laws would               lead to the
preparation of an exhaustive list of the possible combinations in the
other sub-divisions.      The combinations are still further sub-divided
into inversions according to Reuleaux's principle of the inversion of
a  machine.
    Further than this there will be varieties of any inversion differing
in the    details of the construction and uses of the machine move
ment.
    Lastly, the author proceeds to show how the foregoing considera
 tions assist in the analysis of compound mechanisms.          It is assumed

that    practically all compound mechanisms contain a continuous
mechanism A, of not more than four links, from which definiteness of
relative motion of all the other links is derived. Any two links
of A in their exact length, or longer or shorter, may be adapted to
form with two new links a second mechanism B, and any two of A or
B, or one of A and one of B, may be adapted to form with two still
further added links a third mechanism C, and so on. In this way a
definiteness of relative motion of many links in a compound
mechanism is derived.     The notation lends itself to a clear exhibition
of the manner in which two or more simple mechanisms are associated
together, and the compound mechanism built up.

        Temperature of the Crater of an Electric             Arc Light.
        Preliminary Notes of Observations made at            Daramona,
        Streete, co. Westineath."     By W. E. Wilson.        Communi
        cated by Professor    Fitzgebald, F.R.S.        Received April
        2o, 1895.
   Of late years it has often been assumed      that the temperature of
the crater forming the positive pole of the electric arc is that of the
boiling of carbon. The most modern determinations give this point
as about 3300°— 3500° C.
   Solar physicists have thought that the photosphere of the sun
consists of a layer of clouds formed of particles of solid carbon. As
the temperature of these clouds is certainly not below 8000° C, it
seems very difficult to explain how carbon can be boiling in the arc
at 3500° and yet remain in the solid form in the sun at 8000°.     Pres
sure in the solar atmosphere seemed to be the most likely cause of
this, and yet, from other physical reasons, this seemed not probable.
   In order to investigate whether increased pressure in the gas sur
rounding an electric arc would raise the temperature of the crater,      I
had an apparatus made by the Cambridge Instrument Company.              It
consists of a strong cast-iron box, which was tested by hydraulic
pressure to 2000 lbs. per square inch.      In the following plan, A is
the box, B and C are the two carbon poles enclosed in steel tubes.
The negative carbon was kept in position against a copper ring by a
spiral spring behind it.     The positive carbon was hand fed by a
friction roller, which was moved by a handle F outside the box. A
steel tube H was screwed into the box at such an angle that, by
looking down it, we could see well into the crater of the positive pole.
The end of this tube is closed by a glass lens, which formed an image
of the crater at a distance of 80 cm.

     A Boys's radio-micrometer,     with its aperture reduced to about
 2  mm. diameter, was so placed on the pier     in the laboratory that the
 image of the crater   fell on its small aperture.   The instrument thus
 ?ave deflections proportional to the radiation coming from the crater.
 The current was supplied from a battery of accumulators, giving an
 E.M.F. of 110 volts. Suitable resistances of platinoid wire were put
 in the circuit, so that the current could be varied from 40 to 10
 amperes.     An ammeter was also in circuit, and the poles of the arc
 were connected to a voltmeter.
    The gas used was nitrogen, and the pressure was got by connecting
the box by a copper pipe with the valve of a 20-foot steel cylinder
filled with the gas at a pressure of 120 atmospheres.        A -T--j°int- on
the copper pipe was connected with a Bourdon pressure-gauge, which
showed the pressure in the box at any moment.
    The method of experimenting was first to start the arc with the
pressure in the box at that of the atmosphere.          The image of the
brightest part of the crater was thrown on the aperture of the radio-
micrometer, and a series of observations taken of the deflections of
the instrument.      The pressure was then gradually increased and the
maximum deflections observed. As the pressure rises the resistance
of the arc increases, and, in order to keep the same current flowing,
the resistance in the circuit was reduced.        It soon became evident
that, even with moderate pressures of about 5 atmospheres, the tem
perature of the crater had fallen.       This was not only shown by the
reduction in the deflections of the radio-micrometer, but also by the
fall in brilliancy of the image of the crater to the eye.   The pressure
was then increased to about 20 atmospheres, and the brilliancy of the
crater fell to a dull red colour.      These experiments were repeated
several times and always with the same results.
    I then tried the effect of reducing the pressure in the box by
means of an air-pump, but as some of the glands in the box were only
intended for an internal pressure,       I found it impossible to get a
good   vacuum   ; yet by keeping   the pump at work, and thus getting a
   vol. lvih.                                                     o

moderate vacuum,        I found the I-adiation of the crater to be much
greater than at the atmospheric pressure.
     The temperature of the crater seemed very sensitive to any sudden
 diminution of pressure in the gas.      If the blow-off valve was suddenly
 opened, the brilliancy of the crater fell so much that it became nearly
 invisible.   When the box was being exhausted by the air-pump,
 ul though the temperature of the crater was rising as the vacuum
 improved, yet at each stroke of the pump the eye could see a distinct
 falling off of brilliancy in the image.
     It was thought that the diminution of brilliancy might be due to
 smoke inside the box, but on looking through the window everything
 was seen sharply defined, also the gas as it issued from the blow-off
 was perfectly clear.     The arc was also kept burning for some time
in the box at the atmospheric pressure, but the image remained quite
 clear, and the inside of the box seemed quite free of smoke.
    From these experiments it would seem as if the temperature of the
crater, like that of a filament in an incandescent lamp, depends on how
much it is cooled by the surrounding atmosphere, and not on its
being the temperature at which the vapour of carbon has the same
pressure as the surrounding atmosphere. That carbon volatilises in
some form at comparatively low temperatures seems likely, from the
way in which the carbon of incandescent lamp filaments is transferred
to the glass.    The pressure of the vapour of carbon in the arc may
consequently be very small, and further it would seem that the
supposition of high pressures in the solar photosphere, which has
been referred to in the beginning of this paper, is not borne out by
these experiments, and that carbon may exist there in the solid form
at very high temperatures although the pressures are comparatively
low.
    The experiments on high pressures were conducted on several
occasions.     Oh the last occasion, in addition to repeated former
experiments, the experiments on reduced pressures wore performed.
and    I then had the great advantage of the presence, advice, and
assistance of my friends Professor Minchin and Professor G. F.
Fitzgerald.    The later series of experiments entirely confirmed my
former ones.

         the Significance of the Ratio of the two Specific Heats
         in Gases." By G. Johnstone Stoxey, M.A., D.Sc, F.R.S.
         Received April 29, 1895.
    Take first a manifestly phosphorescent substance, such as calcium
 sulphide.     For a long time. after exposure to sunshine such a body
 retains the power of glowing in the dark, and the spectrum of the
 light which it then emits consists of definite lines or bands.
    The temperature of the phosphorescent substance may all this time
be low when tested by the thermometer, i.e., by its power of commu
nicating heat to bodies with which it is in contact.
    Let us now apply another test of temperature. Imagine the phos
phorescent body to be placed close outside one face of a closed
chamber.        Let the other sides of the chamber be adiabatic, while
that next the phosphorescent substance is a window glazed with a
material transparent to the phosphorescent rays, and opaque to all
other radiations; and let there be a theoretically perfectly black
solid within the chamber.
    Such a solid emits all the rays due to its temperature, and them
only — none others, however much a luminary may shine upon it.
    Let us suppose that two specimens of the phosphorescent substance
are provided, which can be alternately exposed to sunshine, and
placed so as to radiate into the closed chamber through its window.
In this way the phosphorescent radiation on to the black body within
can be kept up for any desired length of time.
    Let the black body at the commencement and the phosphorescent
substance before its exposure to sunshine be at the ordinary atmo
spheric temperature.           Now let the phosphorescent body be excited
by   sunshine,    and   put  into  its position in front of the window.of the
closed chamber.         The light emitted by the phosphorescent substance
will then radiate into the chamber without equivalent exchange.
Accordingly the temperature of the black body within will rise, and
will continue rising until its temperature has reached something like
white heat: in fact until that point is reached at which a glowing
black body radiates luminous rays which, at the particular parts of
   * The term motions      as used in this paper is to be understood in a sense, both
generalised and   limited, as including along with the motions proper of ponderable
matter, any other event of or within the molecule in which energy arriving from
outside can be stored — whether in the form of potential energy of ponderable
matter, or in motions or configurations       of the electrons, or in any other way.
It  does not include any event which is completely isolated, if such exist within the
molecule. i.e., any event which is wholly incapable of exchanging energy with the
other events going on within and outside the molecule.
                                                                         o 2

  the spectrum where the phosphorescent bands occur, are as       bright as
  these latter.   Then, and not till then, will an equivalent    exchange
  take place ioi the energy passing in and out of the closed      chamber,
  and only then will the augmentation of the temperature of      the black
  body cease.
     Accordingly, if we regarded only the temperature to which by
  radiation it can raise a neighbouring body, the phosphorescent sub
 stance would appear to be at a white heat.
     This remarkable behaviour of the bodies that are conspicuously
 phosphorescent is, of course, consequent upon the molecular events
 that go on within them. We have accordingly next to inquire what
 their internal dynamical state must be to have such results.
     We may distinguish the movements of molecules into three kinds
 of events.
     1. A events ; by which are to be understood motions of the centres
 of mass of the molecules relatively to one another.     This is a kind of
 motion which is probably inconspicuous in solids, while considerable
 in liquids ; and when we come to gases it becomes so much the pre
 dominant event that it usually engrosses about two-thirds of the
 energy of all the molecular events that are going on.
    But besides these there may be motions of the parts of each mole
 cule relatively to its centre of mass.    These internal events, as they
 may be called, are of at least two kinds, as follows —
    2. Ba events ; i.e., events within a molecule which act on and are
 reacted on by a neighbouring molecule if sufficiently near.      Accord
 ingly, whenever the Ba events within a molecule happen at any time
to have more thau average activity owing to the fluctuations in the
 distribution of energy that are always taking place, this excess of
energy tends to be transferred over wholly or in part to the neigh
bouring molecules in consequence of the interaction between mole
cules.    This interaction seems to proceed continuously in solids and
liquids, but in gases only daring a portion of the whole time, viz.,
only on the occasions when encounters take place, which is perhaps
something like one-seventieth of the whole time in the more perfect
gases at atmospheric temperatures and pressures.
    3. Bb events.   But, besides, there may be more isolated events going
on within molecules, events of the kind that manifest themselves con
spicuously in phosphorescent bodies, events which but slowly part
with any excess of energy they may possess to the other events going
on within the molecule, or to neighbouring molecules.
    It is to these Bb events that our attention has at present to be
chiefly directed.     A conspicuously phosphorescent substance was
selected above in order most easily to demonstrate their existence.
But what has been said of persistently phosphorescent bodies applies
equally to many of the bodies about us which become visible when

 1895.]                   Motions of and within Molecules, §c.                         179
illuminated.          In fact many sach bodies are evanescently phosphor
escent,* and the survival of the phosphorescence when the stimu
lating light has been withdrawn can be observed, and its duration
measured, by the phosphoroscope.                  Although in most cases its dura
tion is but a small fraction of a second, nevertheless in every case
that has been observed, indeed in every case that can be observed
with the phosphoroscope, it is a duration of immense length com
pared with the almost inconceivable rapidity of molecular events, in
comparison with which even the thousandth part of one second is a
vastly long period of time.f
    In all such bodies therefore there are events of the class Bb.
    Solids only seem to have been examined by the phosphoroscope.
But we may feel assured that the same dynamical conditions prevail,
certainly in liquids and probably in gases.
    Let us next consider what bearing this has on the interpretation
which is to be put on a high ratio of the two specific heats.
    An event of the Bb class, which subsides so rapidly as to require
 the phosphoroscope to detect it, will behave, in any protracted
experiment for determining the ratio of the two specific heats, in the
same way as events of the Ba class.                  But this ceases to be the case
where the ratio of the two specific heats is determined by experi
ments on sound ; and in all the experiments which have been
made nse of it ceases to be the case when Bb events are as slow in
subsiding as some of them are in conspicuously phosphorescent bodies.
    Now the method by which the ratio of the two specific heats has
 been    determined for argon and helium has been by experiments on
 sound ; and as the value furnished by this method depends upon Ba
events, it is competent to supply information about them only.                           It
 gives no information as to the energy involved in events of the Bb
class.      Accordingly it remains quite possible that Bb events may be
easily evoked by stimulation of argon and helium, and that while in
existence they may engross a considerable share of the total energy
in the gas. That this is the case would seem to be evidenced by the
 vivid spectra which these gases exhibit under the influence of elec
 tricity.
    • The colours of objects, when not mere interference
                                                                 phenomena, are due to the
 excitation of Ba or Bb events within the molecules by certain rays of the incident
 light.    In both cases the acting rays yield up their energy ; but when Ba events
take    their place, the body is simply warmed : when it is Bb events that come into
existence, the body for a short time subsequently radiates light. In the one case
the colour of the body is that of incident light which -is not absorbed ; in the
other case    it is in general the colour of incident light which is absorbed. Of course
if  both causes are in operation they produce their conjoint effect.             A few out
lying cases,    such   as that of fluorescence, require a slightly modified treatment.
    t The thousandth of a second bears about the same relation to molecular events
 that 10,000 years does to the motions of the limbs of animals.

 180                       Mr. G.  J.  Stoney.     Note on the               [May 30,
    In this connection, it      is well to call to mind that phosphorescent
events can be excited with even greater splendour by electricity than
by exposure to light,* as has been abundantly shown by experiment,
especially by many experiments of exceptional brilliancy that have
been made by Mr. Crookes.
    There appears, therefore, to be no ground for the supposition which
has been sometimes entertained, that there is incompatibility between
the two facts that have been observed — the fact that in these two gases
the ratio of the two specific heats is near its maximum value, and
the fact that these gases, when stimulated by electricity, furnish
brilliant spectra.
   Events of the Bb class in phosphorescent bodies may be made to
reach the intensity which enables them to emit visible radiations in
any one of three ways, either —
   1.   By exposing the phosphorescent body to light of suitable wave
          length and sufficient intensity ; or
   2.   By exciting certain other electrical events in its neighbourhood                ;
          or
   3.   By raising the temperature of the whole phosphorescent body to
          a white heat.
   If  the phosphorescence is excited by either of the first two of these
methods, the phosphorescent substance remains at a temperature as
tested by the thermometer, immeusely short of that which would
enable an incandescent body to emit light of equally high refrangi-
bility.
    Accordingly the luminous             effects within Geissler tubes do not
prove    that   the    temperature of the luminous gas is very high : an
inference which is often erroneously drawn.                   In fact, Bb motions,
when once excited within molecules, may continue for a considerable
time to be more active [or,         it may be, less active] than the Ba motions
simultaneously going on, since there is but feeble interaction between
them.
    If  the molecule consist of but one chemical atom, there may be
both Ba and Bb events going on within that so-called atom. If the
molecule consist of two or more chemical atoms, a part of the Ba
events may be motions of the centres of mass of these atoms relatively
 to one another.           But this is not always the case : the bonding
 between the atoms that form the molecule may be such that there is
 but little of this relative motion.          Accordingly, the ratio of the two
 specific heats being large does not necessarily imply that the molecule
 is monatomic.           The inference involves the erroneous supposition
 that there are no events going on within the molecule, and few

degrees of freedom in its motion :* a supposition which is an example
of how ready we are to think that Nature must work simply when she
works on a very small scale, and of the further error of imagining
that a little rigid body is something exceptionally simple — the fact
being that a rigid body is only a figment of the imagination, and that
in Nature it is physically impossible.                Moreover, it so happens that
the bodies in Nature which most nearly resemble rigid bodies,
namely, elastic solids, are amongst those bodies whose internal con
stitution is most complex.
     Beside the Bb motions, there may be other internal events more or
less isolated from both the Ba and the Bb events. By two events
being isolated is to be understood their being unable to interchange
energy.         We may call these in succession Be, Bd, &c, events.
 When they exist, the body will usually emit two or more spectra
 under variations of the external stimulus, whether luminous or elec
trical.      And we must beat- in mind that Ba events may also be the
 source of a spectrum.
     The simplest supposition as to the interaction between the ether
and the molecules of matter is that which is based on Faraday's law
of electrolysis, which, as von Helmholtz pointed out, and as the
 present writer had previously shown, implies that there is a certain
electrical charge, of the same amount in all cases, associated with
each chemical bond (see ' Philosophical Magazine
                                                                 '

 p. 418).         The approximate amount of this charge, which Relm-
 holtz designated the atom of electricity, and which the author has
 called the electron, can be computed.                According to a determination
 made by the author in 1874, it appears to be about three-eleventhets
     * That there are few degrees of freedom iu the molecule is sometimes supposed
to follow from the dynamical investigation ; but this appears to be a mistake. The
 Maxwell Law of the partition of kinetic energy is only known to prevail 1° where
the kinetic energy is expressible as a sum of squares i 2° where certain initial con
ditions of the motions of the system of bodies have been complied with ; and 3°
 where the subsequent events are due exclusively to the interaction of the bodies of
the system.
     No one of these is known to be true of any gas ; and the second of them if ful
 filled initially will in general cease to prevail so soon as any agency other than the
 dynamical action of the molecules intervenes.           Eadiant heat, light, electricity,
 and many (probably all) chemical reactions, are agencies of this kind.
     That the dynamical investigation, based on data simpler than those that prevail

 ratio of the two specific heats as determined by experiment in several gases, in no
 degree proves that those simpler data are what exist in nature.         Many and very
 various phenomena of light are explainable in a very striking way by the simple
 hypothesis that light is an undulation of transverse motions i but it would be a
 rash inference to conclude from this that electromagnetic waves are mere trans
 verse motions.       The data of Nature have always to be simplified before they can be
  used  as the   data of mathematical investigations.

V. "On the Velocities of the Ions."                 By W. C. Dampier
       Whetham, M.A., Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge.
       Communicated by Professor J. J. THOMSON, F.R.S. Re
       ceived May 2. 1895.
                                (Abstract.)
   In  a previous communication    to the Boyal Society (' Phil. Trans.,'
184, (1893), A. p. 337),   I have described a method of experimentally
determining the velocities of the ions during electrolysis, by observa
tions on the phenomena which occur when a current of electricity
is passed across the junction of two salt solutions, ono at least of
which is coloured.
   The results obtained agreed, within the limits of experimental
error, with the numbers deduced by Professor F. Kohlrausch from
measurements of the conductivities.           The method is, however,
seriously restricted by the conditions necessary for its success.       The
two solutions must be of different densities, of different colours, and
of nearly equal conductivities at equivalent concentrations.
                                     I
   In order to extend the method, have used solid solutions in agar-
agar jelly, tracing the motion of the ion by the formation of a precipi
tate. Jelly solutions were employed by Dr. Oliver Lodge, but, although
he got a good result for hydrogen with phenol-phthallein as an indicator,
when he tried to measure the velocity of barium and strontium by
watching the formation of precipitates, the experiments were not very
successful.    This was probably due to the fact that, when a pre
cipitate forms, it removes some of the electrolyte from solution, and
so  increases the specific resistance and the local potential-gradient.
In order to eliminate this disturbing    cause, instead of setting np two
solutions which completely precipitate          each other, like barium
chloride and sodium sulphate, use was made of barium chloride and
sodium chloride, just enough sodium sulphate being added to the
latter to enable the motion of the barium ions to be traced by the

1895.]                 On the Velocities   of   the   Ions.           183
formation of a    slight precipitate of barium sulphate. That this did
not   seriously affect the result was shown by making two determina
tions of the velocity of the barium ion, much more sodium sulphate
being present in the first case than in the second.        The numbers
obtained    for  the   specific  ionic  velocity were     0-000385    and
000039O cm. per second respectively.
   The influence of the jelly was examined by determining the velocity
of the bichromate group (Cr2Oi) with solid solutions of potassium
bichromate and potassium chloride — the motion being indicated by
the change in colour.    The result was 0"00044 cm. per second.         In
the former paper the velocity of the same ion, measured by means of
aqneous solutions of these salts, came out O00047 cm. per second.
The influence of the jelly thus appears to be small, as is also indicated
by Arrhenius'    experiments on the conductivity of such solutions
OB. A. Report,' 1886, p. 344).
  The apparatus      used   and the method  of measurement were the
same as    in the former investigation.  Two vertical glass tubes, about
2 cm. in diameter,
                       were joined by a third, considerably narrower,
which was bent parallel to the others for the greater part of its
length.   In this tube the jelly solutions came in contact with each
other, and formed a slight precipitate     at the junction. When a
current was passed from one solution to the other, this precipitate
spread, and the rate at which its advancing        surface moved, was
 measured on a glass scale placed behind          it,
                                               the observations being
 roade through  atelescope.

   If the potential-gradient      at the junction is dV/dx, we have
                                   dV/dx =     <yr/A,
where 7 represents the total current, r the specific resistance of the
solution, and A the area of cross-section of the tube.
   If v is the observed velocity, the specific velocity for unit potential
gradient is given by
                                         v        vA

                                      dVjdx       7r
A  is determined by    filling a known length of the tube with water or
mercury, 7 is read off on a galvanometer previously graduated by
means of a Daniell cell and a box of resistance coils, and r is de
termined by Kohlrausch's method of a Wheatstone's bridge with
alternating currents.
   The solutions must be of nearly equal conductivities, so that a
mean value of r may be taken.            This is the more important because,
unlike the colour-boundary method, the formation of a precipitate is
an irreversible process.        Measurements cannot, therefore, be made
with the current flowing in both directions, which, in the former
paper, was shown to get rid of the disturbing effect of any remaining
difference in conductivity.         All that can be done is to choose solu
tions whose conductivities are very nearly equal, so that the un
certainty which must appear in the result shall be, at all events, as
small as possible.
   The apparatus was immersed in a water bath, and the results all
corrected to a temperature of 18° C, in order that they might be
comparable with Kohlrausch's calculated values.
   The following results were obtained : —
   Barium. — Solutions used : decinormal barium chloride and sodium

The temperature coefficient was found to be 2-5 per cent. per degree,
so that we get for the specific ionic velocity of the barium ion,

   The general result goes to show that the ionic velocities thus
measured      agree, within          the limits of experimental error, with
Kohlrausch's numbers.*
   It has already been shown (- Phil. Mag.,' October, 1894) that when
travelling through acetates whose concentration is 0-07 normal, the
velocity of the hydrogen ion is about 0-000065 cm. per second,
  *  It is worthy of note that all the results     for kations are slightly larger than
indicated by theory, while the oniy measurement made for an anion gives a value
which is slightly less.   This may possibly be a result of the use of jelly.

186                  Mr. W. C. Dampier Whetham.                 [May   30,
whereas in other solutions, such as chlorides, it is about 0 0030, that
is, about 46 times as great.     Now acetic acid at the concentration
 mentioned above has an abnormally low conductivity, only the 1/62
 part of that of an equivalent solution of hydrochloric acid, so that, in
 such cases, the immediate cause of the low conductivity appears to be
 a reduction in the ionic velocities.
    An attempt was made to complete the investigation of acetic acid
 by measuring the velocity of the acetate group C3HiOa.         I thought
the red colour, which acetates give with ferric salts, might be used as
indicator, and for this purpose set up solutions of ferric chloride and
ferric chloride coloured red by ferric acetate.     These ferric salts are
said to be decomposed in solution into ferric hydroxide and the acid.
Besides the chemical reasons in favour of this hypothesis, it is sup
ported by the conductivities.      Ferric chloride, which gives hydro
chloric acid, is known to have abnormally great conductivity, and
measurements     I  have carried to great dilution show that the mole
cular conductivity reaches a maximum at a certain concentration,
and, as the dilution is pushed further, sinks again. This behaviour
is characteristic of the solutions of acids. In the case of ferric
acetate, acetic acid is produced, and the molecular conductivity is
 abnormally low. It seemed likely, then, that the red colour pro
duced by acetates, when added to solutions of ferric salts, might be
 used as a means of measuring the velocity of the acetate group in
acid solutions.     When the experiment was made, however, it was
found that the colour boundary travelled in the wrong direction for
an anion, viz., with the current, the specific velocity being O00028 cm.
per second.    Now it is unlikely that an ion should behave thus, and
 an experiment on the migration phenomena of a solution of acetic
acid showed that there was no accumulation of acid round the
 kathode. The result of further investigation was to show that the
red colour of such solutions is due to the presence of soluble ferric
hydroxide, and that, under the influence of a current, this is trans
ported through the solution without decomposition in the direction of
the current.    Among other experiments, a direct measurement of the
velocity  of the transport was made.     If a solution of ferric chloride
be dialysed through parchment paper, hydrochloric acid escapes,
while a red solution of soluble ferric hydroxide, known as " dialysed
iron," remains. This was used to colour a solution of ferric chloride,
which was set up in contact with an ordinary aqueous solution of
ferric chloride of the same concentration. The specific velocity of the
 hydroxide could thus be determined by observing the motion of the
 colour boundary, and came out 0-00033 cm. per second in the direc
tion of the current. It is evident that this is what we were measuring
in the case of the acetate described above.
    The conductivity of the dialysed iron solution is very low, and an

investigation on its value for solutions of different concentration led
to the conclusion that, in such solutions, the whole work of carrying
the current is done by the residual ferric chloride, which is itself
probably decomposed to some extent into hydroxide and acid, though
perhaps the proportion decomposed is not so large as in solutions
without an excess of ferric hydroxide, which is one of the products
of the decomposition.
   An experiment on the migration of acetic acid showed that the
velocity of the acetate group (C2H803) was, at all events, very small,
so that, as in the case of mineral acids, the conductivity is mainly
due to the motion of the hydrogen.

   The values are calculated from Kohlrauseh's theory for the same
strength of solution as that used for the direct observation.                   In
the case of copper, in decinormal copper chloride solution, there are
no migration data for this.          The velocity of the copper ion at infinite
dilution is given by Kohlrausch as 0-00031.                The sum of the ionic
velocities of cobalt nitrate in alcohol, as calculated from the con
ductivity, comes out 0-000079, and that for cohalt chloride 0-000060.
These numbers are to be compared with the sum of the observed
velocities given above, namely, 0-000079           and 0-00004S respectively.

     The LORD      KELVIN,    D.C.L., LL.D., President, in the Chair.
   His Royal Highness       the Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha              (elected
March   16, 1882) was admitted into the Society.
   A List  of the Presents received was laid on the table, and thanks
ordered for them.
   The following Papers were read       : —
I. " On the new Gas obtained from Urauinite. Fourth Note."
      By J. Norman Lockyer, C.B., F.R.S. Received May 28,
      1895.
   Continued experiments on the gases obtained by heating the
minerals broggerite and euxenite in vacuo have revealed the presence
in the spectrum of an important line in the infra-red. By comparisons
with the solar spectrum in the first order grating spectrum, the wave
length of the line has been approximately determined as 7065. There
can be little doubt, from the observations which have been made,
that this new line is coincident with a chromospheric line which
occurs in Tonng's list, having a frequency of 100, of which the
wave-length on Rowland's scale is stated to be 7065-5.
   It follows therefore that, besides the hydrogen lines, all three
chromospheric lines in Tonng's list which have a frequency of 100
have now been recorded in the spectra of the new gas or gases
obtained from minerals by the distillation method.
   These are as follows : —
                                   70655
                                   5875-98
                                   4471-8
   The wave-lengths of the lines are in Rowland's scale, as given in
Scheiner's "Astronomical Spectroscopy."*              In a partial revision of
his chromospheric list, Professor Young gives the corona line 5316-79
as also having a frequency of 100 in the chromosphere, but, up to the
present, this line has not been observed in the laboratory.

                     former                 pointed out the spectroscopic
                                             I
    evidence,   furnished by the isolation of lines in certain minerals,
    which indicates that the complete spectrum obtained when brog-
    gerite     submitted to the distillation method
                is                                            produced by
                                                                     is                          a
    mixture of gases.
       In order to test this view, have recently made some observations,
                                       I
    based on the following considerations.
       (1.) In a simple gas like hydrogen, when the tension of the electric
    current given by an induction coil        increased, by inserting first a
                                                   is
    jar, and then an air- break into the circuit, the effect    to increase the
                                                                         is
    brilliancy and the breadth of all the lines, the brilliancy and breadth
    being greatest when the longest air-break       used.  is
       (2.) Contrariwise,  when  we  are  dealing  with  a known compound
    gas; at the lowest tension we may get the complete spectrum of the
    compound without any trace of its constituents, and we may then,
    by  increasing the tension, gradually bring in the lines of the con
    stituents, until, when complete dissociation         finally reached, the
                                                                is
    spectrum of the compound itself disappears.
       Working on these lines, the spectrum of the spark at atmospheric
    pressure, passing through the gas, or gases, distilled from broggerite,
    has been studied with reference to the special lines            (hydrogen),
                                                                              C
,   Da, 667, and 447.
       The first result is that all the lines do not vary equally, as they
    should do    we were dealing with
                     if                    simple gas.

                                 is                                relatively     is
    more brilliant than the other lines     on increasing the tension,

194             On the neio Gas obtained from           Uraninite.     [June 13,
   The above observations were made with a battery of five Grove
cells ; the reduction of cells from 5 to 2 made no difference in the
phenomena except in reducing their brilliancy.
   Reasoning from the above observations, it seems evident that the
effect of the higher tension is to break up a compound, or compounds,
of which C, D3 and 447 represent constituent elements ; while, at the
same time, it would appear that 667 represents a line of some com
pound which is simultaneously dissociated.
   The unequal behaviour of the lines has been further noted in another
experiment, in which the products of distillation of broggerite were
observed in a vacuum tube and photographed at various stages.
After the first heating, D3 and 4471 were seen bright, before any
lines other than those of carbon and hydrogen made their appearance.
With continued heating,         667, 5016, and 492 also appeared, although
there was no notable increase of brightness in the yellow line; still
further heating introduced additional lines 5048 and 6347.
   These changes are represented graphically in the following
dingram (fig. 2).

                             when broggerite is heated.
   It  was recorded further that the yellow line was at times dimmed,
while the other lines were brightened.
   In my second note, communicated to the Royal Society on the 8th
instant,   I stated that   I  had never once seen the lines recorded by
Thaleu in the blue, at     \  4922 and 4715.
   It now seems possible that their absence from my previous tubes
was duo to the fact that the heating of the minerals was not
sufficiently prolonged to bring out the gases producing these lines.
   It is perhaps to the similar high complexity of the gas obtained
from cleveite that the curious behaviour of a tube which Professor
Ramsay was so good as to send me, must be ascribed.                       When   I
received it from him, the glorious yellow effulgence of the capillary,
while the current was passing, was a sight to see.                But after this
had gone on for some time, while the coincidence of the yellow line
with Ds of the chromosphere was being inquired into, the luminosity
of the tube was considerably reduced, and the colours in the capillary

 and near the poles were changed.     From the capillary there was but
a  feeble glimmer, not of an orange tint, while the orange tint was
now observed near the poles, the poles themselves being obscured
by a coating on the glass of brilliant metallic lustre.
    After attempting in vain for some time to determine the cause of
 the inversion of D3 and 447 in various photographs      I had obtained
 of the spectra of the products of distillation of many minerals, it
 struck me that these results might be associated with the phenomena
 exhibited by the tube, and that one explanation would be rendered
 more probable if it could be shown that the change in the illumina
tion of the tube was due to the formation of platinum compounds,
platinum poles being used.      On May 21st    I accordingly passed the
current and heated one of the poles, rapidly changing its direction
to assure the action of the negative pole, when the capillary shortly
 gave. a very strong spectrum of hydrogen, both lines and structure-
 A gentle heat was continued for some time and apparently the
 pressure in the tube varied very considerably, for as it cooled the
 hydrogen disappeared and the D3 line shone out with its pristine
 brilliancy. The experiment was repeated on May 24th and similar
 phenomena were observed.

                              Introduction.
   The two genera, Lyginodendron and Heterangium, are among the
most interesting and at the same time the most puzzling representa
tives of the Carboniferous flora.    Although we are still without any
satisfactory evidence as to the reproductive organs in either genus,
yet the organisation of their vegetative members is preserved with
such completeness and perfection        as to show that these fossils
present a combination of characters such as exists in no living group
of plants.
   The evidence afforded by the vegetative characters clearly points
to a position intermediate between ferns and Cycadeffi.

tional specimens, has enabled us to clear up many doubtful points in
the structure of the plant, and to give for the first time a complet-
account of all its vegetative organs.
                                    A. The Stem.
    1.   General  Structure. — The middle of the central         cylinder or stele
is occupied by a parenchymatous pith.                  Surrounding this is the
primary wood, which usually forms a ring of from five to eight distinct
strands.      Beyond this we find, in all but the youngest specimens, a
broad zone of secondary wood, then the cambium, and next the phloem.
The whole stele is bounded by a well-marked pericycle. The inner
cortex is mainly parenchymatous, while the outer zone consists of
alternating strands of fibres and parenchyma, constituting the well-
                                    "
known " dictyoxylou cortex of Count Solms-Laubach.
   The pericycle and cortex are traversed by the leaf-trace bundles,
which alternate with the perimedullary xylem-strands.
   2. Course of the Vascular Bundles. — We have obtained direct proof
that the perimedullary strands of xylem form the downward continua
tion of the bundles which pass out into the leaves.               Thus the entire
bundle-system       of the   stem is  built up  of  the leaf-traces.     Each leaf-
trace extends through at least ten internodes ; five internodes ar-
traversed while it is passing through cortex and pericycle, and five
more after it has reached the periphery of the pith. On entering the
pith the trace turns aside in the kathodic direction, and unites with
the adjacent perimedullary strand on that side.                 We thus see that
these strands are sympodial bundles, made up of the united lower
portions of adjacent leaf-traces.
    In the upper part of its course, each leaf-trace consists of two
btfndles, which unite into one in passing through the pericycle.
    The phyllotaxis was usually two-fifths, but in the smallest stems-
was probably one-third.
    3. Structure of the Vascular Bundles. — The preservation is so good
that we have been able to determine with certainty that the bundles
in the stem were normally collateral, having xylem on their inner,
and phloem on their outer side. As they passed out into the leaves

 their structure became concentric, the phloem here extending all
 round the xylem.
    The xylem of the bundles in the stem of Lyginodendron exactly
 resembles that in the leaves of existing Cycadeae.               The protoxylem
 lies in the interior of the primary wood, but near its outer side, so
 that the greater part of the primary wood was centripetally developed,
 while a smaller portion was centrifugal. We propose to term such
 bundles mesoxylic or mesarch.*           All statements as to the position of
 the protoxylem are based          on   longitudinal as well as on transverse
 sections.
    4. The Secondary Tissues. — A few young stems have been observed
 with little or no secondary thickening ; in most specimens it has
 made considerable progress.           A large amount of secondary wood and
 bast, both fascicular and interfascicular, was formed, by means of a
 normal cambial layer, which is often well preserved.
    The tracheides of the wood have numerous bordered pits on their
 radial surfaces. Similar elements occur in the primary wood also.
 The rows of tracheides are separated by numerous medullary rays.
    The phloem is often well preserved, so that primary and secondary
 phloem can be distinguished.
    The secondary tissues bear a general resemblance to those in the
 stems of Cycade».
    5. Pith and Pericycle. — Both these tissues contained nests of dark
 coloured elements, probably of a sclerotic nature.                 They are also
 traversed by numerous rows of cells with carbonaceous contents,
 which may have been secretory sacs, but not intercellular canals. At
 the outer border of the pericycle a characteristic internal periderm was
 developed.
    6. The Cortex. — The parenchymatous portions of the outer cortex
became much dilated in the older stems, in consequence of the
 secondary growth.
    7. On Small Stems of the Lyginodendron Type. — Certain very small
 stems have been described, differing in structure from the usual
form.     In some of these the primary xylem forms a continuous ring,
instead of being divided into distinct bundles. We now suggest that
these specimens may represent the basal, first-developed region, of
normal stems.          In Osmunda, which in many respects resembles
Lyginodendron, it has been shown by M. Leclerc du Sablon, that the
embryonic stem has the same peculiarity.
    8. Structural Anomalies. — Some of the specimens show remarkable
individual anomalies, the most freqnent and conspicuous of which
consists in the appearance of a cambium at the periphery of the pith,
   *  One of the authors has recently found that this peculiarity sometimes extends
to stem-structures  in Cycadese ; in the peduncles of both male and female flowers of
atangeria the bundles are often mesoxylic.

forming medullary wood and bast, with inverted orientation.           This
is precisely the anomaly shown by certain species of Tecoma, and
other dicotyledons.        The anomalous medullary cambium is con
tinuous with the normal cambium through the leaf-trace gaps.          This
case   is a striking instance of  the independent appearance  of  the same
structural peculiarity in families as remote as possible from each
other.
                                 B. The Leaf.
    1.  Connexion between Leaf and Stem.—^Nevv and conclusive evidence
has been found, confirming the conclusion previously arrived at (in
Mem. XVII), that " Rachiopteris aspera" is the petiole of Lygino-
dendron.      In several specimens petioles with the characteristic struc
ture of that fossil, are found inserted on the stems of Lyginodendron.
The vascular bundles on leaving the pericycle of the stem bend out
rapidly into the base of the leaf, becoming concentric at the same
time. Petioles, continuous with the Lyginodendron stem, have Y ien
traced up to the point where they begin to ramify.
    2. Form of the Leaf. — The petioles, which we now know to belong
to our plant, branch repeatedly, and ultimately give rise to small
palmately-segmented leaflets. The leaf was thus a highly compound
one, and we can confirm the statement previously made, that the
character of the foliage was that of Brongniart's form-genus
Sphenopteris.
    3. Structure of the Petiole. — The most important point here is that
throughout the petiole and rachis, the vascular bundles, of which
either one or two are present, are of typical concentric structure. as
in a fern.
    The cortex of the petiole has essentially the same structure as that
of the stem.
    4. Structure of the Lamina. — We have examined sections of leaflets
 (found in connexion with petioles of Lyginodendron), in which the
structure is perfectly preserved. The lamina had a distinctly bifacial
structure, with well-differentiated palisade, and spongy parenchyma.
 Stomata have only been observed on the lower surface. The vascular
bundles in the lamina appear to have been collateral, as is also the
case in recent ferns.
    5. On a Peculiar Bud-like Structure. — This is a unique specimen,
 consisting of an axis, of obscure structure, bearing numerous append
 ages which exactly resemble the well-known cortical outgrowths of the
stem and petiole of Lyginodendron. At first sight, the specimen bears
 some resemblance to a cone, but it was more probably a bud or young
 leaf, from which the inner delicate tissues have perished, leaving the
protective outer coat, bearing the appendages,      which may represent
the bases of pale®.

                                    C. The Boot.
     1. Connexion between Boot and Stem. — We have already briefly
 recorded onr discovery that " Kaloxylon Hookeri" is the root of
 Lyginodendron*       We have found that certain appendages of the
 stem of Lyginodendron, most of which were formerly described as
 " branches," are in
                       reality of endogenous origin, as is shown by the
 fact that the appendage, in passing through the cortex of the parent
 stem, is surrounded by a well-defined               cortex of its own. These
 appendages are further shown to be roots, by the structure of their
 central cylinder and their mode of branching.                Sections of the free
part of the same organs, which are in connexion with stems of
Lyginodendron, show that they agree in all respects with " Kaloxylon
 Hookeri," namely, in the structure and arrangement of both primary
 and secondary wood, and in the details of the cortex, which is well
 characterised hy its double or treble external or epidermal layer.
    We find then that the stem of Lyginodendron bore numerous
 adventitious roots, of endogenous origin, and that these roots are
 identical with the fossils previously described under the name of
 " Kaloxylon Hookeri."
    2. Primary Structure of the Boot. — All the specimens of
                                                                       " Kaloxylon
          "
 Hookeri have been re-examined, and are found to present a perfectly
 typical root-structure.        The stele varies from triarch to octarch
 structure in different specimens. The protoxylem is external, showing
 centripetal development of the primary wood.                 In favourable speci
 mens the regular alternation of the phloem-groups with those of
 xylem is quite clear. The stele has no pith, but there is a consider
able amonnt of conjunctive parenchyma.                  Both pericycle and endo-
 dermis are present.      The inner cortex contains abundant
                                                                        " secretory
sacs."
    The yonng roots much resemble the smaller adventitious roots of
Marattiaceae.
    3. Secondary  Tissues    of the  Boot. — These are beautifully preserved,
and are found at all stages of development.                The cambium is often
specially clear. Secondary growth began opposite the phloem-groups,
and the secondary wood is generally interrupted                     by large rays
opposite the protoxylem-strands.             The secondary tissues resemble
those of the stem.     The whole process of secondary growth was per
fectly normal, as in dicotyledons at the present day.
   4. Branching of the Boot. — The numerous specimens showing
branching prove that the rootlets were endogenous, and that they
arose opposite the protoxylem-groups of the main root.

                   D. Habit and Dimensions of        the Plant.
   In none of our authentic specimens is the stem more than 4 cm. in
thickness.    Certain cortical impressions, belonging to much larger
stems,   have   been referred        to Lyginodendron,    but on inconclusive
grounds.
   There is one large specimen showing structure, in which only the
secondary wood and portions of the pith are preserved.                So much of
the structure as remains agrees closely with that of Lyginodendron.
This specimen may have reached a diameter of 30 cm. or 40 cm., and
establishes a certain probability that L. Oldhamium, or some allied
species, may have attained the dimensions of a small tree.
   The ordinary specimens must have had upright stems of consider
able height, bearing spirally-arranged, compound, fern-like leaves,
separated by internodes about an inch long. The lower parts of the
stem gave off on all sides numerous adventitious roots.
   The entire absence of fructification is remarkable, considering the
great frequency and admirable preservation of our fossil.               It may be
explained, either on the hypothesis that        the leaves  bore very caducous,
fern-like sporangia, or by supposing that our material consists entirely
of immature specimens.
                                II.   Hetebangium.
                                    Introduction.
   The genus Heterangium differs conspicuously             from Lyginodendron,
in the structure of the stele of the stem, which in Heterangium con
tains no pith, but has a solid axis of primary wood.              In most other
respects the two genera much resemble each other.
                         i. Heterangium Grievii,    Will.*
   The original specimens of this species were derived from the
Burntisland deposits. At a later date, specimens were found in the
coal-measures of Dulesgate, Lancashire, which have been referred to
the same species, though they show some slight differences from the
original form.
                                   A. The   Stem.
   1.  General Structure. — The whole interior of the stele is occupied
by the primary wood, consisting of tracheides intermixed with con
junctive parenchyma.           In most specimens a certain amount of
secondary wood has been formed around the central mass.                   Outside

  the wood a zone of phloem can be traced, and this again is sur
  rounded by a parenchymatous belt, which we regard as pericycle.
  The inner cortex is characterised by the presence of horizontal plates
  of sclerotic tissue.   The outer cortical zone has a structure similar
  to that of Lyginodendron.      In the pericycle and cortex numerous
  leaf-trace bundles are met with.
      2. Course of the Vascular Bundles. — The bundles can be traced
  from the stele into the bases of the leaves.    Their arrangement indi
  cates that the phyllotaxis was three-eighths in the larger and two-
  fifths in the smaller stems.     Each leaf received a single bundle.
  The leaf-trace bundles can be followed downwards for some distance
 at the periphery of the stele, where they form distinct strands,
 though united with the axial wood.
     3. Primary Structure of the Stele and Leaf-trace Bundles. — Th-
 strands at the periphery of the stele, as well as the leaf-trace bundles
 with which they are continuous, have the same collateral and meso-
 xylic structure as the bundles in the stem of Lyginodendron, or the
 foliar bundles of Cycadeae. The essential difference from Lyginoden
 dron consists in the fact that in Heterangium these bundles are
 united by the axial xylem, which extends throughout the whole
 interior of the stele.    The primary tracheides, with the exception of
 those adjoining the protoxylem, have numerous bordered pits.
     4. The Secondary Tissues. — The secondary wood, when present,
 has essentially the same structure as in Lyginodendron.        Cambium
and phloem, in the normal position, are fairly preserved in some of
the specimens.
     5. The Cortex. — The most characteristic feature here consists in
the horizontal plates of sclerotic cells in the inner cortex.       Their
structure is precisely that of the   " stone-cells," found in the cortical
tissues of many recent plants.       Their presence in the cortex of the
stem is a point of difference from Lyginodendron, where the sclerotic
masses are usually limited to the pith and pericycle.
     6. Branching of the Stem. — In one specimen a young stem bears a
branch much smaller than itself.       This is the only distinct case of
branching observed in either genus. All other supposed branches
have turned out to be either petioles or adventitious roots.
                               B. The Leaf.
     1.   Connexion between Leaf and Stem. — The bases of petioles, in
connexion with the stem, have been observed both in transverse and
longitudinal section. These specimens show that the cortical tissues
of the petiole have the same characteristic structure as those of the
stem     ; we are thus enabled to recognise the petioles of Heterangium
Grievii when detached from the stem.           Unlike Lyginodendron, the

 202      Prof. W. 0. Williamson and Dr. D. H. Scott.                   [June  13,
 petiole of  H. Grievii usually receives from the            stem a single bundle
only.
    2. Form and Structure of the Leaf. — We find innumerable portions
of petioles, varying from 4 mm. to 0-4 mm. in diameter, sometimes
 branching, and intermixed with fragments of leaflets.                We can only
 infer that the leaf of H. Grievii was a highly compound one, probably
 not very different from that of Lyginodendron.
    The petiole is traversed by a single bundle of concentric structure.
 Thus the bundles underwent the same change on entering the leaf as
in Lyginodendron.
    The petioles bear a considerable resemblance to those of the latter
 plant, from which they chiefly differ in the absence of cortical out
 growths.
                                  C. The Boot.
    1. Connexion   between   Boot and Stem. — In several cases endogenous
appendages, evidently adventitious roots, havo been found arising
from the stems of H. Grievii.           In one specimen the bases of three
such roots are seen in a vertical row, and the connexion of their
tissues with those of the stem can be exactly traced.
    2. Structure of the Boot. — -We have good evidence, though not so
direct as in the case of Lyginodendron, that the roots of H. Grievii
                          " Kaloxylon "
also belonged to the                     type. A special form of root, with
a large tetrarch stele of characteristic shape, seems to be peculiar to
Heterangium.
                   D. Habit and Dimensions of         the  Flant.
   In habit, Heterangium Grievii must           have been similar to Lygino
dendron,    but its dimensions were considerably smaller.              Sporangia,
like those of ferns, have occasionally been found in close association
with the foliage, but not in connexion with it.
                       ii. Heterangium tiliceoides,     Will.
   This species differs from H. Grievii in several points, but evidently
belongs to the same genus.            The specimens are from the coal-
measures     of Halifax,*    and  are  remarkable for the astonishing per
fection with which the histological structure is preserved.                   The
general anatomy was fully described in 1887.                In primary structure
the stele agrees    with    that of  H.  Grievii,  but    the  peripheral bundles
are more distinct.        The secondary tissues are subdivided by broad.
primary rays (enormously dilated in the phloem), which correspond
to the conjunctive tissue separating the primary bundles. Cambium

 and phloem are perfectly preserved ; the latter is of great thickness,
 almost equal to that of the secondary wood. So perfect is the preser
 vation, that stages in the development of the tracheides from the
 cambium have been observed, while the compound sieve-plates on
 the radial walls of the sieve-tubes are quite clear.              Sclerotic groups
 occur in the pericycle, as well as in the cortex, and the leaf-trace
 bundles are in pairs — two points in which this species resembles
 Lyginodendron and differs from H. Grievii.                Thus the close relation
 ship of the two genera, in spite of the different arrangement of the
 primary wood, comes out even more clearly in this species than in
 H. Grievii.
    We have a single specimen of a Heterangium, which differs in
some respects from the two species above described, and may turn
out to represent a third type.
            III.  Affinities of Lyginodendron and Heterangium.
    The vegetative organs of these genera show a remarkable com
 bination of fern-like and cycadean characters.              The leaves of Lygino
 dendron, which are now well known, are so like fern-leaves, not only
 in form and venation but in minute structure, that if they stood
alone they would, without hesitation, be referred to Filices. Although
many leaves simulate those of ferns in external characters (Stangeria,
 Thalictrum, &c), none are known which at the same time show the
characteristic    anatomy of fern-leaves.          Hence we are led to attach
great weight     to  the   characters    of   the Lyginodendron foliage.       That
of Heterangium, though less well preserved, was evidently of the same
type.
   In Heterangium the primary structure of the                  stem is much    like
that of a monostelic fern such as Gleichenia, but the leaf-trace
bundles closely resemble the foliar bundles of a Cycad.
   In Lyginodendron the whole structure of the stem suggests a Cycad,
but with the remarkable peculiarity that the bundles here have the
structure which in Cycadeae is usually (though not always) limited to
those of the leaf.        The cycadean characters are too marked to be
accidental, though the general anatomy of Lyginodendron is not
inconsistent with a close relationship to ferns, for in Osmunda we
have a monostelic fern, with a large pith, collateral bundles in the
stem, and concentric ones in the leaf.*                 The mere occurrence of
secondary growth in a fern-like plant is not surprising, considering
that  it takes place in Botrychium and Helminthostachys at the present
day.
   In various respects Lyginodendron and Heterangium have points in
common with Gleicheniace», Osmundaceaa, MarattiacesB, Ophioglosseae,

  and Cycadesa.     The view of their affinities, which we snggest, is that
  they are derivatives of an ancient generalised race of ferns, from
   which they have already diverged considerably in the cycadean
   direction.  Of the two genera, Heterangium appears to be geologi
  cally the more ancient, and certainly stands nearer to the filicinean
   stock. Lyginodendron, while retaining conspicuous fern-like charac
  ters, has advanced much further on cycadean lines.         This view by
  no means involves the improbable assumption that these plants were
  the actual ancestors of existing Cycadeee.      How far their divergence
  from the fern stock had proceeded cannot be determined until we
  are acquainted with their organs of reproduction.
      The existence of a fossil group on the border-land of ferns and
 Cjcads seems now to be well established.           Count Solms-Laubach
  places his Prctopitys in this position, which is probably shared by
  Myeloxylon and Porozylon.        Messrs. Bertrand and Renault have
  indeed endeavoured to derive the last-named genus from Lyco-
 podiace®, and have extended the same view to Lyginodendron and
  Heterangium. In the latter cases their theory is completely negatived
 by the organisation of the leaves, and by many structural details.
      The relation of the genera which we have described to those
 ancient gymnosperms, the Cordaitece, will form one of the most
 interesting palaeobotanical problems of the future.

     In Leucosolenia coriacea the youngest spicules are found to be
surrounded by six cells, which are similar in all their characters to
the cells of the external flat epithelium of the sponge, and undoubtedly
derived from this layer. It appears that three cells of the external
epithelium wander inwards, and give rise to six by division of each
cell into two, the six cells being arranged in such a way, that three
are placed more internally, i.e., towards the gastral surface of the
body wall, and three more externally, towards the dermal surface.
Each of these sets of three cells has a form which might be compared
to a trefoil, and the whole mass may be described as two such trefoils
superposed, the cells of one trefoil exactly corresponding to those of
the other.
    The spicule is formed by the three inner cells, a ray being formed

 1895.]        the Triradiate Spicules of Leucoeolenia.               205
by each cell. In many instances it appears as if the three rays were
formed quite separately and afterwards fused at the centre.
   The three outer cells soon lose their rounded form, and by throwing
out processes, assume an amoeboid appearance. After the spicule
rays have attained a length of 10 or 15 ft, the three outer cells are no
more to be found, having apparently rejoined the flat epithelium from
whence they came.      The three inner cells alone secrete the rays and
continue to do so until the spicule is full grown.
   The spicule rays soon appear to project beyond their formative
cells, but are in reality covered by a thin layer of protoplasm.        At
the same time, the spicule sheath makes its appearance as a
denser layer of substance between the protoplasm of the formative
cell and the calcareous spicule, and it is by continued calcification of
the sheath that the spicule grows.
   The spicule rays attain their full thickness at their bases before
they have reached their full length.      The formative cells remain at
the bases of the rays   until this  portion is built up to its full thick,
ness.    Each formative cell then migrates along its ray towards the
tip, building up the ray to its full thickness as it goes. In the
fully formed ray the formative cell is found adherent to the extreme
tip.
                        Theoretical considerations.
                                                    —
    (1.) The origin of the spicule-forming cells that is to say, of the
whole connective tissue system in these sponges — from the external
flat epithelium, is another nail in the coffin of the so-called mesoderm
in these forms. Sponges are to be regarded as two-layered animals,
composed of a dermal and a gastral layer.            The dermal layer is
differentiated into (1) an external flat contractile epithelium, the
neuro-muscular system, and (2) an internal connective tissue layer.
The gastral layer consists of the collar cells. The amoeboid wander
ing cells are perhaps also to be reckoned with the gastral layer.
    (2.) The fact that each ray of a triradiate spicule is formed by a
single cell, shows that each triradiate spicule must be regarded as
derived from the fusion of three originally separate monactinal
spicules. This supports Schnlze's theory, namely, that the triradiates
of the more primitive Ascons have arisen as an adaptation to the
structure of the sponge, and goes against Dreyer's theory that the
primitive spicule of all sponges is a tetraxon, a form explained by
him as the direct mechanical outcome of the vesicular structure of
living bodies.

       of the Cortex Cerebri in the Bonnet Monkey (Macacos

    The object of this investigation        was   to trace     by the so-called
 anatomical method the degeneration resulting from minute lesions of
 the motor area of the cortex cerebri through the brain and spinal
 cord, to locate the path of the conducting fibres in the internal
 capsule and elsewhere, to follow them as far as possible to their
 destinations, and by snch control observations to check off the results
 obtained by previous excitation experiments.
                                Method Pursued.
    The animal selected for these experiments was the bonnet monkey
(Macacus Sinicus), and the lesions were made in the motor area of the
left hemisphere.       The records are here presented of degenerations
resulting from fourteen (14) successful operations, three being lesions
of the hallux centre, four of the thumb centre, and seven of four
separate centres in the facial area.         The animal being etherised the
skull was opened under strict aseptic precautions, and the centre to
be removed located by stimulation with a weak faradic current.                A
small portion of the cortex (generally about 16 sq. mm.) embracing
this centre was then excised, care being taken to remove with it a
portion of the underlying corona radiata, thus ensuring the removal
of all the cortical cells.    The scalp wound was closed with horse-hair
sutures and covered with borated cotton held in position by collodion.
The wound in every case healed by first intention and but slight and
transient paresis resulted.       The animals were killed in from 10 to
35 days after the operation, the brains and cords hardened in Muller's
fluid and stained by the Marchi method.
                Degeneration    following  the Hallux Lesions.
   The portion of the cortex removed in these cases was taken as
nearly as possible from the centre of the triangular space at the upper
extremity of the ascending frontal convolution formed by the longi
tudinal fissure and the fissure of Rolando, and extending down the
convolution to the posterior extremity of the superior frontal sulcus.
   Numerous degenerated association fibres, both coarse and fine, were
found passing to the central convolutions down to the level of the

inferior genu of the fissure of Rolando          ;  fine fibres only passed to the
superior parietal lobule ; degenerate fibres, mostly fine, were traced
to the posterior portion of the superior frontal convolution ; both
coarse and fine to the lobulus paracentralis ;                  fine only to the
precuneus, and a very little fine degeneration to the gyrus fornicatus.
The degenerate fibres crossing in the corpus callosum were very fine
and occupied the middle third of its antero-posterior extent.                 This
corresponded very closely with the antero-posterior extent of the
ascending parietal convolution at this level. Degenerate fibres could
be traced into the convolutions of the right hemisphere corresponding
to the distribution of the degeneration in the left, but considerably
less in amount, and the area of distribution being rather less exten
 sive.    Both coarse and fine degenerate fibres, varying considerably in
 amount in different animals, pass from the lesion through the mesial
 half of the centrum semiovale to the left internal capsule, in the lower
 levels of which they are located in the middle third of the posterior
 limb. From the internal capsule most of the fine degeneration passes
 into the optic thalamus.          In the left- cms the degeneration is very
 evenly scattered over the middle third, and many coarse degenerate
 fibres pass from here into the substantia nigra.             At the decussation of
 the pyramids the tract divides, the larger portion crossing to the oppo
 site lateral column while the smaller goes to that of the same side (t ide
  Preliminary Report*). The amount of degeneration passing to the
 lateral column of the same (left) side varies from a third of all the
 degeneration in one case to about a twentieth in the other two. In
 each case a small number of degenerate fibres remain in the left
 anterior column after the completion of the decussation. The amount
  varies in different cases and is not apparently dependent on the
 proportion of degenerate fibres passing to the lateral column of the
 same side.       The relations and extent of the degenerated areas remain
 unchanged throughout the cervical and dorsal cord. The degenera
 tion in the crossed tract of each side is evenly scattered over its entire
 area, the two sides only differing in the density of the degeneration.
     In the upper cervical region the tendency of the crossed tract to
  mingle with or encroach on the boundaries of the direct cerebellar
  tract is well illustrated.     In the lumbar region the degeneration in
  each crossed     tract and in  the  left anterior column (Tooth) begins to
  go out, and. in the only case examined at that level the degeneration
  bad not all disappeared at the level of the third sacral root.

   intra-parietal sulcus and the fissure of Rolando, and a little above the
   inferior genu of the fissure of Rolando (Beevor and Horsley).          In
   these cases the majority of the degenerated association fibres pass to-
   the ascending frontal and ascending parietal convolutions, rather
   more to the latter than to the former.         In these lesions of the
   thumb centre degenerate fibres were distributed to these two convolu
   tions from the border of the longitudiual fissure nearly to the fissure
   of Sylvius, the fibres passing upward from the lesion being coarse,
   while those passing downward were fine.         Fine degeneration was
   traced into the posterior portion of the middle and inferior frontal
   convolutions, and in one case to the supra marginal and angular gyri.
   In two cases it was also found passing to the upper or posterior
   portion of the superior temporal convolution.       In various instances
  a few degenerate fibres passed to the precuneus and lobus quadratus
  and paracentralis and to the gyrus fornicatus.
      There is considerable variation in the size of the fibres crossing
  in the corpus callosum after lesion of the thumb centre.             With
  slight variations it was situated in the middle third. The distribu
  tion of the degenerate fibres to the convolutions           of the right
  hemisphere corresponds very closely to that         in   the left, though
  less in amount and slightly less in area.        The same arrangement
  of the coarse and fine fibres observed on the left side prevails on
  the right — coarse above the lesion, fine below.        The degeneration
  passing from the lesion downward through the centrum semiovale is-
 both coarse and fine.     These fibres are more scattered and the area
 of degeneration    is greater than that in lesions of the hallux centre,
 both laterally and antero-posteriorly.      In one case only was there
 any apparent separation of the coarse and fine fibres in the centrum
 semiovale, and there the coarser fibres were anterior to the fine.     The
 same arrangement prevails in the internal capsule, the coarser fibres,
 representing the pyramidal fibres being found (in the lower levels)
 in the middle third of the posterior limb, while the fine fibres, mostly
 representing the corona radiata thalami, are largely situated in the
 posterior third of the posterior limb.    Between the upper and lower
 levels of the capsule there is a movement of the degeneration for
ward, and in the lower levels most of the fine degeneration has
already passed into the thalamus.       In one case a little fine degenera
tion was found in the right internal capsule occupying a position
corresponding to that of the fine degeneration in the left capsule.
This all passed into the right thalamus. In another case both coarse-
and fine degenerate fibres were found in the right capsule occupying
the same position and pursuing the same course as the corresponding-
fibres on the left side.    These fibres come from the area of degenera
tion in the right centrum semiovale, into which the fibres crossing       in
the corpus callosum could be traced, but no continuous fibres could.

  The coarse degeneration, mixed with more or less fine, is found in
  the middle third of the crns.       In each case some fine degeneration
  reaches the crns, where it invariably takes its position external to
  the coarse fibres.     In the entire group a large proportion of the
  degeneration passes    to  the substantia nigra.    This varies from a half
  to nearly the whole of the degeneration reaching the crus.           The fine
  degeneration referred to external to the coarse disappears from the
  crus, but could not be traced to its destination.      The coarse degenera
  tion observed in one case in the right internal capsule reached the
  crus, where all but a few fibres disappeared.         In one case the last
  remaining degenerate      fibres disappeared  in  the  upper levels of the
  pons.    In another about half those remaining disappeared in the
  lower pons and upper medulla, but could not be traced after leaving
  the pyramidal tract.      In one case only was there a division of the
  degenerated tract at the decussation of the pyramids, such as was
 observed in lesions of the hallux centre, and the amount of degenera
  tion passing to the left lateral column was less than in either of the
 hallux cases. This was also the only case in which a few degenerate
 fibres remained in the left anterior column after the completion of
 the decussation.      In one of the remaining cases the few degenerate
 fibres remaining in the left anterior column cross to the right lateral
 column, and in the other the degeneration in each pyramid apparently
 goes to the crossed tract of the opposite side.        In each of the three
 cases in which the degeneration reaches the cervical cord, its amount
 and relations remain unchanged in the upper and middle cervical
            '
 regions.      From the level of the seventh cervical root downward the
 degenerate fibres steadily and gradually disappear, and at the level
 of the third dorsal root there are none left, thus confirming the
results obtained by excitation of the nerve roots (Ferrier and Yeo,
 Forgne,   Ac.).

    Seven     successful  experiments were performed to determine if
possible the degeneration resulting from minute lesions within the

Sylvius and just anterior to the plane of the fissure of Rolando,
representing the movement of opening the mouth straight ; in one
the lesion was in the same level, and just posterior to the fissure of

mouth towards the opposite side ; in one the lesion was just above
the fissure of Sylvius and anterior to the plane of the sulcus trans-
versalis frontalis inferior, and the movement represented was the
                                                                   Q 2

rhythmical movement of mastication.         In the other experiment the
portion of cortex removed was in the level of the inferior genu of the
fissure of Rolando, between the fissure of Rolando and the precentral
sulcus, and the movement obtained on stimulation was elevation of the
opposite angle of the mouth. None of the brains in this group were
examined above the level of the inferior genu of the fissure of Rolando.
In three cases, one of lesion of the mastication centre and two of lesion
of the centre for opening the mouth, only fine degeneration resulted
from the lesion ; in the other four both coarse and fine. In two
cases of " opening mouth
                             " and in the lesion
                                                 posterior to the plane of
the fissure of Rolando, coarse degenerate association fibres were only
found in the upper levels of the lesion or above, where they were mixed
with more or less fine, the proportion of coarse to fine increasing from
the lesion upward, while the aggregate amount of degeneration
decreased.    In all the lesions on the border of the fissure of Sylvius
anterior to the fissure of Rolando, most of the degeneration was found
in the ascending frontal convolution from the border of the fissure of
Sylvius to the level of the inferior genu of the fissure of Rolando.
In the lesion of the mastication centre all the degeneration was very
fine, and in the left hemisphere, with the exception of a few fibres
near the base in the ascending parietal, the degenerate association
fibres were confined to the ascending frontal convolution.         In the
four lesions of the centre for opening the mouth degenerate associa
tion fibres were also distributed to the ascending parietal, the
posterior half of the inferior frontal, and the posterior or upper
extremity of the superior temporal convolutions.           In only one of
these four cases was any degeneration found in the inferior temporal
convolution.    In the lesion posterior to the plane of the fissure of
Rolando both coarse and fine degeneration was distributed to the
central convolutions, the fine degeneration above the lesion being
mixed (as noted above) with coarse fibres, which were more
numerous in the ascending parietal convolution.          No degeneration
was traced into the frontal convolutions in this case, but a good deal
of coarse degeneration passed from the superior temporal convolution
to the posterior extremity of the internal capsule, whez-e it turned
 downward and forward in the posterior limb.         A mingling of this
 with the degeneration in the internal capsule coming from the lesion
 could not be demonstrated.      In the case of the lesion on the upper
 border of the facial area the coarse degenerated association fibres are
 almost entirely confined to the neighbourhood of the lesion.           In
 addition to this, fine degeneration is distributed to the central convo
 lutions nearly to the fissure of Sylvius. The degeneration in the
 supra-marginal gyrus and in the inferior frontal convolution is much
 more than in any other experiment, the degeneration in the latter
 convolution reaching to the anterior extremity of the precentral

anlens.     No degeneration in this case was found in the temporal
lohe. In all directions the amount of degeneration decreased as the
distance from the lesion increased.
    The size of the degenerate fibres crossing in the corpns callosum
corresponded to that of the fibres proceeding from the lesion, i.e., in
each case in which both coarse and fine fibres were found proceeding
from the lesion both coarse and fine fibres crossed in the corpus
 callosum.     The coarse fibres in the corpus callosum were finer than
the coarse fibres elsewhere, and much less numerous than the fine
fibres.     In all the lesions anterior to the plane of the fissure of
 Rolando the degeneration was in the posterior two-thirds of the
 anterior half of the corpus callosum. Following the one lesion pos
terior to the plane of the fissure of Rolando it was in the middle third,
 thus corresponding to the hallux and thumb lesions. The convolu
 tions of the right hemisphere were examined in four cases, and, with
 the exception of the case of the lesion of the mastication centre, the
 degeneration, while corresponding to that on the left side, was rather
 less extensive and less in amount.     The majority of the degeneration
 was in all cases distributed to the central convolutions.    In the case
 of the lesion of the mastication centre the degeneration was even
 more extensive and of about equal amount on the right side.           In
 most of these cases but little of the degeneration passing from the
lesion to the left internal capsule appears in the centrum semiovale
 as it reaches the capsule by passing over and around the anterior
 angle of the putamen at a lower level.     As much of this as reaches
 the centrum semiovale, together with the fibres going to the corpus
 callosum, occupies a more extensive area than in either the hallux or
 thumb lesions, corresponding to the antero-posterior extent of both
 central convolutions.    The angle of the mouth centre was the only
 case in which both coarse and fine fibres degenerated from the lesion
in which there was not marked grouping of the coarse fibres anterior
 to the fine.
    In all the lesions of the facial area the degenerations in the upper
 most levels of the capsule, i.e., the coarser fibres which pass down
 through the capsule, are situated in its anterior portion, and in the
 lower levels move backward till they occupy in the lower levels the
 middle third of the posterior limb.      Between the upper and lower
 levels of the capsule most of the fine degeneration passes from
 the posterior limb into the thalamus.     In the lesion of the mastica
 tion centre, though the degeneration in the capsule is all fine, but
 little passes to the thalamus.       In the three cases referred to in
 which there were only fine degenerate fibres, a varying amount of
 fine degeneration was observed in the posterior limb of the right
 internal capsule corresponding in position to that in the left. In one
 opening of the mouth lesion the amount on the right side was nearly

 212     Dr. E. L. Mellus.     Experimental Degenerations       [Jtuie  13,
 half as much as on the left, in another it was nearly equal on the two
 sides, and in the lesion of the mastication centre there was quite as
 mnch on the right as on the left side. In the other four lesions of
 the facial area there was no degeneration observed in the right
 internal capsule. In the lesion of the centre for the angle of the
mouth degenerate fibres were observed in the striations of the right
thalamus, some of them being pretty coarse.            In two cases fine
degeneration was observed crossing in the posterior commissure. In
the three cases in which fine degeneration only resulted from the
lesion, most of this disappears before reaching the crus. In the
lesion of the mastication centre it could not be traced, but in the
other two it passed to the thalamus from both left and right capsule.
In all three a small amount of fine degeneration was found in the
middle third of both crura.        In one case this passed to the sub
stantia nigra, but in the other two it could not be traced. In the
other four lesions of the facial area the coarse degeneration from the
left internal capsule was scattered very evenly over the middle third
of the crus encroaching a little upon the lateral third. Some of the
fibres passed into the substantia nigra or the sub-thalamic region, and
in one case a considerable number to the anterior corpus quadri-
geminum.      The remaining degenerate fibres begin to leave the left
pyramid at the junction of the pons and medulla, passing as single
degenerate fibres to the facial nucleus of one or the other side.
Below the level of the facial nuclei these fibres pass to the motor
nuclei of the glosso-pharyngeus and the vagus on both sides, the
majority crossing the raphe to reach the nucleus on the opposite side.
Occasional fibres were observed, which apparently passed to some
termination dorsal to these nuclei.       This movement of degenerate
fibres continued as far as the sensory decussation.      A few degenerate
fibres (probably thumb or finger fibres) remained in the pyramid,
and crossed in the decussation to the right lateral column, and dis
appeared in the lower cervical or upper dorsal region. No degenerate
fibres remained in the left anterior column after the decussation, and
there was no apparent division of the tract, as in hallux and thumb
lesions.
    Under the head of "other appearances resembling degeneration"
are recorded appearances which are of doubtful significance, but yet
so closely resemble degeneration that they are well calculated to
deceive and lead one into grave error.       Among these may be men-
 tioned apparent degeneration in the left lateral geniculate body and
 optic radiation, in the posterior longitudinal fasciculi, the roots of all
the motor cranial nerves of both sides and the corpus trapezoides
(Marchi), and in one case extensive degeneration in the optic tract.
The degenerations in the roots of the motor cranial nerves and in the
corpus trapezoides could hardly have been due to the lesions, as

   1895.]   following Unilateral Lesions of the Cortex Cerebri.          213
   exactly the same appearances were found in the brains of control
  animals in which there was no lesion.
      In the general summary attention is called to the fact that the dis
   tribution of the degenerate association fibres in the thumb lesions corre
  sponded with the measurements made by Bevan Lewis of the corpuscles
  of the fourth layer of the cortex in this region, i.e., that coarse fibres
  were distributed to the upper part of the motor area and fine fibres
  to the lower part.    In four of the experiments (one thumb and three
  facial) neither pyramidal fibres nor fibres connecting the nuclei of the
  cranial nerves directly with the cortex were found to have degene
  rated. Yet in each of these cases the characteristic movement was
  obtained from stimulation of the area removed quite as readily as in
  any other case. The degenerate fibres passing through the internal
  capsule in these cases apparently belong to two distinct systems,
  which are also more or less represented in the other experiments.
  One of these, composed almost entirely of fine fibres, passes from the
  posterior limb of the internal capsule into the outer surface of the
 optic thalamus, and represents the corona radiata thalami.           These
  fibres are to some extent mixed with the pyramidal fibres in the
 posterior limb of the internal capsule, but are mostly situated in the
 posterior third, and, as they pass from there into the thalamus, make
 room for the entrance of the sensory (non-excitable) tract.            The
 other of the two systems referred to, largely composed of coarser
 fibres, passes through the internal capsule into the cms, and appa
 rently ends in the substantia nigra. These fibres are of much the
 same calibre, and apparently occupy the same position in the internal
 capsule and crus as the true pyramidal fibres. Both these tracts
appear to arise in all portions of the motor cortex coming within the
 range of these experiments.       All the degenerated pyramidal fibres
 from the hallux and thumb lesions were found to enter the capsule at
or near the posterior extremity, while the corresponding fibres from
 the facial lesions entered the capsule at or near the anterior
extremity, and the former were displaced forward and the latter
backward until in the lower levels of the capsule they all found a
place in the middle third of the posterior limb. It is also shown that
a line can be drawn from the fissure of Sylvius upward, so dividing
the motor area into two parts, that all the facial lesions from which
fibres enter the anterior portion of the capsule would be in the
anterior division, and all the hallux and thumb lesions from which
fibres enter the posterior portion of the capsule would be in the
posterior division.    In the movement of the facial fibres backward
between     the   upper and lower levels of the capsule they would
necessarily, at some level, envelop the genu, which would account
for the fact that they have always been described as occupying that
position.    The location of these degenerations in the internal capsule

214      On the Differences  in Lichtenberg   's  Dust-Figures.    [June 13,
corresponds very closely with the results of excitation of the fibres in
the living animal of the same species (Beevor and Horsley).            In all
the cases in which there was coarse degeneration in the internal
capsule it was, with two exceptions (both hallux cases) grouped on
the outer edge of the capsule. Attention is called to the fact that a
large proportion of the coarser fibres passing down through the
capsule enter the substantia nigra, and these experiments show this
tract to be nearly or quite as large as that passing down into the
pyramid. These are apparently fibres which have been looked upon as
                                                "
pyramidal, and, as the "pyramidal tract has been shown to be even,
more extensive in the medulla and below the decussation than in the
internal capsule, it follows that the fibres passing to the substantia
nigra are probably replaced by others arising at lower levels. These
degenerations show that in the monkey the facial fibres are situated
in the middle third of the crns, in which they are mingled with the
fibres of the pyramid, and that they do not occupy a space by them
selves mesial to the pyramid.
VI.    " On the Cause of the Differences in Lichtenberg's Dust-
       Figures : Preliminary Note." By Silvanus P. Thompson,
       D.Sc., F.R.S. Received May 9, i895.
    As ordinarily produced by dusting a mixture of red-lead and lyco-
podium upon a surface which has been charged by contact with the
knob of a Leyden jar, the dust-figures present a remarkable and
 hitherto unexplained difference of form.        The positive figures consist
of white lines branching in stellate or dendritic patterns, whilst the
 negative figures exhibit red patches of circular or ovate outline.      The
 differences, save in the matter of colour, are not due to the powders used
 nor to the nature of the dielectric surface chosen for the experiment.
 They vary only slightly with the nature of the gas ; but are more
 considerably altered by the rarefaction of the air. The author found
 that the dendritio patterns of the positive figures are correlated to
 the brush form of discharge, whilst the rounded patches of the
 negative figures are due to the silent discharge of electrified winds.
 When polished metal surfaces are used in air for producing the
 discharges (as in the usual case when the knob of a Leyden jar is
 employed), negative electrification more readily discharges itself in a
 wind, positive electrification less readily, disruptively, as a brush.
 But where a smooth surface of a peroxide, such as the peroxide of
 lead, is substituted for a metal knob, positive electrification will dis
 charge itself as a wind, giving rise to white positive figures of
 rounded outline ; while negative electrification will under certain
 conditions produce a brush discharge from the peroxide surface,

differences to be analogous to the differences observed in the experi

VII.   "Theorems on the Attraction of Ellipsoids for certain
      Laws of Force other than the Inverse Square."                            By
      E. J. Routh, F.R.S. Received May 11, 1895.
                                        (Abstract.)
   The object of the author is to find finite expressions for the
potentials of an ellipsoidal shell, and of a solid ellipsoid when th-
law of force is the inverse K,h power of the distance, k being positive
or negative. It is shown in the beginning of the paper that the two
cases in which k is an even integer and an odd integer require dif
ferent treatment.
   After discussing          some   special cases, we come to the first general
theorem       Supposing that k is even and that the shell is a thin
homogeneous homoeoid, the potential is found to assume very differ
ent forms according as k is greater or less than 3, so that the law of
the inverse square is just on one side of the boundary.                 When <c>3,
the potential can be completely integrated, and an expression is
found containing |(«— 2) terms, and involving only the differentia
tion of an integral rational function of xyz of k— 4 dimensions.              The
general   form    at   an   internal  point  is

being 0(f>/z) where 0 is a function of i dimensions, different cases

are found to arise according as k is greater or less than 3 and i
greater or less than k— 2.   If k>3 and £<«— 2 the potential can he
completely integrated.     A finite expression is given containing not
more than k— 3 terms, and involving differential coefficients of an
integral rational function of xyz.    For an internal point the general
form is
where A and A' are two differential operators, and 2 implies summa
tion from h = 0 to k— 4.  The potential is also found for an external
point.  If i> k—2 or k<3 the potential contains a single integral '
which reduces to a known form when we can put ic = 2. There are
two standard expressions, one of which is of the form

   Passing on to      solid ellipsoid the potentials at an internal point
                        a
for both  a  homogeneous and a heterogeneous ellipsoid are discussed
both when *:> and <3 and finite expressions are found, which reduce
to known forms when k — 2.         When the point       external and the            is
strata are similar ellipsoids with any law of density, expressions for
the potential are found for the cases <c=             and 10. These are
                                                                     4,   6,   8,
reduced to depend on a single integral.       Except when k =       these                           4,
can be completely integrated when the solid         homogeneous and in    is
some  other cases.
   When k      an odd integer, there
              is                           division of cases according as
                                                       is   a
k is < or >2. In the first of these cases, finite expressions for the
potential of a thin homcooid are found (1) when homogeneous, and
(2) when heterogeneous. There are corresponding expressions for a
solid ellipsoid.    As explained in the text, these results differ in form
rather than in substance from some already known, but they are
treated in    different manner.

    In the   second case, when              k >   2,   the integrations become very long.
Finite expressions for the potential of a homogeneous homoeoid are,
however, found (1) when the force varies as the inverse cube, and (2)

-when the force varies as the inverse       «th power, and k > 3, the formulae
for the inverse cube being much simpler than for any greater power.
   Lastly, the potential of a special elliptic disc is discussed which has
the property that the level surfaces are confocals, the force varying
as any odd inverse power greater than the square.
   In this list only those properties have been mentioned which the
author believes to be new.

    In view of the numerous magnetic surveys of different countries
which have been made in recent years, it seems important              to call
attention to the increasing value of magnetic surveys made over that
much larger area of the earth, the sea ; the coasts washed by the
sea ; magnetic disturbances proceeding from land under the sea, and
the settlement of the question of tho direction of the iso-magnetics
when passing from deep water to the land.

     The magnitude of the subject is self evident, therefore it is pre
  sumed that under existing circumstances of paucity of information ,
  any well conducted series of observations of the kind required will
  be welcomed.

                                                                survey the
  West Coast of Australia, proceeding there by way of the Suez Canal,
  it was decided to equip that vessel with the necessary absolute
  magnetic instruments for observations on land and other necessary
  instruments for relative observations on board the ship.              The
  " Penguin "
                being practically an iron ship, general observations of
  the magnetic elements at sea were not undertaken, but the special
 attention of the observing officers was directed to obtaining the
 following observations : —
     (1.) The magnetic elements on land at all ports visited.
     (2.) Local magnetic disturbances on islands.
     (3.) The magnetic survey of the West Coast of Australia, which,

  until the " Meda's                               was a terra incognita as
 far as the inclination and force were concerned.
     (4.) The position and extent of an area of remarkable local
 magnetic disturbance, reported by H.M. surveying vessel Meda
                                                                   "      "
 as situated under the sea at Port Walcott (N.W. Australia) and two-
miles from the visible land.
     With regard to (1) — A series of observations with the absolute
 instruments were made at twenty-three different places situated on •
 the route from Malta, via Australia, to Hong Kong. These are
 shown    in Table I.
     For (2) — Observations of local magnetic disturbance on land were
made      at Perim Island and Baudin Island (N. Australia).              At
Perim the principal disturbance was found         in the inclination, being
about 1^° to 2° in value. At Baudin Island, the declination was
disturbed 5^°, the inclination 2f°. Horizontal force undisturbed.
    For (3) — The magnetic elements were observed at twelve stations
between King George's Sound and Baudin Island.
    With regard to (4), the chief interest lies in the area of disturbance
termed a " magnetic shoal," from its situation at 9 fathoms below
the sea level. Four days were devoted to the survey of this shoal,
whilst observations were being made on the neighbouring land.
(Data contained in Tables        III and IV.)    This survey was neces
sarily carried out on board the ship with the relative instruments.
    The results were the mapping of an area of magnetical disturbance
3£ miles long by   If miles average width, extending in a north-easterly
direction. The positions of the greatest easterly disturbance and
westerly disturbance having been found in proximity to one another,
the ship was moored in the neighbourhood, and observations of decli
nation, inclination, and total force made. From these a sectional

plan of the magnetic rock causing the disturbance has been made,
and, together with the complete set of observations, the following
results have been deduced.
   The cause of the disturbance is a ridge of rock permanently magne
tized, repelling the north-seeking end of the needle. In the trans
verse section this ridge is steeper on the south-east side where the
disturbances are at a maximum than on the north-west side. Longi
tudinally the ridge rises rather abruptly to a principal peak (as
determined by the point of maximum disturbance of the vertical
force), followed by a depression, and a second peak, finally falling
abruptly to the level.
   The principal values of the disturbances caused by this ridge are —
      Declination              56°  E. on   S.E. side, 26° W. on N.W. side.
      Inclination               —29°.
      Horizontal force.     .   —  L92 on S.E. side     ;  +104 on N.W. side.
      Vertical force . .    .   — 4-44 metric units.
   A geological survey of the coast at the Red Cliff (see map), where
the greatest disturbances of the magnetic elements were observed, was
made, and specimens of rock and sand were obtained which have
since been tested for susceptibility.          The evidence from these does
not give any direct information tending to show the exact nature of
the rock causing the remarkable disturbances over the magnetic
shoal, but the character of the disturbances caused by the visible and
invisible land are of a similar character.
   Five diagrams are appended showiug the data from which the
foregoing results have been deduced, with a map showing the position
of the " magnetic shoal " relative to the neighbouring land. Also a
geological map of the Red Cliff and neighbourhood.
II. " A    Dynamical Theory of the Electric and Luminiferous

        Larmob, F.R.S., Fellow of St. John's College, Cambridge.

   In  a previous paper       on this subject,* it has been shown that by
means of a     rotationally elastic fflther, which otherwise behaves as a
perfect fluid, a concrete realization of MacCullagh's optical theory can
be obtained, and that the same medium affords a complete repre
sentation of electromotive phenomena in the theory of electricity.
The ponderomotive electric forcives were, on the other hand, deduced

 from the principle of energy, as the work of the surplus energy in
 the field, the motions of the bodies in the field being thus supposed
 slow compared with radiation.         It was seen that in order to obtain
 the correct sign for the electrodynamic forcives between current
 systems, we are precluded from taking a current to be simply a
 vortex ring in the fluid aether ; but that this difficulty is removed by
 taking a current to be produced by the convection of electrons or
 elementary electric charges through the free asther, thus making the
 current effectively a vortex of a type whose strength can be altered
 by induction from neighbouring             currents.      An electron occurs
 naturally   in   the  theory  as  a centre or  nuclens    of rotational strain,
 which can have a permanent existence in the rotationally elastic
 aether, in the same sense as a vortex ring can have a permanent
 existence in the ordinary perfect fluid of theoretical hydrodynamics.
    In the present paper a further development of the theory of elec
 trons is made.        As a preliminary, the consequences, as regards pon-
deromotive      forces,  of treating an element of current i£* as a separate
dynamical entity, which were indicated in the previous paper, are
here more fully considered. It is maintained that a hypothesis of
this kind would lead to an internal stress in a conductor carrying a
current, in addition to the forcive of Ampere which acts on each
element of the conductor at right angles to its length.             Though this
stress is self-equilibrating as regards the conductor as a whole, yet
when the conductor is a liquid, such as mercury, it will involve a
change of fluid pressure which ought to be of the same order of
magnitude as the amperean forcive, and therefore capable of detec
tion whenever the latter is easily observed. Experiments made by
Professors FitzGerald and Lodge on this subject have yielded purely
negative results, so that there is ground for the conclusion that the
ordinary current-element              cannot be legitimately employed in
framing a dynamical theory.
    This result is entirely confirmed when we work out the properties
of the field of currents, considered as produced by the convection of
electrons.       There can be no doubt that a single electron may be
correctly   taken   as an independent element of the medium for dynamical
purposes ; so that electrodynamical relations deduced from a statistical
theory of moving electrons will rest on a much surer basis than those
derived from the use of a hypothetical current-element of the ordi
nary kind, in cases where they are in discrepancy.
    Now it is shown that an intrinsic singularity in the aether, of the
form of an electron e, moving with velocity (i, y, i) relative to the
qniescent mass of Hither, is subject to a force       e   (P, Q, R), given by
equations of the form

in which (a, h, c) is the velocity of flow of the aether where the electron
is situated, and is equal to the curl of (F, G, H) in such way that
the latter is Maxwell's vector potential given by the formulae of the
type
                        <.JHK-0«);*'
and where + is the electrostatic potential due to the electrons in the
field, so that ^ = c22e/r, where c is the velocity of radiation.         These
equations    are   proved  to hold good, not   merely   if the  motions  of the
electrons are slow compared with radiation, as in the previous paper,
but quite irrespective of how nearly they approach that limiting
value ; thus the phenomena of radiation itself are included in the
analysis.
   An element of volume of an unelectrified material medium contains
as many positive electrons as negative.         This force (P, Q, R) tends
to produce electric separation in the element by moving them in oppo
site directions, leading to an electric current in the case of a conductor
whose electrons are in part free, and to electric polarization in the
case of a dielectric whose electrons are paired into polar molecules.
In the former case, the rate at which this force works on a current of
electrons (u', t-', to'), is Pu' + Qr' + Rto' ; it therefore is identical with
the electric force as ordinarily defined in the elementary theory of
steady currents.       In the case of a dielectric it represents the ordinary
electric force producing polarization.         So long as a current is pre
vented from flowing, the pondero motive force acting on the element
of volume of the medium is the one of electrostatic origin due to
such polarization as the element may possess, for as the element is
unelectrified it contains as many positive electrons as negative. But
if a current is flowing, the first two terms of (P, Q, R), instead of
cancelling for the positive and negative electrons, become additive,
as change of sign of the electron is accompanied by change of sign of
its velocity ; so that there is an electrodynamic force on the element of
 volume,
                   (X, Y, Z) = (r'o — w'b,  w'a — u'c, u'b — v'a),
 where, however, («', v', to') is the true current composed of moving
 electrons, not the total circuital current (u, r, w) of Maxwell, which
 includes the rotational displacement of the free ajther in addition
 to the drift of the electrons.
    The electric force (P, Q, R) as thus deduced agrees with the form
 obtained originally by Maxwell* from the dh-ect consideration
 of his concrete model of the electric field, with idle wheels to

 Papers,' vol. 1, pp. 450—512.

 represent electrification.  It has been pointed out by vonlHelmholtz
 and others, that the abstract dynamical analysis given in his Treatise
does not really lead to these equations when all the terms are retained ;
 this later analysis proceeds, in fact, by the use of current-elements,
 which form an imperfect representation, iu that they give no account
of the genesis of the current by electric separation in the element of
 volume of the conductor.
    The ponderomotive force (X, Y, Z) is at right angles to the direc
 tion of the true current, and is precisely that of Ampere in the ordi
 nary cases where the difference between the true current and the
total current is inappreciable.       It differs from Maxwell's result in
involving true current instead of total current ; that is, the forcive
tends to move an element of a material body, but there is no such
forcive tending to move an element of the free aether itself.       In this
respect it differs also from the hypothesis underlying von Helmholtz's
recent treatment of the relations of moving matter to fflther.
    When we treat of a single electron, (a, 6, c) is the flow of the aether
where it is situated.     When we treat of an element of volume with
its contained electrons, (a, 6, c) becomes the smoothed out, or averaged,
flow of the aether in the element of volume ; it is circuital because
the aether is incompressible, and thus it represents the magnetic
induction of Maxwell.
  When magnetic polarization         of the medium contributes to the
forcive, it is necessary to divide (a, b, c) into two parts, one part
(a, /3, 7) contributed by the medium as a whole, and independent of
the surroundings of the element, and the other representing the effect
of the polarization in the immediate neighbourhood ; the former part
i*, of course, the magnetic force of Maxwell.      Similar considerations
apply as regards the electric force in a polarized dielectric     ;   it   is
clearly proper to define  it  so as to correspond to magnetic induction,
not to magnetic force.     It     then shown from the direct considera
                                   is
tion of the orbital motions of electrons, that there is, in addition to
the electrodynamic force on the element of volume of the material
medium,     a magnetic force derived from         a   potential  function
\*(a2 +    + ^f) and a force of electric origin derived from a potential
                ,
(K— l)/8irc2 (P2 Q2 + Rr). If the element carries an electric charge
            .       +
of density p, there is also the force /,(P, Q, R).  In addition to these
latter forces on the polarized element, there are also stresses due to
interaction between neighbouring parts, in which are to be found the
main explanation of the phenomena of electrostriction and magneto
striction.
  As an example of these ponderomotive forces, the mechanical pressure
produced by radiation     examined later on, with a result half that of
                         is

expression multiplied by \{\ — /t-'), when the interface separates two
transparent media.
   The distinction between true current and total current is practically
immaterial, except in questions relating to electrical vibrations and to
optics. The remaining part of the theory is therefore developed more
particularly with a view to optical applications. At the end of the
 previous paper a brief outline of the method of treating optical dis
persion was given, and it was shown that the same principles led
directly to Fresuel's formula for the effect on the velocity of light
produced by motion, through the aether, of the material medium
 which transmits it. In the latter respect the theory is in agreement
 with a more recent discussion by H. A. Lorentz, of the propagation
of electrical and optical effects through moving media.
   A detailed theory of optical propagation in transparent and opaque-
ponderable media is given, on the basis that it is the contained
electrons that are efficient in modifying the mode of propagation
from that which obtains in free aether. The dispersive theory of
MacCullagh had been physically interpreted in the earlier part of
the previous paper ; but it appears from the same train of reasoning
as was there applied to Cauchy's theory, that molecular magnitudes
are too small compared with the wave-length to allow any consider
able part of the actual dispersion .to be accounted for statically
in that way. The rotatory dispersions, both natural and magnetic,
are, however, structural phenomena ; and this accounts for their
smallness compared with ordinary dispersion.
   As regards ordinary dispersion, a formula is obtained for the case
of perfectly non-conducting media, namely,     =
                                              /t2   1
                                                      A/(/32— p-), where
                                                        -f-
2?r/p is the period, of the samo  type as one recently deduced by von
Helmholtz by an abstract process based on the principle of Least
Action combined with theory of electrons, which, however, does not
                          a
correspond with the views here developed. That this formula is a
good representation of the experimental facts for ordinary trans
parent media   isgenerally recognised  ;especially as     may, in case of
                                                          it
necessity, be modified by the inclusion of slight non-selective opacity,
due to drift of free electrons, after the manner of ordinary conduc
tion. When this kind of general opacity      is predominant, the result
obtained in the paper conforms to the main features of metallic pro
pagation thus, with sufficient conductivity the real part of the square
           ;
of the refractive index becomes negative, and the real part of the
index itself may become less than unity, while the dispersion is
usually abnormal.
   When the phenomena of moving media are treated, dispersion may?
for simplicity, be left out of account. It   is shown that,    ifthe view
described in the previous paper, that all the dynamical properties of
matter are to be derived from the relations of electrons, with or

without intrinsic inertia, in a rotationally elastic fluid Hither, is
entertained, the null result of the Michelson-Morley second-order
experiment on the effect of the Earth's motion on the velocity of light
becomes included in the theory ; in fact, according to a suggestion
thrown out by FitzGerald and Lorentz, and developed somewhat in
this manner by the latter, the second-order optical effect is just com
pensated by a second-order effect on the lengths of the moving arms
of Michelson's apparatus, which is produced by its motion along with
the Earth th rough the Bather.
    As mixed dynamical and statistical theories of electrons or other
objects require delicate treatment, especially when pushed, as here, to
the second order of small quantities, the formulae of this part of the
paper are deduced independently by two very different analytical
methods. In the first place, there is the usual process of extending
the fundamental circuital relations of the free aether which express its
dynamical relations as differential equations of the first order, by
suitable modification of the significance of the vectors involved in
 them, so that the same equations shall apply to ponderable media as
 well, the vectors then representing averages taken over the element
of volume. The other method consists in working out the dynamics
of a single electron, and applying the results statistically to the
inclusion of the various ways in which the electric current arises
from the movements of the electrons in ponderable media.
    The theory as thus developed from the electron as the fundamental
element, may be stated in a form which is independent of the
dynamical hypothesis of a rotational aether. Maxwell's formal equa
 tions of the electric field may take the place of that hypothesis,
 though it may,    I think, be contended that an abstract procedure of
 that kind will neither be so simple nor so graphic, nor lend itself so
 easily to the intuitive grasp of relations, as a more concrete one of
 the type here employed.
    The exact permanence of the wave-lengths in spectra, under various
 physical conditions, may be ascribed to the influence of radiation on
 the molecule, which keeps it in, or very close to, a constant condition
of steady motion, of minimum total energy corresponding to its pre
 determined constant momenta.         It is also pointed out, from the
 analogy of physical astronomy, that the harmonic oscillations into
 which the spectroscope divides the radiation from a molecule, may
 be far more numerous than the co-ordinates which specify its relative
 motions ; that, therefore, relations of a semi-dynamical character may
 be discovered among the spectral lines, without its being rendered
 likely that we can ever penetrate from them back to the actual con
 figuration of the molecular system.
    Reverting finally to matters relating purely to a rotational rather
 theory, with electrons as the sole foundation for matter, it is possible to

228       Sir John Conroy.       On the Refractive Tndex   of  [June 20,
identify the inertia of matter with the electric inertia of the electrons,
if only we may assume their nuclei to be small enough, or sufficiently
numerous.      And the fact that these nuclei have free periods of elastic
l-adial vibration in the fluid aether, not subject to damping by radia
tion, reminds us that a pulsatory theory of gravitation has been
developed by Hicks and Bjexknes.         There is no recognised funda
 mental interaction of electric and radiative phenomena with gravita
tion, so for present purposes we are not bound to produce a precise
explanation of gravitation at all.        The scope of this remark is
restricted to merely showing that a rotational aether is not incom
petent to include such an action among its properties.
III. "On      the Refractive Index of Waler at Temperatures
       between 0° and 10"." By Sir John Conboy, Bart., F.R.S.,
       Fellow and Bedford Lecturer of Balliol College, and Millard
       Lecturer of Trinity College, Oxford. Received May It),
       1895.
   In   1856 Jamin    (' Comptes Rendus,' vol. xliii, p. 1191) published
an account of observations*he had made on the refractive index of
water at temperatures between 30° and 0°. He used an interference
method, and found that as the water cooled the index increased.
   "La masse totale de l'eau qui d'abord etait a 12 degres, se refroi-
dissant continuellement, arriva bientdt a 4 degres, c'est-a-dire, au
point oii les variations de l'indice devraient changer de signe, et ou le
deplacement des franges devrait etre inverse. Mais rien de pareil ne se
montra, et en continuant le refroidissement jusqu'a zero, on continua
d'observer une augmentation de l'indice.         II n'y a done pas de
maximum dans la valeur du coefficient do refraction quand il y en a
un dans la densité."
   In another experiment the temperature of the column of water
through which one of the beams of light passed was kept at 0°,
whilst that of the other was gradually raised to 30° ; he found by the
displacement of the bands that the index decreased steadily.       He did
not, apparently, publish any numerical values for the indices, but
states that they are accurately given by the empirical            formula
K/ = K0-(0-000012573)<-(0-000001929KJ.
   Two years later Gladstone and Dale (' Phil. Trans.,' 1858, p. 887)
gave an account of observations that they had made " on th-
influence of temperature on the refraction of light;" they used a
hollow glass prism, and determined the angles of minimum deviation.
for water, and several other liquids, at various temperatures.       They
      " our determinations were                           and  most care
say,                               performed repeatedly
fully on water near the freezing point; they confirm the observations

                           "
the remarkable reversion of the density at 4°, is not withont its
influence on the amount of sensitiveness; the change of refractive
index between 10° and 5° being O0002, whilst that between 5° and
0° is only 0 0001."
    They give a table for the values of the index to five places, for
A, D, and H at eight temperatures between 0° and 11°.
    In 1867 Riihlmann (' Pogg. Ann.,' vol. 132, p. 1 and 176) pub
lished an account of observations he had made of the refractive index
of water at various temperatures ; he also used a hollow glass prism
and gives the values to five places, for lithium, sodium, and thallium
light from 0° to 100°. He states, " Der Brechungsindex des Wassers
nimmt stetig ab von 0° bis 80° R., ohne bei dem Dichtigkeitsmaximum
irgend eine Abweichung von dem Aenderungsgesetze zu zeigen, mi thin
ilie Fortpflanzungsgeschwindigkeit     des Lichtes stetig zu."
    Lorenz (' Wied. Ann.,' vol. 11 [1880], p. 70) made observations by
an interference method, on the refractive index of water between the
temperatures of 0° and 34°; and Dnfet ('Jour. de Physique' (2),
vol. 4 [1885], p. 389) determined the index of water at temperatures
above 17° by the minimum deviation method and by an interference
method, and also calculated from the results obtained by other
observers the rate of change of the index with change of tempera
ture.
    Ketteler (' Wied. Ann.,' vol. 33 [1888], pp. 353 and 506) repeated
 Riihlmann' s determinations for temperatures above 20°, using a total
reflection refractometer, but did not make any observations at lower
temperatures.     More recently still, B. Walter has published ('Wied.
 Ann.,' vol. xlvi [1892], p. 422) a short account of some determinations
of the refractive index of water to five places between 0° and 30° for
the D line, made, apparently, with great care by the minimum devia
tion method.
    That tbe refractive index of water increases with the decrease of
temperature until the freezing point is reached, appears to be proved,
but as few determinations of the values of the refractive indices of
water near its point of maximum density have been published,      I have
ventured, as the matter is one of considerable theoretical importance,
to bring before the Society an account of some determinations     I have
recently made.
    The method employed was the ordinary one, the determination of
 the angle of minimum deviation for a ray of definite wave-length
 passing through a hollow glass prism containing water at a known
 temperature.
     The goniometer used was made by Messrs. Troughton and Simms,
 it has an 8-inch circle divided into 10', and is read by means of
 two micrometers, directly to 10", and by estimation to single seconds.

 230     Sir John Conroy.       On the Refractive Index  of  [June 20,
   The prism was made by Steinheil        ; the value of its refracting
angle,   as   determined   by   six  independent measurements, was
60°   V 42" ±0-8".
   The prism was surrounded by a water-jacket, through which a
stream of brine, cooled by a freezing mixture, could be passed.
   Openings in the water-jacket allowed the light which had passed
through the collimater to reach the prism, and the refracted beam to
reach the telescope.    The temperature was ascertained by means of
a thermometer with its bulb immersed in the water contained in the
prism.
   The prism was filled with distilled water which had been recently
boiled and allowed to cool under reduced pressure.
   The determinations were made exclusively with sodium light ; it
had been originally intended to make observations with lights of
different refrangibilities, but it was found that, owing to the
brilliancy and constancy of the sodium light, it was not only far
easier to make observations with it, but that these observations would
certainly be more accurate than those made with light of other re
frangibilities.
   The prism, not being in actual contact withthe water-jacket, cooled
very slowly, about four or five hours were usually necessary to reduce
its tempei'ature from about 9° to a little above the freezing point.
   Owing to the experiments being made at temperatures different
from that of the room, and to the temperature of the prism con
tinually, though slowly, altering, it was found impossible to make
the determinations by reversing the prism, and then taking half
the angle between the two positions of the telescope as the angle of
minimum deviation.
   Several series of observations were therefore made with the prism
in both positions of minimum deviation, and the differences between
these readings and those made when the axes of the collimator and
telescope were in the same straight line, gave the deviations.
   Seven sets of observations were made, and the results are con
                   I
tained in Table ; which gives the deviations for both positions of
the prism, and the corresponding refractive indices for the various
temperatures.
   The angles of deviation differ so little from each other, that any
error in the determination of the refracting angle of the prism would
not make any difference in the relative values of the indices ; it
would, of course, affect their absolute values.     The probable error
calculated   by the ordinary   formula
measurements made of the angle of the prism (see above) is +0 8''.
A difference of 1'' in the value of the refracting angle corresponds
to two units in the sixth place in the refractive index ; the probable

corresponds to 4 units in the sixth place of the refractive index ; as
the sets of micrometer readings were all fairly concordant, and their
probable errors less than 1", the values of the indices were calculated
to six places.
   The temperatures at which the observations were made not being
identical for the two positions of the prism, it was thought that a
graphical method, though, from its nature, somewhat
                                                             " arbitrary,"
would give a more truthful result than any arithmetical process of
taking the means.        The results were therefore plotted on paper
divided  into  squares of 1 mm., 0-2° of temperature being represented
by 5 mm. on the axis of abscissae, O-OOOOl of refractive index by 4 mm.
on that of the ordinates ; and a curve drawn in the ordinary way.
    Owing to the scale on which the results were plotted, a good deal
of " judgment" was necessary in drawing the curve.          It was there
fore thought desirable also to plot the results on a smaller scale, so
far as the ordinates were concerned ; this was done, one unit in the
fifth place being represented by 2 mm., and another curve drawn.
The values of the index for different temperatures, as given by the
two curves were compared and were found to agree satisfactorily ;
and it therefore seemed probable that the curves were really fair
representations of the observations.

  The values show that the refractive index of water, as was first
announced by Jamin, increases continuously up to the freezing point,
the rate of increase, however, seems to change about 4°, the
temperature of maximum density, as was pointed out by Gladstone
and Dale.

                                (Abstract.)
   The aim of this investigation      is the determination in absolute
measure of the magnetic rotation of liquids at different temperatures,
the effect of the chemical nature of the liquid on this property, and
its correlation with other physical properties.
   The present communication contains a description of the apparatus
and method of experiment, and the results obtained with the standard
liquids, carbon bisulphide and water, for sodium light, in a magnetic
field of constant intensity, and at different temperatures between 0°
and the ordinary boiling point.
   The magnetic field was produced by means of a helix consisting of
two separate coils, either of which, if desired, could be used separately.
During the process of winding, the dimensions of each layer were
carefully determined, and every precaution was taken to ensure good
insolation.
   The liquid under examination was contained in a glass tube closed
by very thin glass plates. This tube was surrounded by a brass
jacket, which passed through the coils.      Observations could be made
at different temperatures, and the temperature could be kept con
 stant while making a set of readings by causing water, or the vapour
of liquids boiling under different pressures, to circulate through the
jacket.
    Special pains were taken to obtain monochromatic light, with the
 result that in the case of carbon bisulphide, where the double rotation
 amounted to 40°, there was no trace of coloration.

    The ultimate standard of current was a silver voltameter, a Kelvin
deci-ampere balance being used as an intermediate standard.
    In the case of carbon bisulphide three different samples were used,
and identical results were obtained with three separate coils. In the
following table are collected the mean values of the boiling point
(b. p.), density at 0° (p0°), and Verdet's constant at 0°(703). Verdet's
constant may be defined as the rotation in minutes of arc produced
in a column of liquid when the difference between the magnetic
potentials at the ends of the column is equal to one C.G.S. unit.
                                                        P          To*-

    It will  be seen that the three different           samples    give practically
identical values for the three physical constants.
    The results obtained for the rotation of carbon bisulphide may be
summed up in the following equation, where n is the value of Verdet's
constant at the temperature t,
                          7(   =  0-04347 (1 — 0-001696*),
 or                        -it =  0-04347 — 004737<.
    The expression connecting rotation and temperature is therefore
 linear.
    In the case of water the results are best represented by
                     -It =   0-01311  (1— 0-04 305/—  0-0S 305i2),
or                   -/, =   001311 — 0-064£ — 0-0,  if.
     Here the rate of change of the rotation with temperature increases
 as the temperature rises.
     The following table gives the values of the rotation of water and
 carbon bisulphide at every 10° between 0° and the boiling point, as
 well as the values of the quotient (7//;), obtained by dividing the
 rotation by the density.
     In the case of water the quotient 7//J is practically constant up to
 20°, it then very slowly increases, the rate of increase between 20°
 and 100° being practically constant.
     For carbon bisulphide the quotient 7//> decreases at a constant rate
 as the temperature rises, the rate of decrease being very much greater
 than the rate of increase in the case of water.

   The measure of the molecular rotation which is usually employed
in chemical investigations is
                             (M7//>)«ussuuice/(M7//>)water,
where M is the molecular weight.               Although the authors postpone a
detailed discussion of the validity of this expression, they show that
for carbon bisulphide, at any rate, its value changes with the tem
perature, and hence the conclusions obtained by its use regarding
questions of chemical constitution, especially of tautomerism, are
affected on this account.                                                 .
   They also point out that the above expression involves the pro
perties of water. The only justification for the use of water in
relative observations is the elimination of variations in the strength
of the magnetic field in which the observations are made.                          If the
temperature of observation is always the same,                    this  can  readily be
done.     If, on the other hand, the temperature varies, it is essential to
know how the rotation of water alters with the temperature.                        In the
past   this   alteration    was   unknown,     and   the  arbitrary    measure     of the
molecular rotation above referred to has come into use. Since an
expression for the temperature variation has now been obtained it is
to be hoped that observers will employ a measure of the molecular
rotation which does not involve the properties of water.                         Indeed,
other considerations make such a measure all the more desirable.
Up till now the authors have made observations on eight liquids,
besides water and carbon bisulphide, and in all cases except that
of water the relation between rotation and temperature is linear.
and the quotient, rotation divided by density, diminishes as the tem
perature rises.        It is highly probable, therefore, that as regards
magnetic rotation, as in the case of so many other properties, the

1895.]      Influence  of the  Cerebral Cortex on the      Larynx.        237
behaviour of water is exceptional, and hence it is particularly ill
suited for the use to which it has been put. Again, on account
of the smallness of the rotation in water, the unavoidable in
accuracies in determining its rotation, and thus estimating the
strength of the magnetic field, produce a larger percentage error in
the results than if a liquid, such as benzene, having a considerably
higher rotation than water, were used for this purpose.

    This research was undertaken       in order to attempt to differentiate
an abductor centre in the cerebral cortex of the dog, bat, as several
new observations were made during the course of the investigation,
similar experiments were performed in the cat in order to compare
the results obtained in this animal with those obtained in the dog.
   Among the preliminary considerations was the question as to what
influence the condition of the peripheral laryngeal apparatus in an
animal has on the effects obtained from its central nervous mechanism,
and the conclusion arrived at was that the influence must be compara
tively insignificant, as abduction or adduction of the vocal cords could
be obtained on excitation of the appropriate area of the cerebral
cortex, irrespective of whether abduction or adduction was obtained
on excitation of the recurrent laryngeal nerves in the same animal.
    No evidence of unilateral representation of the movements of the
vocal cords in the cerebral cortex was obtained ; and in testing this
point one recurrent laryngeal nerve was divided transversely, when it
 was found possible to influence the vocal cord whose nerve was
 intact, with equal ease on stimulation of either cerebral hemisphere.
    The question of inhibition of antagonistic muscles by electrical
excitation of the cerebral cortex, on the lines adopted by Sherrington
with regard to antagonistic muscles in other parts of the body, was
tested by first dividing the adductor fibres in both recurrent laryn
geal nerves, leaving the abductor fibres intact, and then exciting the
adductor centre with strong induced currents ; but no evidence of
inhibition of the abductor muscles was obtained.
    The major part of the paper deals with the movements of the vocal
cords which could be evoked on excitation of different foci in the
cerebral cortex. It was found that both in the dog and cat there

238             Mr. R. Ihinstan and Miss L. E. Boole.         [June   20,
existed a focus, excitation of which resulted in adduction of the vocal
cords, and another near to this, stimulation of which resulted in
abduction of the cords. While in the cat it was possible to differ
entiate these movements without any preliminary measures being
adopted, it was otherwise in the dog, for it was only after the
adductor fibres of one recurrent laryngeal nerve had been divided
transversely that it first became possible to evoke abduction of the
vocal cords on excitation of the cortex, though in subsequent experi
ments it was sometimes possible to evoke this movement on excita
tion of the cortex of the dog without adopting this preliminary
measure.    The other effect on the cords, which it was as a rule found
most difficult to differentiate from that of abduction, was acceleration
of their movements.
   In further exploring the cortex it was found that on the anterior
composite gyrus, below the abductor centre, there existed a focus,
excitation of which resulted in what is described as a clonic adductor
effect on the cords, in which the cords were first brought into a posi
tion of moderate adduction, and then there was added rapid short to-
and-fro excursions.
   On passing within the confines of Spencer's area for arrest of
respiration, it was found that in the peripheral parts of this area
there existed three foci, excitation of which affected the cords in
different ways. The most anterior of these foci was responsible for
arrest of the cords in adduction, i.e., in the expiratory stage of their
excursions ; excitation of the focus behind this, and corresponding,
probably, to Horsley and Semon's abductor centre in the cat, was
followed by arrest of the cords in abduction, i.e., their inspiratory
position ; while the most posterior focus, which is situated at about
the junction of the anterior composite and anterior sylvian convolu
tions, resulted in intensification combined with acceleration of the
movements of the cords when stimulated.         Excitation of Spencer's
chief focus for arrest of respiration on the olfactory lobe, resulted in
arrest of the cords in the position they occupy during expiration in
dogs, and in the position they occupy during inspiration in cats.

      of Croton Oil." By Wyndham R. DUNSTAN, M.A., F.R.S.,

   The vesicating constituent, or more strictly, the pustule-prodncing
constituent   of croton oil, has been the subject of investigation     by

1895.]     Nature of the Vesicating Constituent of Croton Oil.       239
numerous chemists and pharmacologists during the past forty years.
According to the researches of Buchheim, and more recently of Kobert
and Hirscheydt, the vesicating action is due to an acid closely allied
to oleic acid, which has been given the name of crotonoleic acid.
This substance is now prepared on a large scale in Germany for
medical use, being extracted from croton oil by the method devised
by Kobert and Hirscheydt.           This consists in saponifying with
barium hydroxide that part of croton oil which readily dissolves in
strong alcohol. The resulting barium salts are washed with water,
then dried, and repeatedly extracted with ether, which dissolves the
barium salts of oleic and crotonoleic acids. These salts are separated
by means of ether, which dissolves only the barium crotonoleate, and
this, when decomposed with dilute sulphuric acid and extracted with
ether, furnishes the crotonoleic acid as a viscid oil.
   Since very little is known about this acid, even its composition
being undetermined, the authors prepared it with the object of
studying its properties and, if possible, of determining the constitu
tion, since no fatty acid of known constitution exhibits the property
of vesicating.      Starting with the crotonoleic acid prepared as
described above, the lead salt was obtained and submitted to a pro
cess of fractional precipitation by adding successive quantities of
water to its solution in alcohol. By this means crotonoleic acid was
proved to be a mixture composed for the most part of inactive oily
acids, the lead salts of which are precipitated first, whilst the true
vesicating constituent (or its lead salt) is principally contained in
the last fractions, and represents but a small proportion of the
original material.      It was observed that the conversion of the
crotonoleic acid   into a lead salt did appreciably affect its vesicating
power.
   The supposed active constituent of croton oil, crotonoleic acid,
having thus been shown to be a mixture, the authors proceeded to
attempt to isolate the vesicating constituent from croton oil direct.
   By saponifying that part of croton oil which is soluble in strong
alcohol with a mixture of lead oxide and water, and repeatedly frac
tionating an alcoholic solution of the lead salts with water, the later
fractions, which possessed the greatest vesicating power, ultimately
furnished, when submitted to a series of fractionations, a resinous
substance having extraordinary power as a vesicant. This substance
could not be further resolved by repeating the process of fractional
precipitation of the alcoholic solution with water. The same sub
stance was isolated from the so-called " crotonoleic acid,'' and the
authors propose to name it " croton-resin."          To its presence the
vesicating property   of croton oil is due. The    composition of croton-
resin is expressed by the empirical formula d3HuO4.            So far all
attempts to crystallise it, or to obtain crystalline derivatives from it,

                      is     complicated, and its molecular formula
would appear to be at least (Ci3H,sOi)3 or CmH36Os.      Sinceit   isnot
saponified by a mixture of lead oxide and water, and as no glycerol

phenylhydrazine     or sodium bisulphite,   it   isprobably neither      a
ketone nor an aldehyde. The evidence so far obtained points to
the conclusion that the constitution of the vesicating constituent
of croton oil       that of
                       is     alactone or anhydride of complicated
structure.

   Consider a population in which sexual selection and natural selec
tion may or may not be taking place.           Assume only that the
deviations from the mean in the case of any organ of any generation
follow exactly or closely the normal law of frequency, then the
following expressions may be shown to give the law of inheritance of
the population.
   Let H2 = deviation of the father from mean of the total popula
tion of fathers, and [let <72 = the standard deviation of the total
population of fathers.
   Let H3 and <73 be the corresponding quantities for the mother for
the same (or any other) organ.     Let Hi be the mean deviation of the
offspring (fraternity) due to fathers H2 and mothers H3 with regard
to the same (or any other) organ, and let <r, be the standard deviation
of the whole offspring population.     If we are dealing with offspring
of one  sex, both the mean and the standard deviation of the offspring
may differ, owing to natural selection, by any amount from those of
parents of the same sex.

    Thus the distribution of fraternities is the same for all parentages                     ;
it   depends, however, upon           the strength of sexual selection, and on
the paternal and maternal inheritances for the community at large
with regard to the organs under consideration.
    The portion of regression due to either parent alone is not depen
dent solely on maternal or paternal inheritance ; it is influenced not
only indirectly by sexual selection but directly by the inheritance
from the other parent owing to the presence of the terms rfo and
rirt. Further, the greater the variability of one sex (i.e., the greater
<72 or <r3) the less, other things being the same, the parent of that sex
contributes to the inheritance of the offspring. The above two formulae
seem to embrace the chief laws of heredity in populations.                               The
whole of the constants involved can be found by comparatively simple
measurements, and, indeed, have been, to some extent, found in the

 VIII.     " On the Occlusion
                                of Oxygen and Hydrogen by Platinum
        Black.     (Part I.)"     By Ludwig Mond, F.R.S., William
       Ramsay, Ph.D., F.R.S., and John Shields, D.Sc, Ph.D.
       Received June 13, 1895.
                                   (Abstract.)
    The authors describe some preliminary experiments on the occlusion
of oxygen and hydrogen by platinum sponge and foil, which in general
confirm the results obtained by Graham. At most only a few volumes
of these gases are occluded by the more coherent forms of platinum.
    After giving details of what they consider the best method of pre
paration of platinum black, they next describe some experiments
which had for their object the determination of the total quantity of
water retained by platinum black, dried at 100° C, and the amount
of water which can be removed from platinum black at various tem
peratures in vacuo. As the result of these experiments they fiud that
platinum black dried at 100° retains in general 0-5 per cent. of water,
and this can only be removed in vacuo at a temperature (about 400°)
at which the black no longer exists as such, but is converted at least
partially into sponge.      At any given temperature the water retained
by platinum black seems to be constant.           The density of platinum
black dried at 100° C. is 19-4,     or allowing for the water retained by it
at this temperature, 21-5.
    The amount of oxygen given off by platinum black at various tem
peratures was determined.         Altogether it contains about 100 volumes
of oxygen ; the oxygen begins to come off in quantity at about 300° C.
in vacuo, and the bulk of it can be extracted at 400° C, but a red heat is
necessary for its complete removal. Small quantities of carbon dioxide
were also extracted, chiefly between 100 — 200° C.
    In determining the quantity of hydrogen occluded by platinum black
the authors have carefully distinguished between the hydrogen which
goes to form water with the oxygen always contained in platinum
black, and that which is really absorbed by the platinum per se.
Altogether about 310 volumes of hydrogen are absorbed per unit
volume of platinum black, but of this 200 volumes are converted into
water, or only 110 volumes are really occluded by the platinum.         Part
of it can be again     removed  at  the ordinary temperature   in vacuo ; by
  Tip. the  larger portion can be  extracted  at about  250 — 300°  C, but  a
       heat is necessary for its complete removal. The amount of hydro

  1895.]      Occlusion  of Oxygen, Sfc,  by Platinum Black.        243
  gen absorbed by platinum is very largely influenced by slight traces
  of impurity, probably grease or other matter which forms a skin over
  the platinum.
     Platinum black in vacuo absorbs a certain quantity of hydrogen.
  On increasing the pressure of the hydrogen up to about 200 — 300
  mm. a further quantity is absorbed, but after this pressure is almost
  without effect.   By increasing the pressure from one atmosphere up
 to four and a half atmospheres, only one additional volume of hydro
 gen was absorbed.     On placing platinum black charged with oxygen
 in an atmosphere of oxygen, and increasing the pressure to the same
 extent eight and a half additional volumes were however absorbed.
     Platinum black charged with hydrogen and placed in an atmosphere
 of hydrogen kept approximately at atmospheric pressure, and plati
 num black charged with oxygen and confined in an atmosphere of
 oxygen, behave quite differently when heated.       In the former case
 hydrogen is immediately expelled on raising the temperature, whilst in
 the latter case oxygen is steadily absorbed until a temperature of
 about 360° C. (the temperature of maximum absorption) is reached,
 when on further heating oxygen begins to come off again.
    Incidentally it was noticed that mercury begins to combine with
 oxygen at 237° C, and that a mixture of platinum black and phos
phorus pentoxide absorbs oxygen at a high temperature probably with
the formation of a phosphate or pyrophosphate.
    In the discussion of the results special reference is made to the
work of Berliner and Berthelot, and it is pointed out that there is not
sufficient evidence for the existence of such chemical compounds as
Pt3oH3 and PtaoHs.     Moreover, the authors are of opinion that the
heats of combination of hydrogen and platinum as determined by
Berthelot and Favre are valueless, and that the heat which they
measured is due for the most part if not entirely to the formation of
water by the oxygen always contained in platinum black. It has yet
to be proved that the absorption of hydrogen by pure platinum black is
attended by the evolution of heat, and as regards the formation of
supposed true chemical compounds, solid solutions, or alloys, the
authors prefer to wait until sufficient data have been accumulated for
an adequate enquiry, before coming to any definite conclusion.

IX. "     On the Electrolysis of Gases." By J. J. Thomson, M.A.,
         F.R.S., Cavendish Professor of Experimental Physics,
         Cambridge.      Received June 17, 1895.
     In the experiments described in this paper    I have nsed the spectro
scope     to  detect the decomposition   of gases by  the electric discharge
and the movement of the ions in opposite directions along the dis-
charge-tnbe.
   -
     The method consists in sending the electric discharge through a
tube so arranged that the spectra close to the positive and negative
electrodes can easily be compared ; thus the presence or absence of
certain ions at these electrodes can be ascertained. This method
is capable of much wider application than the one               I   previously
         in                             "                            "
used         my experiments    on  the    Electrolysis   of  Steam     (' Proc.
Roy. Soc.,' vol. 52, p. 90), the use of which is attended with very
great difficulty for any substance other than steam.              The earlier
method has, however, the advantage of being a quantitative method
— the present one is only qualitative.
     In my former experiment with steam, when             I worked at atmo
spheric pressure      and varied  the  length  of the   spark,  I  found that
when the spark-length exceeded a certain length, du there was an
excess of hydrogen at the negative electrode and of oxygen at the
 positive, equal in amount to the quantities of hydrogen and oxygen
 liberated from a water voltameter placed in series with the steam-
 tube. When the sparks were shorter than a certain length, a\, the
 hydrogen appeared at the positive, the oxygen at the negative electrode,
 but the quantity of these gases was again equal to the quantities
 liberated in a water voltameter placed in series with the steam-tube.
      When the spark-length was between d, and               the effects were
 irregular, and there seemed to be no connection between the amounts
 of gases liberated in the steam-tubes and those liberated in the
 voltameter.
      In the following experiments in which the sparks were of constant
 length and the pressure was altered, corresponding effects were
 observed. Within certain limits of pressure definite and perfectly
  regular evidence of the separation of the ions of the gas sparked
  through was obtained ; and the electrode at which a given ion
  appeared could be reversed by altering the pressure ; there was,
  however, a range of pressures in which the separation of the ions was
  either not well marked or was irregular in character.
      I shall begin by describing a very simple method of showing the
  separation of the ions produced by the discharge of electricity
   through a compound gas such as hydrochloric acid gas, which is

1895.]               On the Electrolysis  of Gases.                 245
applicable when the discharges through the constituent gases of the
compound are of distinct and different colours ; this is eminently
the case with the hydrochloric acid gas, as the discharge through
hydrogen in a capillary tube is red, through chlorine green.
   Take a capillary tube of very fine bore, the finer the better (the
tube   I used was thermometer tubing of the finest bore        I  could
procure), and insert platinum wires for electrodes in two small
bulbs blown on the ends of the tube ; then fill the tubo with HC1
gas, allowing it to run through the tube for a considerable time so
as to get rid of any extraneous gas, and exhaust the tube so that
the gas in it is at a very low pressure.     Then when the discharge
from a large induction coil passes through the tube, the following
phenomena are observed.      When first the discharge passes through
the tube the colour is uniform throughout and of a greenish-grey ;
after the discharge has been passing for a little time the end of the
tube next the cathode gets distinctly red, whilst that next the anode
gets green ; this difference in the colour at the ends of the tube
goes on increasing until the tube presents a most striking appear
ance, the part near the cathode being bright red, while that near
the anode is a bright green. The difference in colour attains a
maximum value, and if the discharge is allowed to run for several
hours the contrast between the two ends disappears to a very great
extent ; the discharge throughout the whole of the tube being pinkish
and apparently passing mainly through hydrogen.       This is doubtless
due to the diffusion through the tube of the hydrogen which in the
earlier stages of the discharge had accumulated about the cathode ;
one advantage of using very narrow tubes is that with them this
diffusion is slow. When the tube is in this condition the colour of
the discharge sometimes changes suddenly, and for a second or two is
green instead of pink, showing that though in the main the discharge
passes through hydrogen, it occasionally leaves the hydrogen and
passes through the chlorine. This transference of the discharge from
one constituent to another of a mixture of gases is not infrequently
observed when the gases are mixed in certain proportions.
   Some of these capillary tubes showed after the discharge had been
passing through them for some time a peculiar patchy appearance, some
portions of the tube being a much brighter red than the others, while
other portions were green.     In some tubes this occurred to such an
extent that the discharge showed an irregularly striated appearance.
This effect is due, I believe, to gases or moisture condensed on the
walls of the capillary tube, and in some cases to irregularities in the
chemical composition of the glass.    I found that it did not occur if
the tabe before being used was heated for some time along its whole
length to as high a temperature as it would stand without collapsing ;
this heating would tend to cleanse the walls of the tube. That dif

246                        Prof. J. J. Thomson.                [June 20,
ferences    in the quality of the gas also conspire to produce these
patches is shown, I think, by the following phenomenon. A capillary
tube of fine bore containing mercury vapour and a little water vapour
developed a well marked red patch ; the tube was then heated for
some inches in the neighbourhood of the patch.         In general heating
the tube makes the discharge yellow from the sodium vapour given
off from the glass ; in this case, however, the whole of the heated
portion, with the exception of the patch, turned yellow ; the patch
itself withstood the heating and continued to show the bright red
colour characteristic of hydrogen.
    Electrolytic Transport of one Gas through another. — A tube of the
shape shown in fig. 1 was made of the finest bore thermometer-
tubing ; the extremities, C and D, of the tube in which the electrodes
                                    Fio. 1.
 were fused were bent down so as to be parallel to each other, and so
 near together that a slight motion of the tube suffices to bring either
 of the extremities in front of the slit of the spectroscope.    The tube
 was mounted on a board moved by a lever ; by moving this the
 observer at the spectroscope could readily bring the spectrum of
 either the positive or negative electrode into the field of view. A
 side tube, AB, was fused to the middle of the main tube and was pro
 vided with two taps ; in the space between these taps a small quantity
 of any gas which it was desired to introduce into the main tube could
 be imprisoned, and could, by opening the tap A, be introduced into
 the discharge tube. The experiment consists in filling the main tube
 with a gas at a low pressure, observing the spectra at the two elec
 trodes, then introducing by the side tube a very small quantity of
 gas into the main tube, and again observing the spectra at the two
 electrodes.
     A tube was filled with hydrogen and showed no trace of the
 chlorine spectra ; a very small quantity of chlorine was then let in
 through the side tube (in performing this experiment it is necessary
 to be careful that only a very small quantity of chlorine is intro
 duced).     After the discharge had been running through the tube
 for a short time, the chlorine spectrum was found to be bright at the
 positive electrode, though no trace of it could be detected at the
 negative.      When the discharge was kept on for some time, the chlo
  rine spectrum, though still visible at the positive electrode, got
      iter ; it did not appear at all at the negative.   If a considerable

1895.]                On the Electrolysis of  Gases.                  247
quantity of chlorine was introduced through the side tube, the chlo
rine spectrum was visible at both electrodes, though it was brighter
at the positive than at the negative.
   When the induction coil was reversed, so that what was before the
positive electrode became the negative, the first effect observed was
that the chlorine spectrum flashed out with great brilliancy at the
old positive electrode, and was much brighter than at any previous
period.   This, however, only lasted for a second or two ; the chlorine
spectrum rapidly faded away and for a time was not visible at either
electrode. Soon, however, the chlorine spectrum appeared at the
new positive electrode, having thus been transferred from one end of
the tube to the other.
   On again reversing the coil the same phenomenon was repeated.
There was apparently no limit to the number of times this effect may
be obtained ; at any rate,  I  have driven the chlorine from one end of
a tube to the other 14 times in succession by reversing the coil. The
chlorine is always driven to the positive electrode, showing that th-
chlorine ion carries a charge of negative electricity.        The same
effect was obtained when a little vapour of bromine was introduced
into the tube instead of chlorine. When, however, the capillary tube
was filled with chlorine instead of hydrogen, and a little vapour of
bromine let into the tube, the bromine went to the negative electrode
instead of to the positive, as it did when introduced into the hydrogen
tube. These experiments snggest that the two gases in the tube com
bine, and that the compound gas so formed is split up into ions which
travel along the tube; that bromine when in combination with hydro
gen is the negative ion, and therefore travels to the positive elec
trode ; when, however, it is in combination with chlorine the bromine
is the positive ion and travels to the negative electrode.
   Another experiment tried was to let a little vapour of sodium into
the middle of a capillary tube filled with air at a low pressure. To
prevent the sodium vapour condensing on the walls of the tube, the
whole tube was placed on a sand-bath and the temperature raised so
high that no condensation took place. After the discharge had run
through the tube for about two hours the sand was removed from the
tube, and the movement of the sodium vapour to the negative elec
trode was very apparent even without using a spectroscope, as there
was a great patch of yellow light near the negative electrode and
none in any other part of the tube.
   Another experiment was to introduce a small quantity of hydrogen
into a tube filled with air at a low pressure : the hydrogen made its
way to the negative electrode. This experiment is a somewhat trouble
some one, as it is exceedingly difficult to get these very fine capillary
tubes so dry that the spectrum of the discharge does not show the
hydrogen lines even before the hydrogen is introduced into the middle

248                       Prof.  J. J. Thomson.                 [June  20,
of the tube   ; indeed I never succeeded in getting rid of the hydrogen
lines at the very lowest pressures. By heating the tube and allowing
dry air to run through it for a long time, however,     I got the tube eo
dry that it did not show the hydrogen lines at a pressure quite low
enough to allow the discharge to pass freely through it. When the
tube was in this state and hydrogen was let into the middle of the
tube, the hydrogen spectrum appeared at the negative electrode, but
not at the positive.
   The appearance of hydrogen at the negative electrode when mixed
in a discharge tube with other gases has been described by Mr. Baly
in a very interesting paper in the 'Philosophical Magazine,' vol. 35,
p. 200.
   The preceding experiments suggest, I think, that this separation of
two gases, A and B, by the discharge is due to the decomposition by
the discharge of a chemical compound formed of A and B, in which
the A atoms have a charge of electricity of one sign, the B atoms a
charge of electricity of the opposite sign ; these charged atoms under
the influence of the electromotive force in the tube travel in opposite
directions. Further, it follows from the experiment with the bromine
vapour in an atmosphere of chlorine that the sign of the electrical
charge on an atom of the same substance is not invariable, but
depends on the substance with which this atom is in combination.
 We shall find numerous other instances of this change in the sign of
the charge on an atom in experiments described in a later part of
this paper.
   Polarisation of the Electrodes. — This in the electrolysis of liquids is
due to the accumulation at the electrodes of ions which have ceased
to act as carriers of electricity. We have,    I think, distinct evidence
of   a  similar accumulation in the electrolysis of gases. For, as has
been already described, after the discharge has been running for some
time in one direction, giving the spectrnm of some gas at one of the
 terminals, the spectrum of the gas at that terminal is momentarily
 brightened to a very great extent by suddenly reversing the direc
tion of the discharge.     After the current has been flowing for some
time in one direction through, say, CI in an atmosphere of H, the
spectrum of the chlorine, though still visible at the positive elec
trode, gets faint, the chlorine apparently to a great extent ceasing to
carry the discharge ; when, however, the current is reversed, the
atoms of chlorine can move freely, as they are not obstructed by the
electrode, so that immediately after the reversal of the current there
is probably more of the discharge carried by the chlorine than at any
other time, and the chlorine spectrum is consequently brightest.
    Discharge through a Compound Gas. — The separation of the ions by
the discharge can be readily observed in a tube of the kind shown in
fig.  2.

metal plate, AB, fastened across the tube. When the discharge
passes through the tube, one side of the plato acts as a positive, the
other as a negative, electrode.       The tube is mounted on a stand,
which the observer at the spectroscope can move by means of a lever
so as to bring one side or other of the plate opposite the slit of the
spectroscope ; a very slight movement of the lever is sufficient to do
this, so that the spectra at the two sides of the plate can readily be
compared.     I  found that the results were more satisfactory when the
current was kept flowing through the tube in one direction and the
tube moved so as to bring the spectra at the two electrodes into
the field of view, than when the tube was kept fixed in one position
and the current reversed. The latter method, however, suffices to
show the separation of the ions in many cases, and it has the advan
tage of not requiring a plate across the tube ; all that is necessary is
to use for one of the terminals a disc whose plane is parallel to the
slit of the spectroscope.
   If the plate AB is thin, it is necessary to fuse it into the glass tube
all the way round, otherwise when the pressure is low, the discharge,
instead of crossing the plate, goes through any little crevices there
may be between the plate and the tube. The easiest way of making
the tube is to use a plate about 0-5 cm. thick, cut from an aluminium
cylinder which tightly fits the tube ; with a plate of this thickness the
narrow spaces between the tube and the plate are so long that the
discharge goes through the plate rather than through the crevices.
   The tube was filled with the gas to be observed and the spectra at
the two sides of the plate compared. These spectra were in many
cases found to differ in a very remarkable way ; it was, however, only
in exceptional cases that a line which was bright at one side of the
plate was absolutely invisible on the other. The method used was to
take two sets of lines, say A and B, as close together in the spectrum
as possible, and compare the brightness of these sets of lines on the
two sides of the plate ; if it was found that the A lines were brighter
on the positive side of the plate than on the negative, while on the
other hand the B lines were brighter on the negative side of the plate
than on the positive, then it was inferred that electrolytic separation
had occurred, and that the substance giving the A lines was in excess
on the positive side of the plate, that giving the B lines on the nega

tive.   It is not safe to draw any conclusions from the variations in
intensity of one line or one group of lines on the two sides of th-
plate, as the total quantity of light coming from the neighhourhood
of the cathode often differs considerably from that coming from the
anode.     When, however, we get an increase in the brilliancy of one
set of lines accompanied by a diminution in the brightness of another
set, when we move across the plate we eliminate this source of err-or.
The differences in the spectra at the two sides of the plate are most
easily observed at pressures where there is not any very great
difference between the luminosity of the cathode and the anode.          As
•was mentioned at the beginning of the paper, there is a range of
pressure within which the effects are irregular, and no decided
differences are observed between the spectra at the two sides of the
plate. It is desirable in these experiments to keep the tube on to
the pump as long as the experiment lasts, for the discharge always
decomposes the compound gas, and unless the products of decompo
sition are continually pumped off and replaced by fresh supplies of
the compound gas, the spectra of the discharge keep changing. With
organic compounds this is especially necessary, as the character of
the spectrum often changes entirely very shortly after the com
mencement of the discharge unless fresh gas is continually intro
duced.
    In the following experiments the current was produced by        a large
induction coil with a mercury slow break.
    When the tube was filled with hydrochloric acid gas at           a  low
 pressure, the separation of the hydrogen and chlorine was seen very
 distinctly, the hydrogen line being much brighter on the side of the
 plate which acted as the cathode (which we shall call the negativ-
 side of the plate) than on the positive side, while the chlorine, on
 the other hand, was brighter on the positive than on the negative
 side of the plate.
    When the tube was filled with ammonia gas, the hydrogen lines
 were bright on the negative side of the plate but were absent from
 the positive side, while on the positive side of the plate there was
 the positive pole spectrum of nitrogen, and on the negative side of
 the plate the negative pole spectrum of nitrogen and the hydrogen
 spectrum.
    Sulphur Monochloride. — When the tube was filled with the vapour
 of this substance at a low pressure, the chlorine lines were brighter
 on the negative side of the plate than at the positive, while the sulphur
 lines were brighter at the positive side than at the negative.       Thus
 the chlorine in this substance behaves in the opposite way to the
 ohlorine in HC1 ; in the latter compound the chlorine ion has a charg-
 of negative electricity, while in the sulphur monochloride it has i*
 charge of positive electricity.

    Influence of the Chemical Constitution of a Compound on the Sign
of the Charge of Electricity on one of its Constituent Atoms. — In many
organic compounds an atom of thejelectro-positive element hydrogen
•can be replaced by an atom of the electro-negative       element chlorine
without altering the type of the compound. Thus, for example, we
can replace the four hydrogen atoms in CH< by chlorine atoms, getting
successively the compound CHSC1, CH3Cl3, CHC13) and CC14. It
seemed of interest to investigate what was the sign of the change of
electricity on the chlorine atom in these compounds. The point is of
some historical interest, as the possibility of substituting an electro
negative element in a compound for an electro-positive one was one
of the chief objections assigned against the electro-chemical theory of
Berzelius.
   When the vapour of chloroform, CHC13, was placed in the tube, it
was found that both the hydrogen and the chlorine lines were bright
on the negative side of the plate, while they were absent from the
positive side, and that any increase in the brightness of the hydrogen
lines was accompanied by an increase in the brightness of those due
to chlorine.    The spectrum on the positive side of the plate was that
called the carbonic oxide spectrum ; when first the discharge passed
through the tube, the spectrum on the positive side was the
so-called candle spectrum, but this very rapidly changed to the
carbonic oxide spectrum.          The appearance of the hydrogen and
chlorine spectra at the same side of the plate was also observed in
methylene chloride and in ethylene chloride.            Even when all the
hydrogen in CH4 was replaced by chlorine, as in carbon tetrachloride,
 CC14, the chlorine spectra still clung to the negative side of the plate.
To test the point still further,        I tried the analogous compound
silicon tetrachloride, inserting a small jar in the circuit to brighten
the spectrum.       The chlorine spectrum was again brightest at the
negative   side of the plate,. while the silicon spectrum was brightest at
the positive. This is a very favourable case for the application of
this method, as there are two silicon lines (wave-lengths 5058, 5043)
quite close to two chlorine ones (wave-lengths 5102, 5078), so that
their relative brightness can easily be compared. The experiment
with the silicon tetrachloride is more conclusive than those with the
carbon compounds, as with the latter the spectrum on the positive
side of the plate is a band spectrum, and since the potential gradient
when the discharge is passing is very much steeper on the negative
side of the plate than on the positive, the effects observed might be
 supposed to be due to the circumstances on the negative side being
better adapted for the production of line spectra than those on the
 positive.    This explanation is not, however, applicable to the case
of silicon tetrachloride, where the spectra on both sides of the plate
 are line spectra.

   From these experiments it would appear that the chlorine atoms in
 the chlorine derivatives of methane are charged with electricity of
 the same sign as the hydrogen atoms they displace.
   When we can determine the signs of the electrical charges carried
by the atoms in a molecule of a compound, we can ascertain whether
any given chemical reaction does or does not imply interchange
between the electric charges on the atoms taking part in the reaction.
 Thus take the reaction
                          CHi + Cl^CHaCl+HCl.
If we represent the sign of the charge of electricity carried by an
atom by + or — placed below the symbol representing that atom,
we may write the last reaction as
                         CH4+C1C1 = CH3C1 + HC1,
                         -+     +-      -++      +  -
so  that this reaction could be produced by a rearrangement of the
atoms without any alterations of their electrical charges.
   If, however, we take the reaction —
                             HH + C1C1 =   2HC1,
                             + -   +  -     + -
 we see that   in addition to a rearrangement of the atoms there must
in  this case be an interchange of electric charges between the atoms     ;
for before combination half the hydrogen atoms had a negative
cbarge, and half the chlorine atoms a positive one, whereas after com
bination no hydrogen atom has a negative charge, and no chlorine
atom a positive one. We may thus distinguish between two classes of
chemical reactions, (1) those which do not necessarily require any
interchange of the electrical charges carried by the atom, and (2)
those which do. It might, perhaps, repay investigation              to see
whether the occurrence of chemical change is affected by the presence
of a third snbstance in the same way in these classes of chemical
combination.
   Another point to be considered is the effect of this difference
between the chemical actions on the amount of heat developed during
chemical combination.        When hydrogen and chlorine combine the
heat prodnced may       be  regarded as the^ joint effect of three pro
cesses  : —
   1.  The splitting up of the molecules[(H      H)   and (CI CI) into the
                                              +   -        +  -
atoms H, H, CI, CI.
          +  -   +  -
   2.  A  transference of electricity by which the negative charge on
one atom of hydrogen is replaced by an equal positive charge, while
the positive charge on an atom of chlorine is replaced by an equal
negative charge.

   3. The combination of the positively electrified hydrogen atoms
with the negatively electrified chlorine ones to form hydrochloric
acid.
   In that  class of chemical action where the atoms retain their charge
(2)  is absent, so that if the change in energy occurring in the pro
cess (2) were considerable compared with the changes occurring in
processes (1) and (3), the thermal effects of the two types of chemical
combination ought to differ considerably.      If the changes in energy
occurring in the process (2) had a great preponderance over those
occurring in (1) and (3), the thermal effects produced by the com
bination of two elements ought to follow very simple laws. For if
2{H} is the excess of the energy of an atom of hydrogen charged
with the negative electron over the energy of the atom charged with
the positive electron, 2{C1} the excess of the energy of an atom of
chlorine charged with the positive electron over the energy of the atom
charged with the negative electron, then if we could neglect the
energy changes in (1) and (3) compared with those in (2), the
mechanical equivalent of the heat developed when a molecule of
hydrogen combines with one of chlorine to form two molecules of
hydrochloric acid would be equal to 2{H} + 2{C1}. Thus we see that
if the energy changes in (2) preponderated largely over those in (1)
and (3), the heat produced when an clement A combined with another
element B to form the compound AB, could be expressed as the sum
of two numbers {A} and {B}, where {A} depends solely on the
element A, {B} solely on the element B. In some cases of chemical
combination between dilute solutions there seems evidence that the
heat produced can be expressed in this way (see Lothar Meyer, " The
Evolution of the Doctrine of Affinity," ' Phil. Mag.,' vol. 23, p. 504),
but when we attempt to apply the same law to combination between
gases, it seems utterly to break down, indicating that in such cases
the greater purt of the changes in energy occur in the splitting up of
one set of molecules and the subsequent formation of others.        This
view seems to be supported by the phenomena attending the discharge
of electricity through rarefied gases, for the smallest difference of
potential which can send a discharge through an electrified gas
(which we have reason to believe involves the splitting up of
molecules into atoms), is very many times the electromotive force
required to liberate the ions from an electrolyte, though the latter
process requires changes in the electrical charges on the ions.    These
reasons seem to indicate that we can hardly expect to get any clear
indication of the charges carried by the atoms in gaseous compounds
from the study of the thermal changes which occur when gases enter
into chemical combination.
   Vapours of Organic Compounds. — These show very interesting
differences between the spectra on the two sides of the plate when

254                       Prof.  J. J.  Thomson.                 [June 20,
the discharge passes through them. Thus when the discharge first
passes through the vapour of ethyl alcohol, C3H60, the spectrum on
the positive side of the plate is the candle spectrum, that on the
negative side the carbonic oxide spectrum.           For some little time
                                    I
after the discharge commenced could not detect any hydrogen lines
on either side of the plate; after a time, however, they appeared on
the negative side but not on the positive.      If the discbarge was kept
running for some time without letting a fresh supply of alcohol into
the tube, the " candle spectrum
                                    " on the
                                             positive side of the plate was
replaced by the CO spectrum, which now occurred on both sides of
the plate, accompanied on the negative side by the hydrogen spectrum.
This is the appearance presented by all the compounds of carbon,
oxygen, and hydrogen which        I   examined, when the spark had been
passing through them for a considerable time, and it is what would
occur if the vapour were decomposed by the spark into carbonic acid,
water, and hydrogen.
   The appearance of the candle spectrum on the positive aide of the
plate with the CO on the negative was observed in many other cases.
                                                        I
Thus on sparking through a tube filled with CO could not detect
any difference between the spectra on the two sides of the plate, but
when a little hydrogen was let into the tube the " candle spectrum
                                                                          "
appeared on the positive side of the plate, the carbonic oxide spectrum
on the negative.     The same effect was observed in a tube filled with
cyanogen    mixed   with a little hydrogen.    When the tube was filled
with the vapour of methyl alcohol, CH8OH, the candle spectrum
was on the positive side of the plate, the carbonic oxide and hydrogen
spectra on the negative ; with this vapour, unlike that of ethyl
alcohol,  I  could not detect any stage when the hydrogen spectrum
was absent.
   The first explanation which occurs to one of this phenomenon is
that it is owing to the potential gradient at the negative side of the
plate being steeper than that on the positive, so that we may imagine
we have a fierce spark on the negative side, a mild one on the posi
tive, and that the fierce spark gives the CO spectrum, the mild one
the candle spectrum.      There are, however, some phenomena which
seem inconsistent with this explanation : in the first place if the
current is reversed after flowing in one direction, traces of the former
spectra linger for some time at the sides of the plates, and, secondly,
if the difference is due to the greater decomposition at the negative
side of the plate, how is it that in the case of the vapour of ethyl
alcohol the hydrogen spectrnm is not seen, at the commencement of
the discharge, on the negative side of the plate ? It only appears after
the discharge has passed through for some time, when hydrogen has
probably been set free by the decomposition of the vapour by the dis
charge. If the absence of the candle spectrum from the negative side

of the plate is due to the spark being so intense that the hydro-carbon
which is supposed to be the origin of this spectrum cannot exist, then
we ought to see the spectra of the substances which result from the
decomposition of the hydro-carbon, i.e., we ought to see the hydrogen
spectrum at the negative electrode. The view which seems most in
accordance with the results of observations on the discharge through
                                 " candle             " is the
these vapours is that the                  spectrum              spectrum of
carbon when the atom is charged with negative electricity, or of some
compound of carbon in which its atom is negatively charged, while the
"carbonic oxide" spectrum is the spectrum of carbon when the atom
is charged with positive electricity, or of some compound in which
the carbon atom is positively charged.
   Discharge through an Elementary Gas. — It has long been known
that when the discharge passes through some elementary gases, the
spectra at the two electrodes are different.         This was first shown to
be the case for nitrogen, then Dr. Schuster showed that the same
thing occurred with oxygen, and recently Mr. Crookes has shown
that it is also true in the case of argon.         I  have observed a very
striking change in the relative brilliancy of the red and green
hydrogen lines at the two electrodes.            When the tube with the
plate   across  it was   filled with  hydrogen at a low pressure, then ^n
 the positive side of the plate the red line tends to be brighter than
 the green, while on the negative side the green line tends to be
 brighter than the red ; in some tubes this was so marked that on
 the positive side of the plate the red line was bright, and the green
 invisible, while on the negative side of the plate the green line was
 bright, and the red invisible.           The spectroscope     I   was using
 weakened the red rays much more than the green, so that I
 cannot be sure that the red rays were really altogether obliterated
 on the negative side of the plate ; the above experiment is, however,
 sufficient to show that on the positive side of the plate the red rays
are more easily excited than the green, while on the negative side
the green line is more easily excited than the red. On the negative
side of the plate we have an excess of positively charged hydrogen
atoms, while on the positive side of the plate there is an excess of
negatively charged hydrogen atoms, and           I  am inclined to attribute
the difference in the spectra partly at any rate to the difference in
properties between a positively and a negatively charged hydrogen
atom. The reason       I  do not attribute it wholly to the difference in
the potential gradient on the two sides of the plate is that the effect
is not reversed immediately, but only gradually on reversing the
coil, the former spectra clinging for some time to the sides of the
plate.

sides of the plate, but    with negative results.   Chlorine seems a gas
in which we might expect to find this effect, for as Dr. Schuster,
in his Report on Spectrum Analysis, says, the behaviour of its spec
trum indicates that we have several spectra superposed. I have not,
 however, been able to effect a separation of its spectra, the differences
 I observed between the spectra on the two sides of the plate were
 irregular, and due, I think, to impurities producing effects like those
 observed when the discharge passes through a compound gas. How
 ever, as has been mentioned before, there is even in the case of gases
where distinct evidence of separation can be obtained, a region of
 pressure within which the effects are irregular, and       I ascribe my
failure to observe separation in the case of chlorine to my having
failed to get the relation between the intensity of the discharge and
the pressure so adjusted as to get outside this irregular region.      The
 cases, however, in which distinct differences between the spectra of
a simple gas occur at the two electrodes, seem to indicate that the
spectrum given by an element is influenced by the sign of the
electrical charge carried by its atoms.
    I  have made some experiments to determine whether there was
any separation produced in a mixture of equal volumes of hydrogen
and chlorine kept in the dark, when a considerable difference of
potential though not sufficient to produce discharge was maintained
between the two electrodes. The parts of the tube adjacent to the
two electrodes could be shut off from each other by a tap, and the
amount of chlorine in the two sides was determined by absorbing it
by caustic potash. The mixture was at atmospheric pressure, and
the electrodes were maintained at a potential difference of about
1,200 volts by connecting them to a large battery of small storage
cells.    The potential difference between the terminals was main
tained for about 16 hours on three separate occasions, bat on
analysing the vessels surrounding the two electrodes, the amount
 of chlorine in the vessel adjacent to the negative electrode did not
 differ from that in the vessel adjacent to the positive electrode by
 more than 1 per cent., and this could be accounted for by errors of
 experiments, as test experiments in which the mixture had not been
 exposed to the electric field gave differences comparable with these.
  We should conclude from the preceding experiments that the
  molecules of a gas are not acted on by any appreciable translational
  force tending to move them from one place to another, when they
  are near to a body charged with electricity.        To test this point
  further, two large terminals were placed in bulbs which were con
  nected by a horizontal capillary tube, in which a drop of sulphuric
 acid was placed ; a difference in the pressure of the gas would cause
  the sulphuric acid to move, and the arrangement acts as a very
  delicate pressure gauge.      The bulbs aud tube were filled with

nected to the electrodes of a battery giving a potential difference of

be detected.

   The key to the solution of the composition of the vertebral column
is given by the metameric repetition of the four pairs of symmetri
cally arranged cartilaginous elements, the origin of which we have
traced in Fishes, namely —
       One pair of basidorsalia.
       One pair of basiventralia (with its lateral outgrowths = ribs oi-
         pleurapophyses,     and haemal, ventral outgrowths = haemal
         arches, chevrons, wedge- bones, haemapophyses).
       One pair of interdorsalia.
       One pair of interventralia.
   The first of these four pairs is always present and forms the neural
arch.    Of the other three pairs any one may be suppressed, some
times even two in the same skleromere.
   The vertebrae of the Amphibia and Amniota possess only arch-
centra, because the chordal sheath takes no share in their formation.
   According to the composition of these arco-genous centra or bodies
we distinguish the following lines of evolution : —-

            2. Or the basidorsalia    and basiventralia fuse together and
                 form the middle of the vertebral body, while the inter-
                 basalia form neutral zones of intervertebral cartilage.

   III. Interventralia and basiventralia          are reduced.     The vertebrae
          consist    of dorsal elements only, so-called            " epichordal "
          type. (Trnnk of Pipa, Xenopus, Bombinator.)
   IV. The interdorsalia are reduced. The interventralia are enlarged
          and form the centrum.            (Gastbocentbous type.)
   IVa. The three remaining components ossify separately and remain
          separate ; the basiventralia are still large and carry most of
          the neural arch. (All the vertebrae of Eryoyse, Cricotus, the
          atias of the Amniota.)
   I Vb. The centrum is much enlarged, forms the whole of the " body,"
          and carries the neural arch (neurocentral suture).                  The
                                                                 "

          disks     or menisci, attached to the cranial end of the
          centrum ; when less reduced, they appear as the so-called
                              " intercentra," or chevrons.
          wedge bones,                                         (Trunk and tail
          of most Amniota.)
   IVc. The centrum and the neural arches alone constitute the ver
           tebra. The basiventrals are lost completely. (Trunk of many
            Amniota, for instance, the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae of
           lizards, caudals of many mammaha and birds.)
    The phylogeny of these modifications may be expressed as follows :—

    The  ribs are homologous structures throughout the vertebrata.
 They are lateral distal outgrowths of the original basiventralia, with
which they later on form joints, and they ossify independently.
    The " chevrons," the bony arms or arches which enclose the caudal
 canal, are more ventral or median outgrowths of the same basiven
 tralia and are to be called luemapophyses. They are possibly serially

1895.]       Vertebral Column      of Amphibia and Amniota.            259
homologous with the visceral arches, but any attempt to homologize
them with, or to consider them as distal outgrowths of the inter-
ventralia, results in failure.          Ribs and haemapophyses are not
homologous structures, although both are ventral arches in a general
sense.
   The ribs are originally attached by their capitula, to the basi-
ventralia ; the tubercular attachment to the neural arch is a secondary
acquisition.    When the basiventralia are reduced, the ribs either
retain their old attachment and appear henceforth as " intervertebral
                                                                         "
organs, e.g., in many mammalia, in the anterior cervicals of Hatteria,
and in many vertebrae of Chelonia ; or they transfer their attachment
backwards upon the centrum, in some cases even upon the neural
arches.
   The spinal nerves arise originally in a transverse level behind the
basidorsalia and in front of the interdorsalia, i.e., itrtravertebrally.
Each nerve issues behind, or through the neural arch of the vertebra to
which it genetically belongs.        The first spinal nerve, when it is a
N. sub-occipitalis (although this nerve is not in all vertebrata the
same serial entity) has lost its vertebra, the latter being added to the
skull, either completely, without leaving post-cranial remnants
(Amniota), or incompletely, and in this case the ventral arcualia,
probably the interventralia only, are added to the first vertebra as an
odontoid-like process (Urodela).

                          Morphology and Classification.
       During the progress of my investigation of the bacterial flora of
    the River    Thames, I have frequently isolated from the water a
    schizomycete, which turns out to be in many respects one of the
. most interesting forms yet met with, and probably one of the most
    instructive species yet known to science.
       It occurs at all seasons, more or less, but oftenest during the
    autumn and winter months, and is found on the isolation plates as
   white colonies, becoming yellowish with age, which rapidly develop
   into large membranous growths, so like the mycelium of a fine mould
   that it is quite conceivable, or even probable in some cases, observers
   might pass it by as a small mucor or other fungus, not belonging
   to the schizomycetes at all.
       It appears on the plates at all times of the year, though it seems
   to be commoner in the river water taken in autumn and winter than
   in the samples of spring and summer.
      It attracted my attention at an early period in the investigation,
  owing to its rapid growth, the relatively large size of the filaments
  and cells, and especially the facility with which it can be made to
  develop spores.     Moreover, it presents certain superficial, though not
  unimportant, resemblances in some of its characters to cultures of
  Bacillus anthracis, fiom which species, however, it is decidedly dis
  tinct, as evinced by its larger size and other pronounced characters.

   I  have now, after long and careful studies of its behaviour on
different media, and in various circumstances, little hesitation in
referring this species to Fraenkel's Bacillus ramosus, the form com
monly known as the Wwrzel-bacillus in Germany, but which passes
under various names, and concerning which there is still a good deal
of confusion in the various text-books and bacterial floras which
mention it.
   I  shall discuss these matters and the synonymy at the end of the
present section of the paper ; but since      I have succeeded in following.
out the life-history of this species in a singularly complete manner,
and find the organism a remarkably typical and instructive one, it
has seemed worth while to give in detail all the facts which have
come under my observation, and especially to call the reader's atten
tion to the fact that it runs through its entire life-history, from spore
to spore-formation, in from thirty to sixty hours at ordinary tempera
tures,* and that    I have been enabled to follow the course of this life-
history by    continuous  observations under powers (l/12th and l/20th
oil-immersions) much higher than have commonly been successfully
employed for such observations.
                           Bacteriological Cultures.
   In the preliminary plate-cultures in 10 per cent. gelatine, made to
isolate it from the Thames water, the colonies look so like the
mycelium of a fine white mould fungus, that, as said, it is quite con
ceivable they might be overlooked or neglected by observers not
sufficiently on their gnard concerning such deceptive forms.           In fig. 1
is represented one of these colonies,'natural size, as seen on the second •
day, at 15° C.      From a darker centre, which already shows signs of
softening and liquefying the gelatine, wavy strands, of varying
diameters, radiate outwards, and break up into finer and finer strands
or filaments, until they fade away imperceptibly at the margins. The
whole of this circular colony has a milky-white, somewhat opaque
appearance,     especially in the denser centre, which may have a
yellowish tinge now or a little later ; as we approach the indistinct
 margins, the opacity gradually gives way to a translucency, and
 eventually transparency, which prevent sharp demarcation from the
 gelatine around.
    In a recorded series of observations of such colonies, at 15° C,            I
 found they were first visible to the unaided eye in about forty to
 forty-eight hours ; in seventy-two hours the average diameter was
 25 mm. ; in ninety-six hours about 50 mm. ; and in six days (164
 hours) a single colony covered nearly half the area of a Petri dish.
    * The ease with which it can be obtained and grown suggests that this species
 would be a much better type for teaching purposes than the smaller B. subtilis
 commonly used.

                     Report on the Bacteriology of Water.               267
      Examined under a low power (^-in. objective), the radiating strands
   are   found to consist of closely woven and interwoven, wavy, and
   coiled tresses of filaments, with a distinct yellowish colour such as
  protoplasmic structures usually present by transmitted light. These
  tresses (fig. 2) break up into finer and finer strands, as said, towards
  the margin, and finally into single filaments.
      The coarser tresses may consist of twenty to thirty closely twisted
  or woven filaments, and are perfectly evident even to the unaided
  eye in older (e.g., six days) colonies, the margins of which, as shown
  in fig. 3, remind one of a complex river-system as depicted on a map,
  or even of the yellowish, radiately-veined plasmodium of some
  myxomycete.
     I  suppose this radiating meshwork of yellowish- white strands    was
  one character    that suggested the resemblance to a network of      fine
  rootlets, creeping on a flat substratum, and so gave origin to        the
  German name ( Wurzel-bacillus) for this species.
     As we shall see subsequently, the individual filaments, twisted  and
  woven to form the tresses and meshwork referred to, are the very
 long, wavy, coiled, or straight cell-series of the schizomycete.
     The liquefaction of the gelatine at 15° C. commences only slowly
  about the second day, when the centre of the colony is soft beneath
 the dense membrane of tresses ; it gradually progresses day by day,
 until, about the fourth day, the plate can no longer be upturned
  without liquid oozing from below. In about a week most of the
 colonies are floating on the fluid mass of liquefied gelatine.       The
 liquid is slimy,   and never  seems  to become  completely watery, as is
 the case with some species.      At higher temperatures, such as 20° and
 25° C., the liquefaction is more rapid, in proportion to the quicker
development and growth generally.
     Colonies submerged deep down in the solid gelatine of a tube grow
also, though more slowly than those at the surface ; this is enough
to show that the organism is partially anaerobic, though only to a
very slight extent. The stab-cultures to be described demonstrate the
same fact.       The ultimate filaments themselves are long, straight,
wavy, or spirally-coiled cylinders, averaging about l-75 ft in diameter,
and regularly divided into segments by transverse septa, at intervals
of from 3 to 5 or 6 /t. It depends on the stage of development and
other factors how far these segments are isolated from one another.
In some cases, especially in the young colonies, the cylindrical fila
ments are merely septate ; in others they are indented at the septa,
and we may then speak of the filaments as more properly seg
mented ; while in yet other cases the segments are so nearly isolated
— evidently by more or less complete fission of the septa — that it is
almost necessary to regard the filaments as long chains of segments
end to end.


                  Report on the Bacteriology of Water.                         269
       It
     hardly needs pointing out that these are merely so many stages
in the progressive segmentation into bacilli, each bacillus being
therefore a cylindrical rodlet, from 3 to 5 or 6 ft long by about 175 ft
broad, and with rounded ends (see figs. 9 — 13).
  Before this complete segmentation into bacilli, however, which
only occurs, as a rule, very late in the life-history, the septate fila
ments often break across here and there at a septum, and so we have
shorter filaments, each with twenty, fifty, or a hundred or more septa.
  As I shall have to recur to these matters when tracing the develop
ment, however, no more need be said here further than that fila
ments and rodlets alike are usually quiescent, even in the liquefied
gelatine,* and no cilia can be detected at any time; for the very
slow growth-movements to be described later would hardly come
under the head of motility in the sense ordinarily used in bac
teriology.
   Streak-cultures on gelatine at 15° C. result in very pretty and
characteristic growths.    A rapid extension of the tresses and fila
ments above described is effected from the streak all over the surface
of the gelatine, so that in three or four days the white mycelium
like membrane covers nearly the whole area (fig. 4), and presents
some resemblance to the diagram of the digestive and blood systems
of certain worms.      Meanwhile the gelatine begins to soften and
liquefy,  and  on the fifth day the film, more or less broken up, is
floating on the liquid. In ten days nearly all the gelatine is liquefied.
and flocks of broken film float on and in it. The liquid does not
show any noticeable turbidity at any time.
   Stab-cultures in 10 per cent. gelatine at 15° C. are even more
beautiful.    From the white axis formed along the line of puncture,
radiating silky-looking filaments branch out horizontally towards
the walls of the tubes, and by the second or third day the culture
looks so like a root, with its silky root-hairs radiating around, that
this stage would seem best to justify the German name Wurzel-
bacillns : it resembles strongly some cultures of Bacillus anthracis.
On the fourth day liquefaction of the gelatine has definitely begun
at the top, and the " root-hair system
                                           " now looks more like an
 inverted fir-tree (to use Fraenkel's simile), and this resemblance
 becomes more and more perfect as the culture gets older (see figs. 5,
 (5,and 7).
    The liquefaction of the gelatine progresses slowly from above
downwards, and the felted yellowish- white membrane floating on
 the top gradually breaks into flocculent patches.     Even after three
 weeks the liquefaction has only extended about one-eighth of the
 distance from the top of the gelatine, but the fir-tree resemblance              is
       *    A
       slow movement of isolated segments breaking off at high temperatures   (about
35° C.) must be regarded as abnormal, as will be seen later on.

more pronounced on inverting the culture, owing to the depression
of the longer lower branches (fig. 7).
                     -
    At 20° C. the development is similar, but the "root-hair" or
" inverted fir-tree"
                        system and liquefaction proceed more rapidly.
    Cultivated as a streak on agar at 20° C. the development is some
what like that of the streak-cultures on gelatine, except that the
widening streak and fimbriated offshoots which it gives off at right
angles (fig. 8) are of a more opaque, granulated, chalky-white
appearance, presenting resemblances to cotton-wool rather than to a
silk texture. About the third day this granulated, chalky, mould
like growth has begun to develop spores in abundance, and as these
ripen and the filaments break up into segments, the whole assumes a
white pasty consistency.
   Cultivated on potato at 20° C, this schizomycete grows rapidly at
first, and in twenty-four hours looks like a dry, white mould spread
ing over the surface.       After about forty-eight hours the surface of
the thickish membrane formed becomes still dryer and duller in
appearance, and by the third day the mass looks like a slightly
wrinkled, powdery, rather thick, drying up pasty layer, white tinged
with yellow or grey.         In this stago further extension ceases and
spores are forming, and after five or six days magnificent crops of
well-ripened spores are to be obtained from these potato-cultures.
   In broth at 20° C, abundant flocculent growths are evident in
twenty to twenty-four hours, but no general turbidity. In forty-
eight hours a thick, dull-white, mould-like membrane is formed on
the surface, and flocculent cotton-wool-like masses have developed
below, and occasional flocks of the same kind float in the otherwise
clear broth.      The floating membrane thickens rapidly, but the
 submerged flocks do not develop so quickly, evidently owing to the
want of oxygen below the surface.            As the membrane breaks up,
flocks fall through the liquid and increase the cottony deposit, but
otherwise no further change occurs up to the sixth or seventh day,
 when all growth ceases.           The liquid remains clear throughout,
evidently because the filaments do not break up into motile bacilli.
All attempts to find cilia — by Loeffler's method as well as by the
improved form of it given by Alfred Fischer* — have failed, and there
can be little doubt that, like anthrax and some other forms, no such
 organs are present, common as they may be in the group of schizo-
mycetes generally.!
    Cultivated in milk at 20° C, no changes are visible at first, but it
grows slowly and gradually dissolves the casein, with an alkaline
reaction.     The liquor becomes yellow, and copious networks of fila
ments are to be found in the cream above.

    In   a 3 per cent,    solution      of glucose, to which a little broth and
Liebig's extract (mere traces) are added, the cultures at 20° C. show
rapid growth in twenty-four hours as white cotton-wool-like flocks,
resembling those formed in broth.
    Further research has shown that it grows readily in and on all
-ordinary media, at all temperatures from 12 — 15° C. up to 27 — 30° C.,
the optimum being near 25° C. Bnt it is also capable of slow growth
at temperatures below          7° or 8° C., and even above 38 — 39° C. for a
short time. It is not strictly aerobic, but nearly so, and yields no
pigment or other pronounced excretion.
    I   owe to the kindness of Dr. W. S. Lazarus-Barlow, of the
 Pathological Laboratory, Cambridge, the following proof that this
organism is not pathogenic : —
    " The question whether the bacillus were pathogenic or non-patho
 genic was investigated on mice and on guinea-pigs.                            Beef-broth-
cultures of ages varying from one to seventy-eight days, and in
 quantities of 2 c.c. in the case of the mice and 20 c.c. in the case of
guinea-pigs, were used.           The mice were inoculated sub-cutaneously,
 and the guinea-pigs intra-peritoneally. In no animal was any devia
 tion from the normal observed except such as were directly and
 solely attributable to the introduction of the aseptic needle of the
 syringe.     The bacillus is therefore non-pathogenic.                  This conclusion
 is further supported by the fact that the bacillus grows better at the
 room-temperature than at the body-temperature."
    I  have to record my thanks not only to Dr. Lazarus-Barlow for the
 trouble he took in the above investigation, but also to Professor Roy
 for permitting the investigation in his laboratory.

   It    is obvious from the foregoing researches that this schizomycete
comes into the group of true bacillar forms.                       If we adopt the very
exhaustive classification attempted by Saccardo,* it goes into the

    second of his three sub-families    — the Baculogence — though it is some
    what difficult to accept his statement that the bacillar segment, and
    not the filament, is the primary form.         Be this as it may, however,
    this Thames schizomycete must be excluded from the Trichogence,
    Saccardo's first sub-family, embracing the genera Crenothrix, Clado-
    thrix, Beggiatoa, and their allies, as well as from his third group —
   the Coccogenat — which includes Micrococcus,        Sarcina, Streptococcus,
    &c., &c.
       Among the Baculogence — which includes the genera Bacillus, Clos
   tridium, Vibrio, Bacterium, and their allies — it clearly comes under
   the Endosporece, a group embracing those genera which produce
   definite spores in the rods — Pasteuria,         Thiodictyon, Mantegazzia,
   Bacillus, Pasteurella, Clostridium, Cornilia, Vibrio, Spirillum, and
   Spiromonas.
       Pasteuria is excluded by its mode of longitudinal division.       Thio
   dictyon by   its ccenobial colonies.   Spirillum  and  Spiromonas by their
   regular corkscrew-like twisting. Cornilia and Vibrio by their pecu
   liar spore-formation and other characters ; whence we are reduced to
   the true bacilleae (Eubacilleai) .
      This sub-group includes the genera Mantegazzia, with fusiform
  rodlets ; Bacillus, with cylindrical rodlets ; and Pasteurella and
   Clostridium, each of which has peculiarities            of spore-formation
  different from those described.
      This brings us to the genus Bacillus proper.
       The further subdivision of this genus is still very unsatisfactory.
   Saccardo adopts a series of sections based on the habitats, whether
  anthrophobic,      zoobic, pyogenic, zymogenic, saprophytic, and endo
  phytic, subdividing further, according to the organs the pathogenic
  forms occur in, the behaviour towards gelatine, whether they form
  pigments, and so on.
      Accepting this provisionally, the species in question comes under
. the saprophytic section. Here we find forms peculiar to the surface
  of the human body, or to the blood of cadavers, &c., and others
  especially characteristic of putrefaction, or stagnant water, and so on.
       Clearly the present species is a Bacillus found in water, not neces
  sarily stagnant, however, and saprophytic.         It is, moreover, aerobic,
  achroic, and liquefies gelatine at ordinary temperatures, as we have
  seen.
      If we now inquire what species this form belongs to, there are
  several decided and well-marked characters to guide us.           There are
  not many schizomycetes known which are so persistently filamentous,
  and form such large, mycelium-like colonies on gelatine, and whose
  cells measure over l-5 ft in thickness ; which, moreover, easily form
  large, oval spores, and, finally, have such a characteristic stab-
  culture as this one.

274           Profs. Percy Frankland and Marshall Ward.
    Taking the large size of the bacillar segments as our primary clue,
the vast majority of known bacillar or filamentous schizomycetes
rarely exceed 0-5 ft in diameter, and very few surpass 1
    Of these, we may at once dismiss Van Tieghem's giant B. crassus,
4 n in diameter, and the thickest form known,* and even De Bary's
B. megaterium, 2- 5 u in diameter, is much thicker than the form I am
discussing.
    A small number of species, such as B. Brassica, B. tumescent,
B. Zopfii, B. Mallei, B. ascoformans, B. indigogenus, approach our form
in dimensions, but their other characters at once separate them.
    B. anthracis presents several suggestive resemblances to the present
schizomycete, but it is thinner and smaller altogether, and its spores,
in addition to being smaller, germinate differently, and have differ
ent temperature requirements.             Moreover, though the stab-cultures
of B. anthracis resemble those of the Thames form, the gelatine plate
cultures are different.         The spores of the former are also much more
sensitive to light, and the Thames species is not pathogenic.
Maschek's " Baumchen-bacilhis," though it forms a dendroid stab-
 culture, differs in almost all its other characters, and ferments
saccharine solutions.
    As regards the tendency to form mycelium-like colonies on the
 plates, several species found in water and elsewhere resemble the
 Thames species, e.g., B. radiatus, B. muscoides, B. polypiformis, B.
 mycoides,   B. ramosus, B. implexus.f
    Of these, we may rapidly dismiss B. muscoides, B. polypiformis, and
 B. radiatus, since they are strictly anaerobic, and will not grow under
ordinary conditions, to say nothing of their many other specific
differences.
    B. implexus is too thin, and Zimmermann-s curt description of
 the colonies suffices to show that it is totally unlike the Thames form.
 B. mycoides is also too thin, but it forms oval spores, and the plate-
 cultures resemble those of the form in question in many particulars.                    .
 The potato-cultures differ, however. More information is wanted
 about this species, which is said to be very common in soil and water.
    There remains B. ramosus.           I understand by this specific name the
 form described by EisenbergJ under that name, and known in
                          " Wurzel-bacillus."
 Germany as the                                   Crookshank§ gives the latter
 under the name B.figurans, and as a synonym for Fliigge's B. mycoides,
 but Eisenberg gives quite a different description for the latter, and
 quotes Fliigge and Zimmermanu in support of his statements.

    Saccardo* gives under B. Praussnitzii, a synonym B. ramosus
liquefaciens of Fliigge ; whether this is the same           I  cannot determine
from the very short and vague description.
                                            "
    Macef gives B. radicosus as the wurzel-bacillus," but his descrip
tion is too vague to enable me to determine whether it is the B.
ramosus of Eisenberg ; he does not intend it for Fliigge's B. mycoides,
 however, since he describes that separately. Zimmermann also gives
 it as B. radicosus and Tataroff as B. radiciformis.%
    The Franklands,§ who found the same, or a very similar, form
 common in the Thames and Lea, regard their species as the B. ramosus
 of Eisenberg and Praenkel, and as the " wurzel-bacillus," and Lustig||
 gives the descriptions separately, but remarks on their probable
 identity.
    I  have    little doubt that the species I have isolated from the
 Thames is Eisenberg's and Lustig's B. ramosus; that it is the
 " wurzel-bacillus " of Fraenkel and Eisenberg ; and that it is identical
 with that found by the Franklands, though the figures given by the                  '
 latter are not clear enough to identify it by.
    In the size of the rodlets and filaments, mycelium-like plate-
 colonies, root-like stab-cultures,          behaviour on agar and potatoes,
 characters of the spores, and, indeed, in almost every detail of which
 I can get information, my Thames form agrees with Fraenkel's
 B. ramosus, the " wurzel-bacillus " of the Germans. What the forms
 described by Mace, Crookshank, Saccardo, and Fliigge may be is not
 clear, and probably some confusion exists here.
    It seems pertinent to remark here that many bacteriologists are not
 sufficiently careful in all cases to look up the synonyms of the forms
 they describe, though this precaution is really more necessary in the
 deplorable state of their literature than probably in any other
 department of biology.

     As the mass cultures prove, the spores germinate readily at all
  ordinary temperatures, whence was to be inferred that no extra
  ordinary difficulty ought to be incurred in observing the process, pro
  vided I could succeed in isolating a single spore under a sufficiently
  high power in a hanging drop, and such turned out to be the case.
     The methods and apparatus employed were similar to those I had

used previously      in isolating the yeasts and bacteria of the " ginger-
beer  plant."*
   A   small drop of nutrient gelatine or of broth, properly infected
with ripe spores from an agar tube, was placed on the under surface
of a sterilised cover-slip, and the latter luted by means of sterile
gelatine, so as to serve as the lid to one of the glass cultivating
chambers, properly sterilised, the floor of which consisted of a glass
slip, luted by means of melted paraffin.              Over the floor of the cham
ber was spread a layer of sterilised distilled water, and the tubular
arms were plugged with cotton-wool saturated with water, all pro
perly sterilised.      The hanging drop, selected by examining a number
and choosing that which appeared to contain only one, or at most a
very few spores, separated by a sufficient distance, had to be suffi
ciently flat to enable the lens to penetrate through its depth.
                                       Methods.
   As regards my own practice in making these cell-cultures, the
following note may be of use to other students ; though of course
different workers may operate differently.
   I first sterilise the plugged cells in the hot-air steriliser. When
these are nearly cool enough to han lle,               I heat the quartz or glass
floor of the cell between two plates of talc (about               3x6 inches) held
in a large bunsen flame, and allow it to cool slightly. The cell is
then placed in position on its floor, and a small block of high-
melting paraffin — cooled after sterilising — is placed just outside the
cell. The temperature is still high enough to melt this, and th-
liquid runs in by capillarity, and solidifies as the whole cools,
cementing the cell to its floor.
   When the culture is to be made                  I take such a prepared cell —
several can be prepared and kept in sterile glass-covered dishes — and
have ready the following : cover slips, a tube of infected gelatine (or
other medium), platinum loops, sterile stiff gelatine, forceps, sterile
water, and any convenient rest, such as a small ring of brass.
   First, the necessary water is placed in the plugged cell, care being
taken to wet the cotton plugs and that some water shall be retained
on the inner side of each, whether a layer is spread over the floor or
not.
   Second, a cover-slip is sterilised between the talc-plates, and while it
is cooling the platinum loops are held in the flame and teet aside to cool .
   Third, the cool sterile cover-slip is removed with the forceps,
and laid on the brass ring support.               Then the drop is quickly put
on the centre of the slip, and the latter inverted on to the cell, so
 that the drop hangs over the centre.
                    • See ' Phil. Trans.,' vol. 183, 1892, B. d. 125.

                   Report on the Bacteriology of Water.                        277
    Fourth, the slip with its hanging drop is now cemented as a roof
 to the cell by running melted sterile gelatine between it and the
 latter.
    A little  practice enables one to prepare such a culture in a few
 minutes, and very rarely need one go wrong if care is taken. The
 chief difficulties are with fluid drops, or very dilute gelatine, since
 they are apt to spread and run over the glass, especially when the
 air is moist and condenses quickly on the glass surface ; in these
 cases, however, a little experience enables one to avoid letting the
 cover-slip get too cold before the drop is attached — though, of
 course the opposite danger has to be guarded against.
    Having isolated a single spore, suspended in the drop of nutrient
medium beneath the objective — the observations were made with
 Swift's l/20th and Zeiss' l/12th oil immersion, and with Zeiss' E,
occ. 4 — a drawing of the freshly sown spore was at once made.                 The
culture was then left, with a bell-jar, darkened with black-paper over
the whole, at a temperature of 15° to 20° C,* and further observa
tions and drawings made at intervals.           Naturally there were many
failures, especially with the high-power immersion lens, and the
 following successful series were only obtained at intervals from
cultures in which the thickness of the cover-slip, and of the hanging
 drop, the sufficient isolation of the spore, and the normal germination
and further progress were suitable, and where no sudden changes of
temperature interfered to check the growth, dry up the gelatine, or
cause inconvenient condensations of moisture in the chamber, the
relatively large size of which has again proved advantageous owing
to the abundant supply of oxygen it ensures.
    Under the conditions referred to, the spore without materially
changing its ovoid shape begins to swell somewhat rapidly, and in
from one to two hours has increased its dimensions from about
T5 X 2 ft to 2 x 2-5 /t or more. As it does this the brilliant oil-drop
like contents become duller and more hyaline — like ground glass —
and the sharply marked, almost black membrane, gradually loses
some of the firmness of its contour, until it appears as a thinner
limiting membrane. At the same time it becomes surrounded by an
almost imperceptible pale halo-like investment which appears to be
derived from the deliquescence of its most external layers, probably
into a soft, transparent, swollen jelly.      (Cf. figs. 9 — 12.)
   In the course of the next one to two hours or so, the spore appears
to be elongating.       Close observation shows that this is due to a
thinning out of the membrane at one of the ends, and soon after
wards the thinned out wall gives way, and the pale, hyaline,
apparently homogeneous protoplasm, enveloped in an exceedingly

and higher.

tenuous membrane, pushes its way out and grows as -a blunt rod,
about T75 fi broad, with rounded apex, in the direction of the longer
axis of the spore.     (Figs. 9 c, 10 c, 11 c.)
    In about foui- or five hours from the beginning of germination
this straight rodlet has attained a length equal to twice that of the
spore, and two or three hours later it has a length of approximately
four times that of the spore (figs. 9 e, 10 d, 11 «), the membrane of
which is still observable usually      as a cap at the proximal rounded
end of the rod.     (Same figures and fig. 12 6, d, e.)
    The above is by far the commonest mode of germination, but in
some cases this normal condition of affairs is so far modified that
both ends of the spore are softened, and each gives rise to a germ
inal rodlet (fig. 12 c and g) in which case the remains of the spore-
membrane may be found either encircling the germinal rodlet, much
as a napkin ring does a- rolled up serviette (fig. 12 c), or ruptured at
one side and merely adhering to the rodlet as in fig. 12 g. Occa
sionally, rodlets which have germinated out in the normal mode are
found with the collapsed membrane lying loosely at one end, evidently
                                           /
having been thrown off, as in fig. 12 ; this seems to occur rather
frequently in the later stages of germination in broth-cultures.      All
these phenomena point to the elastic nature of the thin, but tough,
spore membrane.
    When the germinal rod or filament has attained a length equal to
about four or five times that of the swollen spore, the first division
wall is usually seen in the centre (figs. 11 e, 12 d, and e). Whether
the case illustrated in fig. 10 d is really an exception to this rule, or
whether the apparent septum closer to the spore was really the rim
of the burst spore (c/. fig 12 e),   I cannot be certain ; from the fact
       I
that could not trace it in the next stage (fig. 10 e) it seems likely
that the latter supposition is the correct one, and in any case the
rule is that the first transverse septum divides the whole germinal
filament into two cells approximately, but not necessarily exactly,
equal in length, and measuring about 3 to 5 ft long by 175 ft broad.
    The germination now rapidly proceeds by the growth in length of
the stiff and nearly straight filament along its whole course, and in
about six to eight hours from the commencement of the swelling of
the spore, the filament is from 8 to 10 times as long as the spore
 (figs. 9 e, 10 e, 11 /), and each of the two cells into which it was
segmented by the first transverse septum has been again bisected by
a septum, thus cutting the filament into four segments (figs. as
before).
  -
    The growth is therefore not merely terminal, but intercalary along
the whole filament.      I have spoken of the latter as being stiff and
nearly straight ; the qualifying word is necessary because close
observation of broth cultures shows that the rounded apex performs

 very slow and very slight movements, due to almost imperceptible
 curvatures of the filament.       These can be traced by watching the
 growth for a few minutes under the eye-piece micrometer, and are
 interesting as indications of slight movements of nutation.          As  I
 shall have to speak of these, and the measurements        I have made of
 them and of the rate of growth, when describing. the behaviour of the
 older filaments, however, they may be passed over here simply with
 the remark that they do occur.
    Even at this early stage, or a little later, the filaments, especially
 in broth cultures, may begin to break across, generally, but not
always, at the oldest septum (figs. 11 e, and 10 /), though this process
is by no means the common or normal one in rapidly growing
cultures (fig. 9/).
    Sooner or later, however, some amount of fission does occur, and
 the further behaviour of the two or more broken filaments is
interesting, as throwing light on the formation of the tresses and
strands, and their false branches, which we meet with later.
    Fig. 11/ and    g is an instructive case in point. As the first stage
shows, the filament broke at the oldest septum when little more than
eight times as long as the spore, and consisting of four segments,
and when only ten hours old.          The lowermost two-celled segment,
proximal to the spore, then slipped its now rounded tip to the right, and
continued growing; the uppermost, free and distal, two-celled seg
ment also grew so that both ends travelled further apart, and in such
a way that the tip of the proximal segment slipped along its right
side.    Further divisions followed on growth in both cases, and the
right hand (proximal) segment again broke during the night at its
oldest segment, when it had divided into four cells, the ends again
slipping over one another, so that at nine o'clock next morning
(twelve hours later) the state of affairs was as in fig. 11 g. This was
a gelatine culture, not growing very rapidly, but I shall have to
revert to these phenomena later in discussing the process of growth
in broth cultures.
    It is already intelligible, however, that this slipping of the broken
filaments one over the other, each portion growing independently
soon gives rise to strands or tresses         compounded of numerous
filaments, the free ends of which stand off as false branches (the
same thing is beginning in fig. 10/ and g), and so the initiation of a
colony, with offshoots radiating in all directions into the surrounding
medium, is established.
   From the fact that well isolated spores, freely suspended in a drop
of broth, give rise to filaments which may grow to many hnndred
times the length of the spore before any breaking across occurs, and
that such breakage is very apt to occur when one such long filament
eventually abuts on another, or on some obstacle which bends the

                  Report on the Bacteriology      of Water.              281
filament,   I am strongly inclined to refer the breakage       in the above
cases to mechanical causes, e.g., the resistance offered by   the gelatine.
Indeed,   I  have watched a long filament in broth, thus        abutting on
another, and seen it curve until bent into more than            half a circle
(evidently owing to intercalary growth between the two relatively
fixed ends) and then suddenly snap at one of the septa, and the two
freed ends dart past each other owing to the elasticity of the filament
which had given way. At the same time, there is a period when the
(much older) filaments are peculiarly apt to break up into shorter
segments, preliminary to spore formation, and this must be due to
other causes than mere fracture due to mechanical pressures or
tensions, indeed, even in the above cases       I  do not suppose that the
mechanical strains do more than determine the sudden rupture at a
septum already prepared to give way, but which probably would
not yet have done so had the filament been able to continue its onward
growth in a more or less straight line.
                            Formation of  Tresses.
    I have  already described one mode of formation of the strands or
tresses composed of numerous filaments lying parallel to one another,
by means of the sliding growth of the two pieces of a ruptured
filament one over the other.
    Perhaps an even more common process is the modification of this
figured in fig. 14 a to t, a series followed under the microscope
 (E occ. 4) on a broth culture at 17-5° to 19-5° C. The culture was the
same as that from which figs. 9 and 13 were obtained, and, in fact
just as fig. 13 represents particulars of the growth of one of the
filaments developed from the spore of fig. 9 (and traced in that figure
for the first thirteen hours of germination) followed from the twenty-
fourth to the twenty-sixth hour from germination, so this fig. 14 takes
up the further history of the same filament from twenty minutes
later through another four hours ; for the left-hand filament in fig.
14 a is the upper end of the filament e, fig. 13.
    We left this at 12.10 p.m., having traced its growth and nuta
tions during the preceding two hours.          At 12.30 the distal end of
another   filament, segmented   off lower  down,    was seen to be curving
over towards the one referred to, and half-an-hour later (fig. 14 6)
the tips of both were in contact and growing up alongside one another.
I  was strongly inclined to suspect the existence of a slight attraction
between them from the relatively strong curvatures towards each
other which they exhibited previous to contact, but could not be sure,
and thought possibly the phenomenon was of the nature of a merely
physical action. During the next hour (fig. 14 c, d, e) a longer and
longer stretch of the growing, curved, right-hand filament laid itself

close to the   rapidly elongating left-hand one, and then an interesting
and instructive phenomenon ensued.
    The long, curved, right-hand filament suddenly snapped at one of
its septa, and shortly after the drawing (e) was made the two ends
began to glide one over the other, and at 2.20 had assumed the
positions shown in fig. 14 /. The rapid growth of the extreme right-
hand filament caused it to curve strongly, and this marked curvature
increased, until at 3 p.m. the large curve looked as if the filament
was pressing the S-shaped one, trapped between it and the left-hand
spring-like filament, elastically against the latter. (Fig. 14 g).
    At any rate, the free end of this spring-like right-hand filament
slipped soon after over the lower half of the S to the left, while its
upper part went on, so to speak, pressing the upper limb of the S also
to the left, until it had trapped it close up against the back of the S
 (fig. 14 h), and then it also snapped.
     Comparison of the figures will convince us that the series of con
tiguous parallel filaments making up the middle portion of fig. 14 i are
 brought together by these repeated doublings up of the snapped fila
ments, pressing up close to one another. The series also shows pretty
 clearly how pronounced is the intercalary growth, e.g., along the
curved upper and lower line of the S-shaped piece in figs. g, h, and t.
     The process may be summarised as consisting in (1) the looping of
 filaments, which go on elongating by intercalary growth, the two
limbs of the loop being doubled one on to the other, possibly by pressure
of other filaments ; (2) the snapping of the same when the doubling
up becomes very sharp ; and (3) the straightening out of the broken
 pieces side by side, and further parallel growth in close contiguity as
a strand or tress.
     The case followed ia a relatively simple one. In larger and older
colonies, and in cultures where many colonies are growing together,
the tresses may consist of scores and even hundreds of such parallel
filaments. Moreover, they are not necessarily arranged in the flat,
ribbon-like manner depicted in these young and small cultures grow
ing in a thin layer of broth, but may be thick and of various sections.
     It will also be understood how — quite apart from any question of
 mutual attraction between filament and filament — the fact of the two
 terminal stretches of a long and otherwise free loop being relatively
fixed as they grow along the sides of such a strand, may force the
loop to make coils of various kinds during the elongation due to
intercalary growth, and it is thus      I  explain the extremely common
occurrence of these coils in large cultures.

mycete, has been the tracing of the successive stages of development
of the spores under high-power objectives ; and here again                 I  have
had the satisfaction of tracing the whole process in one of the fila
ments of the same series as those figured in figs. 9, 13, and 14.
   The strand drawn in fig. 14 i, was left at 5.30 p.m. at a stage too
complex to follow further, and when its age — reckoned from the swel
ling of the spore which produced the filaments — was 30^ hours.
At 9 o'clock next morning these filaments showed evidence of pro
ceeding to the development of spores, and before night every fila
ment had a completely developed spore in each of its numerous
segments, or if any of the segments remained barren they must have
been very few indeed.
   I  had already traced the development of the spores, but it was
obviously an interesting task to do this in one of these filaments which
I  had kept so continuously under observation, and the following
description refers to a portion developed during the night from the
further growth of one of the loose filaments in fig. 14 i.
   To do this      I exchanged the objective (E, occ. 4) for a l/12th oil
immersion, and at 10.30 a.m. made the notes of the first changes
which initiate the formation of the endogenous spores.               This culture
which, as we have seen, was in broth at 20° C* (occasionally lower),
was now aged 47§ hours from the moment of drawing the spores
(fig. 9 a).
   The first indication of spore-formation consists in the appearance
of brilliant points in the cells which have now ceased to grow or
divide.    There may be one or two or more of these bright spots in
each cell, and the septa show signs which seem to precede a tendency
to split.    They look swollen and bright, but I am not sure whether
this is really due to such a change in them, or whether it is owing
to a slight contraction of the protoplasm from contact with the
walls.
    During the course of the next three or four hours the bright, oily-
looking globulesf gradually enlarge, and, where more than one occur
in a cell, some may run together into one bright mass, which slowly
balls itself together in the centre of the cell, and, in the case described,
there was one such mass definitely established as an oval body in each
segment at 3.30 p.m. In the course of the next hour this bright, oval
body had increased in size, apparently at the expenso of the cell-
protoplasm in which it lay, and constituted a definite spore.                 This
slowly acquired a more and more pronounced spore-membrane towards

as a ripe spore like that started with sixty-nine hours previously.
   A still better series of stages observed in the development of the
spore is shown in fig. 18. • The filaments of a very vigorous culture
in broth at 20° C. were passing over to the development of spores in
nineteen to twenty hours after sowing, and at 10.55 a.m. the cells,
about twice as long as broad, had their protoplasm studded with the
minute brilliant points already referred to (fig. 18 a).      These bright
masses stain deeply with methylene blue, as said, and are prob
ably of the nature of the chromatin granules referred to in works on
bacteriology.*      They also slowly change their positions in the pro
toplasm,   and   at  11.40 a.m. had changed in numbers, positions, and
sizes, as shown in fig. 18 6.      These changes slowly proceeded, in the
case under observation, until all the bright substance was aggre
gated near the centre of the protoplasm into a more or less definite
oval body (fig. 18 c) which is evidently the incipient spore.          This
was at 9    p.m.     During the night these masses had each become
larger, more defined, and had clothed itself with a distinct cell wall
(fig. 18 d).     Each cell now contained one distinct oval spore,
and was more cut off from its neighbour by a tendency to rounding

 off.    The ripe spore does not contain all the cell-contents, but lies
 embedded in a matrix of something remaining over from the cell-
 protoplasm.       This might also be inferred from the double staining
 of which such preparations are capable.
     In this case, therefore, the whole life-history — from spore to spore
 — was gone through in a little over forty hours.
     Another equally interesting and rapid case of spore-formation is
 figured in fig. 19, where the changes in tho granules and the gradual
 isolation of the spore mother-cells are again evident traced under a
 still higher power (l/20th oil immersion).
     In fig. 20   I  have shown a series in a case which presents some
 points of extreme interest, which, it seems to me, would be well worth
 special study.
     A culture which       had been exposed to blue light, and was much
 retarded, began to show signs of spore-formation at 2 p.m. — the
 filaments being then sixty-four hours from sowing.               It was now in
 ordinary daylight, but        I  have no records of the details of tempera
 ture.
     The peculiarities observable are (1) the very late appearance of the
 bright granules; (2) that they were first developed in cells much
 longer than        usual ; (3) their slow changes of position during
 several hours (fig. 20 a — c) ; (4) the subsequent division of the
 cells to the short form characteristic of spore-mother-cells (fig. 20
 c, d) ; and (5) the incomplete           character of the spores when they
 did at last appear more definitely in some of the cells.
     I  cannot avoid the conclusion that the blue light had something
 to do with this retardation and hindrance of spore-formation — an
 observation quite in accordance with some earlier ones on the
 development of spores in fungi* — and, as said, believe the subject
 well worth further study.
     That the bodies above described are true spores is proved by their
 behaviour towards staining and other reagents, their resistance to
 high temperatures,t and above all by their germination which, as we
 have seen,     I have observed and traced stage by stage.
     They refuse to stain by all the ordinary methods for staining the
 bacilli, but stand out from the coloured protoplasm in such cases
 like brilliant colourless oil drops ; on the other hand they stain fairly
easily by the usual methods for spores, and especially with aniline-
fnchsin or anilin-methyl violet, after being passed 10 times through
the flame.
     The ripe spores from potato- or agar-cultures           germinated readily

in broth in which they were heated to 80° C. for two hours, and
somewhat more slowly in the same medium in which they were
boiled for a minute ; but after five minutes boiling they appeared to
be all killed, since none germinated out in six days at 20° C.
             Measurements     of Growth of   the Bods and Filaments.
    As will   be evident from    what has been said above concerning the
growth of the germinal filaments, they elongate in nearly a straight
 line so long as they are free to do so and meet with no mechanical
obstruction.      This fact, and the obviously rapid growth, led me
to a method for measuring the rate of elongation;                    and not only
did I succeed in doing this efficiently, but these growth measurements
carried me on much further and to some unexpected and interest
ing results in another connection.
    On placing the eye-piece micrometer so that its vertical division
crossed the long axis of a filament shorter than the scale, it was easy
to observe the gradual extension of the filament as its ends passed
over the divisions.       The value of each division was determined before
hand, by examining a stage-micrometer with the same combination
as I used for the measurements.
    Having selected a nearly straight filament which extended over
twenty-seven of the fifty divisions on the scale, and having deter
mined that each division was equal to 3/t for the power — Zeiss
 E  occ. 2 — employed,     it was evident the filament was        81 ft long.
    It  was growing in broth at 16° C. when put under observation at
 10.10 a.m., and was watched for two hours, during which period the
 thermometer rose from 18° C. to 20° C*                   The microscope stood
 under a shaded bell-jar at a south window, and the day was cloudy
 and dull.
    At 10.22 a.m. — i.e., twelve minutes after measuring the filament — it
 had elongated so as to cover thirty divisions instead of twenty-seven.
 In other words it had grown 9 /t longer (fig. 13 a, b) and had slightly
 altered its slight curvature.        At 10.45 it had grown another 12 ft (fig.
  13 c) ; at 11.30 it was longer by 18 ft, and at 12.10 its elongation
 amounted to 24 ft further.
    That is to say, in the interval from 10.10 a.m. to 12.10 p.m. (two
  hours) the total growth in length of the filament amounted to 63 ft.
 During the first twelve minutes the rate of growth was 0-75 ft per
  minute ; during the next twenty-three minutes the growth was at
 the rate of nearly 0-5 /i per minute ; during the next forty-five minutes
 it was at the rate of 0-4 ft per minute ; and during the last forty
  minutes at the rate of a little over 0-5 ft per minute.
    These facts may be conveniently tabulated as follows : —

    It is obvious that the growth is moderately rapid (the length would
be doubled in about 2£ hours at same rate), but it seems to vary
from time to time. An elongation of 63 ft in 120 minutes would give
nearly 0-3 ft per minute at constant rate, whereas the rate varies
considerably on either side of that.
    These variations could not obviously be attributed to variations in
temperature, for the thermometer was steadily rising the whole time,
           I
nor did think they could be due to the measurements, for although
the slight nutations do occasionally interfere with the strict accuracy
of these, the disturbance can hardly be imagined to be so great as
these variations imply, and repeated experience convinces me that
this is not the explanation at all.
   As already stated, the microscope was placed at a south window,
under a bell-jar surrounded with black paper, and, except during the
short periods necessary for drawing and recording, very little light
could reach the object.     The day was dull and rainy, but with some
what brighter intervals.     During the whole of the two hours the fila
ment was describing the slight writhing movements which regard    I
as nutation curvatures, and the extent of which can be estimated by
the drawings in fig. 13.
    But another idea strikes one in connection with these measure
ments.       If we take the germinating filaments, and draw thom
 vertically to scale, on sectional paper, at any rate as regard the
lengths attained during the various periods of growth, it is obvious
that if their lengths are arranged as vertical lines (ordinates)
on a base line divided into periods corresponding to the times
(abscissa) then the curve joining the tips of the filaments is the
curve of growth, and clearly we may substitute mere vertical lines
 (ordinates) for the detailed drawing of the filaments themselves.
    For instance, the curve of growth is got by straightening out the
filaments of fig. 24, where all are drawn to scale at the indicated
hours, and joining the tips — or, what amounts to the same thing, by
joining the upper ends of ordinates of equal lengths erected on a base
line.

   In the further observations      on growth,   I availed myself largely
of this idea and its consequences,    with results of considerable interest
and importance.
   The following measurements of the rate of growth of the germi
nating filament (as contrasted with the longer older filament) were
made. The spore was sown in 3 per cent. glucose solution (to
which a little broth was added) shortly after 4 p.m. : the temperature
was 20°— 21° C. throughout.
   From 5 p.m. to 6.5 p.m. the spore had swollen and elongated to 3 /t,
and the measurements began at 8.10 p.m., when the germinal filament,
still in the spore, measured G /<.
   At 8.40 p.m. the young rodlet had elongated to 9 ft— i.e., it had
grown 3 /t in thirty minutes.       At 9.45 it had grown another 9 ft.
From 9.45 to 11.0       p.m. it grew 12 /t. From 11.0 to 11.45 it had
grown     6 ft.
   The measurements were then discontinued        till 10.35 next morning,
when 45 «. additional had been added.

  The total growth in length from 8.10    p.m.,  when the length recorded
was 6 ft, to 10.35 next morning, when the length was 81 ft, therefore,
amounted to 75 ft in fourteen hours twenty-five minutes.        This gives
an average growth of about 0-086 ft per minnte, but the rate varied
considerably from time to time. Thus during the first thirty minutes
(from 8.10 to 8.40 p.m.) it was about 0-33 ft per minute.      During the
next sixty-five minutes it averaged only about half that amount, a
fact which puzzled mo exceedingly, and which           I   thought might
possibly  be  explained by  the germinal  rod  being engaged in prepara
tion for its first segmentation ; for the first septum was visible shortly
afterwards.     But during the next period, of ninety -five minutes, the
rate was apparently only about 0-12 ft per minute ; and during the
next forty-five minutes, almost the same average rate was observed,
whence  I   came to think the explanation temporarily entertained may
have to be abandoned.       Then came the break in the observations.
During the night 11.45 p.m. to 10.35 a.m. = 650 minutes — the
                     —
total growth was 45 ft, i.e., about 0-66 ft per minute on the average.

    From the general slowness of growth of this specimen, was more
inclined to suppose that the medium (3 per cent. glucose solution)
was less adapted for the needs of the organism than broth         is,
                                                                    a con
clusion fully borne out by tube-cultures, and subsequent experience.
    Spores sown in broth at 15° C. at        3    p.m., had given rise to
vigorously growing plants next morning, the long filaments of
which were already breaking up as described on p. 279. One of these
partial filaments was fixed under the micrometer scale, each division
of which corresponded to ft, with the combination (E/4) used. The
                           3
filament was quite straight, and its ends were covered by the 11th and
38th divisions respectively when the observations began. During the
whole period the temperature was 15° to 16° C. and did not fall or
rise outside those limits. Moreover, I     kept the microscope at a north
window, and by means of cardboard screens and by turning the
mirror between the observations, prevented any access of direct light
such as might possibly be suspected of inhibiting the growth.
    At 10.18 the filament was straight and measured 27 divisions of
the scale in length — i.e.,
                          it  was 81 ft long, and the following shows the
growths at successive intervals.

   It may     seem a remarkable        coincidence that this partial filament
 was the same length as that         measured previously, but the explanation
is very simple, though        I did  not discover it till later : it is that the
long filaments tend to begin          breaking up into isolated segments of
this length (each consisting         of several cells) very early under certain
circumstances.
   I  have given the measurements taken at 2, 3, and 4 p.m., but these
are far less useful than those preceding them, for two reasons : (1) th-
intervals are too long, and (2) the filament underwent considerable
curvatures from about 2 o'clock onwards, so that               I cannot- insist on
the accuracy of the measurements so strongly as on those made pre
viously.
   If, now, we examine these results, it is clear that the filament grows
more slowly at 15° C. than it does at 20° C, as was to be expected.
It is also evident that considerable variations in the rate of growth
occur during the whole period, and since             I  could not refer these to
the action of any external causes, it seemed necessary to assume that
we have here a case of periodicity due to internal causes of growth.
Thus, there was an acceleration between 10.49 and 11.2, and another
between 12.G and 12.25.          I  have as yet failed to correlate these with
any   observed    phenomenon,      but   it is clearly a question worth asking,
whether the slower periods intervening were not perhaps the periods
during which new septa were put into the filaments — i.e., period of
cell-division.       I was strongly inclined to think that is the case,
though     I   had hitherto been unable to actually satisfy myself by
directly observing the phenomenon.                 It is certain, however, that
the filament at the beginning of the observations had fewer septa
than at the end : for at 10.18 there were only 16 septa, whereas

                    Report on the Bacteriology of Water.                293
at 4       o'clock there    were certainly 23, and I   believe more, per
haps 25 or 26, but those most recently formed are very difficult to
see with the powers employed for measurements.
    The whole period of growth under observation was (from 10.18 a.m.
to 4 p.m.) six hours all but eighteen minutes, i.e., 342 minutes, and
during that period the total elongation (from 81 ft to 135 ft) amounted
to 54 ft, and taking the average length of the growing segments at
5 ft, this would agree very well with the above, and, so far as it goes,
                                         I
is evidence in favour of the view have supposed probable.
    Having regard to the paucity of exact measurements after 12.56 in
the above series, it is scarcely of value to note that the average rate
of increment over the whole period, at 15° C, seems to be about 0-15 /t
per minute ; and the less useful since we have seen that there are such
marked periods of slower and more rapid growth.          Nevertheless, this
 would amount to a good deal in, say, sixty hours ; if the germinal
filament from a spore 2 ft long continued to grow only at that
rate, the filament produced would be 600 ft long, and would be seg
mented into from 100 to 200 bacillar segments.          But this is far less
than actually occurs, as we shall see later.
    In the following case the spore was sown, in dilute broth, a little
after 10 a.m., and was put under observation by 11a.m. The tempera
ture was then 16° C. ; but it fell to 15° by 4 p.m., and slowly down to
12° C. by 7 p.m. The spore was germinating at 12.10 p.m., when it
measured 3 ft.

    This gives a total grow th of 19 5 ft in six hours and fifty-five
minutes, with an average growth of 0-09 ft per minute if the rate
were constant.
    I   was unable to distinguish any trace of a second septum up to
6.45, but at 7.5 the rod showed a perfectly sharp median septum, and
two extremely faint secondary septa— one on each side.
   I   thought there could be little doubt that the sharp fall in the rate
of growth at 6.27 and 6.45 was associated with the process of cell

division which initiated these new septa, because the fall in tempera
ture seemed probably too gradual and slow to account for it. No
doubt these septa were already present at 6.45, and the increased
rate of growth followed on their inception, but, with the power
employed, they would be invisible for some time, as experience had
shown me in other cases.
   The foliowing series were traced on a segment broken off from one
of the filaments of the same culture as the last, and is therefore
practically a continuation of that series into the night. It clearly
bears out the same conclusion, that the period of cell-division entails
more or less cessation of growth. In this case the temperature was
12° C. throughout the whole period during which the rod was kept
under observation, and the whole growth took place in the dark,
consequently the variations noticed cannot have been brought about
by recognisable changes in the environment, but must be referred to
internal causes.

    In this  case no septum was       visible at 7.8 P.m., but there was one at
 7.34 p.m., and the rod consisted of two cells.              At 8.39 to 9.28 we
have    another   period  of  slower growth, and during this interval each
 cell put in another septum ; then it increased again, up to 10.48 p.m.,
when the observations ceased for the night.
    At 8.30 on the following morning the filament measured 144 /t,
 having grown 106 ft during the nine hours and forty-two minutes,
 which would give 0-18 /t per minute as the approximate average if
 the rate were constant. This seems a somewhat high rate for the
 temperature (12° C), and suggests a question which I afterwards
 tested  ; the question is, does the average rate of growth, other things
 being equal, increase during the dark hours of the night ?
    The following series, however, drew my attention to some questions
of temperature more definitely than hitherto, and led, as we shall see,
 to some interesting results in this connection.

at the short intervals (one to two minutes each) necessary for
recording the growth.
    The temperature at 10—11 a.m. was 16° C, hut it rose to 20—21° C.
at 2 p.m., and remained at that until ahout 7 p.m., when it fell until it

    On scrutinising this table and drawing the curve representing the
increments, it is evident that we have the effects of the higher tem
 perature expressing themselves in conjunction with those (if there
 are any) due to absence of light.
    The characters of the culture itself were all those of a superbly
 vigorous organism, and the crop of spores developed at the end of
 its growth — the spores were ripe in 72 hours from sowing — was a
 remarkably fine one.
    As we see, in the period of growth recorded from 2 p.m. to
 9.27 p.m., the rodlet elongated from 10 to 240 ft.              In other words,
 it grew 230 ft, which is 115 times the length of the spore, in
 7^ hours.      This would give an average growth of about 0-5 /t per
 minute throughout the period referred to.
     On comparing these results with what were obtained during
 growth at the same temperature in ordinary daylight, could not seeI
 how to escape the conclusion that the rapid rise of the curve is
 chiefly due to the absence of the inhibitory effect of the light.*
    * Unless — a question which arose later — the temperature inside the culture--
 chamber is very different from that recorded by the thermometer   standing. as here,
 outside the system.

296          Profs. Percy Frankland and Marshall Ward.
Moreover, the same conclusion forced itself on one if other curves are
compared : the general slope in each case is undoubtedly largely due
to the lower temperature, but the decided rise in some cases about
6 p.m., when the daylight failed, took place in spite of the falling
temperature, and the generally steeper ascent of others at this low
temperature might be due to the cessation of light-action — at least I
could see no other way of explaining it at the time.
   It is clear from the foregoing results that the growth of the rods
and filaments of this bacillus can be measured by the methods
devised, and that the undertaking presents no particular difficulties
so far, beyond those incident to all close and patient microscopic
investigation.
   But, beyond the fact that growth        occurs at various rates, and
can be thus measured, the results thus far give us far too little
information to be of the value      I anticipated from the application
of the method. They simply raise a number of questions as to the
action of various factors in influencing the course of growth and
inducing the variations in the rate of growth which undoubtedly
occur.
   Sach factors are (1) internal factors, such as the age of the fila
ment, the process of cell-division, and possibly the vigour of the
spore itself ; and (2) external factors, such as temperature, light of
 various kinds, and the food-materials, &c.
                         Growth and Cell-division.
   I  made the following observations with a view to obtain more
information concerning the question raised as regards the con
nection between growth and cell-division.          The chief difficulty
connected with them was, as might be expected, that very high
powers have necessarily to be employed, and all the troubles of
thin cover-slips, minute and not too deep drops, and so forth, arise.
   I  selected the tip of a filament which had been growing vigor
ously all the afternoon and evening, and which was in all about
600 u long, and traced its behaviour under the l/12th oil immer
sion. The piece     I chose was the terminal portion from the tip to
the first visible septum. Its length was measured as exactly as
possible, and when the septum was under the division 0 of the scale
the tip was exactly under the 14th division.
   I  had previously determined that six divisions on the scale used,
each representing 4-5 /t with my ordinary measuring combination, are
equal to fifteen divisions by this power, and therefore I was measuring
nearly 2 ft per division (more exactly = T82 ft).
   At 8.20 P.m. the segment in question measured (under the l/12th
 immersion) fourteen divisions, i.e., 14 x l-82 = 25-48 ft, and I started

the observations.             The scale consisted of fifty divisions, and I started
with the septum at 0 and the tip at 14. The following table gives
the positions of this septum and tip at successive intervals as (1) the
growth of the terminal segment carried tip and septum further apart,
and (2) the elongation of the rest of the filament as a whole pushed
the entire segment forward over the scale.                                               .

   It will be noticed that to do this observed the successive periods
during which the filament pushed the septum over five divisions, as
I  found that the easiest plan, and then recorded the position of
the tip at the time (see fig. 26).

    Here    we   see  the   segment elongated from fourteen divisions to
twenty divisions, i.e., it grew six divisions (=6xl-82 = 10-92
in the interval from 8.20 to 8.51 — i.e., in thirty-one minutes — giving
an average rate of growth of about 0-35 ft per minute, though
the rate of growth varies from time to time.
    Now the whole filament was 600 divisions long (= 1,092 ft), and.
consisted of at least forty such segments,* and if each of them was
growing at anything like this rate, no wonder the filament pushed.
this segment forward so quickly, for it would be elongating as a
whole at the rate of 14 n per minute.
    To gain further information in this connection,               I exchanged the
objective for the combination            I   usually employ   for   measuring, and
measured the growth of about a third of the whole filament (including
the part here concerned) during the seven minutes from 9 to 9.7 P.m.,
i.e., beginning 4£ minutes after the last measurement.
    At 9 p.m. the piece observed was 210 ft long, and at 9.7 p.m. it
bad elongated to 250 fc, giving a growth of 40 ft, which is at the
rate of 5-7 /t per minute.           If this was going on through the rest
of the length, the filament as a whole would be growing at a rate
considerably in excess of my estimate.
    Now if we look at the distance through which the measured
segment was pushed during the thirty-one minutes' period given
above, we find it amounts to forty-five divisions (= 45 x T82 =
81-90 ft), so that even such numbers as                I have proposed need not
seem extravagant, and indeed            I   have reason to know they are much
below the real ones in many cases.
    One of the most interesting cases of rapid growth               I have seen is
the following.
    Spores sown in normal gelatine at 22° C. had germinated out to
filaments 80 — 100 ft long in 5£ hours in the dark, and were then
put into the dark Sachs' boxf at 28° C. The temperature was then
slowly raised, so that in two hours it had risen to 34° C, half an
hour later to 38° C, and in the next quarter of an hour to 39° C.
By chance       I  happened now to catch a broken-off segment which
was growing at the maximum rate that precedes death at these
high temperatures. The measurements were as follows : —
    • Almost certainly more than   40, but   I could not determine accurately because
the last formed septa  are not sufficiently  distinct.

 moving almost like an Oscillatoria.
    Then the filament suddenly contracted and broke up, and in a
 short time presented the granular appearance of dead cells.

 made on a germinal filament which had emerged from the spore
 during the night.             The culture in broth was exposed to the day

no septum was really visible* in the young filament, but a distinct
median one was seen at 11.30 dividing the filament into a proximal
and a distal half. By 12.10 a second septum was clearly visible bisect
ing the distal half, but none was as yet visible in the proximal half
to which the spore membrane still clung.                      At 12.38 the proximal
segment was also              divided      by  a visible median eeptum. At 12.47   I
measured both the primary segments and found the proximal, recently
divided, one shorter than the distal one, in the ratio of 15 to 18;
that is to say, the whole filament measured 59-86 /t, as seen, but that
part of it to the proximal side of the first septum was only 27 ft, that
to the distal 33 ft in length ; so that already the symmetry of the
filament was disturbed, and further measurements confirmed this.
    At 12.56 the proximal segment had one septum, now very distinct,
and measured 30-5 ft, whereas the distal one was by this time pro
vided with two visible septa, and measured nearly 37 /t; at 1.5 p.m.
the proximal one still had but one septum visible, and measured
32 5/1, whereas the distal one, with its two visible septa, measured
42 5
    Hence we see the two primary segments resulting from the first
division of the germinal filament grow and (so far as visible segments
   * Probably thin septs were preseut, but they were not visible in the living and
rapidly growing filament.

                                                      am disposed to
regard the slower growth of the proximal segment, in part at any
rate, to its being more especially concerned with the absorption of
food-materials from the spore ; though the fact that it is still behind
hand, even after escaping from the spore-membrane, may indicate a
deeper meaning — possibly that differences between basal and apical
regions are more strongly defined in these organisms than we suppose.
    But another point must be considered before the curve can be
understood, and for this purpose it seems necessary to introduce a
Bimple nomenclature for the divisions and segments.
    We may term the first septum, which divides the whole germinal
filament into its first two segments, the primary septum ; thus the
primary septum was first visible at 11.30. dividing the filament into
a proximal and a distal primary segment.         At 12.10 the longer
distal primary segment showed a further division by a secondary
septum into two secondary segments; but the corresponding secondary
septum in the proximal primary segment was not visible until 12.38.
    At 12.56 the distal secondary segment of the primary distal seg
ment had a tertiary septum plainly visible, and the filament as a
whole, therefore, consisted at this hour of five visible portions, two
belonging to the primary proximal segment, and three belonging to
the primary distal segment.
   On turning to the curve of growth (fig. 27), it may now be
possible to understand its principal features if we first accept as a
fact that the period when a septum is first distinctly visible in these
brilliant living cells is some time after thz moment of actual cell-
division.   This, I think, must be accepted, because I find stained pre
parations of such filaments show many more septa to be actually
present than can be seen in the living filaments, owing to the
extremely high refrangibility of the protoplasm obscuring the view
of the most recently formed and still tenuous walls.
                                I
   In the curve referred to, as understand     it,its general form, with
a higher and higher rate of ascent as time goes on,   is due to the total
increasing elongation of all the segments simultaneously — aided in
this case by the slight continuous rise of temperature.
   Bnt, although the general sweep of the curve       is such, there are
clear indications of smaller curves, convex also to the abscissae, on
which points of maximum rate of growth are seen at 11.30, 12.10,
12.38, and 12.56, and points of minimum rate in each case about
mid-way between these times.
   Now, it  was at just these periods — the intervals between which are
approximately 40, 30, and 20 minutes respectively — that the new
cell-walls were first perceptiblo, and    it  seems almost certain that
the intervening periods of slowest rate of growth, viz., about 11.15,
11.50, 12.20, and 12.40 respectively, were the approximate moments

of insertion of the septa, and, consequently, moments when elonga
tion would be going on with least rapidity, because the cell-con
tents were too busy with the act of division to be then growing at
quickest rates.
    In any case, it is obvious that the growth of even these yonng
filaments is a complicated phenomenon, and that the following points
at least have to be regarded in considering it.
    (1) There is the total elongation of the filament as a whole, and
(2) the growth of the individual segments or cells ; (3) the growth
of any one segment or cell is not necessarily going on at exactly the
same rate as a neighbouring one : this depends on the position and
on the age of the cell concerned ; (4) there is evidence to show that
the rate of growth of any cell or segment, and consequently that of
the filament, as a whole, is profoundly affected by several factors,
such as temperature, the nature of the food-medium, the presence of
other filaments which may aid the given one (at certain stages) by
increasing the peptonisation in the immediate neighbourhood — though
we must believe that in other stages these neighbouring filaments
retard it by acting as competitors for the available food ; and, lastly,
possibly light, some rays of which (perhaps blue) may retaid the
growth, while others (possibly the red and infra-red) may accele
rate it.
   The following observations with the l/12th immersion were made
on segments of a two-days' growth in broth, with a trace of gelatine,
in bright light — not direct sunlight — at 17° to 18° C.
   A terminal segment showing three distinct septa, but already com
posed of at least eight cells — the other four (secondary) septa being
very difficult to observe — was 54-6 ft long at 9.5 a.m.   The growths
are shown in the following table, and, as before, we see that con
siderable irregularity is observable in the rate from time to time : —

    The segment was being pushed forward by the rest of the filament
at the rate of about 1 ft per minute — 364       in 34 minutes actually
measured    —  and was shghtly undulating the whole time. In fact the
movement forwards, a scarcely perceptible series of jerks, reminded
 one of the movements of the hands of a watch.

a rapid rate again.

   At the end of the period assured myself that the segment contained
one very distinct septum dividing it into two parts, or secondary
segments ; the apical one measuring not quite 1 1 p (my numbers
give 10-92), and the other a little over 9 ft (9-10), and each of these
had an extremely faint median septum in it. According to this, the
segment 20 ft long consisted of four cells each, more or less, 5 ft long,
and we must infer that they were growing at slightly different rates
part of the time.
   Another terminal segment of the same culture was watched under
the l/12th immersion. It measured 62-88 ft at 12.7 (p.m.) and consisted
of eight visible cells, and probably each of these with a septum. As
near as I could measure, the primary septa, which were very distinct,
stood as follows : One (which I will call A) stood at 30-03 ft from the
apex, dividing the whole segment selected into a (fig. 28) distal
(apical) moiety measuring almost exactly 30 ft, and a proximal

304             Profs. Percy Frankland and Marshall Ward.
moiety measuring 3T85 ft. Each of these portions was again sub
divided by a septum ; the distal one, by a septum B, into a distal
moiety just over 17 ft in length, and a proximal moiety not quite 13 ft
long ; the proximal one, by a septum B', into a distal moiety measuring
just over 17 ft, and a proximal moiety slightly more than 15-5 f-.
 Close observation showed that each of these was again sub-divided by
 a faint, approximately median septum, into two cells.

   Now it is perfectly obvious from this that the various subsidiary
segments or cells, measured at any period, are not of exactly the same
length.
   At     12.27   I    again measured, as exactly as possible, the relative
positions      on the scale of the above septa to see if               I could determine
the relative rates of growth of the various segments in the intervening
twenty minutes.
    The septum A had moved backwards nearly 3 ft on the scale, and
the apex and base of the whole segment were driven apart about this
distance. This suggests that the growth (intercalary) had occurred
chiefly in the distal part of the original segment, and such was the
case.
    ThjB distance         between the septum B and the apex was not
measurably altered, i.e., the part to the distal side still measured
17-29 ft ; but the distance between B and A had increased from
12-74 to 1638 ft.          On the proximal side of the septum A no appreciable
 changes     had   occurred.      It is true, my measurements, as multiplied
 out, are a trifle different from those first made, bnt the differences
 may be neglected, as of course              I   could not measure to the decimals
concerned.
    What does come out, and very clearly, is that during the interval
named the growth was entirely in one only of the four cells, and not
 in all of them. It is obvious that such phenomena complicate the
question of the growth of the entire filament still more, and no doubt
 home of the minute variations observed are due to such events as
 these.
    I made the        following measurements under the l/20th immersion, on
a terminal segment 3G ft long, in the sister culture                      to the last one,

                   Report on the Bacteriology        of  Water.              305
  standing side by side with it. The temperature was rather low,
  15° C, and the observations soon came to an end owing to the close-
  focussing objective cracking the very thin cover slip.           I made many
 attempts to measure growths for longer periods under this lens, but
 the failures were so frequent owing to the extremely thin cover slips
 and hanging drops necessary for so high a power, and the difficulties
 of illumination, that    I   had to abandon them.
    The value of each division of the micrometer scale was found to be
 from l-20 ft to 1-25 ft, but here again        I found it hopeless to attain to
 greater exactitude of measurement. However, the following attempt
 is at least interesting.

    On comparing the figures with other measurements at the same
 temperatures, moreover, they agree very well ; so that it may yet be
 possible to carry out measurements with this power.
    It should be noticed — as a point of importance in what follows —
that these minute variations observed with the highest powers are
not traceable (and probably neutralise one another along the filaments)
when longer stretches are measured with the lower powers.
    After considerably greater experience with these curves, am able  I
to sum up the meaning of these experiments more clearly.
    1. They give evidence that the growth of the filament as a whole
is intercalary, and due to increase in length and division of all its
cells, along the entire course of the filament.
    2. The different rates in the general growth observed are due partly
to differences in temperature, partly to differences in age of the
portions observed, partly to differences in the food-medium in which
the orgauism is growing, and partly to other causes.
    3. The small variations in rate of growth, especially those traced
under high powers, are due partly to small and uurecorded variations
in temperature, e.g., cooling of the thin cover-slip when the bell-jar
was lifted (as in the experiment on p. 306), and partly to the causes
assigned on p. 302, namely, pauses during the intercalation of the
new segment walls, and, no doubt, to some extent, to curvatures in the
filaments, and want of practice on my part in recording the observa
tions so accurately as      I learned to do later on.

                            Comparative Measurements.
    The foregoing results led to the attempts — now to be described —
to grow two filaments side by side, one in the light and the other in
the dark, to see if the action of light could be detected by any change
in the growth curve.
    Before passing to these experiments,          I  obtained satisfactory evidence
that two cultures, side by side and under the same conditions, behave
similarly.*
    On February 18th I started the following comparative cultures, to
see how far I could test the action of daylight rendered so probable
by some of the foregoing results.
    Spores were sown in broth at 9 a.m. in two hanging drop cultures,
each with a layer of water at the bottom to prevent rapid changes of
temperature or drying up. The two cultures were then put under a
dark bell-jar, covered with foil and brown paper, at 18° C., rising to
21° C, close to the south window where                     I  intended to start the
experiment.       The    cultures   were   left  thus   so   that   the spores should
have time to germinate out normally, which they began to do about
noon   ; they were left undisturbed till 2 p.m.
    Meanwhile,    I had selected two similar bell-jars and placed these a
the window, each over a microscope provided with a thermometer ;
one bell-jar was darkened with tin foil and brown paper, the other
not. The thermometers were examined, and readings taken from
time to time.      The differences observed at first, and due to the shading
action of the covering, began to get less and less as the bell-jars,
table, and microscopes, were warmed by the sun, which was bright
and hot ; and by noon the temperatures were very nearly the same
in each jar.
   At 12.30 the thermometer under the light jar indicated a tempera
ture of 25-5° C. ; that under the darkened one =24 6° C.,f and this
difference of nearly 1° C. was maintained till about 1.80, the readings
being as follows      : —
              12.30 p.m.      12.45  P.m.     1.0 P.m.        1.15 P.m.    1.30 P.m.

About 2 p.m. the sun began to sink behind trees and the roof of a
building facing the window, and now it was possible to use the bright
light from the sky without danger of direct insolation.
   * Better proofs of this were ohtained later, however, and are given at pp. 359 — 361.
   t These are all air temperatures, unless the contrary is specially staled.

                   Report on the Bacteriology of Water.                307
   At   2.20 p.m. the thermometer   in both bell-jars stood at 23° C, and,
as the curve of temperature          shows, they were so nearly equal
throughout the experiment that       I had little hesitation in concluding
that the cultures did not vary much from the same temperature nt
any time; because      I thought it could hardly be imagined that the
hanging drops in these damp cells rapidly vary with the tempera
ture of the environment, and still less so the filaments growing in
th--im.
    At  2.30 the observations were begun by       noting the temperature,
and measuring the rod in each case.       As the following tabular record
shows, the difference in time between the two notes rarely exceeded
a couple of minutes, whence the two series are closely comparable in
all respects.
    It was not until much later that the question arose — or, rather,
acquired the great importance     I now attach to it — how far the culture
in the light could avail itself of or be affected by the infra-red rays
reflected from the mirrors, and so complicate the matter of tempera
ture effects in these experiments.      This matter is of pregnant im
 portance in its bearing on all physiological experiments of this kind,
however.

      Now my constant temperature cultures in broth in the dark at
   23—21-75° run from 32 minutes at 23—24° C. to 63 (at 20—21°) and
   at 18 — 19° C. the extremes are 67 — 78 minutes ; the range is a wide
   one — i.e., 32 — 78 — but it may be regarded as including the above
   cases, or very nearly so, and perhaps, therefore, the air-temperatures
•  given did not depart far from those of the culture cells.
      2.  The culture in the light for the same date has the following
   doubling periods : —
                                                                 Approximate
                                                                 (air) temps.
           25— 50 n = 2.32—4.12 = 100 minutes at 23 —21° C.
           50—100        = 4.12—5.53 = 101           „   „     21 —19-5
          100—200        = 5.53—7.20 = 97            „   „     19-5—18
      And there is nothing comparable as regards time with such long
   periods anywhere in my broth cultures at constant temperatures, in
   the dark.
      Unless, therefore, we assume that the air- temperatures given depart
  very widely, in different ways, from the real temperatures of the cul
  ture-drops, we must assume that the lower growth in the exposed
  culture was due to inhibition by the light rays.
      Probably the most startling fact which comes out on examining
  these results is the extremely rapid growth of the dark culture from
  6.41 onwards.       To explain this it is necessary to point out one or two
  things   not  obvious   at all. In the first place, as the filament grows
  longer there are more and more cells formed by the repeated bi-par-
  tition — i.e., there are more and more elongated segments in the chain,
  and therefore a greater elongation of the whole as the sum of the
  growths of the individual cells becomes greater. Then, secondly, the
  vigour of the entire cell-series evidently increases as the feeding and
  other powers — e.g., peptonising activity, &c— increase.
      Consequently, after a certain period these strongly developing fila
  ments which have not been exposed to any disturbing agent, grow at
     * The doubling   period  is the time required for a given length of filament to
  double this length (see p. 403).

                  Report on the Bacteriology of Water.               311
rates which are    really enormous if we regard the relations of size.
This is the more marvellous when one notices that this rapidity of
growth was increasing although the temperature was falling the whole
time.
    This last is an important point, for if we now turn to the culture
in the light, we find nothing like such a general increase in the
power of development.        Nevertheless, the filament clearly began to
grow much more rapidly after sun-down (see 5.47 and 6.1 p.m), and
was evidently tending towards some such maximum at 7.23.
    Now, why did not this filament begin to get up its maximum of
growth as soon as the other ? It was a lunger and more vigorous
specimen to begin with, for I purposely chose a germinal filament
 2-5 ft long, whereas that in the dark was only 15 ft long — and unless
 some inhibiting agent was keeping it back, it seems incredible that
 its general curve of growth should ascend so slowly before sun
 down.
    But it seemed clear that the inhibition cannot be due to the tem
 perature, because that was falling too slowly to produce such an effect ;
 and, besides, it falls practically equally in both cases, so that if it
 checked the growth of this culture, one asks why the lowering of the
 temperature did not check it in the dark ?
    If, then, the growth is accelerated after sun-down, in spite of a fall
 of  temperature — as we see to be the case — the logical conclusion
 seemed to    be that the acceleration  is due to the withdrawal of the
 inhibiting   rays of light, and on the hypothesis that this is the case
 the curves are intelligible.
                Germination and Growth behind Glass Screens.
    In view of the encouraging results of which the above is an illus
 tration, it appeared worth while to further test the action of light on
 the germination and growth of this schizomycete, and this I did with
 the following measure of success.
     The method employed was as follows : — A quantity of dilute broth
 in a test-tube was infected with the ripe spores to such an extent
 that the smallest drop I could manipulate with a platinum loop con
 tained on the average at least about twelve and not more than about
 twenty-five spores.
     I  then made a number of hanging-drop cultures in the usual
 manner, on thin, sterilised cover-slips, each being at once luted to the
 moist chamber by means of sterile gelatine.
     Each moist chamber was then placed on a piece of glass, plain or
 coloured, about 3j inches square, and covered by a similar square of
 the same glass, supported just above the cover-slip from which the
 drop was suspended, by means of a suitable wooden block.

      The following diagram gives the sectional view.

       screen ; f  = upper ditto, supported on wooden blocks shown in section at gg.
      The gla^s screens were made sufficiently large to ensure that no
  light could possibly reach the moist-chamber that had not previously
  traversed them.
      All being thus ready, the moist-chambers were placed in position,
  and the upper screen removed while I focnesed the contents of the
  hanging-drop, and arranged so that the mirror of the microscope
  threw the light directly up, through the lower screen.                 The tube of
  the microscope was then drawn up so as to raise the objective suffi.
 ciently to allow of the upper screen being placed in position.
     All the microscopes thus loaded were placed side by side at a
 south window, and illuminated exactly alike, and for equal periods;
 maximum and minimum thermometers being placed in position by
 them.
                               I
     At stated intervals examined all the cultures, and measured the
 growth, &c., of the filaments as follows : — In every case a number of
 filaments — usually five to ten — were measured, and an estimate
 formed of the commonest length that prevailed.                       Then I sought
 throughout the drop for the longest and for the shortest filament I
 could find.
                      I
     In this way was enabled to obtain a fair estimate of the amonnt
 of increment going on in each culture, as compared with a standard
culture kept in the dark; for numerous trials had shown me that
the spores germinate so freely, and the germinal rodlets in any one
drop grow so evenly during the early periods, that the method may
be trusted at least up to the point           I push it to.
    The following experimental series are typical, and serve very well
to bring out the instructive results obtained by these comparative
cultures.
    To test the relative effects of strong blue and red light on the
growth of the germinal filaments, two cultures were made in glass
cells, as usual, and placed behind blue and red glass screens respec
tively.

   The spores were sown at 10       a.m. and placed in the light over
mirrors   at a south window.      The temperature was fairly steady at
16° C.    The light was chiefly reflected from brightly illuminated
clouds, but intermittent sunshine touched the mirrors from 11.35 a.m.
to 1 p.m., at intervals.
   At 4 p.m. — i.e., six hours after sowing, the spores behind the red
screens had germinated to rodlets about 10     long, whereas no trace

the temperature having only fallen half a degree. the average length
of the filaments behind the red glass was 125 to 135 ft, but none of
the spores behind the blue glass had germinated out.
   Next morning at 10 a.m. the filaments in the red light were 750 to
1,000 u long, as near as  could measure them, but all the spores in

day at 14 — 18° C, nor during the two further days the culture was

respect, shows clearly that in bright sun-light the spores are killed
behind blue screens, whereas the same exposure behind red screens
leads to no injury whatever — confirming the numerous similar results
with macroscopic cultures.

prevailed all the morning, the afternoon being warm and with bril
liant sunshine, obscured occasionally by clouds.        availed myrelf of

   The spores had of course all been sown at the same time, so that
each culture began under equal conditions.       Six sowings were made,

rodlet, a comparatively easy task with the small drops nsed and with
this power, and noted the commonest average length which prevailed
among the little plantlets developed. The following summary will
give the best idea of the results.     (Table, p. 315).
    The averages were got by taking the sum of all the lengths
measured, arid dividing by the number of rods measured.         This last
number is placed in brackets next each average.
    These results seemed to show very clearly that (1) the differences
in the rapidity of growth are very large, and (2) they are not to be
referred directly to the changes in temperature.
    They also show that the growth in total darkness under the given
conditions is much more rapid than the growth in any kind of light
experimented with, except the red. It is eventually more rapid than in
the red light, but not so at first, and I attributed the difference here
to the fact that so long as the light was acting the dark heat rays in
the red can make themselves felt to such an extent that the young
filaments grow more actively during this period ; when the light
fails, however. between 6 and 7 p.m., the curve in the red falls — the
effect of a falling thermometer, in fact.
    In the present case the blue light seemed to be distinctly a retard
ing agent throughout, but it was not sufficiently intense to exercise
its full effect, and the screen must be regarded as having acted
more as a shade to the relatively low intensity of light employed
than as a transmitter of any large proportion of the presumably
injurious rays.
    With the ordinary glass and the pale olive (which really trans
mits almost as much light) the retarding effects of the light seemed
very evident.     I attributed the more effective retardation behind the
pale olive to the fact that it transmits about as strong a light as
 the ordinary .glass, but with relatively more bine in its composition.
 The effects with green glass screens are often puzzling, as I have
 found in other cases.     Ou the whole it seemed to act like a shade to
 the intensity of the light, but what does traverse has a lot of blue in
 it. It lets the dark heat rays through, and consequently the fall
 about 7 p.m. is like that of a fall of temperature.
     In both cases — that of the red and that of the green — it will be
 noted that the fall of the curve would be aided by the fact that the
 temperature was also falling slowly all the time, and this latter fact
 also probably prevented the other curves (blue, ordinary, and pale
 olive) from ascending more rapidly from 7 p.m. onwards.
     Without pressing this explanation too far, it seemed not unlikely
 that it was approximately correct, though the matter is undoubtedly
 a complex one.
     In any case the above     results seemed to show very clearly that
  whereas the mean growth        of the filaments, in darkness, or behind

red glass, which cats out all the blue rays, at the temperature
given, in 10£ hours, amounts to from 144 to more than 160 times
the length ot the spore, it is only 25 to 45 times its length in the
same period if exposed for six or seven hours of the time to light
passing through glasses (pale olive or ordinary) which transmit most
or all of the blue rays. Under the same conditions spores behind
glasses (blue and green) which act partly as shades which reduce the
intensity of the light (and in so far favour growth), and partly as
screens which so alter the composition of what light is transmitted
that it consists of relatively large quantities of blue, show decided
retardation of the growth — which in the given period amounted to
from 65 to 104 times the length of the spore — act as might be
expected, and the amount of growth is somewhere between the
extremes.
   In the following experimental series these facts seemed to come
out still more prominently, principally perhaps because the tempera
ture was somewhat higher and the insolation longer.
   The arrangements were exactly as before, but the culture under
pale olive glass had to be discarded, owing to partial drying up of
the drop, because the gelatine luting was incomplete.
   The spores were sown at 11 a.m., and the exposure began at 12
noon, the temperature being 16° C. The sun was bright and hot,
and was directed on to each culture at the commencement for five
minutes.    An hour later, i.e., at a period when the swelling spores
would be just on the point of germinating, another five minutes'
insolation was allowed to each, and so on through the afternoon, i.e.,
five minutes at 2, 3, and 4 p.m. respectively.
   For the rest of the period the mirrors were carefully arranged, so
that only bright light from the blue sky or from brilliantly illumi
nated clouds was allowed to fall on them.
   The temperature steadily rose to 18 — 19° C. about 1 p.m. to 21 —
22° C. at 2 p.m., and to 23—24° C. between 2 and 3 p.m.     At 4 p.m. it
had fallen to 19° C, and so down to 16° C. at 10 p.m., at which it
remained through the night.
   The first measurements were taken at 4 p.m., i.e., after the spores
had been sown five hours.       As before,  I  examined each culture in
 the order of its making, so that althongh the hours given in the
table are only the approximate mean times of the periods (about
half an hour) occupied in examining the whole series, they give the
 correct interval in each case, whence no allowance need be made
 for the minute increments of elongation during those periods (see
 Curves 7—10).

    On comparing this table and curves with those last discussed, we
find the following facts come out : —
    The retarding action behind the blue and ordinary glass screens is
much more marked, simply, no doubt, because the insolation was
more intense. During the whole period (from 12 noon to 10.30 p.m.)
of 10£ hours, although the time of exposure to light was shorter by

318          Profs. Percy Frankland and Marshall Ward.
an  hour at least, the filaments developed from the spores in darkness
or behind the powerful shades (green and red glass) grew. to from
125 to 187 times the length of the spore; those behind the bloe aud
ordinary glass only grew to 10 to 15 times the length of the spore.
   Moreover, it is interesting to observe that, so far as it goes (and I
do not wish to press it nnduly, because a larger number of measure
ments will be required to decide such a point) the red glass again
acted as an incubator during the early stages, which    I attribute to its
acting as a trap for the dark heat-rays ; and the more pronounced
retarding action of the blue glass so long as the stronger light could
penetrate it, fell somewhat after six or seven o'clock, when the dark
ness set in.
   As before,  I  regarded the green as acting much like the red : it
cuts off much of the intensity of the light, and in so far is a shade,
while it transmits a light of such composition that the dark heat
rays are relatively in excess, and still some blue passes.      Neverthe
less, there is something puzzling about the behaviour of this green
glass which I cannot as yet explain.       The same uncertainty of its
action prevails in other cases, as I have already stated.
   To test still further the action of various coloured screens,         I
repeated the experiments with glass screens, taking a series of com
parative thermometrical readings at the same time.              The days
                        —
chosen (February 18 19) were very bright and clear, and great
care was taken to obtain the light used from the clear blue sky, to
the east of the sun, so as not to run any risk of direct insolation at
unexpected periods.
   Moreover, before beginning the experimental exposures,        I made a
series of observations by placing the bulbs of thermometers between
the glass screens exactly in the place occupied by the moist culture-
chambers, and exposed them under all conditions.
   When the thermometer lying on the table under the south window
used for exposures, registered 25° C. in the sun,  I found that the one
with its bulb over the mirror of the microscope registered 27° C,
when the light reflected from the blue sky at noon passed through
the blue glass : on then reflecting the sun's image on to the same bulb
between the blue glasses, the temperature, of course, rapidly rose,
and was at 32° C. ten minutes later.
   On repeating this with the bulb of a thermometer between the red
glasses, the temperature rose to 33° C. in the same time (10 minutes),
and rapidly fell to 28° C. when the mirror reflected only light from
the blue sky to the east of the sun.
   With the orange glasses, the temperature shot up to 33° C. in the
sun's image, and fell to 27° C. in 10 minutes on turning the mirror as
before ; and with the green glasses, the temperature rose to 30° C. in
the sun, aud fell to 27° C. in the rays from the blue sky.

                   Report on the Bacteriology   of Water.             319
    It was evident that, provided   I kept to the reflected rays from the
 blue sky near the sun, the heating effect was about 2 — 3° higher
 than in the open air beside the microscope, and that the cultures
 between red glasses were exposed to at least about 1° or 2° higher
 than those between the blue, orange, or green glasses, and these
 tacts must be carefully borne in mind when discussing the results.
    The hanging drops, each containing about 25 spores, were made at
  11.30 a.m., from broth, infected at 9 a.m., and kept at 15° C., so that
 the spores were already swelling and ready to begin germinating
 when the cultures were exposed at 12.30 noon.
    As soon as the cultures were placed in position on the microscopes,
 I turned each mirror so as to powerfully insolate each culture for
 exactly five minutes ; that was all the direct sunlight they were
 allowed during the whole period, except such, rays as struck the top
 glass obliquely, and the heating effect of which must be taken into
 account in what follows.
    The results of the four examinations     I  made of these cultures at
 about 2.45, 4.45, 7.0, and 10.46 p.m. respectively, showed considerably
 more growth in the red and orange than in the blue and green.
    The culture in diffuse light was an accident, and not part of the
 planned series.    It stood in a shaded part of the room, and was not
 only at a higher temperature during the hours of exposure, but was
 considerably more advanced to start with. It cannot, therefore, be
 compared with the others, and must be regarded as merely of pass
 ing interest: its curve fell rapidly after 7 p.m., possibly owing to the
 fall of temperature.
    Two hanging drop cultures of broth with a trace of gelatine,
 of equal age — spores sown at 10 — -12° C. overnight — were placed on
microscopes in the south window arranged as follows: — The cells
had a thin glass floor.
    One had a sheet of red glass below, and a similar sheet above ; the
 other a sheet of bine glass below, and screens of the same in front,
so that all light direct from the sky had to traverse the glasses
before reaching the drops. The only difference between the two
arrangements (apart from the colour of the glasses) was that the
first one had its second sheet of red glass close over the drop      This
difference was necessary owing to the microscopes being of different
patterns.
    Unfortunately the morning turned out cloudy, with rain at inter
vals, and occasional short breaks of sunshine ; a high wind kept the
temperature down to about 17 — 18° C., rising now and then to
19—20° C.
    It will also be noted that   I here exposed, not spores, but rodlets
already strongly germinated out.           When the red culture was
started, at 10.46 a.m., the rodlet selected (to be kept under observu

tinn the whole time) was 30 ft long; its growth in length was
recorded every 15 to 30 minutes or so, and the temperature as shown
by a thermometer by the side of the cultures noted.
   After allowing the growth to go on for 1^ hours in the red,                  I
changed the glasses, and put the blue ones here and the red ones on
the other culture; after growing thus for 2f hours, the exchange to
the original glasses was made again.
   The blue culture was started three-quarters of an hour later than
the red, a rodlet of almost the same length (3T5         being selected
                                                            ft)
tor observation.
   After being half an hour under the blue glasses, this was changed
to red, and allowed to grow in red light for     hours.
                                                    -l\
   The result was not sufficiently decisive to encourage my drawing
any conclusion.    It true the rod growing under red glass seemed
                      is
to have got  a good start, so that its ultimate sojourn in blue light
was less injurious than might, perhaps, have been expected while            ;
the shorter stay of the other in blue light appeared nevertheless long
enough to have affected    it seriously.   But meanwhile other factors
complicated the matter, and         discarded this line of experiment.

Before passing to the further developments, however,        will be well
                                                                  it
to see what the foregoing results amount to.
  1.  It clear that growth occurs with increasing rapidity in suit
        is
able food materials and under suitable conditions, and         evidently
                                                                       is
intercalary.   Sinceit comes to an end eventually, the curve must be
that of a long drawn out             -.
   2. The measurements show, also, that the rate of growth may
vary owing to the action of certain factors, partly external and partly
iuternal;  and these variations may be local in a filament, or general.
   3. The experiments show that the growth        slower on exposure to
                                                     is
sunlight (and may even be stopped altogether)                 passing through
certain screens, whereas   it   is   not retarded perceptibly in light through
other screens.
    4. The results obtained so far, however, do not decide with cer
tainty how far the differences with growing filaments depend on other
factors than the light ;  though they are pretty definite as regards the
spores, exposed ina   resting condition.   They even suggest that there
                                         —
may be differences in the two cases e.g., that the actively growing
filaments may have some power of overcoming the detrimental action
of rays which seriously injure, or even kill, the spores in a state of
rest.
   5.  It may be added that there         no question that exposure to
                                            is
direct sunlight kills both spores and filaments    numerous trials have
                                                      ;
proved that. The question under investigation            rather bow far
                                                           is

 Criticism         of    the    foregoing Results, and Experiments on Temperatures.
     The more      I      became           familiarised with the methods which had given
the foregoing results, the more evident        became that, instructive  it
                                   —
and valuable as the facts may be and there can be no question as to
their decisive confirmation of the conclusions of previous observers,
as well as myself, that direct sunshine kills so long as the blue rays
are not filtered out — they are not altogether satisfactory. The varia
tions due to internal causes are so minute that, real though they are,
they do not seriously affect the measurements of growth, provided                                       I
compare similar rods or long filaments during the same periods, and
it    obvious that
     is                   use cultures in the same food-material, and
                                    if    I
prepared alike, there can be no serious drawback in the method so
far as comparative results go.
     But over and over again      was impressed by the dangers possible
                                                    I
as regards the screens employed.      It obvious that with an organism
                                                                 is
like this, very sensitive* to changes of temperature during its growth,
differences of a few degrees at the critical periods might easily lead
one into errors which,        neglected, would vitiate many of the con

clusions entirely.
   The matter       a serious one, for
                               is            must be remembered that
                                                                   it
biologists, and especially botanists, have long been in the habit of
using coloured screens, and if these agents are responsible for changes
of temperature not recorded in the observations, we are in danger of
making fundamental errors.
    The suspicion that the temperatures, as recorded merely by thermo
meters in the air beside the microscopes, might be less trustworthy
guides to the changes of temperature going on in the hanging drop-
cultures in the glass cells than had been hitherto assumed, now
forced itself upon me and with that, of course, the idea that
                                             ;                                                          I
might be running risks of confusing the effects of high or low tem
peratures with those of light, became painfully disturbing.
    In any case,      was obviously necessary to institute a series of
                               it
experiments to test these notions, and        was well   did so, for the

results, although not wholly unexpected, were more startling than                                       I
care to dwell on now.f
     •   It   was not   till   a    much later period that     I   found how extremely sensitive   it   is   to
temperature        changes, as            will   be seen subsequently.
 f       It
       scarcely needs mention that the question here concerned     not the physical   is
one whether two different screens transmit heat-rays in different proportions, but
the physiological one how far the differences affect the organism experimented on.
It   can obviously        be decided             only by patient comparative investigations.

   I select the following        series of observations in illustration from a
large number which           I made for my own guidance : it does not seem
necessary to publish all the notes, but as many readers may be
unacquainted with the magnitude of the dangers referred to, I retain
one or two experiments of a somewhat obviously elementary nature.
   In order     to understand       the behaviour of the thermometer as an
indication of what was going on in the culture-chambers, it was
clearly necessary that         I should make a series of blind experiments in
which the bulbs of the thermometers were as carefully placed in the
relative proper positions as possible.
   The following series refer to the sort of temperature changes to be
expected in the laboratory, near a south window, in spring.

   Obviously this kind of thing would not do for the experiments
contemplated, and the first thing              I  set myself to overcome was the
variations due to direct insolation, for it was found that the tempera
ture of the air in the room used is remarkably constant, from the
regular action of the heating apparatus, and the rise in temperature
during the day and the fall during the night are comparatively small
and slow, provided the nights are not frosty and that the Venetian
blinds are drawn in the evening.

   These examples will suffice to show how far the screens differ as
regards transmission of heat rays.
   The following series is interesting as showing that the thermometer
hanging in the glass bell-jar, with its bulb close to the culture-
chamber, may undergo considerable variations without any corre
sponding reaction in the growth curvatures.
   The experiment was designed to see if the light of a paraffin
lamp would be sufficiently active to affect the growth ; but the
results showed that— for short periods, at any rate — this is not the
case.    As is well known, however, the flame of a paraffin lamp is
very hot, and the possibility arises that the rise of temperature may
mask the effect, if the paraffin light has any.

324              Profs. Percy Fraukland and Marshall Ward.
    I  give the results in any case, though they prove little by them
selves : they only show that, either (1) the organism does not
rapidly* react to any great extent to quick, small, but considerable,
variations of the temperature immediately around the culture-
chamber, or (2) the inhibiting action of the light is sufficient to just
undo or mask that effect.
    The plan was as follows.           A culture drop was prepared as usual,
and germination allowed to proceed in the dark for several hours.
    At 12 noon, a germinal filament 5 ft long was selected for observa
tion.     The temperature of the interior of the darkened bell-jar, as
shown by a thermometer hanging with its bulb close to the culture,
was 24° C. The reading and measurement being taken,                         I  left the
whole system undisturbed till after 2 o'clock, except to take the
temperature readings given in the following tabular resume: —

    Here   it is probable the rise of temperature in the lighted cell was
responsible for the enhanced growth ; and it may be concluded that
if the light of this hazy day had any inhibitory effect, it was more
than covered by the stimulus given to the organism by the heat-rays.
It is by no means to be concluded with certainty that no inhibition
decurred — only that none could be observed during the comparatively
short period in which measurements are possible owing to the com
plication referred to.

   The following set of experimental observations were made to test
more accurately the heating of the cells, and the rise of tempera
ture in the cultures, as compared with the temperature of the thermo
meter merely between the glasses, and that in the air close to the
culture.
   One of my moist chambers was prepared exactly as for a culture,
except that one of the two arms was cut short so that the bulb of a
thermometer could be inserted into the cavity as shown in the accom
panying figure.
   a = cavity of the glass cell (moist chamber) the atmosphere in which is kept
saturated by water-vapour which evaporates from the layer of water b and wet
c .tton-wool plugs c and c'.   d the hanging-drop suspended from the cover-slip.
The latter is luted to the glass-cell by stiff gelatine   ;   while the floor of the cell is
formed   by a glass slide (e) cemented by paraffin melting between 55° and 60° C.
  At   c the second open arm    of the glass cell has been cut short to receive the bulb
of the thermometer     f (the bulb of which may be blackened),       g and g' are the
coloured glasses, so placed that all the light reaching the hanging-drop d must pass
through them.
   Having arranged such a cell over the mirror of the microscope, and
loaded another microscope with an exactly similar thermometer
whose bulb (blackened or not as necessary) is merely suspended
between glasses similar to g and               g',
                                          proceeded to compare the
                                                 I
temperatures ou    hot bright morning, at a south window, with those
                     a
registered by thermometers hanging from the microscopes, and lying
on the table at the base.
   In the following table, the records of the thermometers outside the
microscopes are given in the first column those whose bulb was;
merely supported between the coloured glasses in the second (under
the heading " dummy         and that whose bulb was in the culture cell
                            ") ;
under the third columu. The bulbs in second and third columns were
blackened, the others not.

   The coloured glasses used were the ruby ones marked in table. The
thermometers in the air were exposed to the sun, and so the tempera
tures given are not really those of the air, but thej serve my purpose
for this preliminary experiment, which is only intended to give an
instance of the enormous variations which may be got if the observer
is not on his guard against insolation.

   On looking at these results, one or two interesting facts of consider
able importance to the investigation come out and serve as a basis for
great caution in exposures of this kind.
   In the first place it is clear that direct insolation causes such enor
mous rises of temperature in the cells, that no results could be
expected sufficiently definite to be of use unless these could be con
trolled.     Secondly, it is equally clear that the variations of tempera
ture in such a south window are too sudden and great to be neglected
as serious sources of error ; and, thirdly, the ordinary mode of record
ing the temperature by means of thermometers merely hanging near
the cultures obviously gives very imperfect results, and cannot be
trusted for any such purposes as these.
   On the other hand, the records as given by the blackened-bulb ther
mometer in the dummy and model cells (especially the latter) may
be taken as true indications of the temperature in the culture-drops,
and it is instructive to observe that the culture-cells respond slowly
to alterations in the temperature of the air, but very rapidly to

                   Report on the Bacteriology of Water.               329
changes in the       intensity of the  sun-light when    direct   on   the
mirror.
   That the sluggishness in responding to the air-temperature is due to
the protection of the glass and the layer of water will be accepted at
once, I take it, and it will be equally obvious that the sharp rise in
direct sunlight is owing to the dark heat rays, reflected from the
mirror, passing easily through the red glass and water layer and
being absorbed direct.
    On the whole, then, we may conclude that so long as the culture-
cells are protected from the direct rays of the sun, the temperature
of their interior does not quickly vary, though it may be somewhat
higher than that of a thermometer outside.
   By keeping a thermometer, with blackened bulb, in such a culture-
chamber side by side with the growth culture under examination,
however, it may be accepted that the temperature of the growing
schizomycete in the hanging drop is very accurately known.
    Three culture chambers, with hanging drops of broth, were prepared
                                                        I
over-night, the only difference introduced being that employed thin
quartz instead of glass for the floors. The spores germinated out
slowly, at 10 — 12° C. during the night, and the filaments began
growing more and more quickly as the temperature rose in the
morning.
    By  10 a.m.  I  had prepared a control or " dummy
                                                         "  cell, with the
blackened bulb of a thermometer in it, as described on p. 327, and
 placed this beside two of the cultures, all in position on their micro
scopes, at the south window.      One culture was arranged for exposure
 to light, and a thermometer (blackened bulb) hung to its microscope.
 The other culture was arranged in exactly the same way, but kept
 darkened by a dome of thick brown paper.
    The third culture was placed in a cooler room at a north window,
 for growth at a lower temperature. At both windows ordinary ther
 mometers were also placed to give the air temperatures in the usual
 way.
    Unfortunately the day turned out dull and cloudy, with rain
occasionally, but now and then the sun shone brightly at intervals
 during the morning.
    The following tables give the results. Small thick cardboard slips
 were arranged as shutters to prevent the direct sun-light from falling
 on the mirrors or thermometers, &c, but with as little shutting off of
 light  as possible.

   The scrutiny of these tables can leave little doubt that the general
shape of the curves is due to the temperature, and the curve at
the lower temperature is hardly useful for any other purposes.
   As regards the other two curves, however, the sharper ascent of the
curve of the dark culture from 1 o'clock to 2.30 requires explanation,
and. unfortunately, the data do not quite suffice for it. Of course,
the suspicion arises that it may be due to the inhibiting action of
light so retarding the growth in the one case, that the darkened fila
ment — although a younger, and therefore more feebly growing speci
men to begin with — is gradually making way and more than catching
it np.
   The following comparative observations were made with the dummy
cells, between CuS04 and bichromate screens, top and bottom, on a
bright day in March.
   Here, again, it is evident that the observer must be very carefully
on his guard when using these screens, of glass bottles containing
liquids which filter out different rays, of different heating power ;
and    I would also call attention to the matter of the heating up of
these screens in the sun and their power of slowly radiating their
heat later on.

 the thin glass roofs would therefore be exposed to radiation, &c, thus
 accounting for the more rapid changes — in part at any rate. This
 will probably suffice for calling attention to this point, which must
 also be carefully borne in mind.            I  shall have opportunities of refer

                  Report on the Bacteriology of Water.                  333
    Before leaving this part of the subject, there is one other criti
cism to be taken into account. Experiments show that great care
must be exercised with respect to the cooling effects of radiation
from the thin coverslips supporting the hanging drops.          I shall have
occasion to illustrate this as we proceed ; it is not so much that one
does not recognise a danger of this kind, as that one does not know
the magnitude of its effects until experiments have been made to
determine them, that makes it worth while to note it particularly.
    As we shall see, the danger does not depend entirely on the direct
effects of the fall of temperature on the organism in the drop, but
also on the dilution of the drop by condensation of water, and some
times making it spread over the surface of the glass, and so on.
 These, and difficulties of similar kind, have given much trouble, and
 sometimes resulted in the ruin of experiments which promised useful
 results.
 Measurements     of Growth in Light and Dark, under Known Conditions
                               as to Temperature.
     I now proceeded to make experimental cultures with due regard to
 the information previously obtained, and especially taking care to
 check the temperatures by keeping control cells — which          I now have
 expressly   made   with  small, black-bulb  thermometers   in them.    More
 over, as time went on, and experience increased,       I discarded the use
 of glass as much as possible, and eventually succeeded in getting rid
 of it altogether; for the whole tendency of experience in these
 researches has been to show that the more glass the light rays have
 to traverse, the more difficult it is to trace their effect.
     At first, however, I had to be content with using open windows and
 quartz floors to the cells, the light rays being reflected from the glass
 mirror of the microscope and passed through glass or other screens,
 Ac. Subsequent developments will be described as I proceed.
     In the first set of examples of experiments it will be noted that the
 exposures     are from the beginning —i.e., it is the spores themselves
 which are submitted to the light-action ; subsequently,       I  give experi
 ments where the spores are first allowed to germinate out, and it is
 the actively growing rods or filaments which are exposed during post-
 germinal life.
                            Experiments with Spores.
      Spores were sown as usual at 9 a.m., in broth drops, in cells with
 quartz floors, and the two cultures kept in the dark at 15° C. while
  farther preparations proceeded.
      By 10.15 a.m. four microscopes were fitted         each  with two flat

334          Profs. Percy Frankland and Marshall Ward.
bottle-screens, filled with saturated alum solution, and b pair of
coloured glasses, arranged as follows : —
   On one microscope-stage lay an alum-screen over the mirror, and
on this transparent screen a blue glass, then the culture chamber.
Over the culture came another blue glass, and, lastly, an alum-
screen.
   Thus all light which passed into the . chamber, whether reflected
up from the mirror or direct from above, must traverse the alum-
screen as well as the blue glass.
   By the side of this stood a second     microscope loaded in exactly
the same way, except that a
                                   " dummy " cell with its
                                                             (blackened
bulb)   thermometer   replaced the true culture cell.
   The third microscope was exactly as the first, but with red
glasses in place of blue ; and by its side an exactly similar control
                   "
with a " dummy cell.
   Each pair of microscopes was further provided with a suspended
thermometer, with bulb blackened, to give the air temperature.
   All four microscopes stood side by side at the south window, and
each was supplied with a narrow vertical shutter just broad enough
to cast a band of shade across the mirror and loads, and so keep
direct rays from the cells.
   The day was brilliantly sunny, with deep-blue sky, and very few
clouds till 2 p.m. Then heavy white clouds kept coming up, but the
sunny intervals were numerous.
   The following were the thermometric observations, the cultures
(mirrors and screens) being illuminated only by light from the sky—
never direct from the sun in the case of the cultures, and only occa
sionally and for short periods to get experimental information from
the "dummy" cells.
   From this table we observe (1) that the culture-cells were never
allowed to exceed at most 25° to 26° C — indeed the cultures them
selves never went so high, because the sun was not allowed to shine
directly on either the mirrors or the top glasses ; and (2) that, on the
whole, the temperature of the cell betwt en the red screens was about
0-5° to I/O0 higher than that of the cell between the blue screens.

     I examined     the culture-drops at 12.30, 3 o'clock, 5.15 p.m., 9 p.m.,
  and 11 p.m., taking note of the extremes and of the commonest
  lengths of the germinal filaments developed, with the following
  results (Curves 28 and 29, p. 337) :—
     That the light and not the temperature was the effective agent in
  delaying the germination of the spores between the blue glasses
  hardly admits of any doubt after this experiment, the most
 astounding thing about the matter being the prolonged action of the
 inhibition effect ; for it was permissible to expect that when once the
 germination had begun, the plantlets would rapidly gain strength
 during the dark hours of the night. Such was not the case, how
 ever, and this fact certainly seems to support the idea that the action
 is on something — whether substance or machinery — in the spore
 itself, so that the plant produced is really a weakened organism
 incapable of assimilating the nutritive substances of the food-medium
 .with anything like the normal vigour.

readings during consecutive minutes — 19, 21, 25, 28, 31 (for blue), and 24, 27,

minutes, the blue dummy to 39 — 40°. They fell as quickly on replacing.              When
fully shaded from all sunlight, both fell, in five minutes, to 22-5°.

and eventually grew into normal and rapidly-spreading filaments ;
but the effects of the retardation and weakness were evident in the
poverty and lateness of its spore-formation.
   I repeated the foregoing experiment the next day, which was also
sunny and with a blue sky with passing white clouds, under exactly
the same conditions, excepting that the general temperature was
lower throughout and the sky less clear.       The utmost care was
taken in the arrangements of the shutters, positions of microscope
mirrors, <tc., and no direct sunlight touched any of the apparatus.
The thermometer readings were as follows — all with bulbs black
ened  : —
   The readings show (1) that the temperature varied very slightly,
and (2) that of the red culture was a trifle higher than that of the
blue.
   The spores, which had been sown at 10 a.m., and exposed at 10.30,
were examined from time to time as before ; and, also as before,
germination began in the red culture long before it did in the blue.

   After exposure for the day, placed the cultures from 11 p.m. near

night, because there was a danger of the red one forming filaments

   No direct sunlight was allowed to fall on the cultures, cardboard

   No germination           had occurred in either culture at 2 p.m., nor even
at  5 p.m.   ; but at 10 p.m. both had germinated, and the condition of
affairs was as follows : —
   In the blue culture the longest rods were 17-6 ft, and the shortest
8-8 m, giving a mean of 13-2, which was about the average length.
   In the red culture, however,            I  found filaments 44 /t, 76 ft, 110 n,
 and even 150 /t in length.           Mean of extremes = 97 ft.

                  Report on the Bacteriology of Water.                341
    On leaving the cultures throngh the night, at abont 12— 13° C,
and examining at 9 a.m. next day, the one over bichromate had
filaments from 220 /t to 660 ft long, whereas none in the blue light
were more than 88 ft to 130 ft long.
    Since the variations in temperature (N.B. — The rapid and extreme
variations only refer to the control cells, and were made for experi
mental purposes) only concern the exposure of the, as yet, un-
germinated spores, we can hardly err in referring the retardation of
 the spores in the blue-light to the inhibitory action of the light rays.
              I
    At 7 a.m. sowed spores in gelatine-broth, and exposed forthwith
at an east window.      The cells had a quartz floor, and a plate of glass
 covered with tin-foil was put over them to keep the sun off the top
 glass. One was over red glass, the other over blue, and neither
 received any but rays reflected through these glasses from the micro
scope mirrors.
    Each had a dummy cell by its side, arranged similarly, the tem
peratures of which ran as follows : —
                                    Blue.              Red.

    The day was bright, and every care was taken to keep the direct
 sun's rays off by means of shutters, &o.
    At 4 p.m. both cultures were removed to the south window, where
the temperature was 21° C, and kept so till near 7 p.m., at which
hour it had fallen to 20° C.         It slowly fell during the night, as
shown by curve, to 19 21°.—
    The table on the next page gives the results (see also Curves 34
 and 35, p. 343) :—
    Here, again, the results seem definitely positive, and only to be
 accounted for as due to the light rays, and one must conclude that —
 with resting spores at any rate — the above exposure to reflected light
 through blue glass causes very pronounced retardation, suggesting
 that a little longer exposure (or a somewhat more intense light)
 would have inhibited the germination entirely.

                 Report on the Bacteriology of Water.               343
                Effect of Light from Blue Shy on Spores.
   I now made a new departure.         Starting from the fear lest any
heating up of the bichromate, &c, screens, and the passage of the
solar rays through so many glass layers, &c, might affect the results,
I arranged screens and cultures as follows : —
   Three large circular crystallisation dishes, 12 in. wide by 4 in.
deep, were taken ; they were of thin clear glass, with vertical walls
and flat floor.   These were supported, bottom down, each on four
corks just large enough to clear the cover-slip roofs of my cells, with
their hangiug drops.

344             Profs. Percy Frankland and Marshall Ward.
   One dish was filled to a depth of 3 in. with clear water ; one with
2| in. of CuS04Am, and the other with 2^ in. K. bichromate.
   Under each of the two latter               I
                                        placed a plane mirror, flat, on
           I
which laid the culture cell (quartz floor), and one of the "dummy
      "
cells   with its black-bulb thermometer. Under the water dish I
                                     " control on a
placed a culture and its " dummy                     piece of slate ; and
by the side of this a culture and its dummy under a bell-jar darkened
with foil and brown paper.      Under the bell-jar I also hung a ther
mometer in the air.    A.11 four pieces   of apparatus were on a large
box outside the laboratory and looking east and north.
   The day opened with a clear blue sky and light wind, but a good
deal of white cloud (cumulus) came over after 10 a.m., and there was
some haze about 1 p.m.     After 2 p.m. a magnificent clear blue sky.
The sun was on the box until noon, but it was often covered by white
clouds, especially from 11.45 to 12.15 or so.
   The following table (p. 345) gives the temperatures.
   The sowings were made in broth-gelatine drops about 10.30 a.m.,
and were at once exposed as described. The dishes were so large that
no side light could get in, and           I
                                   was certain that only the light from
the sky, after traversing the liquid, glass-bottom of dish, and thin
cover-slip, reached the drop.
   Each dish had a thermometer in the liquid, and care was taken* to
avoid any complications arising from the cusp of light reflected from
the     vertical walls.
    In order to    meet   the objectionthat the orange and blue liquids
and cultures varied so much in temperature during the first 1^ hours,
I  made two new sowings at 2.30, and put one under the blue and the
other under the orange dish, exactly as before, and left them there
till 6 p.m., so that they got 3£ hours' exposure to the open sky only —
no direct sun.     The retardation in the blue        is,
                                                  nevertheless, nearly as
marked as in the other cultures.
    *   After
           my attention was directed to the danger by noticing the high tempera
ture to which the bichromate dummy cell was running at 11 a.m.

                                                                ;  only the dummy
was being touched by the cusp, however, so that the temperature   recorded for the
actual culture cell at this moment   is   too high.

         At 3.30 all the four cultures were brought into the laboratory                             and

      tbe night at 21° C, falling to 20-5° at 10.30 p.m., and to 19 5° at 1 A.m.,
      where it r-mained until 9 a.m., when the last observations were made.
          The two 2.30 cultures were brought in at 6 p.m., and remained
      side by side with the others through the night.
          If we examine these results (Curves 36—41, p. 343), the striking
      effects of the bichromate come out more clearly than ever.                              It is an
      undeniable fact that the spores germinate more quickly, produce
      stronger and more rapidly developing filaments. and sporify more early
      after exposure to the light coming through the orange screens than
      when left in the dark or behind any of the other screens for the same
      period.
           Why is this ? The reply first suggested is, because the bichromate
      lets so much of the heat rays through that- the spores are raised to a
      higher temperature.              But the same acceleration of germination is
      seen   if    the bichromate and CuSO< screens are not exposed to the
       sun, but only to light from the blue sky, and when the temperature
       of the cells behind them hardly differs — at any rate not more than

     a degree.       Moreover, the temperature of the water-cell also rose con
     siderably above that of the CnSO4 cell. Why, then, did the spores
     exposed to light through water not germinate ont more rapidly ?
     Those in the dark did ! though not so rapidly as those behind
     bichromate.
        It  seems     to me the only possible explanation is that behind the
     bichromate screen we have the effects of a higher temperature —due
     to the transmitted           infra-red rays — superposed on the beneficial
     effects of the absence of the inhibiting blue rays, which the bichro
     mate cuts off.
        I  think the absorbed infra-red rays must be effective in some way,
     or else the dark culture ought to have germinated as readily. If this
     is so, it raises an extremely interesting and important question as to
     the sources of energy available from without to these orgauisms, and
     may possibly help to throw light on many obscure points connected
     with the extraordinary capacity for work which they show.
        But we cannot explain the striking difference between the water
     and the bichromate action as merely due to temperature.                       Indeed
     none of the results would accord with that, for it was merely a ques-

   tion of the rise in temperature between 10.40 and 12.30, before germi
   nation had begun be it remembered, and therefore acting on spores
   wh'ch will bear a high temperature, e.g., 60° C. for some hours. The
   order of germination ought to have been (1) bichromate, (2) water,
   (3) dark, and (4) CuS04 culture, whereas it was (1) bichromate,
   (2) dark, (3) CuSO<, and the spores behind water did not germinate
   at all, but were there lying dead.
      In order to settle the doubt as to temperature, or sudden slight
   alterations of temperature, being the cause of the retardation and
   death   of the spores, I repeated the experiment on the following day,
  exactly as before, excepting with the single modification that the
  table was so placed that no direct sunshine whatever was allowed to
  fall on the apparatus or spores ; they received no light except that
  from the blue sky and white cumulus clouds passing through the
  liquids and glass.
      The results, summarised in the table and curves (pp. 350, 351, and
  353), show that my conclusion was right; the effect is solely an effect
  of the lipht passing through the screens.
     The accompanying table (p. 349) gives the temperatures, during
  exposure, of the liquids, the air in the dark bell-jar, and the cells. At
  4 r.m. the cells were all brought into the laboratory and kept under a
 dark jar. The temperatures during the night and following day are
 also recorded.     The differences in temperature are so slight that the
 spores may bo regarded as exposed to the same conditions as
 regards heat. Nevertheless the red and dark cultures germinated
 ont five or six hours before the blue, and were much stronger-and
 more rapid in growth, while the spores under water were killed, and
 all this with only five hours' exposure to diffuse light from a blue
 sky, which was, moreover, slightly hazy for a considerable part of the
 time, and never entirely free from white clouds.
     This experiment seems conclusive. Moreover, it is instructive in
 other respects.    It shows, for instance, that when the dark heat ra\s
 (transmitted by the bichromate the day before) are absent, the
 bichromate culture germinates out and grows like that in the dark,
and that these rays are not necessary for the bactericidal effect
through water. That the culture behind the CuSOi germinated out
at all is no doubt due to the thick layer of strong CuS04 diminish
ing the quantity and intensity of the light; it is pretty certainly a
mere matter of length of exposure.
    It seems to me the importance of these results can scarcely be
over-estimated in their bearing on the question of the death of
bacteria in water. As the sun shines for a longer time and with more
intensity on the river day by day with the advance of spring to
summer the spores will be more and more retarded, and even those
which escape actual death with the advent of the night are again

         exposed a few hours later as the early dawn brings the light on them
         once more.           So that even if it were true that the bacillus is safe as
         soon as     it has germinated, it would still be the case that only those
         spores which lurk in the shadows, or are rolled by the river into unex
        posed places, could recover.
             We shall see later on, however, that this action of light on the
        spores in water is favoured by the low temperatures to which the
        river organisms are usually subjected for subsequent experiments
        show very clearly that whatever resisting action they may be sup
        posed to have is put in abeyance when the temperature is too low

            To test the germinating power of the spores after baking, or,
       rather, drying at high temperatures, I proceeded as follows : —
            A number of cover-slip preparations were made in the ordinary
        way, with spores distributed in distilled sterile water, and these were
        placed, infected side upwards, in Petri dishes, and exposed to 80° C.
        in the hot air sterilizer, and allowed to cool slowly (two hours) to
       30° C.
            The     results show clearly that the germinating power of these
       spores dried at high temperatures is by no means destroyed by the
       high temperatures to which they are subjected.
            In the series selected the spores were distributed on the slips at
       10 a.m., and at once put into the hot-air steriliser at 80° C.                         At 12
       tioon they had cooled to just below 30° C, and each slip received a
       drop of broth -gelatine, and was arranged as the roof to a cell, the
       culture being now a hanging drop.

         All things considered, and especially the difficulties of measuiing
      the averages of the more advanced cultures, these three curves agi ee
      very well, and show clearly that neither the germination nor the sub
      sequent growth of the bacillus is in the least hurt by the heating and
      drying of the spores. Indeed, it is difficult not to suspect that the

         At 2 p.m. selected a germinated rodlet, well out, under each mi
      croscope, and kept it under observation the whole period. This was
      made feasible by placing the screens below the stage of the micro
      scope— the upper         surface    of the   light cultures      being      shaded    by
         • Brefeld found that such was the case when the epores of B.            tubtilit were
      heated to boiling (' Unters. ii. Schimmelpilze,' B. IV, 1881, p. 51).

   I  am unable to explain the slow rate of growth except on the
hypothesis that the heat was rapidly radiated from the thin glasses
on lifting the bell, and so kept the culture back.
   Another possible — perhaps more probable — explanation is that the
screens absorb (and subsequently radiate) heat from the solar ravs;
whereas the bell-jar did not do this to the same extent.       The tempe
ratures in the dark being, therefore, lower throughout all the early
6tages of the observation (only the air-temperature could be obtained
owing to difficulties of manipulation) explains the effect.

bring out clearly the retarding action of the light, especially on noting
that the temperature of the retarded culture was slightly higher,
rather than lower, than the other.

    Spores sown in a broth drop had germinated and developed good
filaments in the dark at 20 —22° C. ; the culture was then put on a
cool slab over-night, and kept slowly growing at 10 — 12° C.
    At 10 a.m. the twenty-four hours culture had fine strong filaments
when put at the south window under the l/12th immersion, with
Zeiss' screw micrometer eye-piece, for exact measurements of the
growths.       Each division of the scale gave exactly 2 «.
    The segment selected was an isolated one measuring just 50 ft long,
and consisting of four distinct segments, each again, but less ob
viously, divided by a median or nearly median septum into two cells.
    The diagrams below give the successive growths of these seg
ments and cells, as observed from 10.40 to 12.27 under the power
named, and fully bear out my previous observations that the growth
is not perfectly uniform over the filament.

     Here it must be noted that T was observing the filament in bright
 light, at relatively high temperatures ; I attributed the slow growth
  from 10.55 to 11.47 to these factors.
     The diagrams, which are drawn carefully to scale, give the relative
 elongations of the cells very accurately, and the reader is referred to
 them for details ; the conclusion to be drawn from them is that from
 10.40 to 10.55 the growth was entirely confined to the two right-hand
 segments, and then it occurred in the segments to the left end.
     At 11.47 each of the right cells became divided, almost, if not
 quite, simultaneously, so that the filament now consisted of sixteen
 cells each from 3 to 4 /i long.
     At 11.47 I was taking the light almost direct from the sun, and
 inadvertently allowed the cell to be more brilliantly illuminated than
 usual, and the reflected solar image in fact gradually got on to the
 culture-drop. On examining at 12.3          I found a most unexpected
result — the whole filament had contracted from 62 /t (its length at
 11 47) to 52 ft, aud each of the 16 short cells composing it was now
 seen to be sharply contracted and lying distinct from its neighbour,
from which it was separated by a broad cell wall. The whole was,
in fact, now a series of cells inclosed in a distinct swollen sheath.
     Still more remarkable was the fact that on again shading the
culture, which at once brought the temperature down from 36 to
26° C, these cells at once closed up again, and the whole series once
more slowly lengthened out, so that at 12.18 it was again 62 ft long.
 But no more growth occurred, though more septa were formed and
the positions of others altered. On again turning the sun on, saw   I
these cells once more and suddenly contract away from one another,
and clearly lie as contracted blocks of protoplasm in a distinct
sheath.
    Again they closed up, but more slowly, on shading the culture, and
in ten minutes all the segments were marked with fine granular
reticulations.
    The cells were now dead, and we may conclude that the insolated
                            —
protoplasm is killed by 5 10 minutes direct insolation at 35 — 36° C.
    From subsequent experiments at these temperatures in the dark it
may perhaps be concluded that the death here resulted from the
high temperature, quite apart from any possible light action, and this

                Profs. Percy Frankland and Marshall Ward.
in spite o\ the fact that not all the cells were killed by the insolation
(see below).
    For my own part,     I regard it as more probable that the   high tem
perature merely helped the light action, for if the death was due to
the high temperature, why did not all the cells die ? That some
escaped is intelligible if they were sheltered behind others — a by no
 means improbable event, for the culture was an advanced one, be it
 noted — whereas it is not easily explained on any assumption of
 heating: or of poisoning.
     It will be useful again to summarise the results of the foregoing
 section, and the suggestions they give rise to, before proceeding
 further.
     1.    So far as the spores exposed in the ripe resting condition are
 concerned, it may be regarded as proved that the blue-violet rays can
 retard or kill them, apart from any temperature rffect, and it is
 shown that they are extremely resistant to high temperatures.
     2. As regards actively growing bacilli, the evidence goes to show
 that the light action affects them also, by retarding their growth,
  and even eventually killing them, bnt, owing to certain difficulties, it
  is not so clearly shown quantitatively how far the effect is due to
  light alone, because the retarding effects are not observable within
  the short period during which measurements are taken.
      3. In attempting to trace the effects of light (of moderate intensity
  only) it is so difficult to keep two growing filaments exactly at the
  same temperature under different conditions of illumination, that the
  quantitative results cannot be insisted upon too much in detail, for
  there is always the suspicion that even a difference of less than one
  degree of temperature may affect the rate of growth, and therefore
  alter the steepness or otherwise of the curve.
      4. Some results suggest the possibility that the organism may even
   make use of rays at the red end of the spectrum in combatting the
   effect of those at the blue end.
      5. The further possibility is suggested that the difference of
   behaviour between the spores and the filaments may simply depend
   on the relative activity of the protoplasm — that when the latter is
   comparatively inactive, as in the resting spore, it is incapable of
   resistance to the light action, but that, when it is actively engaged in
   metabolism and growth, it can resist the action if the temperature is
   favourable, and the more so the nearer the optimum the temperature
   is. On the other hand, extremes of temperature may favour the
   light-action.
       fi.  Yet another hypothetical   step may be taken.      It is possible
   that the spores succumb so readily simply because a dangerously
   unstable supply of easily oxidisable materials is there, ready to be
    destroyed by the light-action ;. whereas, it is conceivable, these food

                  Report on the Bacteriology of Water.
materials are not present in the active cells of the growing filaments,
for it is by no means improbable that the active protoplasm contains
totally different compounds from the reserves in the inactive spore.
Some such view is rather supported by the retarding action of the
light on spore- formation.
    7. It must not be forgotten that, in the majority of these experi
ments, the intensity of light employed is very low, and that the
question investigated is not whether direct sunshine kills the organism
(for there is no douht on that head), but how far, and in what
manner, ordinary daylight is effective.
          Experiments without Glass and at known Temperatures.
    As already mentioned,    I contemplated avoiding glass altogether, in
order to   test the suspicion  that some of the effects observed might be
due to differences in diathermancy, &c. ; this was done by employing
thin quartz plates for all screens, floors of the cells, and even as
cover-slips in some cases (though optical difficulties occurred here),
and metallic surfaces for reflection.
    The new apparatus took some time to get together, but I had some
of the flat glass bottle-screens ground out by Mr. Hilger, and fitted with
parallel plates of quartz, and used quartz floors to the cells, and even
thin quartz cover-slips where necessary ; then        I replaced the mirror
of each of   the  microscopes  with  one silvered in front, and was now in
a position to repeat the foregoing observations with matters so
arranged that none of the incident light could be absorbed by glass.
    This is, perhaps, the best place to give the proofs that cultures
standing side by side, and treated similarly in all respects, give
growth curves so closely alike that we assume that the organism
behaves similarly whenever subjected to the same conditions.
    The following experiments show that the curves are alike in all
essential respects, within certain llmits of errors of measurement,
-when exposed to like conditions.
              Comparative Measurements     under like Conditions.
    In  order farther to test the method of measurement,        I made two
 cultures of spores sown in 10 per cent. gelatine and traces of broth
 and glucose, and kept at 22° C. in the dark incubator from 9 a.m. to
 4 p.m. Germination had begun by 1 p.m., and at 4 p.m. the cultnres
 were placed at 22° C. under microscopes, exactly alike, in diffuse
 light, the mirrors turned away in the intervals. A control thermo
 meter cell was employed, and in each case a sturdy-looking filament
 selected of exactly the same length, as nearly as I could measure.
 Care was exercised to ensure that each scale measured evenly, and
 the measurements were made at various intervals, as follows: —

    It must be allowed, from the results, that the measurements attain
a high degree of accuracy, but they suggest, at the same time, that
the problem of detecting the exact effect of slight differences of
illumination is extremely difficult for direct solution in this way.
    After standing all night at 20° C, these two nearly equal cultures
were exposed from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. to a very blue sky, with passing-
white clouds, on July 4th, A over water, B over bichromate screen —
quartz, silver mirror, shades, &c, as before — to see if spore-formation
would be affected differently by the different lights.           At 8 p.m.,
July 4, the final segmentations prior to spore- formation were visibly
commencing in B, but neither showed spores as yet.

tion.   I fear that a   new difficulty arises here — that of ensuring that
each culture-drop shall contain the same amount of food-materials, if
it is to last a long time ; of course one does one's best to have the
drops of equal size, and the drying up was here due to the different
water contents of the cotton-wool in the arms of the cells.
   In the following case the experiment was made in the north labora
tory, fully exposed to the overcast sky, the day hot and sultry.       The
spores were sown in weak gelatine, as before, at 9 a.m., and were in
the dark at 22° C. till 2 p.m. Germination was established at 2.30
and at 4.15 ; the measurements were begun on two filaments almost
exactly the same length.       The results testify strongly to the accuracy
of the measurements and the equality of growth under like con

   1 now pass to the comparative cultures in light and dark, premising
that eich j air of cultures must be compared by itself, the difficulties
of observation and preparation being so great that one cannot possibly
push the method further.
   As before, I begin with the exposures of ungerminated spores, and
pass afterwards to exposures of already germinated rodlets and fila
ments in active growth.
   On June 23 spores were sown in dilute broth-gelatine at 10 a.m ,
and exposed at once.           The quartz cells, shades, and screens as before.
 The temperature at 10.30 was 19-5°, slowly falling at the open
 window to 19° C. at 12 noon, and exactly alike under both screens.
 The sky was overcast, with traces of hazy bine now and again, and a
 cool wind was blowing; no rain fell, but the afternoon was very dull.
 The following are the results, germination having begun soon after
 12 noon.

      The results are not so conclusive as in previous cases with biighter
   light, but, so far , as they go, they bear out the inference already
   drawn, viz., that the light does inhibit the germination of the spores
   even though it is very feeble so far as blue rays are concerned.
      The following experiment, carried out on June 30, a very hot day,
   "with a slight haze but no clouds in the blue sky, bears out the fore
  going conclusion that the action is due to intense destructive meta
   bolism at high temperatures (see p. 375).
      Spores were sown and exposed at 7 a.m., a more dilute gelatine,
  •5 per cent., with only traces of broth, being            used.      Control cultures
  in the dark at 24° C. showed that germination and growth can go on
  quite well in this medium, and filaments of 2C0 to 250 ft were deve
  loped by 3 p.m. from these controls put into the incubator at 7 a.m.
      The temperatures reached were occasionally rather high, as the
 following table shows, but the exposed cultures were subjected to
 exactly the same influences, except as regards the light (never direct
 from the sun) filtered through the screens.                  The arrangement was
 exactly      as before.

      At    3.30   p.m.   the bichromate     cnlture showed several germinating
rotllets, and by 9 p.m. these had grown considerably. That the high
temperatures and great range had retarded them, however, even in the
orange light, was evident from the much better grow th of the con-
t? ol cultures kept constant at 24° C. in the dark incubator. On
July      1 — i.e., next day — there were plenty of well-grown colonies, but

long tresses.
   The culture exposed over water, however, never gave any colonies
at all : the spores were all killed.
   That the light-action on the spores does not depend for its effect
on a high temperature, however, follows not only from the previous
experiments, but also, and very clearly, from the following one,
carried out on July 1, a hot day with a cloudless blue sky, but some
what hazy, probably owing to London smoke brought up the Thames
valley by the light east wind then prevailing.

    That is to say, this filament doubled its length in fifty-six minutes
at 24—23-25° C.
  .
    Further measurements were made during the evening, and showed
that the rapid growth continued, for at 6.40 p.m. — the temperature
being 23° C. — this filament was approximately 450 ft long, and at
7.30— t = 22-5°— considerably over 1000 ft.
    At the same time (7.30 p.m.) and at exactly the same temperature
the culture over water showed one or two filaments, very feeble and
sharply segmented, about 100 ft long.
    At 10 p.m., temp. 22-5° in both cells, the long coils of the bichro
mate-culture were several thousand ft long, whereas the feebly growing
one or two filaments of the water-culture measured from 150 to 250//
at most, and were much broken up and starved looking.
    Even on July 2, when examined at 8.30 a.m., the water-culture
had no filament so long as 500 ft, though one or two were over 400 ft
long, but by this time the filaments of the other culture measured
many thousand ft.
    By 9 a.m. on July 3 the bichromate-culture was fully grown, and
had developed magnificent spores in every filament ; the water-culture
showed no trace of spores, though the shortly segmented filaments
were very granular.
    These facts are of especial interest and importance as disposing
effectually of any question as to so weak a food material being
unsuitable for the growth, &c, of this bacillus.          It is quite clear
that very little is needed for normal development.
    On July 4, after another day's exposure — but July 3 was dull, hot,
and cloudy all day — the culture over water was still devoid of spores.
After the whole of the 4th, in dark incubator at 22° C, still no signs
of spores.
    On July 5 one or two spores were detected           at isolated    spots
here and there in the filaments, but very few.

     It was perfectly clear that, exposed at the same temperatures, the
 culture from which the blue rays were screened flourished well and
 formed spores, whereas the other was starved and retarded, and
 could scarcely form spores at all.
     Spores sown as before, in weak gelatine, at 8.30 a.m., July 7, were
at once exposed to the south window.                        At 9.30, however, removedI
 them to the upper              room,    north window, to avoid high temperatures.
     The day opened very bright, with a deep blue sky, about half
 covered with cumulus clouds, at noon became more overcast, and after
 I p.m. was dull and quite overcast ; rain later.

   Here, again, we see that the light effect on spores is obvious enough,
and that with daylight, which gives no measurable results with
growing filaments at all.            We obtain a more vivid impression of the
differences of behaviour of these two cultures if we note the following
points    : —
   The water-culture took 101 minutes to grow from 50 ft long to
100 ft — double its length — at 19-5 — 19° C, and 120 minutes to grow
from 67-5 n to 135 ft at 20—18° C.                 ; whereas the bichromate-culture
grew     from      292  5  n  to  585   /t  (i.e.,   doubled its length) in only 80
minutes at 18-5 to 18° C, and only took 89 minutes to grow from
 146 25 to 292 ft at 20—18-5°.

  On August 3 spores were sown in broth 4- 1 per cent, gelatine, at
10 a.m., and exposed as follows. Each of two cultures had a black
ened matchbox cover pierced with a hole, so as to diminish radiation

   How the conclusion that the light from a sky only occasionally
blue, and generally very cloudy, retarded the spores indefinitely is
to be avoided here seems inconeeiveable.     There is nothing in the
minute differences of temperature  — the maximum at 11.45 was only
0 4 of a degree — to account for      and as for the variations -(from

the range was really very favourable.
   On August        this experiment was repeated, but with broth
                          4
instead of    per cent. gelatine drops. The cultures were started
                1
at 10.15, and kept till 10.55, at a north window in the laboratory,
because rain was threatened.    The sky then became blue in patches
 — a very deep blue, but with rolling heavy cumulus clouds — and
the cultures were then taken outside and exposed exactly as yester
day, all the cells standing on a glass mirror, the surface of which
was covered with black paper except just below the drops and the
thermometer bulbs. The variations of sky and temperature are given
in the annexed table.

       Of course, we must remember these numbers are             for averages of
    lengths, and cannot be compared too closely       with the numbers got as
    averages   of detailed observations.     Nevertheless, there is a certain
    and more     than merely rough agreement, which suggests that the
   growth was normal for the rather wide ranges of temperature.
       May 22 opened very clear and blue, but with a cold N.E. wind ;
   after 10 a.m. it clouded over, and the afternoon was dull and wet as
   well as cold.
       A culture of spores kept at 12° C. overnight was germinating
   freely, but slowly.     The cell had a quartz floor; the drop was broth-
  gelatine.
      At  10 a.m. this was put over a concave silver mirror and qnartz
  cell   of water, and the measurements begun. The exposure was to
  the open blue sky to the south ; no direct sunshine at all was
  allowed, a cardboard screen being used.
       The measurements were as follows, the temperatures being those of
  a similar cell over a plane silver and bichromate quartz cell ; experi
  ments showed this registered the same temperatures.
      The experiment was simply a trial to satisfy myself that the
  apparatus worked satisfactorily.         As the following table shows, the
  growth was very slow, but six hours' exposure to the dull light did
  not kill the filaments.
      The following table gives results : —

      This filament doubled its length in         5  hours and 28 minutes at
 12—13—12° C.
      On June 21, which turned out a brilliant sunny day, with blue sky,
a little hazy, and very hot, the following experiments were made ; the
apparatus being quartz cells, and screens, and double cardboard
shades to microscopes arranged as in the accompanying diagram
 (p. 110).
     The spores,     sown in broth-gelatine the night before at 12° C., had
germinated evenly to rodlets by 9 a.m., and were exposed at the open
south window at 9.45, over screens of water and of K. bichromate,
the silver mirrors being turned to the blue sky to the south.

    Here was evidence that the culture over water was growing            less
rapidly than that over bichromate, but since the growth of                the
filaments in the bichromate culture was rapidly approaching the long
lengths which     I   cannot measure, I determined to try the effect of
more direct insolation to see if the higher temperature and intensity
would bring more rapid action. Consequently          I tried the results of

  to the cultures and thermometers, again using the same cultures, but
  selecting yet another filament in each of lengths as nearly equal as
  possible.

    Here we see clearly enough that at high temperatures (32 — 34° C.)
the bright light acted as a powerful stimulus to rapid growth behind the
bichromate, which warded off the blue-violet rays, but brought about
rapid     diminution of growth and death behind the water.
    It   seems  extremely probable therefore that, provided there is
plenty of food-material of a highly nutritious nature present, the
high temperature is in itself merely conducive to intense construc
tive metabolism and growth, but if the blue rays gain access at the
same time they so interfere with constructive metabolism or so
promote destructive metabolism (perhaps by promoting respiration ?)
that rapid death ensues.                                                      /

376          Profs. Percy Frankland aud Marshall Ward.
    In any  case the death cannot here be referred   merely to the high
 temperature, because, on the whole, the bichromate culture was at a
 higher temperature than the other.
    On July 5 spores were sown in weak gelatine at 9 a.m., and
cultures kept in dark till 2 p.m.       The sky was particularly blue,
but unfortunately I had to abandon the measurements at 4.25 p.m.,
and on my return several hours later they had grown too long to
measure.
    So far as the measurements show there wns no appreciable light-
effect up to 4 p.m., but after that the bichromate curve was making a
sharp rise out of all proportion to the temperatures ; it was unfor
tunate that an engagement took me away from the observations just
at the critical p^rt, because the pursuit of this rise — which ousrht
to have been les* than the rise in the other curve, according to the
temperatures — would have been interestin?.
    But these cultures were placed next morning at 22°. C. in the
dark incubator, and on the 7th July the one over bichromate had
formed excellent and normal chains of spores ; whereas the one over
water, though some spores were developed, was far behind in that
respect. So that, after all, there was an appreciable light effect in
the retardation of spore formation.
    Spores were sown at 12 midnight on July 5, and kept at 22° in
dark incubator till 10 A.m. They were then exposed over a water
screen, quartz, as usual. The weak gelatine was used.      The day was
very   hot, and the haze in the early morning  soon became thicker, and
by noon the sky was overcast; the afternoon was dull and intensely
sultry, ending in thunderstorms. From previous experience no light-
effect could be expected, and the following table and curve show that
no appreciable effect was obtained.     The curve, on the other hand,
may be regarded as an almost perfect type of the growth record at
the temperature used, probably the optimum or a little beyond.
    The measurements could only be conducted directly on the whole
filament up to 5.3 p.m., but fortunately the filament then segmented
so distinctly into two parts, and at 5.30 into three parts, that, since
these remained in contact and each quite straight but forming very
open angles one with another,     I was able to measure each by itself
and add their growths.      After 6.14, however, this became no longer
possible, partly owing to the enormously rapid growth and partly
to the lengths being greater than I could measure accurately.

   On August        6 spores    sown in two broth-drop cultures were kept
at 23° from 10.15 a.m. to 2 p.m., and germinated out well.
   Then placed over bichromate and water respectively during the
afternoon to test the light-action, with the following results (pp. 378,
379), a rodlet 6-75 ft long being fixed in the water culture, and one
13-5 n long in the bichromate culture.
   The morning had been very dull, but cleared up between 1 and
2 p.m. ; at 2.30 the sky was only just showing blue and hazy between
streaky clouds, little or no wind. From 2.37 to 3.10 the sky was
overcast with heavy dull clouds, hut cleared a bit by 3.30, and from
3.50 to 4.45 again showed some hazy blue between -streaky clouds.
The clouds get thicker, in fleecy streaks afterwards, and there was
some blue showing up to 4.50. Thence onwards was dull and over
cast.
   The    window was open — south laboratory — all the time, up to 6.55,
quartz,   silver mirrors, card and matchbox screens, &c., as before.

     It  is pretty evident, in spite of the irregular and almost abnormally
  rapid growth recorded for the bichromate culture at first, that a
  prolonged retardation occurred in the water culture — a retardation
  which, for broth cultures, is too long for the temperatures, and can
  only be referred to the light.
    On November 16          I sowed spores in normal 10 per cent, gelatine,
 and put into 22° C. at 10 a.m. Two cultures were made, and at 12.30
 these were exposed as follows, to test the effect of the light from a
 bine sky on germinating rodlets. The two cultures stood side by
 side on a mirror, each covered with a matchbox screen ; on one lay
 a bine glass, and on the other a red one. The sky was fairly clear,
 but clouds      passed occasionally.
    Two      control-cells with thermometers lay beside them, and each of
these was arranged exactly like its culture, the glasses used for
screens being in each case the half of the same piece ot glass as that
on the culture.
   The temperature was rather low, and ran as follows during the
exposure from 12.30 to 4 p.m., on west side of laboratory, and com
pletely sheltered from any direct sunlight.

    At  4 p.m. the cultures were brought into the laboratory, where the
 temperature rose to 12-5° C, and there is no question as to the tem
 perature being identical in both cells from 2 p.m. onwards, and at no
time after the first ten minutes of exposure did the temperature
differ by more than y^th of a degree C.
    When the cultures were first put out the spores were swollen, and
were already beginning to germinate, and if they had remained at
22° C. till 4 p.m. they would have developed filaments from 90 to 150 p
long, as shown by two sister cultures left at 22° C. as controls, and
which were examined at 4 p.m.
    As it was, the exposure to a low temperature — 12° to 7° C. — of
course checked both cultures.
    Nevertheless, at 6 p.m. the red culture showed several rodlets
9 to 10 ft long, one 6 ft, and two or three 4-5 to 5 /t, whereas                    I could
discover plenty of swollen and germinated spores 2 3 ft long, and         —
even one rodlet 4-5 /t long in the blue, but nothing longer.                            The
following    table  gives    the  successive     measurements.
    It will be seen that here we have obvious retardation by 3^ hours of
diffuse blue light acting on the young rodlets, and that this retarda
tion was entirely independent of the temperature, which was the
same in both cases.           (See Curves 74 and 75.)

   The curves show that the doubling periods ran approximately
thus : —
  7 -7—15 -4 = 6 P.m. to 9.10 p.m. = 190 min. at 12 '5— 13— 12 -75 for the rod,
whereas the blue did not double (2  "7 — 5 "4 = 6. p.m. to 10 "30 = 270 min. at same
temperature) till 80 mins. later.
   On November 17 spores which had been sown overnight in normal
10 per cent, gelatine at 13° C. had germinated to filaments 200 to
300 ft long by 10 a.m. ; two cultures were examined and exposed at
10.15 a.m., at the sonth of the laboratory, care being taken that the
sun was behind a building, and could not touch the cultures.
   One culture was under blue and the other under red glass, each with
its control thermometer cell, and side by side on a mirror, all open to
the blue sky. The day was cold, and growth very slow. Matchbox
screens were used.
   The temperature ran as follows : —

   At   3.15 — i.e., after five hours' exposure — the red culture had
 grown considerably more than the Hue one, although, so far as there
 was any difference of temperature at all, it favoured the blue
 culture.    The filaments were too long, and too much curved to
 measure, but there was no doubt as to the increased growth.
    Spores sown in normal gelatine at 10 p.m. on November 17, and
 tept in the dark at 13° C, had germinated to rodlets averaging
 9 — 12 ft long at 8.30 a.m. on November 18, when two cultures were
 exposed to the clear blue sky on a mirror to the north and out of the
 sun. The day was cold and very fine. Each culture was covered by
a black match-box screen, and had a thermometer control by its side
 treated exactly like it. One culture had ruby glass over       the otherit,
 blue; the latter was slightly in advance, i.e., had some slightly
longer rodlets.    In order to be on the safe side     chose the culture
                                                             I
which had      slight advance
                 a               anything
                                     if    for the blue.
    The following table (p. 383) summarises the results of measure
 ments, and the temperatures.
    It not difficult to translate these records. At the very low tem
      is
perature used growth was extremely slow* in both cases neverthe          ;
less the temperature was above the minimum, and the red glass
screen enabled      to go on as usual, because the inhibiting blue- violet
                      it
rays were cut off, whereas behind the blue glass these rays carried
on their destructive work, and the rodlets did not grow at all after
the first hour or two.
    A word of explanation       necessary, perhaps, regarding the slight
                                is
discrepancies between the measurements in the blue.
   Each drop had about 20 spores in it. In taking the successive
observations, two sources of (minute) errors exist one is, that no:
doubt the measurements, even of the same rodlet, are not perfectly
accurate—    it easy to see how one could go wrong to 0-25, or even
                     is
0-5 of a  —  the other
            ft            that one does not always find the same six or
                           is
eight rodlets, however carefully one tries. My practice     to seek foris
the same, but to take care that every drop        thoroughly overhauled
                                                        is
for the biggest and the smallest rodlets.
   On the whole      think
                      I        will be admitted that the measurements
                                it
correspond very well,   and  that the averages are very good.
   At 9.15 p.m. the temperature was falling for the night, and     went        it
down to below 9° C. before morning, rising again slowly after suurise                ;
this explains the still slow growth of the red culture.
  At 8.30 a.m.     put both cultures into the incubator at 22° C, to
                     I
seeif   arise of temperature would make any difference as regards
the dormancy of the blue culture.
  The result was that while the red culture had filaments from 40 to
300n  long by 12.30 noon, the blue one showed no further signs of
      The doubling period would      seem to be 360 — 400 minutes, or even longer.

life than before.     Similarly, at 4   p.m.,    the blue was as before, while
the red had filaments several thousands of ft'b in length.
    On November 18 spores were s0wn in normal gelatine at 8 A.m.,
and kept at 22° C. till 12.30, when they had germinated to rodlets
8 — 9 ft long.    Two cultures were then exposed at the south window,
the sun being off (behind a building) on microscopes, and over blue
and red glass respectively, the light reflected up from ordinary
mirrors. Controls as usual. The whole day was clear and cold.
    The following are the results : —-
    The doubling period for the red culture comes out (for the
mean) =
      24-75—49 -5 it = 1.30 p.m.— 3.47 P.H. =    137 minutes at 15 -5—16 -4—15°.
    Owing to the fact of my having the previously described cultures,
exposed to the open sky behind the same blue and red screens, but at
 a lower temperature, it is not difficult to see what happened here.
 The amount of light reflected from the small glass mirrors of the
 microscopes is not sufficiently intense to kill the rodlets at these tem
 peratures, though it is sufficient to inhibit their growth perceptibly.
    This explains many of my previous failures.                      I
                                                                 If arrange the
 microscopes so as to throw a more intense daylight on the cultures,
 then the heat rays produce difficulties, because the screens transmit
 them in different proportions, and       I   either find the measured filament
 growing longer than can be measured before the inhibition sets in,
 or the difference in temperature between the two cultures so great
 that doubts arise as to how much of the inhibition is due to lower or
 higher temperature, and how much to the light action.
    For, as we now see, the temperature is effective at once, but the
 light action takes a considerable time to make its effects visible on
 the growth-curve, and over and over again            I  have found cultures just
 beginning to show the retarding, brake-like action of the light injury
 at, or even after, the conclusion of the short growing period            I am able
 to quantitatively examine and record. Of course, though one may
 be convinced by inspection that, of two cultures, one has formed a
 smaller crop than the other, in the absence of measurements the
 statement wants the definiteness       I have been trying to attain.

    Germination had not begun at 3.10, but was commencing at 4.30 in
the red, whereas it was delayed till 8.30 in the bluo, and would, no
doubt, have been still more tardy at a lower temperature.
    A   review of the foregoing results where no glass was used (except
the thin cover slips in some) only confirms the previous results.
    1. The spores are distinctly retarded or killed by five or six hours'
exposure to daylight, even of low intensity, quite apart from tem
perature.
    2. The growing filaments are often not measurably retarded within
the period observed, except under conditions such as do not exclude
possible temperature effects ; but the evidence goes to show that the
light slowly retards the growth, acting like a brake on the curve of
growth.

386            Profs. Percy Frankland and Marshall Ward.
    3. Further testing of the measurements and curves on growing fila
ments under like conditions, confirms the confidence in their accuracy,
and they may be accepted as very good approximations.
    4. Some of these measurements bring out clearly the extreme sen
sitiveness to changes of temperature of the growing filaments, and
emphasise clearly how difficult it is to avoid this source of error.
    5. The mode of action of the light may be conceived of in several
ways, keeping in view the differences of effect on spores and filaments.
First, we might suppose it promotes oxidations in the surrounding
food materials, resulting in the formation of poisonous substances
which kill the spores but not the filaments; this (taking into
account the resistance of the spores to physical agencies, and the
evidence previously given) seems unlikely, for unless the living proto
plasm of the actively growing cells has some extraordinary power of
destroying such poisons as fast as they are made, whereas the dormant
protoplasm of the resting spore is incapable of this, it seems incredible
that the spores, otherwise so highly resistant, should succumb more
easily than the otherwise so slightly resistant filaments.              Secondly,
we might suppose that the light action takes effect directly on some
easily destroyed reserve material in the spore, which does not exist as
such in the actively metabolising growing cell. This would explain
the retardation of germination, or the death of the spores, according
to the amount of destruction of the spore contents, very well ; but
it is not easy to accept the assumption that the light is totally with
out effect on the growing cell. A third possibility seems to be that
the light action makes itself effective in promoting some intense
metabolic activity in the spores and growing cells alike, and which
is connected with enhanced respiration.               In this case we might
suppose the spores to suffer from the too rapid consumption of
their unstable reserve materials (as before), while the growing cells
do not show the effects so long as plenty of food material is still avail
able in the hanging drop, and, therefore, so long as the filaments
are still measurable.        At a later period, however, the overworked
machinery results in the production of much feebler plants, capable
of developing a few poor spores only, or even none at all, such as was
observed in several cases where the cultures were allowed to go on.
Here, then, we can understand why the direct measurements often
give no decisive results : the actively growing filaments can only be
measured during a short period, but the cumulative effect of the mal
nutrition is not evinced by diminished growth until after the measure
ments have ceased, or at least till towards the end of the period.*
   6. But if the latter hypothesis is accepted,            we have to recognise
   * This is decidedly against action on the food materials, since one would expect
the effect to make itself evident very early in the growth as the injurious  bodies
reach the sensitive cells.

                           Report oh the Bacteriology of Water.                       387
that the fundamental physiological function affected by the light is
not growth, but nutrition — constructive metabolism ; and this would
coincide very well with what Elfving found to be the case in macro
scopic cultures of fungi.
   7. However,    the possibilities are not exhausted by the above.
There are several points which suggest that the destructive light
action may take place on the enzymes which the living cell forms and
excretes.    If Green is right in concluding that the more refrangible
rays* are destructive to the action of enzymes outside the cell, it may
be that we have here the key to the mystery, and that the cells
gradually die of inanition from inability to render their food materials
assimilable.    Still the experiments throw no light on whether such
action takes place outside or inside the cell,t though, perhaps, the
results with spores support the latter idea rather than the former
one.
   8. Whatever the light action consists my it is evidently exerted by
the more refrangible rays, and is the more pronounced the more
intense the light, or with feeble lights the greater the proportion of
these rays there are in it.
   9. The evidence goes to show also, that the rays at the other end
of the spectrum, and especially the heat rays in the red and below,
co-operate in the light action in question (or, possibly, sometimes
antagonise it) in various ways. The probability is that with a given
moderate intensity of light, such as occurs in ordinary daylight, the
damaging effect of the blue-violet rays on growing cells is dependent
on the temperature.    If the temperature is about the optimum, the
protoplasm, working at its best, seems able to resist — perhaps even
undo — the damage ; if the temperature is far removed from the
optimum, however, the injurious action of the light rays is cumulative,
and results in more or less rapid retardation of growth, and eventual
death. This       no doubt, true, whether the protoplasm fails to com
                         is,
 bat the injury because too passive, as at low temperatures, or because
 over-stimulated and too active, as at high temperatures.   Taking into
account all we know, however,       seems improbable that the organism
                                         it
can resist the bactericidal action of the more refrangible rays at any
 temperature,   those rays are relatively abundant in an intense light.

 t      It   is             that when the enzymes begin their work in the food
                  not inconceivable
material, the products of  their action are easily oxidised.   Indeed some experi
ments point to the probability of this, and suggest that broth with enzymes in        it   is
susceptible to some destruction.

          Experiments with the Light of   the Electric Arc, and others.
     In order to    test the validity of previous conclusions as to th-
• essential similarity of action of the electric and solar light,    I  started
  the following experiments.      In spite of the kindness of my colleagues,
  Professor Stocker and Mr. Shields, in lending me the apparatus and
  use of a dark room, and the assistance of Mr. West, who took a
  lot of trouble in helping me,     I had to abandon these experiments,
  partly because    the   lamp was not sufficiently powerful, and partly
  owing to the close attention and long periods of watching they
  require, and also because of other difficulties.           I carried them
  sufficiently far, however,   to show that the matter is worth further
  attention, and append the results in the hope that someone will take
  up this line of investigation.
     On July 13      I  tried the effect of exposing spores, in weak-
  gelatine, over the water and the bichromate screens, to the electric
  arc-light, reflected up from silvered mirrors.
     The lamp used was a small, old-fashioned Dubosq, and the micro
  scopes, with shades, match-box screens, quartz, and controls, &c,
  arranged exactly as before, were 3 ft. from the arc. The current used
  was equal to 8 amperes, and was taken from 32 storage cells. No
  reflectors or lenses were used, and much light was lost.
     The spores were sown at 3 p.m., and the exposures began at
  3.15.
     The temperatures remained the same, or varied similarly, in both
  cultures, and during the whole period of exposure — 3 hours — only
  rose from 18° C. to 19-25° C.
     On stopping the experiment at 6.15 p.m., the cultures were at once
  placed in the dark, side by side, at 18° C. The temperature slowly
  fell to 16° C. at 10.45, when no results were observed.
     At 7 A.m., on the 14th July, the bichromate culture showed rodlets
  and filaments 250 /t long and upwards ; but the culture over water did
  not show a single germinated spore.
     I  was not entirely satisfied with this result, however, because the
  gelatine drop had run a little, owing to condensation of water, and
  therefore regarded the result as negative.
     On July 14 this experiment was repeated exactly, the spores
  being sown at 9 a.m. and exposed at 9.15 a.m.          The spectra of the
  screens were carefully    examined,  and   everything arranged as exactly
  as possible.
     The temperatures were as follows : —

At   12.20 the cultures were put into the        dark incubator at 22° C, and
examined       occasionally   during the      afternoon,    with the following
results.
    At 3 p.m.  there were several germinating rodlets in the bichromate
culture, measuring from 4-5 ft to 15-75 ft; but none could be found in
the water-culture more than 2 ft long — swelling spores, in fact.
    At 4.30 p.m., however, no differences of importance between the
two cultures could be detected.           I   measured 15 rodlets — all that
could be found      —  in the bichromate culture, and these ranged from
5 fI to 64 [l ; while fourteen measurements in the water culture gave
from 4-5 ft to 54 ft, a difference that could not be insisted upon.
    It must be concluded from this that the above exposure (3 hours)
has no marked effect on the spores. It is, perhaps, worth mention
that a reflection of the western sun, on a hazy day (July 13)
thrown from a plane mirror on to the disc of light given by the lamp
at about 10 ft. was much brighter than the disc.
    After the foregoing, it need hardly be said that 1^ hours' exposure
— experiment from 1.35 to 3.5 p.m. on July 14 — gave no results.
    On July 16, with the same arc, but at 2 ft. distance,          I  exposed two
cultures, arranged exactly as before, for six hours — viz., from 9.35 a.m.
to 3.45   p.m.
    The temperature slowly rose from 16-75 (bichromate) and 17-25
(water) at 9.35 to 18 in both at 9.50 ; to 20° C. at 12.50, and finally
to 21 at   3 p.m.,  but never passed beyond that.
    At 3.50 the cultures were placed in the dark incubator at 22° C.
Neither showed any signs of growth up to 10.30 P.m., but at 12 noon,
on the 17th July, the culture over water showed one weak tuft of
filaments, the longest being 140 to 180 ft long ; those in the bichro
mate culture were 675 to 800 ft long.
    This indicates a feeble light action, no doubt ; but it is remarkable
that the bichromate culture had not made more progress in the time !
    On July 26, with exactly similar arrangements, two broth drop-
cultures were exposed, from 9.30 a.m. to 3.30 p.m., a full six hours.
The temperature rose from 19 at 9.30, to 21-5 at noon, and to 22 at
1 P.m.,  and so to the end.
               * Five minutes were occupied in replacing the carbons.

390            Profs. Percy Frankland and Marshall Ward.
   Before removing to the incubator, at 24r C, examined both care    I
fully. No trace of a rodlet could be found in the water culture, but
30 or 40 filaments from 200 to 300 and even 450 ft were abounding
in that over bichromate.
   At 7 p.m., re-examination showed immeasurably long filaments in
the bichromate culture, whereas only three filaments 58, 96, and 81 n
long respectively conld be found in the water culture.
   I think this must be regarded as proof that light-action occurs
under the above conditions of exposure ; and there can be little doubt
that with a more powerful lamp — perhaps aided by quartz con
densers, &c. — effects more nearly approaching those with sunlight
could be obtained.

   The following experiment illustrates very clearly the effect of in
troducing a rapidly growing, strongly aerobic bacillus to compete for
oxygen, &c, with the schizomycete in question.
   I selected a well grown culture of B. ramosus, and introduced into

   The growth had entirely ceased, as I convinced myself by nursing
 the culture in the incubator for the rest of the day.
   Whether this was due entirely to the loss of oxygen brought about
by the form     /3, which showed beautiful chemotactic aggregations
about the filaments, by the bye —or to other causes brought about by
the action of the intruder, cannot be with certainty determined, but
it is obviously a  line of enquiry worth further pursuit. In any case
the shape of the curve        entirely different from the usual one, and
                                     is

the filaments of oxygen.

     A   very curious phenomenon occurred here. At 5.40 the filament
had ceased growing, and apparently measured only 49-5 ft — whereas
it was 55 ft ten minutes previously. More careful observation showed
a length of empty sheath 9 ft long in addition, so that it was really
58 5 ft long, but the solid part had contracted itself.                   The cause of
this is not evident, and as the table shows, the temperature, &c.,
could not have been responsible ; but the phenomenon is apparently
of the same order as the abnormality described on p. 356 by
exposure to intense insolation.               At 5.45 the solid part was 54 ft long,
and at 5.50 it was 58-5 ft. By 6.5 the empty portion had partly
filled up again by a block separated by a piece of empty sheath
(about 1 ft long) from the main mass ; by 6.15 the abnormality
seemed quite repaired.
    I  have no idea what could have induced                  this malformation : there
is an interesting question involving the maladies of a schizomycete
here, but      I  could only note it in passing.
    Its bearing on my present purpose is evident. The disturbance
caused the filament to take ninety-one minutes to double its length
against forty-five in the previous period ; evidently one cause
of this would be the loss of cell-divisions and their summation.
    *  See p. 431   for explanation of the normal doubling period — it is obtained br
dating    the  commencement       of the measurements half an hour after starting the
growth,    to allow   the cell time  to accommodate itself to the temperature.

  There was no reason for concluding that the main mass of the
  filament grew any slower, but it may have been so.
      It scarcely seemed worth while to pursue this, so another filament
  was taken in the same culture.

     The growth was       so slow that    I abandoned the measurements.         I
 cannot explain it, unless the following suggestion is to the point.
 The cotton- wool plugging the arms had been slightly scorched during
sterilisation : my practice is not to heat up to browning point, but in
 this case that had occurred. Can it be that traces of pyrid ine-like
 or other bodies get into such a cell, and cause slight antiseptic
inhibition ? It would probably be worth somebody's while to make
a series of experiments with such cultures to this end, with various
volatile bodies added in known doses in the arms of the cells.
                .Experiments    on the Effects of Temperature   only.
    Various results in the foregoing account of my experiments sug
gested that it would be well to obtain more accurate information as
to the effect of temperature alone on the growth curves. Of coursj
a good deal of work has been done on the influence of temperature

generally, on the growth of bacteria, so far as their macroscopic
characters are concerned, and a few observers — notably Brefeld with
B. subtilis — have made observations on the rate of cell-division at one
                                                    I
or two principal air- temperatures ; but, so far as know, no one has
attempted to measure quantitatively and in detail the effect of small
differences of temperature over a long range, and that temperature
that of the culture — which we have seen may be different from that of
the air — and especially to obtain plotted out curves of growth under
such conditions.
   It is obvious that my methods admit of this being done, and I
thought it might be not only productive of useful information as to
the primary point concerned — the definite effect of given tempera
tures on the growth — but that    I might possibly be able to make use
of these normal temperature-curves indirectly, by comparing them
 with the foregoing.
   I accordingly started what proved to be a very long and laborious
series of cultures under a microscope enclosed in an incubator of an
improved form modelled on the original type described some years
ago by Sachs.     The chief difference is that the heating arrangement
is a  thick, flanged, blackened, iron plate, on which stands a thick
sheet of asbestos-board, and on this the microscope.     The whole body
of the microscope, except the eye-piece and micrometer screw, is
enclosed in a wooden box, of which the iron plate is the floor ; this
box has a glass window in front and two lateral openings (with
shutters) for manipulating the culture, and can easily be opened
entirely if necessary.
   A culture being placed in position, and the microscope focussed on
a selected rodlet or filament, the shutters are all closed and the
growth goes on in the dark.
   The temperature is registered by a thermometer whose bulb is
inside and reading     column projecting through the roof : the gas
passes through   a  very delicate thermo-regulator, containing mercury
and ether, and when once the apparatus (which         I shall henceforth
term Sachs' box) is heated up, it can easily be kept at a temperature
so constant that it does not alter a degree in several hours, while,
with a little more care (aud provided no large alterations of tempera
ture are going on in the room), it will remain for hours within
0-25° C. of the temperature arranged for.
   Of course, the temperature falls or rises quickly when the box is
                                         —
opened — unless it is that of the room but it returns in five to ten
minutes if the opening and shutting are completed in a minute or so ;
the opening and shutting of the side windows, and the removal and
replacement of the shutter during observations, produce very slight,
slowly acting effects, which, however, cannot be neglected, as we
shall see.

                      Report on the Bacteriology of Water.                   395
        The ideal is practically realised in the case of a culture which,
     once in position, remains without the necessity of any opening at all,
     and this can frequently be carried out.         In order to meet obvious
    objections, however,     I have in all cases made several cultures at each
    temperature, and to make the results strictly comparable,         I  adopted
    the following method of recording.
        1. The table of growths was prepared, giving the time of obser
    vation, temperature, and length of filament, &c., as in preceding
    cases.
        2. Then the curve of     growth was plotted out on sectional paper,
    care being taken that the squares, &c, were all equal, and that the
    intervals between the observations were sufficiently short and
   numerous to give good curves. Since the measurements were all
   made with the same micrometer-scale and the same microscope, and
   taking into account the proofs of accurate measurement already
   given, no more need be said on that head.
       3. From    these   curves and tables      I then   measured the period
   occupied by a rodlet or filament of any given length (to start          with)
   in growing to double its length, and call this the doubling period.
       4. The average doubling period for any temperature is then obtained
   in the usual way, by taking the sum of the times and dividing by the
   number of observations. Before saying more, however, it will be
   best to examine the actual results, which now follow.
       I   may add that     I  had already satisfied myself that the curves
   obtained at widely different temperatures, are markedly different,
   and less and less divergent as the temperatures of growth approach
  -one another, facts which are in accordance with experience with
  other organisms, and which will be evident enough as we proceed.
                           I
       In what follows select a number of representative curves from
  larger series made to familiarise myself with the details ; and for the
 sake of classification — and with reference to some conclusions later —
  I   present them arranged according to the food-materials employed.
  The media chiefly used were four, viz. : (1) normal beef-broth ; (2)

varying      between    24-75°  and      25-25° C., and, by the shape of the curve,
the rate would probably not be far different for the next doubling
period.
    This specimen, which had grown vigorously during the night of
the 11th, was kept at the same temperature, 24-5° to 25-5°, all through
i he 12th, in the dark. It was necessary to open the chamber at
9.30 a.m. on the 12th, and the temperature fell to 22 5° for a few
minutes, but it had recovered before 10 a.m.

                               Doubling Periods.
    This is a good opportunity for explaining more in detail what is
meant by the above term.
    If this long and symmetrical curve 83 is carefully examined, it will
be found that, over a great part of its course, any chosen short length of
the filament doubles its length in approximately equal times.
    Thus it took forty-five minutes to grow from 9 ft to 18 ft, and the
same from 18 ft to 36 ft, and so on.         But it is practically the same
whatever the length we select, provided the conditions are constant, as
will be seen by comparing the curves.
    I  term the period required for doubling the length the " doubling
period," and the comparison of a large number of curves shows that
the nearer we approximate to absolute constancy of the conditions
the clearer the truth of the following statement, which amounts to a
 law, is evident.
     Whatever the length of the filament taken, that length is doubled in
equal times when the conditions     are constant.
     For the present it is only necessary to clearly apprehend the
meaning of the above term, and the general truth enunciated, so that
 ; he reader can understand the figures attached to the tables.     Further
 particulars   will  come out as we proceed.

 spores, in stiff weak gelatine, were sown and put in the Sachs' box

further growth could be observed, although          I slowly lowered the
temperature as    follows : —

   A  rodlet fixed on the scale and measured showed no departure at
7 p.m.  from its original length, 9 ft, at 5 p.m. Growth was impossible,
apparently, under these conditions.
   I presume    that what occurred was, germination was effected, but,
at the temperature 30 — 31° C, the delicate young rodlets could not
assimilate food-materials from this weak gelatine.
   Later considerations, based on further experience, suggests that
the variations of temperature may have combined to inhibit the
growth also.
   On reviewing these curves of growth at various temperatures, kept
approximately constant in each case, in the weak gelatine, we find
the following facts come out : —
   1. As was to be expected, the doubling periods are longer at lower
temperatures than at higher ones.
   2. There are indications of a temperature near 25° C. being more
favourable than any others, i.e., an optimum temperature, as con
trasted with less favourable lower temperatures nearer a minimum, or
higher ones nearer a magnum.
   3. Some facts point to the necessity for distinguishing the germinal
phase of growth from the more independent growth which occurs
after the rodlet is entirely free of the spore and its reserves.
   4. The doubling period is evidently affected not only by the meau
temperature employed, but by variations above and below this mean ;
and this in two ways : (1) according to the rapidity of these varia
tions, and (2) according to their range.
   It is hardly worth while making any more general statements
until we have examined other cases, so          I now pass to cultures in
broth.

   As regards the discrepancy between the first doubling period and
the rest, I have little donbt it is explicable with reference to the
process of germination.      It must be noted that the initial length
(4    ft)not that of a free rodlet working up its food-materials from
            is
the broth, but of rodlet phis spore, and presumably still utilising
unexpended stores from the spore.       To make the comparisons fair,
therefore, we ought to neglect this first period.
   On July 21 and 22 the following observations were started with
cultures in fresh broth :—
   Spores sown     p.m. were put at ouce into Sachs' box at 19-5° C,
                          8
falling to 18-75° at 9.30 p.m.
   On July 22 the growths, followed for hour and 10 minutes, gave  1
the doubling period                :   —
                          99—198       n   in   65 minutes at 17—16            75— 17° C.
Or, calculating back               :   —
            225—112-5     n    = 8.221a.m.— 9.10 A.m. = 43 minutes at 16-75—17°              C.

   This culture formed spores by      a.m., July 25, having been at

4.55 p.m. to 8.28 p.m. Sachs' box, &c., as before.

    At 11.30 a rod bent thus         \     was selected and measured as fol

broke up are referred to later.

    When first observed, the filament consisted of two segments joined
at an angle of about            .   At 12 noon the horizontal leg had broken
                 \
into two rods, the ends of which were already sliding one over the
other, thus             , and by 12.20      the other leg had bent into two
segments, which remained joined thus —

 c, d, as shown in the diagram.             The following are their measure

 C, D, and give their measurements separately, then their separate

   A review of these broth-cultures bears out the general truth of the
previous statements, and justifies the following additional conclu
sions : —
   1. The growth in broth is more rapid than in the weak gelatine,
and the doubling periods, especially at lower temperatures, are corre
spondingly shorter.
   2. A curious technical difficulty arises, and often gives great trouble
where broth is used (or when, at high temperatures, the gelatine
liquefies).   On opening the side windows to rearrange the object for
measurement a slight draught is produced, and a cooling of the
cover-slip ensues ; this causes condensation of the vapour in the cell,
and, if a drop catches the edge of the hanging drop, currents are
produced, and the filament, if short and floating free, may move out
of the field.    Slight and slow movements may be followed, and all go
on as before, but rapid ones are fatal to the purpose.
   3.  Several of the cultures suggest that a period of exhaustion
gradually supervenes as the culture ages ; it remains to be seen how
far this is due to one or other of the following possible causes : (1)
mere using up of the food-materials;              (2) fouling of the drop by
excreta; (3) or by C02 accumulating as the oxygen is consumed in
respiration.

    A somewhat remarkable fact was observed in these July 28
 cultures.     After standing all night at 32- 75°, falling to 26° at 10 a.m.
 on the 29th July, both the cultures had passed over into spores.
    That is to say, at temperatures between 23-5°, rapidly rising to 26°,
 then up to 33° C, slowly falling to 26° again, two cultures passed
through their cycle from spore to spore in twenty-seven hours.
    It would be interesting to investigate the properties of these
spores thus rapidly formed at high temperatures, and compare them
with others.
    It is noteworthy that the culture of July 27, though treated exactly
similarly from 8 a.m. 28th, to 10 a.m. 29th July, had as yet formed
no spores. This latter had grown far more luxuriantly, however
 (at 27-5 on the 27th, see record), and served to show that the higher
temperatures of the 28th culture, though driving the organism to
more rapid spore formation, inhibit the growth, as the curve shows.
It should also be noted that the spores formed were small, and,
in many filame'nte, spars-, though otherwise normal to all appear
ance.
    On July 29, spores, in broth -f 1 per cent. gelatine were started

   In this case the measurements were made with Zeiss C, each scale

    In   resuming the foregoing series, we note that they fully bear out
 the previous conclusions, and are closely comparable with the broth-
 cultures.
    Before proceeding to summarise further, it will be instructive to
 look at a series of experiments made not with spores, but with seg
 ments of filaments transferred bodily to the new media, for measure
 ment.
 D. Experiments with Growing Bacilli and Filaments in Broth +                     1 per
                         cent. Gelatine, and in Broth alone.
    On July 29 I tried the following experiment.                    Spores sown in
 broth + 1 per        cent,  gelatine in a tube were kept in incubator till
 5 p.m. at 25° C. Then I fused the tube end, and thoroughly shook up
 the filaments to break them into segments. A drop was then used to
 infect a new tube, and from this a drop put into a cell and used to
 see  if  the growth measurements would correspond.
    An excellent rod, 24' 75 ft long, was easily found in the drop at
 5.7 p.m.      Giving this a little time to recover the shock of the
 violent shaking, and to accommodate itself to the temperature,
 food material, &c.,      I  proceeded to measure it, noting that it began
 to grow at once, as follows : —
     Time.        Length.       Interval.      Growth.        Rate.         Temp.
                                  mins.                                       °C.

   A   very slow, but distinctly perceptible growth.
   The regular measurements were then begun at 5.30                  p.m.
   Normal doubling periods : —
    1. 29 -25—58 -5  n = 5.30 P.m.— 6.15  p.m.  -  45 minutes at 26—25 -8—26° C.

   It  is clear that the rate of growth is the same, under the same
conditions, as for the filaments normally germinated out from the
spores, a point of some importance, as it may perhaps permit an
extension of the method in several directions, besides a considerable
saving of time.

    It  seems to me that a good deal of valuable         information might  be
 obtained by pursuing this method.
    On July 30     I    repeated this experiment with a rodlet from a two
 days'   culture  at    23 — 25°, shaken in its own liquor and then into
fresh (broth + 1 per cent. gelatine in both cases). It was started at
 3.25 at 24° C., and remained till 4 p.m. to accommodate itself to the
 new conditions, the temperature having risen to 24-6°.

    I  concluded that no growth occurred either (1) because it took a
 long time for bacilli beginning to pass over into spore formation
to accommodate themselves ; or (2) because the change of tempera
ture was too sudden ; or (3) because something was passed in of the
nature of a poison. The shaken tube had remained some hours,
and no bacilli in the drop were growing at 5 p.m.
    On July 31 a broth + 1 per cent. gelatine tube, sown 8 a.m. on
July 30, was shaken up after having been till 12.30 at 23 — 24° C. —
i.e., 28^ hours — and a sowing made.
    The temperature in Sachs' box was 20-5°, and rose as follows

     If  we now summarise all these results, it is seen that there are
 three points to be considered as regards the growth and behaviour of
 the organism, (1) The rate of germination : (2) the rapidity of post-
 germinal growth, — or, what is here the same thing, doubling period,
 and (3) the time occupied in completing the life-cycle from spore to
 spore.      The labour involved in making out all these points accurately
 would      be enormous, and        I   have only been able to concentrate my
 attention on the growth curves, and to go accurately into the doub
  ling periods ; though, as we see, some interesting data are given con
  cerning the other phenomena, wherever they could be noted.
      Secondly, it will be seen that while paying especial attention to the
 one point — the influence of temperature on the doubling period — I
  had occasion to test to some extent the effects of altering the medium
  in which the growth occurs, and the results are sufficient to show
  that here, again, there is a large and interesting field for enquiry.
      Thirdly, the question arose as to whether any difference is
  observable between the behaviour of filaments, grown direct from the
  spore, in a given medium at a given temperature, and those grown
 from a segment of greater age; and althongh here again the enormous

                 Report on the Bacteriology of Water.                 429
labour involved would be too great to charge myself with at present,
sufficient facts came to hand to show that this branch of the enquiry
also ought to be taken up and pursued.
    Fourthly, the point arose by the way how far the doubling period
at a given temperature, and in a given medium, is affected by
whether the filament measured has developed all along, — i.e., had
germinated — at the temperature of the growth measurements, or
whether germination was conducted at some other temperature, and
the growing filament then brought into the new temperature.
    A fifth point arises by the way also. How far is the matter
affected by the age of the food-medium ?
                       Curves of the Doubling Periods.
    If we plot out the results reached    so far, some interesting curves
can be obtained which help us materially.
    Taking any series — say the" cultures in weak gelatine — the averages
 of all the doubling periods obtained for the several temperatures
may be plotted on ordinates erected on a base line divided into
degrees centigrade, and on joining the points thus plotted we get a
curve convex to the base line. As a matter of fact, however, the curve
so obtained from averages of all doubling periods is very irregular,
and all that one can say is that, (1) generally speaking, the curve
 descends from somewhat high numbers below 18° C., to the lowest
 numbers between 25 — 30°, and then ascends again.
    2. The various jerks on this curve are unequal, and without any
evident order, and the re-ascent of the curve beyond 30° C. is not
always obtained.
    3. On the whole the curve descends       most for broth, and least for
 weak gelatine.
    It  seems hardly  worth while to go more into details, since it was
 so evident that something had to be explained here, before further
steps could be taken, that I made a careful analysis of all the condi
tions, and found that the irregularities on these curves of all averages
 were due to a number of more or less controllable causes.
    In the first place, it turns out that it -was a serious error on my
part to start the germination of the spores in the Sachs' box at
 various convenient temperatures with reference to the temperatures
 of observation, and many of the irregularities in question are due to
 the consequent (1) differences in initial vigour of the plantlets
 started at different temperatures, (2) differences in phase of growth
 of such rodlets, and (3) differences in degree of exhaustion of the
 food-material in the drops, which had thus been exposed for different
 lengths of time to different initial temperatures.
    It is hardly necessary to go into the details of this very complex

 430         Profs. Percy Frankland and Marshall Ward.
 matter, which     I had to test in various ways before deciding      on a
 satisfactory plan — for it must be borne in mind that one has to so
 arrange matters that the necessary phase of growth shall occur at a
 time convenient for observation and measurement, otherwise it would
 be imperative on one to be ready to take the measurable phase at any
 hour of the day or night — it may therefore suffice to say that further
 reflection on all the circumstances suggests that the following con
 ditions would have to be fulfilled before satisfactory results could be
 obtained.   It will be obvious that some of these conditions can not
 be completely satisfied, so that observers will have to be content to
approach them as nearly as possible.        I give the ideas as they arise,
but perhaps other investigators can suggest improvements.
    1. The temperatures employed should be constant, and this condi
tion can be so nearly approached that we may regard practice as
according with theory. The difficulties have been sufficiently dis
cussed as they arose.
    2. The food-material and medium employed should be constant.
 This condition can also be approximately carried out, because although
 (1) the water-contents of the hanging-drop vary at different teni-
peratures, and (2) no food-medium remains exactly the same from
day to day, however carefully prepared and kept, considerable
 accuracy can be attained.       This difficulty cannot be got over by
 using a fresh brew each time, because no two brews can be exactly
alike. With great care, the nearest approximation to uniformity
must be aimed at.
   3. The spores used must be from the same culture.          This can be
realised, and, apart from theoretical differences as the age of spores
increases, we may regard this condition as satisfied.
   4. The culture-cells used must be prepared in the same way, and
be loaded with the same water supply, and havethe same air-contents.
 Practically this condition is also met.
   5. The culture-drops should always be of the same size, and supply
equal amounts of food-materials.       Here we cannot do more than
approximate as closely as possible   to  the requirements, though much
can be done by practice, using the same loop, and so on.
   6. Strictly speaking, the drop ought always to contain the same
number of spores — preferably, no doubt, one spore — but it would be
impossible to meet this condition exactly, in working with large
numbers of cultures, as I have to do, and so approximation only can
be hoped for.     I regard the matter of importance, however, for it is
impossible   to overlook the probability — amounting to all but cer
        —
tainty that each filament is to some extent an antagonist to all its
neighbours : competing with them for oxygen, water, and food-
materials, and, no doubt, affecting the medium injuriously as its
metabolism proceeds.       With great care and long practice it is

                    Report on tlie Bacteriology of Water.               431
possible to make the sowings approximately uniform — say 12 — 25
spores in each drop. More can hardly be hoped for.
    7. The spores ought always to be germinated out at the same
constant temperature, though beyond the confirmation of the fact that
some temperatures favour germination better than others, my ex
periments throw little light or further details on this matter.     I select
22° C. as a useful temperature.
    8. It seems probable from        the foregoing that the germinated
culture ought always to be transferred to the temperature, &c,
at which the growth is to be examined at the same age, so that the
filaments to be compared, as to their growth-curves under the new
conditions, shall have been exposed to uniform conditions for the
same period of time previous to the study of the new reactions, and
so that we may always select filaments of equal length and age from
the spore, for comparison.        This is undoubtedly a difficult condition
to fulfil, and    I have by no means always succeeded in fulfilling it,
because it requires that the investigator shall be able to begin his
work at any stated times.
    9. Lastly comes the question of what we shall compare            on the
growth-curves.       The outcome of the experiments given suggests that
it may not be sufficient to compare any two doubling periods, as has
been done.      Probably it would be better to decide to compare either
(1)    the doubling of equal lengths — e.g., the elongation from 100 to
         —
200 ft at the given temperature, &c, or (2) the doubling period
starting always at the same age — e.g., whatever the length of the
filament after one hour's sojourn at the given temperature, see
how long it takes to double that length.        Clearly we cannot do both
with the same series of cultures, though perhaps the ideal to be aimed
at is that both be done eventually. Looking at the importance of the
subject, it seems worth while to throw out the suggestion at any rate.
    The following set of cultures in normal gelatine show very clearly
that excellent and clear results are to be obtained by observing the
above precautions as closely as possible, and adopting the method of
recording now to be described.
    1. The culture, when put into the Sachs' box, is allowed half-an-
hour for the organism to accommodate itself to the new temperature.
    2. The first doubling period selected is that starting from the half-
hour accommodation just mentioned, and all previous growth (i.e.,
growth during the accommodation period) is neglected. I term these
doubling periods " normal doubling periods," in contradistinction to
the foregoing doubling periods selected anywhere on the curves.
    3.  If we plot out these normal doubling periods, as already described
(Curves AB, CD, and EF), we obtain a much more regular curve,
which, as will be seen, comes evidently into the category of respira
tion curves.

432            Profs. Percy Frankland and Marshall Ward.
   On examining these three curves, AB, CI), and EF,* we see that —
   1. The general tendency of the weak gelatine — i.e., poor in food
materials but stiff in consistency (Curve AB) — is to lengthen the
doubling period.
   2. That considerable irregularities occur at all the temperatures
higher than about 24° C. or 25° C. These are no doubt due to the
inequalities in the phase of growth, different ages of the culture, and
so on, already discussed.
   3.  It  looks as if the curve suddenly shot up at temperatures beyond
31—32° C, as shown by the curve for broth (CD ).
   4. It might, perhaps, be suggested that although the addition of
gelatine delays the doubling period, it also delays the attainment of
the maximum temperature, i.e., it protects the food-drop against
exhaustion, until a higher temperature than that at which exhaustion
sots in when broth alone is used.             This may be the case, but       I  do
not regard it as proved, and there are many difficulties with broth -
cultures at higher temperatures, as already said.
   But (5) it is clear that these three curves, unsatisfactory though
they are as yet in detail, show striking general resemblances to a
curve of respiratory activity — the steady fall in the doubling period
as we pass from lower temperatures, and the sud den rise again beyond
31° C. (seen in the broth curve) being very suggestive — and             I believe
that is what they really are, for reasons already discussed.
   Having so far cleared th e way for the understanding of these
curves, we shall see that when attention is carefully given to all the
points discussed, a much more regular curve is obtained, as the
following series show.
  *   Curve  AB  summarises the averages for weak    gelatine ; CD, those for broth
 + 1 per cent. gelatine ; EF, those for broth alone. The ordinates are minutes and
the abscissa temperatures.

   In the following series I used throughout the same normal gelatine
— 10 per cent. gelatine, with broth and peptone— and always incubated
the spores at 22° C. until germination was completed and the rodlets
                                                         I
in full growth. As far as possible, moreover, started the growth-
measurements on filaments in exactly the same phase of growth, and
used drops of as nearly as possible the same size, and containing the
same number of spores, though it was found to be quite impracticable
to fulfil all these conditions absolutely.
   The arrangements — Sachs' box, cells, temperature regulations, and
conditions of measurement— were as before.
   I select a number of typical curves from a moch larger number,
and need only say that they are quite representative and fair examples.
The labour of recording the growths, working out the tables, and
drawing the curves has been very great, as will readily be understood ;
but it seems worth while to have done it to get the insights here
obtained into the marvellous regularity of growth that goes on when
the conditions are under control, quite apart from the other informa
tion conveyed by the results.
    Still, it will be obvious that it has been impossible to carry out
more than one series so thoroughly in the time, and it must remain
for others to investigate the behaviour of the organism in other
media or under other conditions similarly controlled.

        54—108 n = 7.42 p.m.— 9.4 p.m. = 82 minutes at 21 -9° C.
       108-216 „ = 9.4    „ —10.31    „   = 87    „       21 -9—21 -8—21 -9° C.
    The foregoing cultures and their growth-curves are extremely-
 interesting and instructive, especially because the temperatures were
 fortunately so constant.
    As we see, the normal doubling period at 21-6° — 21 -4° was sixty-one
 minutes in the first case, where the germination period occupied five
 and a quarter hours, but it was seventy-two minutes (at 21-75 — 21-9°)
 in the second case, with a germination period of five hours and a
 shorter filament. The question arises, Why did the second culture
 occupy eleven minutes longer in doubling its shorter filament,
 although it had been exposed a quarter of an hour less time to the
 22° C. of germination, and although the temperature was nearer the
 optimum by 0-3° to 0 25° C. ?
    I  think the explanation is that the temperatures further from the
 optimum were brought to bear at an earlier stage on a relatively
 weaker plant, and the latter therefore coped less ably with the more
 unfavourable circumstances.
    Turning again to the second culture, it is worth noting that its
 second normal doubling period, at perfectly constant temperature, be it
 noted, is distinctly longer than its own first one —eighty-two minutes
 against seventy-two — bearing out my previous remarks as to the
 gradual slowing of growth as the culture ages, and, no doubt, due to
 the slow exhaustion of the food-materials and fouling of the medium
 by products of metabolism.

    A   curious phenomenon is often observed in these stiff gelatine
cultures at temperatures near 23 — 24° C. This is the neighbourhood
of the melting point, and it sometimes happens that as the drop meto
the rate of growth rises quite sharply ;                I  explain this as due to the
sudden access of more oxygen and available food-materials to the
rudlets.

   The following case is a very interesting one. It will be noticed
that a drop of KHO was put into the arm of the cell. I was experi
menting at the time to see if              I  could detect any difference by
removing     what    traces    of COa    diffuse  into the cell as fast as they
form, but the results were negative in that connection. Incidentally,
however, it turned out that the drop of strong KHO often caused a
slight dry skin to form on the gelatine drop when first put into the
higher temperature, the skin being visible by faint wrinkles in it,
and this affects the growth of the organism, possibly by impeding
oxygen access. After the drop had melted, all went on quite normally,
as we see, and there is no reason to reject the curve as an illustrative
one.
   On November 10 spores were sown at 10.30 in 10 per cent. gelatine
and put into 22° C. A drop of KHO was put in the arm of the cell.
At 3.35 the culture was put into Sachs' box at 27-5° C. The opened
box fell to 25° C, but recovered to 27° C. at 3.45.
    The filament selected did not grow very straight at first, but
straightened out later and did well ; it was also abnormal in some
 way, having one joint swollen, but recovered eventually, and after
 three-quarters of an hour or so behaved quite normally, and the
question arose (answered above), had the KHO any effect ?

  A   scrutiny of these two tables does not bring out any increase
generally in the doubling period during the third to fifth hours of
exposure to these temperatures, as compared with the first hour but                                               ;
the second table suggests that each doubling takes a slightly longer
time to effect. It may be that the temperature    not sufficiently far                   is
from the optimum to show any great slowing effect in such short
periods.
   Next morning there was a very good crop in the hanging drop, left
at 26-5 — 27-5° all night, and this supports the above suggestions.

mained at 22° C. till p.m., then into box at 29° C.

growth after five hours' exposure to the temperatures given ; i.e.. the

   The most interesting feature in this curve was to see how a steady
slow rise of temperature did not prevent a second doubling at nearly
the maximum speed.             I  was not able to measure any further, but
saw enough to convince me that the organism was breaking down
soon after from exhaustion.
   On November 7 spores were sown in normal 10 per cent. gelatine
at 1 p.m., and put into incubator at 22° C. At 5.30 the germinated
rodlets went into the Sachs' box at 30° C, and at 5.54 the measure
ments began as follows : —

    Further examination of this culture brought out very clearly the
difficulties of these high temperatures.     I started measurements at
6.28, 7.58, and 8.23 p.m. respectively, but each had to be abandoned
after less than a quarter of an hour, owing to the excessive dilution,
due     to the powerful absorption of water by the (melted) gelatine
drop, which induced currents and floated the rodlets away.
    The general resnlt was that the longer the culture remained at the
high temperature the slower the growth.        No doubt the dilution was
largely responsible    for this, but another  cause may have been the
slowing action of the high temperatures, taking time to act on the
filaments.
    It is by no means improbable, comparing all one has observed of
these cultures at high temperatures, that the bacterium goes through
a grand period of growth, i.e., it begins growing slowly, attains a
maximum, and then slows down again until fully outgrown.             This
being so, the total length of bacterium obtained (which, in other
words, represents its total crop, or dry weight) will depend on the
following factors : —
    1.   The amount of available food material.         I
                                                  This cannot measure,
because it is not necessarily the amount of broth, or gelatine, &c, but
the amount of peptonised materials, &c, it can get from the medium.
    2. The temperature.     At the optimum it metabolises, and grows.
and respires, &o., at its best ; but at higher temperatures l-emoved
from that it may grow for a short time more rapidly, but sooner
exhausts itself, and so produces a poorer crop in the end.      This cer
tainly seems to be the case with these high temperature cultures,
for    I  never get anything like so large a crop at 30 — 35° C. as at
    —
22 25° C., other things being equal. Moreover, it seems clear that
though the growth may for a short time be as rapid as it is near the
optimum, it soon slows down (e.g., compare November 5 experiments).
All this suggests that at temperatures above the optimum, the
machinery of the cell is being worked at too high a speed, and comes
to grief sooner or later.      How far this is due simply to over-respi
ration and rapid exhaustion of the oxygen in the medium, or to
inability to peptonise or digest the food-materials, or other causes, it
is impossible to say with certainty. Probably the matter is extremely
complex, however.
    3. The amount of water in the medium.             I   have repeatedly
 pointed out my suspicion that variations in the growth result from
 variations in the precipitation or absorption of water in the culture-
 cells. It is not easy to trace the effects to mere dilution of the
food materials, however, and it is quite possible that in all cases
 slight, but perceptible, changes of temperature accompany these
 evaporations and precipitations, <fco. In some cases, at any rate, the
 dilution is traced to precipitations due to slight draughts, causing

cooling of the cover-slips, so that here, at any rate, the effect is at
least in part due to temperature.

    We see that the growth had become very much slower, and at last
had all but ceased.     At 8.30 next morning the short crop had begun
to try to form a few feeble spores ; two control cultures, at 22° C.
all the time, had grown more evenly, and developed a crop probably
100 times as big, and had not yet passed over into the spore stage,
though they did so during the succeeding forty-eight hours, and then
represented a far larger crop, with much more numerous and well-
developed spores.
    Further criticism of these November 7 experiments confirms the
conclusions already arrived at. *? hus, during the first hour at 29-5,
 rising to 32-6° C, and therefore at the large range of 3-6° C. the
 donbling nevertheless only took twenty-nine minutes ; whereas after
 three hours at similar temperatures, 29-0 — 32-25° (a range of 3-25) it
 had not anything like doubled in two hours, i.e., the time of exposure
to this range tells by slowing the doubling period.

  This filament was then left for over half an hour, the temperature
continuing the slow but steady rise already seen to have set in, and
on resuming the observations it had broken up in a manner very
characteristic of such cultures.  Since I have not as yet described
any of these cases — which occur quite commonly, however —                         I    pro
pose to enter into the details of this one, as an instructive                           and
typical example.
  When the filament was measured at 4.6 it showed a slight angular
bend near the middle, like this                                     ,   the segment       a
being 85'5 ft long and 6 94-5 ft long — total length 180, as registered
in the table ; when left at 4.15 a had grown to 95 ft and b to 107-5 ft
— total 202-5 ft as seen.
   On resuming the measurements at 4.50 several interesting changes
 in length and position were observable. The segments a and 6 had
separated,      and grown across one another as seen     in the- accompanying
diagram.
   Not only so, but a had bent at nearly a right angle into two seg
ments — a short one, a', and a long one,      — measuring 45
                                                   /3'          and                ft

                                                         8,                               ft
altogether, but really consisting of a piece of empty sheath — not
 represented   in the diagram — and     piece of solid and normal-
                                         a
 looking filament, the latter measured 14 u, and the connecting

piece of empty sheath 8-5 ft. In fact, the disjointing segment S had
 contracted away in its sheath from the parent filament 7.  During the
 next five minutes the bit of sheath disappeared, and the rodlet began
growing again as an independent segment.
   Now, it is perfectly feasible to measure all these portions of the
original filament, only, of course, it takes two or three minutes to
accomplish the necessary movements of the culture — to bring the
various segments at angles under the scale — and to turn the eye
piece and read off the measurements.         Consequently, one has to
record the mean time of measurement, and a corresponding slight
lack of accuracy results in the curves.

  It  is evident that even if we allow a wido margin for errors,
the curve and tables show that the period of breaking up of the fila
ment coincides with a period of slowing of the growth, i.e., the high.
temperature was beginning to tell on the growth, and the fourth
doubling period was nearly twice as long as the preceding ones.
  This accords very well with the experiment of November 7, where
the first doubling period was twenty-nine minutes, but that of a later
rod in the same culture was found to be over 120 minutes, fully
bearing out the conclusions there arrived at, namely, that the tem
perature begins to tell after a longer or shorter time.
   This culture had broken up into short separate segments of two to
five cells each at 10 p.m.     = 31-5), and on December at a.m.,
                                      (t.                         3    9
had formed a few feeble spores here and there, while many empty
bits of sheath were seen. The sister culture kept at 22° all the time
was now a fine normal crop of long-coiled tresses, and must have
measured several thousand times the lengths of the starved-looking
crop above described. Nevertheless, the drop of gelatine in the 22° C.
culture was certainly no bigger than that at the higher temperatur-,
but,   anything, a little smaller.
      if                            These cultures alone were sufficient
to convince me that        not a question of quantity of food-materials
                            it   is
originally given.
   On November    spores were sown at
                    5                    a.m. in 10 per cent. normal
                                                9
gelatine, and kept at 22° C. until 3.10, when the germinated fila
ments were put into the Sachs' box, which stood at 35° C.
  A filament was selected measuring 40-5         with the following
                                                     ft
results.  It must be remembered that this first series of measure
ments was made during the period of accommodation to the high
temperature, and while the box — necessarily opened for arrangement
—was recovering from the consequent lowering of the temperature.
Variations of temperature are much more difficult to control as they
get higher.
  The filaments in this normal gelatine show their septa much more
sharply than in broth, and, as we see, grow fairly rapidly at these
temperatures.
  The curve shows that the doubling period here was: —

                       Report on the Bacteriology of Water.                     453
    Normal doubling period : —
       58-5— 117-0 M = 3.40 p.m.— 4.9 p.m.    = 29 minutes at 35 -5— 33 -75° C.
       40 -5— 81 -0 „ = 3.20 „ — 3.55     „   =35       „     32— 35 '5— 34-3° C.
    Calculated back      : —
       14175—70    -8 n = 3.48 p.m.— 4.15 p.m.= 27 minutes at 34 5— 33-25° C.
    I.e., with a range of 3-5° C. it took 35 minutes to double, whereas
 with a range of 1-25° C. it only took 27 minutes.
    But we must scrutinise cautiously these results with varying high
 temperatures acting on a culture in process of accommodation.
    At 4.28 another filament was selected, and this was showing the slight
 but distinct writhing movements so often seen at high temperatures.
 The movement was especially noticeable in a segment, about 20 //
 long, which was slowly bending backwards and forwards, and which
 had broken off, when 22-5 ft long, at 4.50 : since it remained close to
 the parent segment, however, it was easily measurable with it.
    This had to be abandoned now, the measurements becoming too
 difficult. The rate of growth was fairly rapid, and the length was
doubled as follows       : —
     126—252 n = 4.28 p.m.— 5.4 p.m. = 36 minutes at 34 -75—35—34—35°         0.
Which — taken with the preceding — shows that strong plants, once
germinated out, can stand these high temperatures (even varying)
very well for a time, though their growth is correspondingly irregular.
    This last point is even more evident from the following, however.
The culture was left at 35° — varying a little to either side — till 8 p.m.,
and another rodlet selected and measured, as follows : —
    A.nd on analysing the doubling periods we find a considerable
retardation, evidently due to the variations in growth at the high
temperatures.
   Doubling periods : —
67-5—   135 n = 8.19 p.m.— 9.13 p.m. = 54 minutes at 35  4— 34-25— 37 5—35     -5° C.
    Calculated back     : —
166 -5—83 -25 n = 8.35 p.m.— 9.31 p.m. = 56 m. at 34 -25—37 -5—35 -25—37 -75° 0.
   It  should be noted that the drop became copiously diluted after an
hour or so, by absorbing water, and the longer doubling period
(36 minutes with a range of 1° C.) from 4.28 onwards is possibly
referable to this rather than the age of the rodlet ; though              I  think
the latter fact of importance, as we shall see.
   On examining these curves of November 5 — all from one culture be
it remembered — we find that when first put in the doubling took
35 minutes, at 32 — 35-5° a range of 3-5° ; whereas the part growing
at 33 25 — 34 5° (a range of l-5°) only took 27 minutes, whence may

454          Profs. Percy Frankland and Marshall Ward.
be   inferred that the slowing was due to either (1) lack of accom
modation, or (2) the greater variation of temperature.
    Then we find, after       hours at the temperatures given, the doub
ling took 36 minutes at 34 to 35° — a range of l°C. only — which
certainly suggests that it is the temperature, and not the range
which is effective in slowing the growth.
    Next — same culture, but having now been 5 hours at these
temperatures — we find 54 and 56 minutes respectively necessary to
double the length at 34V25 to 37-75° C, a range of 3-5°; and since the
same range was experienced by the first filament mentioned, but
which was measured during the first hour or so of exposure to these
temperatures, we can no longer doubt that the slowing is due to
the gradual effect of the temperature, and not to the range.
    This means that at the temperatures given the rate of growth
gradually slows, and the grand curve takes a shorter shape, and, on
consulting the previous series of curves, the same fact becomes
apparent.
    On November 9 spores were sown at 11.30 a.m. in 10 per cent.
gelatine, and put in at 22° C. ; at 6 p.m. they had germinated to
filaments over 100 /3 long, and the culture was put into Sachs' box at
36—37° C.
    In order to see if any body, such as C03, caused or hastened the
running down of the culture,          I put a little KHO solution in one arm
of the cell, next    the cotton-wool plug.*           This was suggested by the
experiments    of  November     7,  and   previous    observations on the extra
ordinary irregularities and slowing of the growth at these high
temperatures.

which    I measured by itself (see below).

    On resuming the measurements at 8.30, 1 found considerable growth
still going on, but the filaments floated about so in the now diluted
gelatine, that it was not till after 10 p.m. that I succeeded in fixing
one, as follows.            Moreover, the temperature had risen considerably
 (to 39° C),       a fact     which makes the following measurements only the

   The filament had gradually        acquired the granulated appearance
which comes on when dying.
   It will be noted that this curve is more depressed than the pre
ceding, and that it has nothing like doubled itself in the hour ; still,
it is, perhaps, remarkable that growth occurred at all.
   Here, again, we find that during the first hour of exposure to even
higher temperatures than on November 5 and 7, it only took twenty-
seven minutes to double the length at 36 — 37-5° C, a range of 1-5° C.
(cf. November 5, at a range of 1-25°), or at 35-5° to 36-5° (a range of
1° C), whereas during the second hour of exposure it took thirty-one
minutes to double, though the range of temperature was only 0-75° to
0-9° C, i.e., from 35— 35 9° and from 35—3575° C.
   The matter is rendered the more interesting by what occurred
during the fifth hour of exposure (10.18 to 11.20 p.m.), for we find
that in sixty-two minutes the filament had not accomplished even
half the doubling, but had slowly ceased to grow at all.
   It is true, this last case taken alone is open to the objection that
the temperature rose so high (35-5 — 39°), but, taken in conjunction
                                                 I
with the experience of November 5 and 7, think it is important.
   Moreover, this experiment of November 9 does not support the
suggestion that the gradual slowing is due to the accumulation of
CO3, or any volatile body inhibitive of the growth and absorbable by
KHO. Of course it does not disprove any such hypothesis, but it
shows that the slowing is not a mere matter of CO' accumulation,
and (considering the capacity of my cells and all the conditions) it
can hardly be a mere starvation of oxygen supply.
   The results point to intense destructive metabolism, possibly
respiratory, as the cause of death, and suggests that the high tem
peratures over-work the machinery of the cells, and, no doubt, the
irregular, jerky growth shown on the curves is an expression of this.
At the same time, it is not impossible that the highly stimulated
organism is here so extremely sensitive to minute changes in the
environment that these sudden variations are, in part, due to altera
tions not recorded.

   At 8.34 the filament had curved badly, and began breaking up, and
at 8.49 it was broken into several writhing curved segments, difficult
to measure. At 8.51 all growth had ceased, and by y.5 the broken
fragments were becoming granular, the temperature meanwhile
having gone up to over 39° C.
   On December 3 spores sown at 9 a.m., normal gelatine, at 22° C,
were put into measurement at temperatures near 39 — 40° C. at
9.15 p.m.      On opening the Sachs' box the temperature fell from
39-75° to 35°, and had to work up again with some difficulty, as the
opening of the side windows, &c, has more effect at these high tem

   At    10.39    the filament, growing no longer, sharply contracted to
 117 ft, and passed over into the granular condition which indicates
 death.
   This case is interesting, because it evidently marks the limit of
 possible growth of this bacillus as nearly as possible. The specimen
 was a very vigorous one, and there was no reason why it should not
 have gone on growing vigorously for some time yet at temperatures
 near the optimum, and, indeed, we see it began growing at a pretty
 good rate ns the temperatnre rose to 39 — 406 from 9.15 to 9.35, and
thence the curve depressed more and more, and the doubling period
 became prolonged to         infinity.

               Some of the experiments show that the growth          still very slow at                                   is

             observations begin to bo more definite near 14° C, and we may put
             the normal doubling period at not far from 200 minutes.

    Passing on from this point the doubling periods fall to about 100
minutes near 16° C, and the shape of the curve now begins to be
apparent (see Curve G H) ; about 70 to 80 minutes near 18°, 60 to
 70 minutes near 20°, falling to 50 minutes near 22°, and about 40
minutes near 24° C. to 26° C, 35 to 30 minutes near 28—30° C., and
this rate of growth may be kept up, for a short time at any rate, at
all temperatures thence to 36° or 37° C., but with certain complica
tions to be referred to shortly.
    It may be inferred from the facts, that growth occurs, at a very slow
rate, at some minimum temperature near 5° or 6° C., and that
starting just beyond an infinitely long period, the doubling period at
the minimum temperature occupies many hundreds of minutes,
rapidly shortening for each degree as we raise the temperature to
 12 — 15°, and falling more slowly at each step as the temperature
 becomes more favourable.
    It never seems to fall below about thirty minutes, however (the
lowest recorded for a post-germinal filament is twenty-seven minutes),
 and we may therefore assume that at the quickest rate, cell-division
demands thirty minutes or so for its completion — for it will be con
ceded that the doubling period of a filament is the expression of the
time occupied by a complete cell-division and growth, since it is
evident from the uniform length of the cells that when the filament
is twice as long as at first, it has twice as many cells in it.
    Now the experiments show over and over again that at higher
temperatures — i.e., temperatures beyond 25 — 26° C. — this minimum
doubling period is only approached during the early stages of the
growth at the given temperature, and when we reach temperatures
near 30° C. and beyond, the filaments occupy fifty or sixty or even
more nr-nutes to complete a second or third doubling, and after a
time fail to complete the period if the high temperature is main
tained.
   In other words, these high temperatures gradually tell on the
power of the organism to maintain its best rate of growth, and the
doubling period gets longer and longer the further the temperature
is beyond the optimum.      The optimum temperature thus comes to be
that temperature at which the organism can longest maintain its
ability to double its length (or, which is the same thing, complete its
cell-divisions) in the shortest time, and so turn the maximum amount
of food-materials into cell-substance — or, crop. This optimum tem
perature is 25° C. to 28° C., or very near these, as the curves show.
   The maximum temperature, therefore, is not a fixed point, until
we approach 39° to 40° C., beyond which no growth seems possible ;
but it differs according to the length of time the organism has been
exposed to the high temperature.
    Thus, it frequently occurs that a first doubling period is completed

 at even 35° or 8(5° C, in the minimum time — i.e., thirty minutes or
 so — but the second doubling of the same filament will require a longer
 time, and the third may occupy nearly twice as long, and so on, as is
 well seen from the curves of November 5.
    Another way of putting it is the following— the higher the tern-
 perature (up to the limit) is above the optimum the sooner the total
growth of the organism is completed, but as the rate of this growth
 does not increase beyond that of the thirty minutes doubling period,
 the total length of the filament produced is proportionately less than
would have been produced nearer the optimum, i.e., the total crop is
a smaller one.
    As I understand     this action of temperature

organism, and not a mere exhaustion of the food-medium             and                 ;         I
suppose that in like manner the action of the blue rays of light is
similarly on the organism, and not merely on the food. medium.
    But    by no means follows that the food medium
          it                                              totally exempt        is
from oxidation under the action of both temperature and light; and
in the case of such extremely oxidisable media as peptone-meat-
broth, and similar compounds, the constitution     which approaches a*of
near to the bodies concerned in metabolism as any media physiologists
have been able to prepare, we must not be surprised to find that they
undergo oxidation outside, as well as inside the living cells, especially
when enzymes are present, under the action of light and high tem
peratures.
   Many of the experiments point to this conclusion, and        is par               it
ticularly to   be noticed that the food-medium seems to bocome more
and more snbjeet to such oxidations — promoted        high temperatures  by
or by light  —  when the action of the peptonising enzymes, which they
excrete,     in full swing, as
             is                  the whole system— cell plus its pepto-

  It will,    think, be worth while to institute a careful series of

condition more like the one in which it enters into the constitution of the
living substance than any other organic substance we know — or at any
rate that we can prepare and use outside the living cell.
   In a certain sense then, it is possibly not absurd to compare the
peptonised broth-drop, in which a bacterium cell is suspended, to a
sort of inverted living cell in which the peptonised food medium
should normally be inside the protoplasmic lining, i.e., in a vacuole. In
other words, we might, perhaps, roughly compare it to a vacuolated
cell turned inside out, a comparison the more justifiable since the
bacterium cell seems to have no obvious vacuole : instead of its assimil
able food solution being clothed by the protoplasm, its protoplasm is
clothed by the assimilable food-solution (of course      I  am neglecting
the cell-membrane, and do not wish to push the analogy too far) in
a highly unstable condition.
   The practical aspects of this are also interesting, for it will rarely
happen that a bacterium cell, or spore, escapes without organic
material clinging to it — a matter of importance even if it were shown
that the action of the light was entirely confined to promoting oxida
tions at the surface of the cells.
    Taking all into account, therefore, it might perhaps be worth
investigation (if methods can be devised) how far some heliotropic
effects and retardations of growth in higher plants, and the retarding
action of light on growth generally, are due to destructive oxidations
in  the cell-sap of highly combustible food-materials at, or just prior to,
the moment they are ready to be assimilated into the living substance of
the protoplasm.
   It might possibly remove some of the difficulties connected with
the theory of heliotropism of non-cellular coeloblasts, if the light
action occurs in vacuoles next the source of illumination — though         I
          I
confess see no way out of the difficulties of so-called negative helio
tropism, on this or any other hypothesis.
   It certainly suggests reasons why so many adaptations occur in
nature to protect fluids, which presumably contain such substances
as 1 have referred to, by colour screens of exactly the kind we should
                            I
expect to be efficient, as have already referred to elsewhere.
   An interesting result follows from the fact that the doubling period
is simply the visible expression of the doubling in length and biparti-
tion of all the cells composing the filament.
    Suppose a filament to be 50 /t long, and composed of ten cells each
5 ft long, and that that filament doubles its length in thirty minutes
at a given temperature : then the filament, now 100 ft long, consists
of twenty cells, each of which has taken thirty minutes to divide and
double itself ; from this we can deduce the number of bacilli formed
in a given time from the doubling periods, although the individual
bacilli are themselves invisible, and when we find a curve like that of
                                                               2 i 2

21 — 23-7°, with an average doubling               period of about thirty-five
minutes, it can be translated as meaning that the number of bacilli
increased   as  follows   : —

and so on, and we may assume that if the supply of food-material
 could be kept constant, and no disturbing conditions set in, this would
 go on.     If it went on for only half a day — twelve hours — there
 would be nearly 4,000,000 of the bacilli produced from the pair
started with above, and the filament would be nearly 40,000,000 ft in
length — i.e., nearly 40 metres — whence some idea may be obtained of
the energy of the growth on the one hand, and of the limits imposed
by the culture-drops on the other ; for if we take the size of a drop as
1 cubic mm., which is approximately            the volume of a hanging drop
such    as is  used    in   the cultures, and    remember that the bacilli in
question are about 1-75 /t in diameter, it will be found that the above
length of 40 metres, nevertheless, has plenty of room in the drop, for
the filaments have a volume of only 96,250,000 cubic ft to pack away
in the 1,000,000,000 cubic /t of the drop, so that we see the latter
 could hold ten times the quantity.
    We are now in a position to resume the discussion of these growth-
 curves in detail, and the action of temperature, &c, on this schizo-
 mycete, with more hope of success.
    It is evident that the normal growth-curve is one which begins to
 rise slowly, and gradually gets steeper and steeper, and then slowly
 rises less and less rapidly until the end.           This gives a curve like a
 long  drawn   out
    At the optimum temperature the growth is very rapid, and lasts
 for a long time, and the organism uses the materials to maximum
 effect and produces from them the maximum amount of its own
 substance — in other words, the largest "crop."
    At temperatures above the optimum, however, the growth, though
 at first as rapid as at the optimum temperature, lasts for a shorter
 and shorter time, according as the temperature is further and further
 removed from the optimum ; consequently, the curve, though equally
 steep in its steepest parts, begins to fall sooner, and growth ceases
  sooner, and the crop obtained from the same amount of original food-
  material is smaller and smaller according as the temperature is higher.

                  Report on the Bacteriology of Water.                          463
  At length     a temperature is reached where the carve is infinitely
short, i.e., no growth occurs at all. This temperature is, however,
above 39° C, and indicates the death-point.
   Taking temperatures below the optimum. There is a point, some
where below 8° C, where the curve is indefinitely postponed, i.e., no
growth can occur at all.      Then comes a temperature, also below
8 — 10° C, where the curve ascends slowly and never attains the
steepness of the curve at optimum temperature. This is the minimum
temperature.
  At temperatures above the minimum the curve attains more and
more nearly, and in shorter and shorter times, to the steepness of the
normal curve, the nearer the temperature in question is to the
optimum temperature.
   This optimum temperature is either 25° C. or some point very
near it.                    •
   The above case of the normal curve is the hypothetical one where
all the conditions are constant, a state of affairs never realised.*
During the growth, between the period when the germination is
completed and the organism no longer obtains any supplies from the
spore, but is totally dependent on the food-materials given        and    it,
the period when the curve begins to ascend less rapidly, there       a          is
period of maximum growth, during which the filament doubles its
length in equal minimum times. This         the critical period of the
                                                is
curve.    The more closely the curve approximates to the normal
curve the longer this phase of equal minimum doubling periods lasts                  ;
the more external conditions affect the curve the shorter this phase
is, and the longer the doubling periods become.
   The factors affecting the curve may be regarded as of two kinds,
internal and external, though they probably never vary entirely
independently.
  The internal factors are such as (1) irregularities of cell-divisions              :
ifa single cell fails to divide in due order, the curve at once affected,
                                                             is
because the regularity of the intercalary growth of the filament                     is
destroyed, and this occasionally happens.    (2) The separation of the
segments  : several observations suggest  that the growth    slowed at
                                                                    is
once when the new surfaces of the broken ends .come in contact with
the food-medium.     (3) Nutations and oscillatory movements, though
possibly these  affect the measurements rather than actual growth.
(4) Unknown internal factors which affect the rapidity of germina
tion, the ability to assimilate the food-materials, and so forth. In
some cases these may be due to pathological conditions, as in the case
given on p. 392.

   The external factors are    :  (1) temperature.     Variations in the
curve are produced by sudden variations in the temperature, and,
apparently, the variations are the more pronounced the quicker the
temperature changes and the more extensive their range ; but the
amount of variation in the curve, due to any given rise or fall of
temperature in constant time, appears to depend on the distance of
the temperature (from which the variation is reckoned) from the
optimum.     In other words, the sensitiveness of the organism to a rise
or fall of a degree centigrade varies according to the temperature
from which the rise or fall occurs, for, if it has been growing at 30° C,
constant temperature, for an hour, it shows a more marked deflection
on the curve for a sudden rise or fall of 1° C. than for the same
sudden rise or fall from 25° C.
    That the variation in rate of growth which has been going on at
any hitherto constant temperature is more pronounced when the rise
or fall is 2° C. than when it is only 1° C. will be obvious, and similarly
for any other range ; but, again, it must be noted that the amount of
deflection of the curve for any range of variation depends on the
mean temperature, or the hitherto constant temperature, at which
the growth has been going on.
    The practical importance of all this on experiments on light is very
great, and the difficulty, amounting almost to impossibility,            of
arranging two cultures differently illuminated (if the sunlight is at
all intense), so that each shall be growing at exactly the same tem
perature during the observations, limits the absolute value of the
determinations, so far as the curve of growth is concerned.
    But there are other points besides (1) the actual temperature when
constant, (2) the suddenness of any rise or fall, and (3) the range of
temperature, referred to above.
    As we have seen, the time during which the organism is exposed
to any given (constant) temperature above the optimum affects the
growth considerably.      The general result of the observations is that
 the higher the temperature is above the optimum the more rapidly the
 organism completes its ./"-shaped curve of growth — i.e., the quicker
 it passes through the phase of maximum rapidity of growth into that
 of cessation — and consequently the smaller the crop produced from a
 given amount of food-materials.
    For instance, if the spores germinate out at 22° C, and are made
 to complete their growth at 30° C, the amount of growth (or, in
 other words, the crop produced) will be much greater if the exposure
 to 30° is delayed till the eighth hour after sowing than if it is made
 at the sixth hour. In both cases the growth at the higher tempera
 ture is at maximum rapidity at first, and then rapidly declines.
  Suppose two cultures at 22° C, the spores having been sown at
  12.0 noon : one is put in at 30° at the sixth hour (6 p.m.) after sowing,

                     Report on    the Bacteriology  of Water.                4C.5
 when the filaments are 20 ft long, the other not until the eighth
 hour (8 p.m.), when 320 ft long. The first will grow at maximum
 rate, or nearly so, for the first hour, and the filaments double their
 length twice during that time, therefore = 80 ft long (at 7 p.m.), and
 then begin to decline ; the second will also double twice in the hour
 (i.e., at 9 p.m.), and therefore be 1280 n long when growth commences
 to decline.
     Suppose during the second hour at 30° C. the doubling period is
 twice as long as during the first hour, then he first culture will have
 its filaments 160 /t long, and the second one 2560 ft long at the finish
 (8 p.m. and 10 p.m. respectively).          If during the third and fourth
 hours the period is again donbled, the first culture at the ond of the
fourth hour (10 p.m.) is 320 ft long, while the second culture (at
 12 P.m.) is 5120 ft, and so on.
     If both had remained at 22° C, and maintained a doubling period
 of, say, thirty minutes through the whole time regarded above (as
 experiments show would be more or less the case), then, supposing
 20 ft to be the length at starting (6 p.m.), it would be 320 ft at the
 end of two hours (8 p.m.), and 1280 ft at the end of the next hour
 (9 p.m.), corresponding to the first hour at 30° above, 5120 ft at the
end of the next hour (10 p.m.), and 81,920 ft after two hours more
 (i.e., 12 p.m.).
     That is to say, at the more favourable temperature of 22° C* the
filaments would attain a length of 81,920 ft in the same time as they
take to reach 5120 ft, or even 320 ft, if their last four hours or so are
spent at the higher unfavourable temperature.
     No doubt the ideal case given could not be actually realised, but
 there can be no question that an approximation to it is what occurs,
and the matter resolves itself into this : — At temperatures above the
optimum the organism cannot get as much out of the nutrient
materials as it can at temperatures near the optimum or below it,
evidently because there is some more or less enormous waste of energy
expended in doing something which no longer contributes to the
nutrition of the protoplasm, and this the more the higher the tem
perature.       To say that the respiration is rendered too intense in
proportion to the constructive metabolism is, no doubt, true, so far
as it goes ; but this does not explain the probably complex matter
beyond a certain as yet unsatisfactory point.
     There is one aspect of the matter worth noting.              I imagine no
physiologist would allow that the destructive waste of energy going
on here has its seat solely in the food-materials, but would agree that
it is in the protoplasm of the ceil ; this is of importance, because we
must conclude that some presumably similar waste of energy goes on

at temperatures otherwise suitable for growth when light rays at the
blue-violet end of the spectrum act on the growing cells or the
spores.
    Unless     it can  be shown that the      high temperature kills the organism
by acting on its food-medium outside the cell, the above is an argument
against any such simple explanation of the action of the blue-violet
rays, especially since experiments with other plants point to similar
destructive actions of such rays in cases where no question of a bath
ing food-solution can be raised- — unless we choose to regard the sap
in the vacuole of a living cell as such a bathing medium, as indeed it
is, in a sense. It would probably, however, seem a strange proposal
in the present condition of plant-physiology to refer the inimical
actions of light solely to reactions of the cell sap — though the
possibility could perhaps not be denied.
    (2.) The second external factor to be considered is light.
    The experiments show beyond all cavil that light-rays of higher
refrangibility bring about the death of the spores at all temperatures
worth consideration ;* in this case the curve of growth does not
come into account.             The evidence also shows that these rays depress
the otherwise normal curve; but the difficulties begin here, because
we have no means of expressing the intensity of the light used in
terms similar to those used in reference to temperature.
    It is proved that a light of low intensity, passing through screens
which transmit only blue-violet rays, kills the young filaments at low
temperatures, which in the absence of these rays does not injure the
filaments at all. It is also proved that these light-rays at even
higher and more favourable temperatures, seriously retard the growth
of more advanced filaments, so that their curve is much more de
pressed than the curve of similar filamonts at the same temperature
but protected from the blue-violet rays.
    When the temperatures are very favourable to growth, however, it
is often difficult to determine quantitatively the effect of the light-
rays on the curve of growth. because the latter can only be observed
for a period too short for the effect of the light action to be mensur
able ; even in these cases, however, the curve is frequently seen to
be commencing its depression towards the end of the observation
period, and the cultures exposed to the light are seen to be deficient
in crop or in spore-production subsequently.
    At temperatures above the optimum it is extremely difficult to
judge of the damage due to the light apart from injury due to the
temperature, but the general conclusion seems likely that high tem
peratures act so much more rapidly than the light that most of the
 disastrous effects are due to the former.
    * I.e., it  is no use disc ussing              known to be dangerous on their own
                                      temperatures
 account.

                   Report on the Bacteriology   of Water.            467
   From all this it must be inferred        that temperatures from the
minimum to the optimum are antagonistic to the injurious light-
action, and are the more effective in this respect the nearer they are
to the optimum; temperatures above the optimum, on the other hand,
help in the destructive light-action, or, rather, co-operate with the
light in killing, or in retarding the growth.
   (3.) The third external factor which helps to complicate these
curves is the nature of the food-medium, and here, again, it has been
extremely difficult to obtain quantitative results.        The following
general conclusions seem deducible    from   the experiments.
   Under otherwise similar conditions in the dark the doubling period
seems to be lengthened by the addition of gelatine, and the optimum
temperature raised somewhat. How far this is due to impeded access
of oxygen, owing to its slower diffusion through a more solid
medium, or a similar impeding of the action of solvent enzymes, or
to mere mechanical opposition to growth, or diminished access of
water or food solution to the organism, could not be decided.
Experiments with stiff gelatine at lower temperatures suggest the
co-operation of all these obstacles; at higher temperatures it seems
probable that no mechanical opposition to growth occurs, and that
since the warm fluid gelatine absorbs much water, the difficulties
regarding that agent disappear also, but it is not improbable thiit
diffusion is still slower than in broth.
   Whether the shorter doubling period and lower optimum in broth
are due entirely to the absence of the above obstacles, or to the food-
materials being really in a more suitable condition for direct assimi
lation by the cells, must also remain undecided.          That the latt-r
factor is not unimportant, however, is borne out by a few experiments
made with less suitable food-liquids — e.g., glucose solutions — and is,
of course, likely on other grounds.
   (4.) That access of oxygen is necessary for the growth follows from
direct experiments, and also from the extraordinary depression of the
curve when another oxygen-consuming bacterium gained access to
the drop. Experiments where KHO was put into the arms of the
cells did not support the idea that it is the mere accumulation of
CO3, due to respiration which ultimately causes the depression of tho
curve at high temperatures, however, and further experiments are
needed to show how far, if at all, the organism can endure partial
pressures of oxygen.
   (5.) Some of the experiments, especially at higher temperatures,
indicate the importance of water, the general necessity of which will
of course not be disputed.
   The curves seem to be affected by sudden dilutions of the drops,
owing to condensation of water on the coyer-slips of the cnlture-cells.
How far this is due to mere dilutiou qf foqd-mate rials, inzymes, &c,

4158              Report on the Ihtcteriulotjy of Water.
or to osmotic phenomena, or to minute changes of temperature
incident to the precipitation, cannot be determined. I have discussed
the collateral effects of these condensations, as difficulties in the obser
vations, in their place, but special experiments are needed in regard
to the other points.
   (6.) In a few cases there is positive evidence that volatile antiseptic
substances — e.g., from scorched cotton wool — inhibit the growth.
Here, again, special investigations are needed to determine the effects
of these on the curves, a lino of experimental inquiry for which the
method  iti admirably suited.

       1895.
                                 (Abstract.)
  In    a  previous communication     the authors     showed that no
organism belonging to the protophyta could         be  cultivated from
malignant new growths, and in addition that carcinomatous and
sarcomatous tumours from the human subject could not be trans
planted so as to produce infection in the lower animals.
   About this time the researches of Nils Sjobring and Soudakewitch,
and in this country, of Ruffer and others, showed that in sections of
carcinoma stained by special methods there were present certain
bodies which the above observers alleged to be parasitic protozoa.
The authors then determined to try whether any protozoon could be
cultivated from malignant new growths ; and as it is well known that
the habitat of the common amoeba is damp sand or pond water, they
decided to select sand and water as the medium for their investiga
tion.   Their first experiments were imperfect, for the reason that
sufficient care was not used in the sterilisation of the materials and
in the precautions taken during microscopic examination.
   The only experiments in which they found living amoebae were
certain of the earlier, in which a possibility of external contamina
tion was not rigidly excluded.
   The following is their final method of procedure : —
   Sand. — Silver sand, from which the finest part had been removed
by sifting, was baked in a shallow thin iron dish over a large ring
Bunsen for an hour.       It was then transferred to the small deep
capsules and Petri dishes about to be used, which had been pre
viously baked for an hour at 150° C. in the hot-air steriliser.     The
capsules so charged were then baked for an hour at 150° C. ; on
removal from the sterilisei the sand was heaped up on one side by
shaking the capsule so that when the water was added part of the
sand was submerged and part remained above the level of the fluid.
The object of this proceeding was to obtain a littoral in order to
ensure better aeration for any protozoa that might develop.
   Water. — This was distilled and collected in a sterilised flask; it
was subsequently boiled for from four to five hours with the object
of rendering     quite sterile.

470         Messrs.  S. G. Shattock and Charles A. Ballance.
                                 — The malignant tumour was received
    Transference  of the Tumour.
fresh from the operating theatre, the redundant tissue around was
removed with sterilised scissors ; then, with knives previously
sterilised at 150° C. for an hour in an iron box, pieces of the
growing edge were cut away, and transferred with sterilised forceps
to the capsules ; they were laid on the sand just beneath the water
level. Two kinds of capsules were used: one, the ordinary Petri,
the other considerably deeper, of less diameter, and furnished some
times with a cover, like the Petri, at other times not.
                                                                   " in
    Storage of the Capsules. — -The capsules thus prepared and
         "
fected were placed between sterilised double dishes ; the covers of
these dishes were raised for a short distance by means of blocks of
 wood which had been soaked in solution of corrosive sublimate ; the
 height was such as to allow free entrance of air, but not sufficient
to expose the mouth of the lower dish.      The double dishes were first
 sterilised by washing with sublimate solution, absolute alcohol and
by heat.
    The double dishes were finally placed, each pair, upon a sheet of
 glass beneath a capacious shade, both of which had been cleansed
with sublimate solution. Most of the small, deep capsules had their
 covers removed as they were placed between the double dishes.      The
 Petri capsules remained covered throughout.       All the experiments
were conducted in a private laboratory continuously heated.
    Method of Microscopical Examination. — A glass rod and slide were
sterilised in the flame, and allowed to cool.  The shade was removed
and the upper dish raised sufficiently to allow of the passage of the
 rod to the capsule. A little sand was then taken from three or four
 places along the littoral or from the neighbourhood of the piece of
 tumour and transferred to the slide ; occasionally a hole was dug
 with the rod above the water level, and some of the deeper sand re
 moved. The sand so removed was gently stroked with the rod on
 the slide until displaced from one end to the other ; the slide was
 finally inclined so that enough fluid left the sand to make a micro
 scopic preparation.
    The examination was made with 1/12 apochromatic oil immersion,
 Zeiss, oculars 4 and 8. Occasionally a few drops of beef peptone
 broth were added to the capsule; and as the water became low from
 evaporation more was supplied.
     In all the capsules bacteria developed, a fact which the authors
 regard as important inasmuch as such would furnish a pabulum for
 the growth of any protozoa that might develop.
    The authors then give a table exhibiting the results of experiments
 made in twenty-three capsules ; there were used nine scirrhous
 carcinomata of the breast, and five sarcomata from different sources ;
 the sarcomata comprised one from the human biceps, one a mela

    Attempt    to cultivate Parasitic Protozoa from Tumours,      $-c.  471
notic growth of the cheek, two melanotic sarcomata from horses, and
a spindle-celled mammary sarcoma from a dog.                In the case of
carcinomata the authors confined themselves to the typical scirrhus
of the breast for the reason that in new growths involving superficial
parts as the lip, tongue, &c, there is not only a chance of protophytic
contamination, but also of protozoic, especially as certain protozoa
nre normal inhabitants of such mucous passages as the vagina and
intestine.
    The result of all these experiments was negative.         No traces of
protozoic    life,  whether    as  spores   or  amoebae  were  encountered,
although the examinations wero made at regular intervals and
repeated for periods of many months.
    It may be added that a similar method of investigation carried out
 with normal tissues was equally negative of result.
    The experiments so made were nineteen in number : seven were
 with human tissues (five subjects), muscle, pancreas, spleen, mamma ;
 and twelve with the tissues of three dogs, submaxillary salivary gland,
 muscle, testicle, pancreas, kidney, and spleen.
    The authors obtained equally negative results with vaccinia,
 molluscum contagiosum, the pancreas of Salamandra maculata, and
 muscles of the frog.
     Vaccinia. — The experiments were made with freshly excised skin of
 the calf on which mature vesicles had been raised.              They were
 carried out because      bodies  similar  to  those  viewed as parasitic in
 carcinoma have been demonstrated in the epithelium of the . vaccine
 and variolous vesicle.
    Molluscum contagiosum was experimented with, because certain
 observers have held that the

 the tissue in question.
     The experiments of the authors, conducted with the precautions
 detailed in the paper, especially the avoidance of contamination from
 the integument, prove that this is untrue.
     The general conclusion the authors draw from the different series
 of experiments recounted in the paper is that by the method adopted
 no protozoa can be cultivated from the healthy living tissues, from
  malignant tumours (at least such as are not directly exposed to
 external contamination), from the lesions of vaccinia and molluscum
 contagiosum, from the salamander's pancreas, and from the muscles
 of the frog.

   The authors record, in addition, a certain number of experiments
made upon animals by means of sand infected with carcinoma and
sarcoma, and containing amoebce which later experiments showed to
be adventitious. These experiments, which were all negative in result,
                                                                  " of
included intravenous injection (dogs), the repeated " vaccination
skin (white rats), intraperitoneal insertion (white rats).
   Having previously found it impossible to raise a growth of
carcinoma in any of the lower animals by transplantation of recent
human carcinoma, they thought it possible that if the tumour was
first incubated outside the body, the hypothetical protozoon might
pass into some phase which would enable it to convey the infection.
With this object, pieces of carcinoma incubated at the room tem
perature in milk, potassium oxalate plasma, and dilute broth were
inserted into the peritoneal cavity of white rats, but with negative
result.
   In the case of two rats, the material used consisted of scirrhous
carcinoma, which had been buried in a country garden for six weeks ;
the animals were kept alive for six months, but remained unaffected
with the disease.
   Under the head of Treatment are recorded the negative results
following the subcutaneous injection of fresh aqueous extract of
carcinoma and sarcoma in cases of both these diseases, as well as the
similar injection of fresh sheep-serum.

       OBITUARY NOTICES OF FELLOWS DECEASED.
    Abthub Cayley was the second son of Heury Cayley and Maria
 Antonia Doughty ; he was born at Richmond, in Surrey, on 16 August,
 1821.
    The family, to whose fame so much honour has been added by ono
 of the greatest mathematicians of all time, is of old origin and
 illustrious descent. Its name, like not a few English names, is
 derived from a locality in Normandy ; there was a Castellum
 Cailleii near Rouen held by baronial tenure. The head of the house
 appears to have come to England with William the Conqueror and to
 have settled in Norfolk, becoming Lord of Massingham, Cranwich,
 Brodercross, and Hiburgh in that county. The influence of the family
 increased and, by the time of Edward II, Sir Thomas de Cailli
 possessed estates also in Yorkshire.      On his decease without issue,
 the Yorkshire property was transferred to a younger branch of the
 family and was inherited by a long succession of Cayleys who mado
 their home at Thormanby.        One of these was knighted. as Sir William
 Cayley,   in  1641 ; in 1661 he was created a baronet in recognition of
 his services during the Civil Wars, the title surviving to the present
 day. The fourth son of Sir William, Cornelius, settled at York ; and
 the eldest son of the latter, also Cornelius, born in 1692, was a
 barrister and in 1725 was appointed Recorder of Kingston-upon-Hull,
an office which he held until a few years before his death in 1779.
 Probably the advantages offered by Hull, then, as now, the greatest
 port on the northern coast of England, suggested commerce as an
occupation for some members of the Recorder's large family ; two of
his sons became Russia merchants, settling in St. Petersburg.           The
younger of these, being the fifth son of the Recorder, was Heury
Cayley, born in 1768 ; he married, in 1814, Maria Antonia Doughty,
a daughter of William Doughty.           The eldest son of this marriage
died in infancy.       The youngest son, Charles Bagot, was a scholai,
possessed    of linguistic genius ; he was particularly interested in tho
Romance languages and he made verse-translations of Homer's Iliad,
Dante's Divine Comedy, and the Sonnets of Petrarch.            The second
son was Arthur, the subject of the present sketch ; he was born during
a visit of his parents to England.      Before passing to the details of his
life, it may be added that the second of his father's sisters married

Edward Moberly — also a Russia merchant living in St. Petersburg —
and was the mother of the late Dr. George Moberly, Bishop of
 Salisbury.
    Mr. Heury Cayley took his young family to Russia and remained
there for a few years.        On retiring from business in 1829, he returned
to England and Rettled into residence at Blackheath.                   Arthur was
 sent soon afterwards to a private school there, kept by the Rev.
 G-. B. F. Potticary ; and when he was fourteen he was transferred to
 fling's College School, London. At a very early age he had begun to
 shew some of those preferences by which the existence of mathe
matical ability is wont to reveal itself ; he had a great liking for
numerical calculations and he developed a great aptitude for them.
    In his new school the boy showed himself to be possessed of
remarkable ability: his power of grasping a new subject very rapidly
and of seizing its central principles was certainly nnnsual.                 An old
friend tells of an examination in chemistry : the subject had not been
studied by Cayley before, but he soon acquired sufficient knowledge
to carry off the medal from the professedly chemical students, to their
surprise and mortification.*       But it was most of all by the indications
of mathematical genius that he astonished his teachers.               It had been
Mr. Cayley's intention to educate his son with the view of placing him
in his former business — an intention not abandoned without reluctance.
The impression, however, produced upon his teachers could not lightly
be set aside; and the advice of the Principal to send him to Cam
bridge, where his abilities promised to secure brilliant distinction, was
adopted.
    Accordingly, he went to Cambridge.             He was entered at Trinity
College on 2nd May, 1838, as a pensioner, and he began residence in the
succeeding October at the unusually early age of seventeen. He passed
through the ordinary stages in the career of a successful student of
mathematics.        Like the other able undergraduates of his period, he
"            "
   coached       with William Hopkins of Peterhouse who has been
described as a great and stimulating teacher — a description justified
by the high achievements of a long line of distinguished and grateful
pupils.
    Cayley's fame grew rapidly : and, as is the way of Cambridge
undergraduates, he soon was pointed out as the future Senior Wrangler
of the year. It is interesting to find a record of him written about
    * It may  be added that he maintained his interest in chemistry throughout his
life, and acquired a considerable knowledge of it. When he was at Baltimore, in
 1882, lecturing at the Johns Hopkins University by special invitation, he attended
 Trofessor Bemsen's lectures with a pleasure which found expression in his letters
home to his children in England.      And on one occasion, at Professor Bemsen's
request. he lectured to the chemistry class on the hydrocarbon
                                                                     " trees " Brit.

 Assoc. Beport,' 1875, pp. 257—305).

 this time and published not long afterwards by an acquaintance,* who
 says that   :   —
         " As an undergraduate he had
                                            generally the reputation of a
      mere mathematician, which did him great injustice, for he was
      really a man of much varied information, and that on some sub
      jects the very opposite of scientific — for instance, he was well up
      in all the current novels, an uncommon thing at Cambridge where
       novel-reading is not one of the popular weaknesses."
    Novel-readers are more frequent in Cambridge now than they
 appear to have been in 1842, and Cayley in his later days avoided
 reading some of the modern novels; but it is worth noting, as will
                                                         "
 subsequently be seen more in detail, that he had this popular weak
 ness
       " all his life.
    He was admitted a scholar of the College on 1st May, 1840, winning
 his scholarship at the earliest time when it was possible to do so :
 and he secured a first class in each of the annual examinations of the
 College.    No record of marks for the first and the second years is
 given in the Trinity Head Examiner's Book ; but in the third year
 the marks are given and, as he then scored more than twice the marks
 of the second candidate, the Head Examiner separated him from the
 rest of the first clabs by drawing a line nnder his name. This presage
 of his powers was confirmed in the following year, 1842, when he
 graduated as Senior Wrangler; the Examiners were so definitely
 satisfied that he was first as to dispense in his case with the viva
 voce tests which at that time were a customary part of the Tripos.
 And in due course the first Smith's Prize was awarded to him in the
succeeding examination.
   Cayley's own "year "at Trinity was a distinguished one; for, in
addition to himself, it contained Mr. (now the Right Honourable)
George Denman, for many years a Judge of the High Court of Justice,
and Hugh Andrew Johnstone Muuro, one of the foremost of Latin
Scholars of any period. And the distinction of Cayley's contempo
raries in neighbouring years is marked : it is impossible to avoid
noticing the names of some of the graduates in the Mathematical
Tripos about that time. Sylvester and Green (second and fourth
wranglers respectively in 1837), Leslie Ellis (senior in 1840), Stokes
(senior in 1841), Cayley (senior in 1842), Adams (senior in 1843),
Thomson — now Lord Kelvin — (second in 1845), constitute an extra-
  * Bristed, ' Five Tears in an English University '

  It may be added that Cayley declared the story about him in the tripos, recorded
by Bristed, to be quite apocryphal.
  So also was another story, belonging to a later part of his life, according to
which he is reported to have said that " the object of law was to say a thing in the
greatest number of words, and of mathematics to say it in the fewest": this view,
and the possibility of his ever having heldit,he repudiated entirely.
                                                                        6   2

ordinary succession of mathematicians of whom England is justly
proud.     Their achievements in mathematical science have done much
to render their University one of the acknowledged chief mathe
matical schools of the world.
    Cayley was elected a Fellow of Trinity and admitted to fellowship
on 3rd October, 1842, at an age younger than any other fellow of
the college, at least in the present century ; and he was promoted
from the position of Minor Fellow to that of Major Fellow on 2nd
July, 1845, the year in which he proceeded to his M.A. degree.            He
was an Assistant Tutor of the College for three years ; but such a
post was then of an almost nominal character, and there appears to
be no indication that any of the mathematical teaching of the College
fell to him. He did, indeed, accept some private pupils : his life-long
friend, Canon Venables, has given a pleasant account* of a reading-
party which Cayley took to Aberfeldie in 1842.
   His pupils, however, did not tie him strictly to Cambridge, for it
appears that the latter half of the year 1843 was devoted to conti
nental rambles. The summer was spent in Switzerland where his
zest for walking and for mountain-climbing,             a pleasure that never
failed while his health lasted, found an active outlet : he had become a
member of the Alpine Club in its comparatively early days.               The
last four months of the year were spent in Italy, partly in the North
and in Florence, partly in Rome and Naples.              It may have been ou
this tour that he acquired his love for both painting and architecture.
The works of painters such as Masaccio, Giovanni Bellini, Perugino,
and Luini, then first became known to him ; they proved a delight at
the time and remained a happy remembrance with him.
    These and other continental journeys from time to time, while he
remained in residence as a Fellow of his College, were his relaxations.
He had no formal lecturing and he did not attempt to obtain a large
 number of private pupils. The leisure that he thus secured was turned
 to the best, and to him the most pleasant, of uses, in carrying out
 mathematical researches.      It was, indeed, as an undergraduate that
 Cayley began the marvellous series of publications which, extending
 over more than fifty years of his life, have been concerned with
 practically every branch of pure mathematics as well as with theo
 retical dynamics and physical astronomy.
    The time seemed ripe for the outburst of some mathematical
 activity.   By the efforts of Herschel, Peacock, and Whewell, Cam
 bridge teaching had been set free from the bonds that restricted
 methods of procedure to those which had proved effective in
 Newton's days ; and the struggle to secure the admittance of analy tica.
 methods had been successfully completed.               One sign of the new
 freedom was the foundation of the
                                                 '

Journal,' in 1837, by D. F. Gregory and Leslie Ellis. Before that
time, practically the only English, means of publication open to
mathematicians was in the ' Philosophical Transactions of the Royal
         '
Society ; and young writers, whether modest or not about the value
of their researches, might well have hesitated before seeking publica
tion in a quarter that exacts so high a standard. The new journal then
founded was open to young students and gave them an opportunity,
previously difficult to obtain, of making their researches known ; and
it proved a great stimulus to the intellectual activity of those members
of the University. Only four volumes of the journal appeared ; but
it was continued, first under the name of the ' Cambridge and Dublin
Mathematical Journal,' and, subsequently down to the present time,
under that of the ' Quarterly Journal of Pure and Applied Mathe
matics.' Though the opportunities of publication, which now are
afforded to mathematicians both in England and abroad, are vastly
more numerous than they were half a century ago, the undoubted
service rendered to English mathematics by the initial venture of the
two young Cambridge men should not be forgotten.
   It was in the second volume of this journal that Cayley's earliest
paper, written in 1841, was printed : and two other papers bearing
the same date — it was the year before his degree — are included in
the third volume. Though the results are not remarkable, the
freshness and the independence of these early investigations are
worthy of notice. Cayley had evidently read with enquiring and
critical care the " Mecanique Analytique " of Lagrange, some of the
work of Laplace, and several memoirs in the two continental journals
of the time, those of Liouville and Crelle.            These achievements of
an undergraduate of nineteen or twenty, which are rarely accom
plished now and were still rarer in his day, recall Abel's dictum* : —
        "Si   1'on vent    faire des progres dans les mathematiques,       il
      faut etudier les maitres et non pas les ecoliers."
   It was as certainly one of the characteristics of Cayley to find a
stimulus to new developments in the main ideas of other writers as it
was one of his characteristics to be able to follow out his own id*y3s
with the insistent unwearying patience of an investigator creating a
now work complete. And it is interesting to see how this faculty of
receiving inspiration reveals itself from the beginning of his career.
   Once free from the necessity of preparing for his Tripos and his
Fellowship examination, he was able to throw himself into the work
of production.      His activity may be estimated from the fact that he
produced three papers in 1842, eight in 1843, four in 1844, and
thirteen in 1845.      Moreover, these papers deal with a great variety
of subjects.    Thus he makes his first investigations in the numerative

  calculus of plane curves : he initiates his discussions about geometry
  of n dimensions : he founds the theory of invariants and covariants :
  and he elucidates the connexion between doubly-infinite products and
  elliptic functions.      Some of these early papers are now classical ; and
  the briefest inspection of them is sufficient to reveal the suggestiveness
  and the easy strength of the young mathematician who was not yet
  in his twenty-fifth year.
      Even by this date the opportunities of publication in England had
  become inadequate to his needs.             Curiously enough, he does not
 appear to have sent any paper to the Royal Society until the year
  1852, when Sylvester communicated the " Analytical Researches
 connected with Steiner's Extension of Malfatti's Problem,"* to the
  Society.     Later in the same year, Cayley was elected a Fellow of the
                                                                        '
 Society, and thereafter many of his papers appear in its Transac
 tions.'     Before 1852, there were few journals either at home or
abroad which did not receive communications from him : and even in
 the quite early years of his researches, several of his papers, written
 in French, appeared in Liouville's journal and in Crelle's journal.
 As societies and journals grew in number, so the area over which his
papers spread became ever wider.
     At first, after winning his Trinity Fellowship, he remained at
 Cambridge, and his time must then have been largely at his own
disposal. This freedom, in his circumstances, could last only for a
limited time, because, unless he either entered holy orders or devoted
himself to teaching in some permanent post (if obtainable) in the
 College, the Fellowship could be held for not more than seven years
after his M. A. degree — a period that would expire in 1852. He was
unwilling to take holy orders — not that there was any religious
obstacle in his way, for he was not harassed either by philosophical
doubts or critical difficulties.         His simple reason for remaining a
 layman was that, though devout in spirit and an active Churchman,
he felt no vocation for the sacred office.
     In consequence, it became necessary to choose some profession.
 Cayley selected the law, left Cambridge in 1846, entered at Lincoln's
Inn, and became a pupil of the famous conveyancer, Mr. Christie. A
story of their first interview, that Mr. Christie used to tell in after
years, is an illustration of the modesty and the lack of self-assertive-
ness which were leading features of Cayley's character : and this
impression is confirmed by the recollections              of a fellow-pupil, Mr.
T. C. Wright, who says : —
          "...     .  -We fellow-pupils knew that Arthur Cayley had been
       the Senior Wrangler of his year, and that he possessed extra-

ences to this series will be made in the form ' C. M. P.'

      ordinary abilities    ; but they were not indicated by his personal
       hearing, and the retiring modesty of his disposition prevented
      him from ever alluding to the honourshe had won at Cambridge.
      He had       one of   the most unsophisticated minds          I have ever
      known ; jokes, and the badinage of the pupil-room, seemed to be
      delightful novelties to him, and his face beamed with amusement
      as he listened to them without taking much part in the conversa
      tion, being content to devote his time assiduously to work which
      I suspect was not altogether congenial to his taste                 "
    But if the modest, almost shy, man did not display his honours, he
could not conceal his powers ; and very soon his clearness of head,
his almost intuitive grasp of the principles of any subject that came
before him, his capacity for work and his power of concentration,
made him a favourite pupil.           He was called to the Bar on 3rd May,
 1849, and thereafter he had no occasion to wait for business.               Mr.
Christie was always ready to supply him with at least as much con
veyancing work as he was willing to undertake : but no advice, no
encouragement, no opening however favourable, least of all any wish
for fame or fortune, could tempt him to subside into a large practice.
He restricted himself to " devilling " for Mr. Christie, and he limited
the amount of work he would undertake in this way, always refusing
work that came to him at first hand. There is no doubt that, had he
remained at the Bar and devoted himself to its business, he could
have made a great. legal reputation and a substantial fortune : even
as it was, some of his drafts* have been made to serve as models.
But the spirit of research possessed him ; it was not merely will but
an irresistible impulse that made the pursuit of mathematics, not the
practice of law, his chief desire. To achieve this desire, he reserved
with jealous care a due portion of his time; and he regarded his
legal occupations mainly as the means of providing a livelihood.
   He remained at the Bar for fourteen years. Between two and
three hundred papers are the mathematical outcome of that period ;
and they include some of the most brilliant of his discoveries. Among
these papers are to be found the majority of his famous memoirs on
quantics (particularly the sixth memoir, in which he develops his
theory of geometry and shows that all geometry can be made entirely
descriptive), his work upon matrices, numerous contributions to the
theory of symmetric functions of the roots of an equation, the
elaborate calculations connected with the development of functions
arising in the planetary and the lunar theories, and his valuable
reports on theoretical dynamics.           The enormous range over which

 his papers of these fourteen years extend is not more remarkabl-
 than the vigour of his contributions to knowledge ; and a reference to
them will show that he frequently recurs to some given problem,
 always adding something to the development.
    In judging of this persistent and unflagging activity, some account
ought to be taken of his surroundings.           It can hardly be that
2, Stone Court, from which many of his papers are dated, proved an
inspiration to mathematical research. For part of the time, his
friend Sylvester was in London — then as an actuary ; and        I have
heard Cayley describe how Sylvester and he walked round the
 Courts of Lincoln's Inn discussing the theory of invariants and
covariants which occupied (and occasionally absorbed) the attention
of both of them during the fifties. And on matters which related to-
analytical geometry he was in frequent (but formal) correspondence
with Salmon ; indeed, the relation that existed between the two men
developed ultimately into one of warm friendship and deep mutual
regard : its sincerity can be gathered from the spirit animating
Salmon's notice of Cayley, published iu ' Nature in 1883, at the
                                                       '
time when the latter was President of the British Association.     But,
with special exceptions of the types indicated, his work was so largely
of the kind that is called path-breaking that he was bound to do it
alone : he did it with a simple unconscious courage and with unfailing
resolution.
   It may easily be imagined that his links with life at Cambridge
had now become slight.        During the earliest of the years spent at
tho bar, he had returned on a few occasions. In 1848, the year befor-
his call, he was the junior mathematical examiner in the regular
annual examinations of Trinity ; in 1849, and also in 1850, he was
the senior mathematical examiner in the same examinations.           In
1851 he was Senior Moderator for the Mathematical Tripos ; one of
the wranglers, Lightfoot, becoming subsequently his friend, and his
colleague in the University, before going to his great work in th-
diocese of Durham as Bishop.       In 1852 he was Senior Examiner for
the Tripos, the senior wrangler of the year being Tait (also after
wards one of his intimate friends), now Professor of Natural
Philosophy at Edinburgh. These seem to have been the only occa
sions when he was recalled to Cambridge ; and they did not require
any permanent connection with the College or the University. He was
settled in London, his allegiance divided between law and mathematics.
   A change, however, in the statutes of the University offered an
opportunity for his return to Cambridge ; a professorship of pur-
mathematics was established upon an old foundation.          Lady Mary
Sadleir (who endowed the Croonian Lecture Fund of the Royal
College of Physicians of London, and also that of the Royal Society, in
memory of her first husband, Dr. William Croonc, a physician and

                                      ix
one of the earliest Fellows     of the Royal Society) had, by her will,
dated 25th September, 1701, and proved 6th November, 1706, given
to the University an estate, which was to be used as an endowment
of lectureships in algebra at nine of the colleges in Cambridge. These
posts were duly established.       The great developments of analysis,
which took place    at  the end of  the last century and during the first
half of the present century, gradually proved that the restriction
to algebra prevented the lectureships from being as adequate an
encouragement to the advancement of mathematics as they were
designed to be at tho time of their establishment.         Moreover, the
lecturers had ceased to attract undergraduates to their lectures : so
that the purpose of the foundation was not being fulfilled. Conse
quently, in 1857, a proposal was made by the Council of the Senate
 of the University that a new direction should be given to the endow
 ment by the establishment of a professorship, to be called the
 Sadlerian Professorship      of Pure Mathematics: the duty of the
                 "
 professor was to explain and teach the principles of pure mathe
 matics, and to apply himself to the advancement of that science."
 The proposal was approved by the Senate on 3rd December, 1857,
 and the new statute was sanctioned by an Order of the (jueen in
 Council on 7th March, 1860. Some time had to elapse before certain
 provisional arrangements could be completed, and it was not until
 after three years that the University was in a position to act.
    On 10th June, 1863, Cayley was elected Sadlerian professor: he
 held the chair for the rest of his life.     The stipend attached to the
 professorship was modest, though it was improved in the course of
 subsequent legislation ; these changes, however, could not have been
 foreseen at the time when Cayley was elected.        Yet he had no hesi
 tation about returning to Cambridge : for the post enabled him to
 devote his life to the pursuit he liked best.         He never felt the
 slightest regret at having neglected the prospects of distinction at the
 bar, or at having chosen to return to his University ; and he always
 expressed perfect satisfaction and content with his life in Cambridge,
 which was one of great happiness.
     His appointment as Sadlerian professor marks a turning point in
  his life.  Henceforward he lived, for the most part, in the qniet of
  the University, though by no means in seclusion, for he took his
  share in administration, which claims a part (often too large a part)
  of the leisure of men fitted for this necessary duty. But he was not
  burdened by heavy claims arising out of his official position : and he
  was directed by the statutes governing him to do what was, as a
  matter of fact, his ideal in life.     No man could have been better
  suited than Cayley was to fulfil the charge of the statutes : his know
  ledge and his power of research pointed him out as the obvious choice
  of the electors.

                                           X
     He settled in Cambridge at once.             On 8th September, 1863, ho
 married Susan, daughter of Robert Moline, of Greenwich.                  This is
not the place to dwell upon his domestic life ; but it is impossible to
omit in silence all reference to its singular happiness, based upon the
affection felt by its members for one another. Friends and visitors who
 have been in that home will not soon forget the kindness and the
gracious courtesy of the welcome they received, or the atmosphere of
 peace into which they were raised.            Sometimes in the old garden by
 the  riverside,  more   often in  the   drawing-room, the talk went on ; the
professor himself listening, attentive and watchful, frequently taking
only a slight share, buteverready to join in. No cynicism or paradox
in speech was ventured upon in his presence ; no harshness of judgment
was tolerated without a quiet protest; no sense of bustle or ambition
was felt there ; in all things the charm of an old-world home, centred
round him. His widow and their two children, Mary and Heury,
remain to mourn their loss.
    His teaching duty was limited to the delivery of one course of
lectures in the academic year, and he usually chose the Michaelmas
term. This practice was maintained for twenty-three years until he
was placed under the new statutes, which in 1882 had come into
operation, so far as concerned all future appointments.                After that
change, he delivered two courses of lectures, one in the Michaelmas
term, the other in the Lent term. An inspection of the list of his
lectures shows that he chose his subjects by preference from analytical
geometry, dynamics (in his view, theoretical dynamics is a portion of
pure mathematics), differential equations, theory of equations, Abelian
functions, elliptic functions, and modern algebra.             The titles of the
lectures, as announced, were sometimes vague, nor were they intended
to limit his range ; in all cases he went far beyond the boundary that
so frequently limits Cambridge studies.               Thus a course of lectures
on differential equations, announced for the Michaelmas term in
1879, was chiefly concerned with conformal representation, poly
hedral functions, and Schwarz's investigations on the hypergeometric
series.
    For many years      he dispensed     with the use of blackboard and chalk
 in his class-room ; this was possible because his class usually was
 small.    He brought his work written out upon the blue draft-paper*
 which was regularly used by him in all his writing of mathematics;
 the exposition consisted partly of verbal explanations made as he
 showed the manuscript, partly of details written out at the moment.
 A change came in 1881, when his class amounted to fifteen or sixteen :
 he was then obliged to use the blackboard, and he subsequently main
  tained the new practice.      Occasionally his older habit of explaining
  his manuscript recurred — he then placed it upon the board. This
        * It vaa the eustomarj " scribbling paper " of M« undergraduate day?.

                                      xi
was especially the case when he brought carefully prepared diagrams,
such as those used in the modular-function division of the plane :
these diagrams were made much clearer by the use of water-colours
to distinguish different sets of regions, and their preparation evidently
gave him pleasure.
   Bat. as maybe surmised his influence as a teacher was overshadowed
by his influence as an investigator.     Those whom he affected by his
lectures belonged for the most part to the mathematical teachers in
Cambridge : the number of undergraduates whom he influenced was
small, though, when any one of them did come under his influence,
the effect was well marked.       His starting point in any subject was
usually beyond the range of all other than quite advanced students ;
but to any able undergraduate who was willing to devote time, not
merely to the comprehension of the matter in the lectures but also to
collateral reading, the lectures were stimulating and inspiring. This
effect was partly due to the easy strength with which he worked,
partly to the spirit in which he approached old and new subjects
alike ; an independent suggestiveness and a singular freshness
marked his views, and gave an added interest to his exposition even
of a well-known theory.      One reason of this freshness may be found
in the fact that his lectures consisted of the current researches upon
which he was engaged at the time ; sometimes, even, a lecture would
be devoted to results which he had obtained since the preceding
lecture. Though the titles of the courses occasionally recur from one
year to another, the same course was never given twice.         The new
matter in any course, once given, was usually incorporated in a paper
or memoir ; and when the same subject was nominally lectured upon
again, it was a distinct part of the subject — old notes were never
used a second time.
   It was not alone by his lectures that he acted as professor.
Students, seeking help or desiring to interest him in their work,
found him always willing to give them the benefit of his advice, his
criticism, and his knowledge.    Nor was it merely mathematicians in
Cambridge whom he helped in this way. He was continually con
sulted by foreigners, who appreciated the promptuess no less than
the fulness of information in his replies.
   It frequently happens that a man of genius, great enough to leave
a distinct impress of his originality upon his science, finds it irksome
to study what others have written.     With the growth of all sciences
during the last fifty years, especially — it may be said — with the
growth of pure mathematics in that time, the tendency of workers is
to become specialists in their own subject and, perhaps, in subjects
immediately cognate with     and to acquire only a slight acquaint
                            it,
ance with what    isbeing done outside the circle of their limited
interests. Not so was Cayley   he was singularly learned in the work
                                  :

                                    xii
of other men, and catholic in his range of knowledge. Yet he did not
read a memoir completely through : his custom was to read only so
much as would enable him to grasp the meaning of the symbols and
understand its scope.     The main result would then become to him a
subject of investigation : he would establish it (or test it) by alge
braical analysis and, not infrequently, develop it so as to obtain other
results.    This faculty of grasping and testing rapidly the work of
others, together with his great knowledge, made him an invaluabl-
referee ; his services in this capacity were used through a loug series
of years by a number of societies to which he almost was in the
position of standing mathematical adviser.
    Concurrently with his teaching, he continued his investigations.
He wrote only one book — a ' Treatise on Elliptic Functions,' pub
lished in 1876, which was intended to bridge over the gap from
                                                  '
Legendre's ' Traite des Fonctions Elliptiques
                                                                 '

                '
menta Nova ; it contains a considerable amount of new matter.
But paper after paper was published in a long unfailing succession
almost until his death ; their tale amounts to more than 800.
Happily for the convenience of mathematicians, the republication of
his papers in collected form was undertaken by the Cambridge
University Press — perhaps the most enduring, certainly not the least
fitting, monument of his fame.       The request was made to him in
1889 by the Syndics of the Press; he willingly acceded to it and
deeply appreciated, both then and afterwards, what he regarded as a
great compliment to himself.      Seven large quarto volumes, under his
own editorship, have already appeared. The preparation of them
was always a great happiness to him ; and, especially in the later
years of his life, it gave him an occupation in his science which was
still within the range of his failing strength.     At the time when the
collection was begun it was estimated that ten volumes would suffice
for the purpose, but it is now evident that ten will be certainly in
sufficient.   The Syndics of the Press intend to complete the series of
volumes ; it is a matter of regret that the illustrious author of the
papers has not lived to complete it himself.
    Even his teaching and investigations did not fully occupy his
time. For the first few years after his return he was left compara
tively free from a large share in administration, bnt gradually it was
assigned to him. As he became better known for his effective busi
ness capacity, his share in administration      grew until he came to
be regarded as an indispensable member of the Council of the
Senate. He was elected a member of that body on 7th November,
1876, and with the exception of some six months when he was absent
in America, he continued a member of it until 1892, when failing
health compelled him to resign.       During this period of service he
      re-elected three times ; while pirty feeling ran rather strongly

                                     xiii
at times during the discussions that led to the new statutes, bofh
parties included his name among their lists of nominations — an ade
quate proof that he possessed the confidence of the Senate. He was
free from party bias, and he became established in his position of
strength by his fairmindedness, his sound judgment, and his calm
 temperament.      He would listen to a discussion, speaking only when
 he had something of importance to add ; when speaking he was
 listened to with full attention.     More frequently he would take no
 part in the discussion until his opinion was asked, as was usually the
case in difficult questions ; his opinion was always valued and some
times final.    Similarly, on syndicates, his co-operation was much
sought, and in particular the services which he rendered to the
Library Syndicate and the Press Syndicate were of substantial im
portance.     He also took great interest in the movement for the
higher education of women. In the early days of Girton College he
gave direct help in teaching, and for some years he was Chairman of
 the Council of Newnham College, in the progress of which he took
 the keenest interest even to the last.
    But, with all his general aptitude for business, he was perhaps
most specially helpful by his legal knowledge.      The training ho had
undergone and the knowledge he had acquired at the bar ultimately
proved invaluable.      His opinion on legal matters was sought by the
University, by    his  own  college, and by the scientific societies with
which he was connected ; when given, it frequently had the effect of
a judicial decision. His powers of drafting were constantly being
called into requisition ; he responded to the calls upon him and, with
nnstinted generosity, placed his time and skill at the disposal of these
bodies, so that the new statutes of Trinity College, and not a few of
the statutes and ordinances of the University, owe much to him.
    One other illustration, at once of his general business capacity and
of the confidence reposed in him, may be given. The elections for
representatives of the Universities in the House of Commons are
still conducted openly and by means of voting papers, delivered
either by the elector himself or by another elector whom he has
nominated ; objections may be raised against any voting paper, but
they must be decided at once. In Cambridge the Vice-Chancellor,
being the returning officer, nominates a number of assessors to act
with him in the case of a contested election. At a bye-election in
1882, when the candidates were Mr. H. C. Raikes and Professor
James Stuart, Cayley was nominated as presiding officer at one of
the polling places.     His imperturbable firmness, his calm courtesy,
and the justice of his decisions secured for his effectiveness in this
capacity the admiration of the University.
    This brief account of his participation in business affairs is neces
sary ; without some 6uch indication a proper estimate of his position

                                              XIV
  in Cambridge cannot be framed. And it also may help to show that
  his supremacy in the subjects of his investigations neither made him
  a recluse, nor limited his other interests, nor restricted his practical
  usefulness.
      The merits of such a man were recognised by the only means at
  the disposal of a grateful and appreciative University.                     He was
  elected an honorary Fellow of Trinity College on 22nd May, 1872, at
  the same time as Dr. Lightfoot, Mr. James Spedding, and Professor
  Clerk Maxwell ; and on 11th October, 1875, he was made an ordinary
  Fellow, a position which he retained for the rest of his life. His
  friends subscribed for a presentation portrait,* painted by Lowes
  Dickenson in 1874 ; it now hangs in the College Hall.                  The simplest
  of inscriptions is on its frame, but the humorous lines which Clerk
  Maxwellf wrote at the time should not readily be forgotten. The
 graver element, seldom absent from his verses, is not entirely
 repressed even by his wit, and the lines were based upon a deep
 admiration of the man
                       " Whose soul, too
                                            large for vulgar space,
                         In » dimensions flourished uurestricted."
 His bust, by Mr. Heury Wiles, was given to Trinity College by a
 donor who wished to remain anonymous.                         It was placed in the
 beautiful library of the College on 3rd December, 1888, an honour
 that has been conferred during life in only two other cases — Tenny
 son and Sedgwick.
     After the new statutes came into operation, the Senate on 27th
 May, 1886, decided that the Sadlerian Professorship should at once
 be made subject to the improved provisions, a decision which, though
 it increased the amount of lecturing required, gave him the benefit
 of the full stipend. At the same time the Lucasian Professorship,
 held by Professor Stokes, was also made subject to the new statutes ;
and it was currently believed that the Lowndean Professorship would
have been included in the proposal had Professor Adams been will
ing to have the change made. There was a wish on the part of
members of the University to give some recognition to the glory con
ferred upon the mathematical school by Stokes, Adams, and Cayley ;
one possibility remained.              The opportunity came in 1888 when
Prince Edward (as he was known in Cambridge), afterwards Duke
of Clarence, received the degree of LL.D.                       Such an occasion is
customarily marked by the conferment of a                       number  of honorary
degrees upon distinguished men ; among them, on this particular
occasion, were the three professors who had been colleagues for a

quarter of a century.          Ou the 9th of Jane in that year a great
assembly gathered to see these degrees conferred upon the recipients.
It need hardly be said that the men singled out for honour received
ovations on being presented ; among the most enthusiastic ovations
were those accorded to the three professors.
    Nor were external bodies and learned societies, both at home and
abroad, backward in recognising the merits of his work; the honours
he received were numerous and came from all quarters.                   Honorary
degrees were conferred upon him by several universities as well as
his own, among them being Oxford, Dublin, Edinburgh, Gottingen,
Heidelberg, Leyden, and Bologna.            President Carnot nominated him
an Officer of the Legion of Honour.            He was either a Follow or a
foreign corresponding         member   of  most   of the scientific societies of
the Continent,        among them being the French Institute, the
Academies of Berlin, Gottingen, St. Petersburg, Milan, Rome,
Leyden, Upsala, and Hungary. He was also a Fellow of the Royal
Society of Edinburgh, of the Royal Irish Academy, and of the Royal
Astronomical Society.          He had been President of the Cambridge
Philosophical Society,       and  he sat on its Council for many years ; also
President of the London Mathematical Society, and of the Royal
Astronomical Society.         He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society
on 3rd June, 1852, and he served as a member of its Council for six
periods of office. He received from the Royal Society a Royal medal in
1859 and in 1882 the Copley Medal, the highest scientific distinction
it is in its power to bestow. When the De Morgan Medal was insti
tuted in connection with the London Mathematical Society, the first
award was fitly made to Cayley.            And from Leydon he received the
Huyghens Medal.
    Mention should be made of one other honour which he received :
it is of a kind seldom conferred.             The high opinion of his work
which was held in America was indicated by an invitation in 1881 to
deliver a course of lectures in the Johns Hopkins University, Balti
more, where his friend and fellow investigator, Sylvester, was then
professor.      He accepted the invitation, and left England in Decem
ber of that year.          During the next five months he lectured on
Abelian and Theta Functions; the substance of these lectures
was incorporated in a memoir subsequently published                       in the
 '
   American Journal of Mathematics.'*             He returned to England in
June, 1882, bringing back pleasant remembrances of kindnesses and
friendships.
    His life, spent in mathematical research and in the quiet round of
 activity in the University, offered little of either interest or incident
 to make his name known by the outside world to the same extent or

in the same way as the names of many scientific men, engaged               in
other lines of inquiry, are known.          Once, however, in his life cir
cumstances brought         him  prominently into notice. In 1883, he was
President of the British Association for the Advancement of Scienc-,
the meeting being held at. Southport; and, in that capacity at the
opening of the meeting, he had to deliver a formal address, an
abstract of which appeared as usual in the leading newspapers of the
country.
    In the early days of the Association, the President's address
frequently reviewed the whole field of science ; but as knowledge has
developed, a tendency has set in, according to which each later
 President has confined himself more particularly to those matters
 witbin whose range he is an authority.         And, subject to this restric
tion, it is hoped that the address may be legitimately popular.
 There have been critics of presidential addresses prepared to assert
that science was sacrificed to popularity; there have been immense
audiences convinced that popularity was sacrificed to science. Taken
 together, the presidential addresses, some severe and others popular,
 form an interesting series of reviews of the successive stages in
scientific achievements.
    Cayley's address belonged to the severely scientific class.        From
                              —
the nature of his subject the progress of mathematics, more particu
larly of pure mathematics — it was bound to have this character.
 Few of the members of a regular Association audience have more
 than a slight acquaintance with pure mathematics ; and, conse
quently, it is impossible to deliver to such a gathering an address
 which, in a reasonable time, can give them any real idea of the con
 dition or the progress of the science.       Cayley felt this and confessed
to the feeling    in   a passage  which  is perhaps the best known in the
address : —
          " It is difficult to
                               give an idea of the vast extent of modern
                         The word ' extent is not the right one : I mean
                                            '
       mathematics.
       extent crowded with beautiful detail — not an extent of mere
       uniformity such as an objectless plain, but of a tract of beautiful
       country seen at first in the distance, but which will bear to be
       rambled through and studied in every detail of hillside and
       valley, stream, rock, wood, and flower.      But, as for everything
       else, so for a mathematical theory — beauty can be perceived bat
       not explained."
 But he also felt that the respect due to the Association requires its
 President to deal with that branch of science about which, as he
 knows it best, he is best fitted to tell them, so that different subjects
 may thus in turn be brought before successive meetings.

                                       xvii
           " So much the worse," he added, " it
                                                    may be, for a particular
        meeting ; but the meeting is the individual which on evolu
        tion principles must be sacrificed for the development of the
        race."
      Granting then the inevitably stern character (as popularly esti
  mated) that must mark any proper exposition of his subject, the
  address is one of singular interest.       It undoubtedly made a great
  impression.     Parts of it were incomprehensible to all but mathe
  maticians : still, there was much which others could understand and,
  understanding, found excellent.        Even leader-writers at the time
  recognised its lucidity, its finish, its native elegance, and its instruc
  tive and stimulating essence. To mathematicians it counts for much.
  Not merely is it a valuable historical review of various mathematical
  theories ; but the exposition possesses all the freshness, the inde
  pendence of view, the snggestiveness and the amazing knowledge
  that were so characteristic of Cayley.         And, consequently, it can
  often be recurred to with unfailing profit.
     After this event, his life pursued the unbroken tenor of its scientific
  course. Ever thinking, working, writing, he maintained the flow of
  his papers with the same unslackening vigour, and he showed the
  same sympathetic encouragement of others, as had marked him
  before the scientific world had tried to acknowledge his genius by
  showering its honours upon him.
     It is now some years since the painful internal malady, which
  ultimately was the cause of death, began to show itself.                At
 first, its action was slow ; and there was reasonable hope that his
 naturally strong constitution would enable him to throw it off.
  Unfortunately these hopes were not realised ; its growth was steady,
 its undermining influence persistent.        Change of scene was tried
 once or twice, but without good effect ; and it soon appeared that
 Cambridge itself troubled him least.         Three years ago his friends
 saw that his health began to fail : he had occasional attacks of severe
 illness which confined him to his bed for weeks together, each of
 them leaving him gravely frailer than before.        Gradually he became
 confined to his house and his garden ; he could see only very few
 friends, and usually even them only for a short time. When they
 did see him, they found only too clearly how rare and brief were his
intervals of relief from pain, though occasionally his gentleness and
his patience would almost delude them into hope.
    The last of the severe attacks began on the 8th of January ; he
seemed to be getting better when, on the 21st, his strength suddenly
began to collapse.       He died about six o'clock on the evening of
Saturday,     26th January, 1895.    The funeral took place on the suc
ceeding Friday when, in Trinity Chapel, a great assemblage, com-

embassies of Russia and America, as         well as of various learned
societies and of personal friends, gathered to pay him their last
homage of respect and reverence.
   Sufficient has been said to show that Cayley was a man of general
activities ; but his scientific work and his public duties by no means
exhausted or limited his general interests.
    It has already been stated that, as an undergraduate, he was fond
of reading novels ; this practice remained with him all his days. He
preferred a novel of the old orthodox type with a " happy ending ";
and though his greatest delight was in the older novels, a modern
book, such as 'Beside the Bonnie Briar Bash' (which he read quite
late in 1894), met with words of warm praise.            He had a good
memory, and used to discuss plots and characters with considerable
animation.       The two novelists, by whose works many English
people are divided into one or other of two classes, did not affect him
much ; Thackeray he read but did not like, and he would not
read Dickens.      His favourite authors were Scott and Jane Austen ;
all their works had been read by hlm many times, and they were read
                                                                          '
aloud to him during the long period of his illness. ' Guy Mannering
«nd ' The Heart of Midlothian,' among Scott's, and ' Persuasion,'
among Jane Austen's, were the books he liked the best.            He also
was fond of George Eliot's novels, particularly of ' Romola.'     Indeed,
though he had aversions, his taste was somewhat general. Com
mendation of a book was enough to make him willing to try it ; and
there was only one limitation to his range of novel-readings— he had
an instinctive abhorrence of anything that suggested either coarse
ness or vulgarity.
    His English reading was not confined to novels.        He had a keen
liking for many of Shakespeare's plays, notably 'Much Ado about
 Nothing,' and some of the historical dramas.            He' delighted in
 Milton's shorter poems, though he would not tolerate ' Paradise
 Lost.'     Scott's poems were frequently read ; and he had a great
                            '      '                   '
 appreciation of Byron's Tales and of Coleridge's Ancient Mariner.'
          '                     '               '                     '
 Grote's History of Greece and Macaulay's         History of England he
 read repeatedly and with zest ; and he never seemed to tire of
 Lockhart's ' Life of Scott.'
     He was also a good linguist. He knew French well ; it was a
 second writing-language       to him, as will be seen from the large
 number of papers, written in French, which occur in his collected
 mathematical papers. He read (but he did not talk) German and
 Italian with ease, and his Greek remained fresh throughout his life.
 This last power may have been due to the admiration he felt for
 Plato ; he referred to the ' Republic ' and the ' Theaetetus ' in his
  Presidential Address ; and, on the afternoon of the day of the " Greek

                                          xix
division "* in the Senate House,            I   remember finding him at home
                  '
reading the Gorgias.'
    He had the keenest interest, amounting almost to a passionate
delight, in travelling; cities of historic or artistic fame delighted
him equally with beautiful scenery.              Long after he had become an
invalid, he found a fascination in guide-books and maps ; and all his
younger friends will recall the sympathetic zeal with which he
entered into their projected journeys, and-the happy pleasure he took
in hearing them speak of recent journeyings and in recalling, with a
wonderful vivid memory, his own experiences and ideas about places
they had visited.
    Reference has been made to his early pleasure in the old Italian
masters. Yet, if any inferences can be drawn from the likings of his
later years, architecture attracted him even as much as pictures. He
had a true feeling and a clear judgment as to genuine excellence : he
sketched well, and had a quick eye for proportions, perspective, light
and shade.          One of his relaxations was to make coloured sketches of
 buildings that he liked, notably sepia drawings of some of the great
Gothic cathedrals and churches of northern France.                 He kept up his
 practice     of water-colour   painting   all  his life, and in his closing years
it proved a great solace to him at times when his strength was so far
 reduced that he could not work. He had great happiness in looking
at architectural        pictures and at books on architecture, one of his
favourites among the latter being Street's ' Brick and Marble in the
 Middle Ages.'
     Financial matters and accounts also interested him ; and only a few
 months before his death he published a brief pamphlet on bookkeep
 ing by double entry, which he has been known to declare one of the
 two perfect sciences.        He could not resist some reference to the sub
 ject in his Presidential Address, making the remark that the notion of
 a negative magnitude " is used in a very refined manner in book
 keeping by double-entry."
     His bearing was gentle, and it was marked by a courtesy that was
 unfailing. On questions of administration and in discussions, his
opinions were stated clearly and quietly.              Not that he did not hold
 decided views or that he would abate one jot of his firm, even chival-
    *  In 1891 a proposal was made by the Council of the Senate for the appointment
of a syndicate to inquire, among other things, into the expediency of allowing
 alternatives for one of the two classical languages in the Previous Examination.
 Many members of the Senate were convinced that the adoption of an alternative
 would lead to the extinction of the study of Greek except in the greater public
 schools  i they consequently opposed the proposal, which, on 29th October, 1891 was
 rejected by a great majority (525 to 185).
    It may be added that Cayley was in the minority. He allowed his signature
 to be added to a letter which was sent to the London newspapers as an appeal for
 assistance in defeating the attempt to resist inquiry.
                                                                          c 2

 Tons, defence   of what he held to be right ; but there was a judicial
 temper   in his mind which prevented the subjective element in a dis
 cussion from disturbing his equanimity.        The even balance of his
 mind enabled him to recognise and appreciate the position of one who
 differed from him, and his quiet " I do not think so " was all the more
 effective because its very calmness excluded the slightest sugg-stion
 of hostile spirit.
    His figure was spare : until his illness, he could easily endur- the
fatigue of long walks, in which he delighted, especially in hill country.
In later years it became rather bent, and he had the appearanc- of
being frail. His head was very impressive, as may be seen from his
portrait and from photographs.        In repose, and when his attention
was not concentrated upon what was passing, his face had a grave air
and the blue-grey eyes suggested that he was far away in thought ;
but when attentive or amused, and when expressing pleasure, the
eyes became singularly keen and a peculiar charm lightened up the
whole face.
    He was absolutely modest. The honours conferred on him in full
profusion never injured in the least degree the grand simplicity of
his character, never gave rise to the slightest trace of vanity, which
was alien to his nature. He rarely spoke of them, and, when he did,
it never was as of honours : they pleased him, but, perhaps, rather as
recognition of his work than as tributes to the worker. If any one
expressed appreciation of any of his papers, owing to the help it had
given, he would reply very quietly : but he did not stint the expres
sion of his pleasure at advances beyond his own results when they
were made by others. Public appearances were rather distressing to
him at first, for his disposition was retiring and he could be reserved ;
but as time wore on, duty often compelled him to take part in them.
In such cases he accepted the claim and discharged it with a straight
forward simplicity that was entirely devoid of self-consciousness ; but
he gladly avoided demonstrations whenever it was possible.
    In the spirit of his work one great quality was his generosity to
others, particularly to young men, whose work he was always willing
to recognise. He ignored the fact that he was a great mathematician
 —probably it never occurred to him to think of his doings : but it
may be doubted whether this unconsciousness of his greatness ever
proved at once more fascinating or more bewildering than when he
was discussing scientific results with young men.        He so evidently
 had his wishes centred on a single-hearted desire for the right result
 that it was difficult to conceive him approaching a question merely
a3 a learner : yet he was ever a learner.     There are few men, if any,
with not even a tithe of his scientific achievements, who have had less
of controversy or have had such immunity from questions as to
priority of discovery. This arose not merely from the indisputable

                                     xxi
priority of his results : it is partly owing to his nature. Salmon says
of him : —
        " His motto has always been • esse quam videri,' and I do not
      know any one to whom it would be more repulsive to engage in
      a personal contest by claiming for himself a particle of honour
      or of money more than was spontaneously conceded. He would
      be apt to take for his model the patriarch Isaac, who, when the
      Philistines claimed a well which he had dug, went on and dug
      another, and when they claimed that, too, went on and dug a
      third ":
an exceedingly happy description of the man the tide of whose genius
was
                        " Too full for   sound or foam."
   Some account of his work, some estimate of its character, some
indication of the original contributions made by him to his science,
may not improperly be given here.        It is, of course, impossible to
predict what his permanent influence will be upon mathematics, or
what opinion coming generations of workers will hold of him :
certainly, by his own contemporaries, he was deemed one of the
greatest mathematicians the world has seen.        Bertrand, Darboux, and
Glaisher have compared him to Euler, alike for his range, his
analytical power, and, not least, for his prolific production of new
views and fertile theories. There is hardly a subject in the whole of
pure mathematics at which he has not worked.            Some new subjects
owe   their existence to   him  ; to others he has made very definite
contributions, so that their boundaries have been enlarged often to an
enormous extent; there are few upon which he has not left the mark
of his genius.
   In several of the notices that appeared at his death he was
described as a great explorer.       Such he undoubtedly was, but he
was more. He not merely discovered new countries but he also
opened them up, so that others were able to enter into some possession
of those regions without undergoing the difficulties that he had over
come.    And if the metaphor may be carried further, he had the
restlessuess of the explorer : he could not long remain satisfied with
an achievement concluded, but must try his fortune again and else
where.
   Varying opinions have been expressed as to Cayley's style ; the
variations are largely due to preconceived views of what a mathe
 matical paper should be. It certainly is not easy to skim one of his
 papers ; any attempt to do so leads to an inadequate estimate of
 what it usually establishes. It is not difficult to read one of his papers,
even to grasp the contents well, provided proper care be devoted to       it,
 because difficulties that occur are completely solved, and nothing lies

                                        xxu
in the background to cause doubt or               suggest incompleteness.         He
has been well described by Glaisher               as an unequalled master of
analytical processes ; it is especially in       algebraical manipulation that
his strength and his facility stand out          in clear view. His sncc-ss in
this direction was achieved by a skill            that cannot be explained by
 describing  it as  due   to acquired knowledge, or to practice, or to long
 consideration and patient selection. It was rather an instinct for th-
management of the most complicated processes, and the way in which
 he controls the most elaborate calculations is sometimes little short of
extraordinary.
    As regards his methods, he does not seem to have cast about so as
to choose one rather than another.           As soon as he had thought of
any method the possible effectiveness of which he could settle almost
intuitively (" one's best things are done in five minutes," he once
said to me, in confirmation of the satisfaction            I was expressing at th-
fruitfulness of an idea that had occurred to me unexpectedly), th-
rest was the exercise of his powers. Among the methods he pre
ferred, especially during the last twenty-five years of his life, was
that of verification ; in his hands it proved a weapon of great force.
Indeed, only less remarkable than his algebraical skill, was th-
insight which enabled him to preserve the exact equivalence of all
the equations in any particular process, so that he could have reversed
each process    merely by reversing the steps as they were made, and
could have proceeded to the required theorem from the initial expres
sion of an algebraical fact. Numerous instances of this qualityin his
 work could be adduced ; it will be sufficient to refer to some parts of
his paper* " On the centro-surface of an ellipsoid."
    But though Cayley was specially happy in the treatment of alge
 braical developments, an inadequate estimate of his genius would be
 obtained by supposing that he was almost entirely an analyst. Much
 of his thinking, not a little of his writing, is completely geometrical ;
 and his contributions to line geometry, his introduction . of the
 Absolute into geometry, his continued recurrence to the methods in
 pure geometry invented by Poncelet and Chasles, should be sufficient
 to range him among geometricians.
    Moreover, even in strictly analytical work, the synthetic element is
 often not far away though it does not always appear on the surface.
 In this connexion an acute suggestion, made by Salmon and perhaps
 based upon his remembrance of their mathematical correspondence
 that lasted through many years, is confirmed by one of the Notes
                                                                           '

 Mathematical Papers.'         An enquiry sometimes begins by a compara

  that, ultimately in the development, considerable generalisations are
  effected.    Now the usual writer, in publishing the results of such an
  enquiry, draws them up in a sequence that partly marks the order of
  their connected discovery : and, in doing so, he makes his work easier
  for his readers.        But Cayley was not the usual writer. When he had
  reached his most advanced generalisations he proceeded to establish
  them directly by some method or other, though he seldom gave the
  clue by which they had first been obtained : a proceeding which does
  not tend to make his papers easy reading.                  An instance of the fact
 occurs* in his Memoir on the Theory of Matrices,' where he proves
                     '
 that a matrix satisfies an algebraical equation of its own order ; he
 proves it by verification in simple cases, but he gives no clue as to his
 line of discovery. An instance of the method occurs in a notef added
 to one of his papers, where he says that the general equations
                         {ydz}— ydr    =  0,      {xdy}—xdy      =   o,
 characteristic      of covariants       and invariants of binary q nan tics were
 initially suggested by considering the relation of the quadratic
 ax% + 2bxy + cyt and its discriminant ac—V to these equations.                     In the
 paper he drops linear transformation as connected with the covarian-
 tive property and defines a covariant as a function satisfying these
 two equations.
    His literary style is direct, simple and clear.                 His legal training
 had an influence, not merely upon his mode of arrangement but also
 upon his expression ; the result is that his papers are severe and
 present a curious contrast to the luxuriant enthusiasm which pervades
so many of Sylvester's papers.                He used to prepare his work for
publication as soon as he had carried his investigations in any subject
far enough for his immediate purpose. He found it an easy matter
to do this part of his work, and thus differed widely in experience from
those to whom the preparation of a paper is laborious even when the
results to be incorporated have been obtained. As a matter of fact, he
took the straightforward course of saying what he had to say in a clear
and simple manner, fixing his mind upon the substance and never going
out of his way in order to secure beautiful form for the presentation
of results. Yet not infrequently his papers are so admirably written
that they satisfy the exacting critics ; thus it is perhaps not too much
to affirm that his ' Sixth Memoir on Quantics '| could not be presented
in more attractive form — a character due, however, to the tendency
of his method and to his results, but not acquired by any effort
specially devoted to elaboration of clear expression. Again, a paper
once written out was promptly sent for publication ; this practice he

maintained throughout his life.      He undoubtedly formed projects
for the immediate future ; thus to the second edition* of his 'Treatise
                       '
on Elliptic Functions he intended to add a couple of chapters which,
however, remained unwritten solely for the reason that all such pro
jects were carried into effect only about the time when the need arose.
The consequence is that he has left few arrears of unfinished or un
published papers ; his work has been given by himself to the world.
   Only one other remark as to the form of his papers need be made.
Readers must be struck with the number of exact references he makes
to other writers.   It was a practice about which he had very decided
opinions : he wished not merely to make honourable acknowledgment
of indebtedness but also to give indications of the history of the sub
ject. In the latter particular he was always careful to insert in the
reference the year in which the book or the paper had appeared ; and
he steadily urged others to insert dates        in their references.
   Cayleymade additions to every important subject that lies within
the range of pure mathematics.    Their importance and their amount
have varied in different subjects ; thus on analytical geometry his
writings have a dominating influence : while on the general theory of
functions, though he knew the subject well, he has left little mark,
for he concerned himself chiefly with details such as the solution of
more or less special problems in conformal representation.        His
papers in general have such value that he is the author most
frequently quoted by the great body of current mathematicians.     A
fall record of what he has done in pure mathematics could be made
only by writing its history during the last half century ; all that
is here attempted consists of some brief indications of a selection
among his more obviously important contributions to mathematical
knowledge.
  One of the subjects with which Oayley's name will probably be
most closely associated is the theory of invariance. It is easy to cite
simple cases of what is implied by an invariantive function : two will
suffice.
   It    is known that,    in solving an ordinary algebraical equation with
literal coefficients,
                    a certain functional combination of these coefficients
(called the discriminant) must vanish in order that two roots of the
equation may be equal ; for example, the equation ax> + 2bx+c = 0,
has equal roots if (and only if) the quantity ac—b" vanishes.      When
the variable is transformed from x to y by a relation (l'x + m')y =
Ix + m, where Z, m,    m' are constants, then evidently two values of y,
                          I',
corresponding to the two equal values of x, are equal.        When x                       is
eliminated from the equation by means of the assumed relation, a new
quadratic arises having      for its variable; let
                                y                  be a'y-   2b'y+c' =

where a', U , c' depend upon a, b, c and I, m, V, to'. The two values of
y determined by this equation are equal if (and only if) the quantity
a'c' — b'-1 vanishes. But the equality of the two values of y depends
upon and is determined by the equality of the two values of x, the
latter equality being secured if the quantity ac—b' vanishes. It fol
lows that the vanishing of either of the quantities a'c'—b'2 and ac—tf
requires the vanishing of the other; and it is therefore inferred that,
when neither of them vanishes, one of them contains the other as a
factor.      When the actual calculation is made, it is found thataV— bn
is the product of ac—bi and (Iml — I'm)1, the latter being a quantity
that depends solely upon the transforming relation. Consequently it
appears that a combination of the coefficients in the original equation
exists, such that when the equation is transformed by any relation of
the type indicated and exactly the same combination of the new
coefficients is constructed, the two combinations are equal to one
another save as to a factor depending solely upon the transform
ing relation.    Such a combination of the coefficients is called an
invariant.
  Again, it is known that every curve (of degree higher than two) pos
sesses a number of points where a tangent       to the curve not merely
touches it but, having contact of one degree closer, crosses it ; and it
is found that all these points, called points of inflexion, also lie upon
another curve uniqnely derived from the first.     When the curves are
represented by means of equations, the statement is that the points of
inflexion of a curve U = 0 are given as the intersections of this curve
with a curve H = 0, the latter equation being uniquely derived from
U = 0. Now suppose that the axes, to which the curves have been
referred, are changed to another system, so that new co-ordinates x', y
are connected with the former co-ordinates by relations
                      x1                       j/                1

  A new equation TJ' =       obtained by eliminating x and y between
                             0,
these relations and   U=  0,      will now represent the curve. The change
thus made does not affect the geometrical properties of the curve ;
its points of inflexion are still given as its intersections with the curve
H = 0. But the points of inflexion of the curve represented by
U' = 0 are the intersections of this curve with another curve repre
sented by H' = 0, an equation derived from U' = 0 in exactly the
same way as H = 0 is derived from U = 0.              It therefore appears
that the associated curve H' = 0 cuts the given curve in precisely
the same points as the associated curve H = 0, a result which suggests
that the associated curves are the same.       Now H' = 0 has been
derived from U' = 0 ; but actual calculation shows that, if the rela
                                                      from H =

resulting equation    H'
                      is =  0; in other words, the relations between

                                           xxvi
 x,  y' and x, y transform         the equation H = 0, derived from U = 0,
 into the equation H' = 0, derived in the same way from U' = 0.
 Moreover, as in the former case by direct calculation, it is found that
 H', a specially constrncted function of              y' aud the coefficients in LP,
 is divisible by H, the same function of x, y and the coefficients in U ;
 the quotient being a quantity depending again only upon the constants
 in the transforming relations. Consequently it appears that a com
 bination of the coefficients and the variables in the original equation
 exists such that, when the equation is transformed by means of rela
 tions of the type indicated, and exactly the same combination of the
 new coefficients and the new variables is constructed, the two com
 binations are equal to one another save as to a factor dependent solely
 upon the transforming relations.              Such a combination of the coeffi
 cients and the variables is called a covariant.
    The first notice of such a property appears to have been made by
 Lagrange.       And Gauss discussed the invariance of the discriminants
of certain expressions when the latter are subjected to linear trans
formations.       Again, Boole in 1841 had shown that this invariantive
property belongs to all discriminants, and he gave a method of deduc
ing some other functions of this kind. Boole's paper suggested to
 Cayley a much more general subject — the permanence of invarian
tive form — so that he set himself the question of finding " all the
derivatives of any number of functions which have the property of
preserving their form unaltered after any linear transformation of
the variables."        The first set of results obtained by his investiga
tions related to invariants ; they appeared in his famous paper,* ' On
the Theory of Linear Transformations,' published half a century ago.
The second set of results related to covariants ; they appeared in the
           '
paper,f      On Linear Transformations,'           published      in the succeeding
year.    In these two papers Cayley demonstrated the general exist
ence of a number of functions, both invariants                  and covariants     (at
first he called them hyperdeterminants), which preserve their form
under linear transformation.
    These discoveries of Cayley establish him as the founder of what
is called sometimes modem algebra, sometimes invariants and co-
variants, sometimes theory of forms ; the origination of the theory is
incontestably his, and it is universally ascribed to him.
    A discovery of this general importance and complete novelty soon
attracted the attention of other workers.             It is not too much to say
that the subsequent investigations long absorbed the active interest
of many mathematicians, and, as a result, the theory has influenced all

 that domain of mathematical science which is in any way connected
with algebraical form.                Among the first to enter the field was
 Sylvester,   then    living     in   London      ; he   and Cayley were in constant
communication, alike oral and written, and carried on their work in
the most friendly relations with one another. Boole also resumed his
investigations, and both he and Salmon made substantial additions to
the theory.       The continental mathematicians also had begun their
important contributions, chief among them being Aronhold, Hesse,
and, at a later date, Hermite.                    Aronhold, indeed, devised the so-
called symbolical method, now the favourite method with German
workers ; in its origin it is nearly the same as the symbolical method
introduced by Cayley, but the subsequent developments — due largely
also to Clebsch and to Gordan — run on lines entirely different from
 Cay ley's.
    After  a time, Cayley began his series of ten memoirs on quantics ;
they must rank among the most wonderful combinations of original
researches and papers upon a single theory ever produced. They
contain a splendid exposition of the theory as already established ;
 they are full of original contributions to the subject, and as they take
account of the work done by other authors, they have the further
interest of showing how the subject grew between the appearance of
the ' Introductory Memoir in 1854 and the appearance of the ' Tenth
                                       '
Memoir ' in 1878. This is hardly the opportunity to writo a history
of the subject by apportioning among the various investigators the
sections which they respectively originated ;* yet reference should bo
made to two matters.
    First, one of the problems that greatly interested Cayley was the
determination of the complete asyzygetic system of irreducible in
variants and covariants appertaining to a binary form, that is, the
system such that every invariant and every co variant of the form can
be expressed as a rational integral algebraical function                               of the
members of the system, the coefficients in the function being
numerical only.            In his ' Second Memoir on Quantics                    f    he had
accurately    determined        the   number        (and  their   degrees)   of  the    asyzy
getic   invariants     for   binary        forms   of  orders  2,  3, 4, 5, 6 ; he   had  also
accurately inferred the number (together with their degrees aud
their orders) of the asyzygetic covariants for binary forms of orders
2, 3, 4, all these concomitants being subsequently tabulated.                          But, in

regard to the invariants of forma of order higher than 6 and the co-
variants of forms of order higher than 4, he came to the erroneous
conclusion that the respective numbers are infinite.                  The error was
not corrected nntil Gordan in his memoir,* dated 8th June, 1868,
and entitled ' Beweis dass jede Covariante und Invariante einer
biniiren Form eine ganze Function mit numerischen Coefficienteu
einer endlichen Anzahl solcher Formen ist,' showed that the com
plete system for a binary quantic of any order contains only a limited
number of members. Cayley at once returned to the question, and
having found a source of error (it was the neglected interdependence
of certain syzygies, reducing the numbers of invariants and co-
variants ; the interdependence had not previously been suspected), he
dedicated his ' Ninth Memoir on Quantics 'f (dated 7th April, 1870),
to the correction of the error and a further development of the theory
in the light of Gordan's results. His promptness in recognising and
giving immediate prominence to the work of the younger author
possibly prevented some controversy among unwise partisans ; it was
characteristic of the man.
    And, secondly, though his series of memoirs was brought to an end
with the tenth, his interest in the subject did not cease, and he fre
quently wrote upon parts of it under other titles. In particular,
Captain P. A. MacMahon's discovery of a relation of a new character
between seminvariants and symmetric functions (viz., that the lead
 ing coefficients of the covariants of a binary quantic are the same as
 the non-unitary partition symmetric functions of the roots of an
equation connected with a modified quantic) proved of the keenest
 satisfaction to him. From time to time he wrote in the ' American
 Journal of Mathematics' upon this subject and upon symmetric
 functions generally in this connection, always sympathetic and appre
ciative of the advances made by others, able to grasp and assimilate
 their ideas, but using them as a master and not as a follower.               It was
 not alone, however, to symmetric functions, upon which he had
 written long and important memoirs as early as 1857, but to many
 other cognate subjects that he extended his researches upon in
 variants and covariants.            The theory of equations of the fifth and
 higher degrees, Sturm's functions, Tschirnhausen's transformation,
 partition of numbers, Arbogast's method of derivation, skew deter-
 minantsj — to quote no others — are titles and subjects of papers, in
 all of which are investigations of great value. The reason that they
 are less known (if such be the case) than his other work in the same
 line of ideas is perhaps due to the fact that the direct theory of in-

variants and covariants was rapidly brought within the range of
students through Salmon's ' Lessons on Higher Algebra,' dedicated
by the author to Cayley and Sylvester.
- Another subject, of which he must be regarded as the creator, is
the theory of matrices.                His first memoir* upon this theory,
" wherein," to quote Sylvester,             " he
                                         f        may be said to have laid the
foundation stone of multiple quantity," was published in 1858. A
couple of isolated results had been obtained by Hamilton in 1852
through the methods of quaternions ; but they were unknown to
 Cayley at the time of his memoir, and, owing to the connection in
which they occur, they have an entirely detached aspect.
    A matrix may initially be defined as a symbol of linear operation ;
thus, when the equations
         X=     ax + by + cz,     Y  =  a'x + b'y + c'z,   Z = a"x + b"y + c"z
 are expressed in the form
              (X, T, Z) =         ( a , b , c   -£x, y, z)  = M(*, y, z),
                                     \  V,   c
                                     ", b",  c
 the symbol M is a matrix.           Cayley was the first to discuss the theory
 of such symbols as subjects of functional operation and to dispense
 with the hitherto regular return at each stage to the equations of
 substitution in which the symbol first arises ; in fact, he replaces the
 notion of substitutional operation by the notion of a new class of
 quantity.
    Matrices (being of the same order or dimension) can be added like
 ordinary algebraical quantities ; as regards multiplication, they are
 subject to the associative law, but not to the commutative law.
 Hence powers of a matrix (positive and negative, integral and frac
 tional) can be obtained, and likewise algebraical functions of a
 matrix.      It also follows that two general matrices are not convertible,    -
 that is, LM is not the same as ML save under special conditions, and
 it is a part of the theory to find the most general matrix convertible
  with a given matrix. The expression of this convertible matrix can
  be deduced by means of the fundamental equation which every matrix
  satisfies, viz., an algebraical equation of its own order, the coefficient
  of the highest term being unity, and the last term being the determi
  nant of the constants in the matrix. All these results were given by
  Cayley in his initial memoir ; and, at the same time, they were
 applied by him to obtain the most general automorphic linear trans
  formation of a bipartite quadric function, a problem which is the
  generalisation of that which requires the most general (orthogonal)

   How frnitful the subject has proved maybe inferred by noting the
subsequent investigations             of Sylvester, who has developed it on
Cayley's     lines,   and    has   added   to it many new ideas ; of Tait, who
developed the theory of quaternions on parallel lines : of the Peirces,
father and son, whose researches on linear associate algebra* gave
rise to the notion of matrices from a different source ; of Clifford and
Buchheim, who connected the theory with Grassmann's methods ; of
Laguerre, in whose memoirf the treatment of a
                                                                   " linear system "
(the same as a Cayley matrix) is similar to Cayley's ; and of many
other writers, among whom Taber should be mentioned.
   Connected with non-commutative algebraical quantities, Cayley's
researches on the theory of groups require a passing notice. He
devoted several papers to questions in this theory.                    Some of them
relate to those groups of substitutions, the introduction of which by
Galois made an epoch in the theory of equations, others of them
relate to groups of homographic transformations, particularly those
related to the polyhedral functions.               But, so far as can be seen, he
limited his published investigations to those groups which are finite
and discontinuous.
    Abstract geometry — the ideal geometry of n dimensions — is a sub
ject that he may almost be said to have created ; no other name than
his has been associated with its origin.               More than anything else, it
marks the line of difference between the kinds of homage accorded
to him. Experts regard it as an illustration of his imaginative power :
the unlearned regard it as an incomprehensible mystery.
    It finds a place among his earliest investigations, X it was steadily
present to his mind, illuminating many of his researches ; and occa

sionally it found explicit treatment, e.g., in his Memoir on Abstract
 Geometry,'§ and in his Presidential Address at Southport. The theory
 presents itself in two connections : one, as a need in analysis, the other
 as a generalisation of the ordinary geometries of two dimensions and
of three dimensions.
    The former origin can be indicated in a brief statement. When an
occasion arises for dealing with a number of variables, connected in
any manner and regarded as either variable or determinate (wholly
 or partially), the nature of the relations among them is frequently
 indicated, and often is made more easily intelligible, by associating
some geometrical interpretation with the given system of relations.

Thus the momenta!         ellipsoid is of great use in the discussion of
moments of inertia,      in  representing the motion of a body round a
fixed point when there are no impressed forces, and in other questions
in dynamics. Again, two non-homogeneous (or three homogeneous)
variables can be regarded as the co-ordinates of a point in a two-
 dimensional geometry, such as that of a plane or the surface of a
 sphere or any analytical surface; and any equation among the co
ordinates is then interpreted as representing a curve (or curves, or
 portion of a curve or curves) upon the surface.           Similarly, when
 there are three non-homogeneous (or four homogeneous) variables, they
 can be regarded as the co-ordinates of a point in a three-dimensional
 geometry, such as that of ordinary space ; corresponding to an equa- •
 tion among the variables, there is a surface (or surfaces) in space ;
 corresponding to two independent equations among the variables,
 there is a curve (or curves) in space ; and corresponding to three
 independent equations, there is a point (or points) in space.
 In such cases the analytical relations can often, with great advan
 tage, be exhibited as geometrical properties.      When the number of
 non-homogeneous co-ordinates is greater than three (or the number
 of homogeneous co-ordinates is greater than four), the circumstances
 have greater need of such a representation, while there is a greater
 difficulty in constructing some geometrical illustration ; and then it
 can be obtained in a corresponding form only by the idea of a space
 of the proper number of dimensions.           To secure the possibility of
 such a representation, it is necessary to evolve the geometry of
  multiple space.
      For example, there are four single theta-f unctions, and their squares
 are connected by linear homogeneous relations:          In order to obtain
 other properties of the functions themselves, it is convenient to regard
 them as homogeneous co-ordinates of a point in (ordinary) space ; the
  amplitude in space that then is to be selected is the quadri-quadric
 tortuous curve represented by those linear relations, viz., the curve
  which is common to two quadric cylinders with intersecting axes.
  Similarly there are sixteen double theta-functions, with corresponding
  linear relations among their squares. The associated geometry is
  fifteen-dimensional ; the manifoldness in this space to be selected for
  the discussion of the properties is the quadri-quadric two-dimensional
  amplitude common to thirteen quadric hyper-cylinders.
      An initial difficulty in the construction of an analytical geometry
  of w-dimensions is the expression of an amplitude of less than n — 1
  dimensions by means of equations that shall represent the complete
  amplitude, and nothing besides the amplitude.        It occurs in ordinary
  solid geometry, the difficulty there being to obtain the expression of
  a tortuous curve in space by means of equations that represent it
  alone.    For instance, a twisted cubic is frequently taken as the inter

                                           xxxii
 section of two quadrics having one common generator ; but the equa
 tion of the quadrics taken together represent not the cubic curve alone
but also the common generator.               And the like for other cases.
                                   '
    Cayley's purpose in his Memoir on Abstract Geometry,' already-
 referred to, was the exposition of some of the elementary principles
 of the subject.       The paper is a remarkable iustance of his power of
 presentation of abstract ideas, and of his clear precision of statement.
 Moreover, he makes it an explanatory paper ; and, in view of the
 prevailing estimate of him as an analyst, it is worthy of notice that
 the paper does not contain a single equation, and contains only a few
 symbols.      It is unnecessary to summarize its contents ; the furthest
 stage   reached    is the establishment of the notion that underlies the
 principle of duality in geometry.
    But though the necessity for hyperdimensional geometry can thus
 be met so far as it arises in connection with analysis, it is a different
 matter when the geometry is to be regarded as the generalisation of
 the geometries of two-dimensional space and of three-dimensional
 space.     Cayley's reply to his own question as to the meaning to be
 attached to hyperdimensional space is* that
          " It  may be at once admitted that we cannot conceive of a
      fourth dimension of space ; that space as we conceive of it, and
      the physical space of our experience, are alike three-dimensional ;
      but we can,      I think, conceive of space as being two- or even one-
      dimensional ; we can imagine rational beings living in a one-
      dimensional space (a line) or in a two-dimensional space (a
      surface), and conceiving of space accordingly, and to whom,
      therefore, a two-dimensional space, or (as the case may be) a
      three-dimensional space would be as inconceivable as a four-
      dimensional space is to us."
    By not     a few people the         first clause in this passage      has been
neglected and the later clauses have not always been read rightly ;
and his further remark, " I need hardly say that the first step is the
difficulty, and that granting a fourth dimension we may assume as
many more dimensions as we please," has left some readers rather
puzzled as to whether Cayley had not, after all, some mysterious
incommunicable conception of a fourth dimension.                     His position is
stated in the first clause of the former passage : his conclusion is that
hypergoometry is, and is only, a branch of mathematics.
    Before passing from the consideration of his larger contributions
to hypergeometry, it is proper to mention his introduction of the six.
co-ordinates of a line. These are six quantities connected by a homo
geneous equation af+bg + ch = 0; and as only their ratios are nsed,
they are thus equivalent to only four independent magnitudes, sufii-

cient for the unique specification of a right line. They were first
established, and primarily used by him, in connection with his new
analytical representation of curves in space ;* and ho often recurred
to the subject, devoting in particular one paperf to the calculus of
the six co-ordinates aud to a discussion of Sylvester's involution of
six lines.       It should, however, be stated that these co-ordinates pre
sented themselves independently to Pliicker ; the development of
Pliicker's theory as set forth in his memoirj ' On a New Geometry
of Space,' and in his book§ 'Neue Geometrie des Raumes,' is entirely
different from that obtained by Cayley, and it ought to be regarded as
a separate creation.            And it need hardly be remarked that while the
introduction of a line, as an entity represented by a set of co-ordinates,
leads to a new geometry of space, it is also clear that line-geometry
ciin be regarded as a geometry of four dimensions.
   Another notion, entirely due to Cayley in its first fcrm, is thnt of
the Absolute ; it was first introduced in his ' Sixth Memoir on Quan-
tics,'|| which was devoted chiefly to his investigations on the generalised
theory of metrical geometry.
   It is a known property that the angle between two lines AB, AC,
when multiplied by 2\/ — 1, is equal to the logarithm of the cross-ratio
of the pencil made up of the lines AB, AC, and (conjugate ima
ginary) lines joining A to tbe circular points at infinity: and the
measure of the angle between two lines can thns be replaced by the
consideration of a projective property of an extended system of lines.
Other examples of similar changes could easily be quoted.                              The
purpose of Cayley's theory was to replace metrical properties of a
figure or figures by projective properties of an extended system
composed of the given figure or figures and of an added figure.
   But it is not solely owing to the generalisation of distance that the
memoir is famous. It has revolutionised the theory of the so-culled
non-Euclidian geometry ; and it has important bearings on the logical
and philosophical analysis of the axioms of space-intuition.                           The
independence        and     the    importance     of  the  ideas,  originated by Cayley
in this memoir, have never been questioned ; but, as is often (and
naturally) the case with the discoverer of a fertile subject, Cayley
himself did not explain or foresee the full range of application of his
new ideas.         He did not recognise, at the time when his memoir was
first published, the beautiful identification of his generalised theory
of metrical geometry with the non-Euclidian geometry of Lobatchew-
sky and Bolyai. This fundamental step was taken by Klein in his

admirable memoir* ' Ueber die sogenannte Nicht-Euklidische Geo
metric,' which contains a considerable simplification in statement of
Cayicy's original point of view, and contributes one of tho. most im
portant results of the whole theory.                The work of the two mathe
maticians now being an organic whole, there is no advantage — at
least here — in attempting to subdivide the subject for the purpose of
specifying the exact share of each in its construction.
    The scope of the Cayley-Klein ideas may briefly be gathered from
tho following sketch.          Let A, and A2 be two points, often called a
point-pair ; they are to be either both real or, if not both renl, then
conjugate imaginaries so far as their co-ordinates are concerned.
 Let P, Q, R be three other points on the line Ai As; and let the
 symbol    (PQ)  denote
                   „ .       A,P  .  A,Q-     „ . .log A,P      . A,Q

according as A, and A, are a real point-pair, or an imaginary point- pair.
 Then it is manifest that
                              (PQ) + (QR) = (PR),
so   that the functions (PQ), (QR), (PR) satisfy the fundamental
property of the distances between P and Q, Q and R, and P and R.
Consequently (PQ) may be taken as a generalised conception of tin-
distance between the points P and Q.
    Now let a conic be described in a plane, either imaginary, say, of the
form ar + i/'+ a2 = 0 or real, say, of the form x' + y1 — z' = 0. Choosing
the latter case, let attention be confined to points lying within the
conic, so that ever)- straight line through a point cuts the conic in a
real point-pair.      Take two points, P and Q ; and let the line joining
them cut the conic in two points, A, and Ai. Then (PQ), as defined
above (the constant 7 being the same for all such lines), is the gene
ralised distance between P and Q. This conic, which has been
arbitrarily assumed, and upon which the generalised conception of
distance depends, is termed by Cayley tho Absolute.
    Cayley, however, avoided the unsatisfactory procedure of using
one conception of distance to define a more general conception. As he
himself explains more fully, | he regarded the co-ordinates of points
as some quantities which define the relative properties of points, con
sidered without any reference to the idea of distance but conceived as
ordered elements of a manifold. Thus if a,, /3,, 7,                              be the
co-ordinates of the point-pair Ai and A,, the co-ordinateb of the points

function (PQ) can then be defined as
                                27 log %m    or stY log £m      ;
the generalised idea of distance thus finds its definition without any-
antecedent use of the conception in its ordinary form.                      Cayley's view
is summed up           in his sentence* : — "      . . . the theory in effect is, that
the    metrical     properties     of a figure  are  not the properties of the figure
considered per se apart from everything else, but its properties when
considered in connection with another figure, viz. the conic termed
the absolute."
    The metrical formulae obtained when the absolute is real are iden

tical with those of Lobatchewsky's                      and Bolyai's " hyperbolic
geometry: when the absolute is imaginary the formulae are identical
                                                   "
with those of Riemann's " elliptic                     geometry ; the limiting case
between the two being that of ordinary Euclidian (" parabolic ")
geometry.
    Cayley's memoir leads inevitably to the question, as to how far pro
jective geometry can be defined in terms of space perception without
the introduction of distance. This has been discussed by von Staudtf
 (in 1847, previous to Cayley's memoir), by KleinJ and by Lindemann.§
The memoir thns points to a division of our space intuitions into two
distinct parts : one, the more fundamental as not involving the idea
of distance, the other, the more artificial as adding the idea of distance
to the former.           The consideration of the relation of these ideas to
the philosophical account of space has not yet been brought to its
ultimate issue.
    It is in analytical geometry, both of curves and of surfaces, that
the greatest variety of Cayley's contributions is to be found. There is
hardly an important question in the whole range of either subject in
the solution of which he has not had some share ; and there are many
properties our acquaintance with which is due chiefly, if not entirely,
to him.        How widely he has advanced the boundaries of knowledge
in analytical geometry can be inferred even from the amount of his
researches already incorporated in treatises such as those by Salmon,
Clebsch and Frost ; and yet they represent only a portion of what he
has done.         In these circumstances only a selection among his con-

   It is an old-established property that two curves of degrees to and n
cut in mn points, but that it is not possible to draw a curve of degree n
through any mn arbitrarily selected points on a curve of degree m.
As early as 1843, Cayley extended the property and showed that when
a curve of degree r higher than either m or n is to be drawn through
the mn points common to the two curves, they do not count for mn
 conditions in its determination, but only for a number of conditions
 smaller than mn by -£(2n-r n — r — l) (m + n—r—2).     A single addition
 was made to the theorem by Bacharach* in 1886 — taking account of
the case when the undetermining         points lie on a curve of degree
m+n    —  r— 3 ; with this exception tho algebraical problem was com
pletely solved by Cayley in his original paper.f The result is often
called Cayley's intersection-theorem.
   Another geometrical research of fundamental importance was em
bodied by him in a memoir* ' On the higher singularities of a
plane curve,' published in 18G6 :           there proved that any singu
                                                      it.   is
larity whatever on a plane algebraical curve can be reckoned as
equivalent to a definite number of the simple singularities constituted
by the node, the ordinary cusp, the donble tangent and the ordinary
inflexional tangent.    The theory has, since that date, been developed
on lines different from Cayley's — owing to its importance in other
theories, such as Abelian functions, variety in its development has
proved both necessary and useful but it was Cayley's investigations
                                                  ;

   The classification of cubic curves had been effected by Newton in
his tract     Enumeratio linearum tertii ordinis,' published in 1704:

and six species had been added by Stirling and Cramer, the total
then being 78. Plueker effected a new classification in his System                   '

  them corresponds reciprocally one (and only one) variable point of

  Rational transformations between two spaces give rational transfor
  mations between loci in those spaces ; but it is not in general true
  that rational transformations             between two loci necessarily give
  rational transformations between the spaces in which those loci exist.
  There is thus a distinction between the theory of transformation of
  spaces and the theory of correspondence of loci.             Both theories have
  occupied many investigators,            the latter in particular; and Cayley's
  work may fairly be claimed to have added much to the knowledge of
  the theory as due* to Riemann, Cremona and others.
     Farther, there may be singled out for special mention, his investi
 gations on the bitangents of plane curves and, in particular, on the
  28 bitangents of a non-singular quartic ; his developments of Pliicker'-i
  conception of foci; his discussion of the osculating conies of curves,
  and of tho sextactic points on a plane curve (these are the places
  where a conic can be drawn through six consecutive poiuts) ; his con
  tributions to the geometrical theory of the invariants and covariants
 of plane curves ; and his memoirs on systems of curves subjected to
 specified conditions.         Moreover, he was fond of making models and
 of constructing apparatus intended for the mechanical description of
 curves.      The latter finds record in various of his papers ; even so
 lately as 1893 he exhibited, at a meeting of the Cambridge Philo
 sophical Society, a curve-tracing mechanism connected with three-bar
 motion.
     All the preceding results belong to plane geometry ; no less im
 portant or less numerous were the results he contributed to solid
 geometry.         The twenty-seven lines that lie upon a cubic surface
 were first announced in his memoirf 'On the Triple Tangent Planes
 of Surfaces of the Third Order,' published in 1849, after a correspon
 dence between Salmon and himself.                 Cayley devised a new method
 for the analytical expression of curves in space by introducing into
 the representation the cone passing through the curve and having its
 vertex at an arbitrary point.             Again, by using Pliicker's equations
 that connect the ordinary (simple) singularities of plane curves, he
 deduced equations connecting the ordinary (simple) singularities of

  He greatly extended Salmon's theory of reciprocal surfaces; and, re
  suming a subject already discussed by Schliifii, he produced* in 18o9
  his ' Memoir on Cubic Surfaces,' in which he dealt with their com
 plete classiK cation. Many of his memoirs are devoted to the theory
 of skew ruled surfaces, or scrolls as he called them. Our knowledge
 of geodesies, of orthogonal systems of surfaces, of the centro-surface
 of an ellipsoid, of the wave-surface, of the 16-nodal quartic surface,
  not to mention more, is duo in part to the extensions he achieved.
  It is difficult to indicate parts of the general theory of surfaces and
 of twisted curves that do not owe at least something and frequently
 much to his labours ; a mere reference to the index of a book like
 Salmon's ' Solid Geometry ' will show how vast has been his
 influence.
      One   group of subjects interested him throughout his life, the
 theory of periodic functions, in particular, of elliptic functions : it was
 to the latter that his only book was devoted.                        But in a subject, the
 main lines of which were established so definitely before he began to
 write,f it is impossible, without entering into great detail, to mark out
the contributions that are directly due to him.                        When a theory is in
such a stage as was that of elliptic functions about 18 12, the work of
one writer sometimes helps to fill the gaps left by that of another,
sometimes develops another writer's results from a different point of
view ; the composite theory depends, in part, upon the coordination
of complementary results.

in publication§ for nearly fifteen years, attracted Cayley's atten

where w = (m, n) = mQ + nX, the ratio fl : Y is not real, and the
product is taken for all positive and all negative integer values of m
and of n between positive and negative infinity, except simultaneous
zero values.       He showed that such products can be used to obtain
Jacobi's elliptic functions by constructing fractions such as
and he also showed that the actual value of any product involves an
exponential factor elB*2, where the value of the constant B depends
upon the relation* between the infinities of m and of n. The results
were of definite importance at the time of their discovery, and they
still hold their place. But the form of the doubly-infinite product
has been modifiedf by Weieratrass, who takes

 of relation between the infinities of m and of n. Owing to the latter
 simplification, Cayley's results are, as he himself remarked, J partly
superseded      by those of Weierstrass.
    Cayley had great admiration for the works of both Abel and
                                                                             '
Jacobi ; he had begun to read the latter's ' Fundamenta Nova imme
 diately after his degree.            The prominent position occupied in that
 work by the theory of transformation naturally attracted his interest ;
 and, even as early as 1844 and 1846, he wrote short memoirs upon
 the subject, obtaining in one of them a function, due to Abel ami
 now known as the octahedral function. Further memoirs of a similar
 tenor appeared occasionally ; they deal chiefly with transformation as
 concerned with the known differential relation of the form
            {(l_^)(l_/,V)}-1^              =   M{(l-j')(l-\y)     }-*dy.
 The contributions made to the transformation theory by Sohnke,
 Joubert, and Hermite, as well as Jacobi's original investigations, all
 depend upon the use of transcendental functions of the quantity
   * This is sometimes expressed differently, as follows.   Points iire taken having
m and » for their Cartesian co-ordinates ; those which occur for infinite values
of  m and    of » lie at infinity, and may be considered to lie upon a curve alto
gether   at infinity, the shape of which is determined by the relation between
the infinities of m and of i.
   The value of the constant B is said to depend upon the shape of this bound-
in!; curve.

  discussed by Jacobi, but the extension to the less simple cases proved
  difficult.          Cayley's

  clearer light than before.              But though he made a distinct advance in
  dealing       with    particular     cases,  he still found it necessary to use the
  </-transcendents for making any definite advance in the general case.
                                                                                            -
  And the same compulsion occurs in the chapters of his ' Treatise
  (dated 1876), where transformation                       is discussed     at considerable
 length.
       He resumed his investigations in 1886, still dealing with the
 alg.-bra'cal method, but applying it to a simplified form of elliptic
 integral due to Brioschi. Though the problem is not solvedt com
 pletely for the general case, he has devised a method which is
 effective at least in part ; it easily leads to new results connected with
 the modular equations in the known simpler cases previously solved.

 obtained in the Fundamenta Nova by a long and cumbrous process ;
and he proceeded to the construction of the linear differential equa
tions satisfied by the theta-functions.                    Except, however, in so far as
they arise        in   the   transformation      theory, they do not appear to have
occupied him until about 1877. In that year and in the succeeding
 years he wrote a number of papers dealing with the theta-functions
us on an independent basis and not as a detail in elliptic functions.
Though the investigations are concerned with ^>-tuple functions, yet.
partly for simplicity, and partly in order to secure the greater
detailed development of the theory, the papers deal chiefly with the
cases p        =   1, p =     2.
     Previous        to Cayley's investigations,          the most valuable algebraical
results in this subject            were    those   of   Rosenhain§ and G6pcl,jj which

 Abelian functions of two variables, and those of Weierstrass, developed
by Konigsberger* to give the "addition-theorem."                        Proceeding in
his Memoir on the Single and Double Theta-functions 'f more by
       '
GOpel's mothod than by Roseuhain's, Cayley resumes the whole theory.
He pays special attention to the relations among the squares of the
functions and to the derivation of the biquadratic relation among four
of the functions, which is the same as the equation of Kummer's
sixteen-nodal quartic surface. To this relation aud to the geometry
of this associated surface he frequently recurred, both specifically in
isolated papers and generally in researches upon quartic surfaces.
    As connected, in part, with elliptic functions, his investigations on
the porism of the in- and circumscribed polygon should be mentioned.
The porismatic property of two conies, viz., that they may be related
to each other so that one polygon (and, if one polygon, then an
infinite number of polygons) can be inscribed in one and circum
scribed about the other, is due to the geometrician Poncelet.                      The
special case when the conies are two circles had been discussed
analytically by Jacobi,J using elliptic functions for the purpose.
Cayley undertook, first in 1853, the analytical discussion of the most
general case of two conies, also using elliptic functions ; and he
obtained§ the relations, necessary for the porism, for the several
polygons as far as the enneagon.                   And it may be remarked, as a
characteristic instance of Cayley 's habit of proceeding to general
cases, that he did not leave the matter at this stage.                  In a memoir||
'                                                                        '
   On the Problem of the in- and circumscribed Triangle he raises the
question as to the number of polygons which are such that their
 angular points lie on a given curve or given curves of any order and
their sides touch another given curve or given curves of any class.
 Using the theory of correspondence, he solves the question com
pletely in the case of a triangle — taking account of the fifty-two ca.ses
 that arise throagh the possibility of two curves, or more than two
curves, being one and the same curve.
     From time to time Cayley turned his attention to questions in
 theoretical dynamics, choosing them as subjects of his lectures
 during his earlier years as professor. Among them may be men
 tioned his investigations on attractions, specially those on the attrac
 tion of ellipsoids, to which he devotes five memoirs,^ discussing the
 nu-thods ot Lrgendre, Jacobi, Gauss, Laplace, and Rodrigues ; and his

 evaluations or reductions of multiple definite integrals connected with
 attractions and potentials in general, particularly his ' Memoir on Pre-
 putentials,'* in which he discusses the reduction of the most general
 integral of the type that can occur in dealing with the potential-
 problem related to hyperspace. He also frequently recurred at inter
 vals, before drawing up his report about to be quoted, to the considera
 tion of the mot ion of rotation of a solid body about a fixed point under
 no forces. By introducing Rodrigues's co-ordinates into the equations
 of motion he was able to reduce the solution of the problem to quadra
 tures ; but the final solution of this case, in the most elegant form, is
 due to Jacobi himself ; it involves single theta- functions.            It may be
 remarked that the next substantial advance made in the theory of
motion of a body under the action of forces is dne to the late Madame
 Sophie Kovalewsky, who, in a memoirf- to which the Bordin Prize
of 1888 was awarded by the Paris Academy of Sciences,                           has
shown that the motion can, in a particular case, be determined in
terms of double theta-functions when the body rotating round a fixed
point is subject to the force of gravity.
    Sometimes, after reading widely upon a subject, Cayley would
draw up a report recounting the chief researches in it made by the
great writers. It occasionally happens in the development of a theory
that periods come when the incorporation and the marshalling of
created ideas seem almost necessary preliminaries to further pro
gress.     Cayley was admirably fitted for work of this kind, owing not
only to his faculty of clear and concise exposition, but also to his wide
and accurate knowledge.             Among such reports, two are of particular
                          '
importance       ;  his     Report on the recent progress of theoretical
dynamics 'J and his 'Report on the progress of the solution of
certain special problems of dynamics '§ have proved of signal service
to other writers and to students.             His knowledge and his power of
summarising are shown also in some interesting articles on mathe
matical topics, written by him for the ' Encyclopaedia Britannica.'
   Cayley also had a great enthusiasm for some of the branches of physi
cal astronomy. Some idea of the value and importance of his labours in
this subject, particularly in connection with the development of the
disturbing function in both the lunar theory and the planetary theory,
and with the general developments of the functions that arise in
elliptic motion, may be gathered by consulting the series of memoirsjj
which he communicated to the Royal Astronomical Society.

     Special reference should be made to one of Cayley's astronomical
papers.       In 1853 Adams had made a new investigation of the value
of the secular acceleration of the moon's mean motion, and, taking
account of the variation in the eccentricity of the earth's orbit, had
obtained a value which differed from that given by Laplace.                       Unfor
tunately, Adams's result was disputed by some of the great school of
French physical astronomers, notably by Pontecoulant, and, in con
sequence, some hesitation about acceptance was felt by some English
astronomers, perhaps not unnaturally in view of the severe criticisms
expressed.        Cayley made au independent investigation of the neces
sary approximations, and devised a new method for introducing
the variation of the eccentricity in question — a method effective per
haps chiefly owing to the instinct and power with which he carried
out the laborious analysis required.                The memoir, in which he em
bodied his results and which was entitled ' On the secular acceleration
of the moon's mean motion,'* completely confirmed the value obtained
by Adams, and was of substantial help in settling the controversy.
    And, in the last place, the preceding sketch of Cayley's contribu
tions to mathematical science seems to refer, for the most part, only
 to long memoirs.            Yet it must not therefore be supposed that his
 shorter papers (which are very numerous) can safely be neglected.
 Sometimes he wrote a simple note not so much to convey new results
 as to set out his view of some particular theorem ; these notes were
 always fresh and often suggestive.                He was specially gratified when
 he had obtained a brief solution of some question, and his quite
 short papers frequently contain most important results.                             For
                                           '
 instance, in the brief paperf               On the theory of the singular solu
 tions of differential equations of the first order,' he was the first
 to give a clear exposition of the theory which in Boole's book had
 been left in an imperfect state.                   He there obtained the broad
 essential results of the theory, and it is particularly on his work, and
on the work of Darboux published very soon after Cayley's, that
ulterior researches are based.
     What has been said may be sufficient to point out Cayley's place
 among the mathematicians of his time, and to indicate the services
he rendered to the science which he loved so well.                   But he was more
than a mathematician.                With a singleness of aim, which Words
worth could have chosen for his ' Happy Warrior,' he persevered to
the last iu his nobly lived ideal. His life had a significant influence
on those who knew him : they admired his character as much as they
respected his genius : and they felt that, at his death, a great man
had passed from the world.                                                  A. R. F.

    In Sib Henby Cbeswicke Rawlinson, Bart., G.C.B., England         has
 lost one of her most brilliant Oriental scholars, and one of her most
 distinguished Anglo-Indian statesmen.     He was born in the year 1810,
 being the second son of Mr. Abram Tysack Rawlinson, of Chadlington,
 Oxfordshire, who was descended from an old Lancashire family,
 members of which have represented both that county and the borough
 of Liverpool in Parliament.       Having passed his school-days at
 Wrington, Somerset, and at Ealing, he joined the service of the
 East India Company, at Bombay, in 1827, being then about seventeen
 years of age. He at once devoted himself with much energy to the
study of Oriental languages, and within a year of his arrival in India
 was appointed interpreter to the 1st Bombay Grenadiers.         While
 serving in Bombay and Poonah he acquired great proficiency both in
 Persian and Mahrattee, and in 1833 he was one of a number of
 British officers sent by the Governor-General of India to aid the
Persian Government in reorganizing its array. It was here that he
first became acquainted with those archaeological remains to which
he ever after devoted so much attention.     A rupture with Persia led
to his being withdrawn from that country, which he left in 1838.
He played an important part in the Afghan war, which soon followed,
having been appointed political agent at Kandahar in 1840. At the
 conclusion of the war in 1843, Rawlinson became British Consul for
Bagdad, and subsequently Consul- General, an office which enabled
him to return to the study of those Persian and Assyrian antiquities
with which he had been fascinated.      In 1856 he returned to England
and was made a K.C.B. and a Director of the East India Company
on the nomination of the Crown.       In 1858 he became a member of
the Council of India, and in the following year was sent as envoy to
the Court of Teheran, a post he occupied for abont a year. Of his
subsequent short career in Parliament and of his political views with
regard to the encroachments of Russia in the East, it is hardly neces
sary to speak.
   In recognition of his incessant labours and valuable discoveries
in connexion with Assyrian archaeology he was elected a Fellow of
the Royal Society in 1850.      It was indeed in that year that his
"
   Commentary on the Cuneiform Inscriptions of Babylonia and
          "
Assyria was published.
    Since that time 45 years have passed ; but it is now 60 years
since Rawlinson, in 1835, began to make copies of the inscribed
tablets of Elwend, so that he had already laboured 15 years in
what was then a field of absolute mystery. When once a science has
become thoroughly developed, we are always too apt to forget the
work of those who laid the foundations on which others have built,
and whatever may have been the labours of Grotefend, Iforris,
Hincks, Westergaard, or L&ssen, it is to Rawlinson that the merit is

                                           xlv
 due of having been the first to read and make connected sense of the
 inscriptions. Lassen had found out the values of most of the Persian
 signs, and Grotefend laid down a plan ; but Rawlinson put botli
 together and added the values of the missing signs from analogous
 forms in Zend, Pehlevi, and Sanskrit.               By immense personal exer
 tions,* and at no small risk, he was able to obtain transcripts of the
 inscriptions engraved on the precipitous rock of Behistun at a height
 of 500 feet above the plain, and having mastered the old Persian
 character, he obtained a key by which he was enabled to unlock many
 oF the secrets of Persian history, while the Babylonian version of the
 Behistun text, together with the newly-discovered syllabaries and
 sign-lists from Nineveh, enabled him to bring to light many historical
 facts from the Assyrian inscriptious at Khorsabad and Nineveh
 (Kouyunjik).
     Some misunderstanding has existed about Bawlinson's share in the
 decipherment both of Persian and Semitic cuneiform texts, and it
 may be as well here to recall a few of the more important facts in
 connexion with his work.            There is abundant evidence that he was
 working at the texts of Elwend so far back as 1835, and in 1836 he
 had mastered all that Grotefend had made out, even succeeding in
 correcting some of the results obtained by him in 1804.                  The short
 inscriptions of Elwend were, however, insufficient for Rawlinson's
 purpose, and so he boldly attacked the long text inscribed on the
 rock at Behistun ; and at the end of 1836 he had translated several
 passages in it.       In 1837 he began to correspond with the Royal
 Asiatic Society with a view of sending them a translation of the
 whole text ; in 1838 he sent in a general statement of his discovery,
 and in 1839 his complete manuscript was ready for despatch. It
  will be remembered that Lassen published his work on the Ancient
  Persian cuneiform texts in 1836, and there have not been wanting
 those who asserted that without it Rawlinson could never have obtained
 his excellent results, inasmuch as he was indebted to it for the pho
 netic values of many of the Persian cuneiform characters. This
 is not the place to adduce minute proofs of the original character of
 Rawlinson's work, but it may be stated as a well-known fact that the
 discovery of several phonetic values was peculiarly his own, and that
by applying other values to the cuneiform characters in question
than his own, he could not have translated the Behistun text. More
over, Lassen's book did not come into Rawlinson's hands until two
years after his translation had been made and sent in to the Royal
Asiatic Society. As soon as political troubles broke out in Persia in
    • An idea of the difficulties encountered in this work may be obtained from the
fact that MM. Costo and Flandin, who were sent out by the French Government
to copy the Behistun text, returned empty-handed        and reported the rock to be
inaccessible.

1839-40 Rawlinson 's studies stopped perforce, and lie was unable to
renew them until he took up his residence as British Consul in Bagdad
early in 1844.     Soon after, the printing of his translation of the
BehiRtnn text and commentary began, and two years later the work
appeared. When we have awarded all dne praise to all other labourers
in the field of Persian cnneiform research, the fact remains that
Kawlinson was the first man to translate into a European language
two hundred lines of Persian cuneiform and to give a correct gram
matical analysis and commentary. Three years later, i.e., in 1849, he
produced a translation of the Babylonian or Semitic section of the
Behistun text, which was printed in 1851. In this marvellous work
he gave a list of abont 250 cuneiform characters with their phonetic
and ideographic values.
    Another triumph of this distinguished          man ought not to b«
forgotten.    When   the Trustees  of  the British   Museum commissioned
hi in to publish copies of the Assyrian cuneiform texts in the British
Museum, the late Mr. Fox Talbot suggested that the great inscription
of Tiglath-Pileser I. should be translated by more than one cuneiform
scholar in order that a comparison of the translations might show if
experts had arrived at any well-grounded system of interpretation
which was known and accepted by them generally.          The Royal Asiatic
 Society asked Rawlinson, Hincks, Oppert, and Fox Talbot to send in
translations under sealed covers which were to be opened simul
 taneously by a committee of examination which included Dean Milman.
 Dr. Whewell, SirG. Wilkinson, Mr. Grote, Mr. W. Cureton, and Prof.
 H. H. Wilson. After the specified time (one month) the translations
 were sent in, and the Committee found that Rawlinson and Fox Talbot
 had translated the whole text, Hincks one half, and Oppert rather less,
 and that the general agreement of the translations was such as to
 leave no doubt in the minds of the examiners that the interpretation
 of cuneiform now rested on a thoroughly scientific basis, which, it may
 be added, was founded chiefly by Rawlinson.
     In 1851, by means of a grant from the British Museum, he super
 intended systematic explorations        at Kouyunjik, with the aid of
 Mr. Horruuzd    Rassam,  and  many   valuable  relics were obtained, which
  are now in the British Museum.        The site is still under the control
 cf the Trustees of the Museum, and it is to be regretted that from
  financial causes further investigations cannot now be properly carried
 on.    The five volumes of
                              " The Cuneiform Inscriptions of Western
  Asia," which, with the successive assistance of Messrs. Edward Norris,
  George Smith, and Theophilus Pinches, he prepared for the Trustees
 between 1861 and 1884, testify to the value of these excavations and
  to the untiring energy of Sir Heury Rawlinson.           In 1876 he was
  elected a Trustee of the British Museum, and was on all occasions ready
  to promote the interests of that institution in every possible manner.

    Of his independent works, principally of travel in the East, and of
 his numerous contributions to the Journals of the Royal Asiatic and
 Geographical Societies, of the former of which he was for many
years Director, and of the latter President, it seems needless to speak.
His merits     as a discoverer were recognized by honorary degrees con
ferred upon bim by the Universities of Oxford, Cambridge, and
Edinburgh, by the Prussian Order pour le Merite, and by his foreign
membership of the Institute of France, Academic des Inscriptions.        It
is to him and to the late Sir Heury Layard that this country is
indebted for the most extensive and important collection of the
historic remains cf the ancient kingdoms of the East that has ever
been brought together.
                                                                   J. E.
    Valentine     Ball, LL.D., C.B.,   the distinguished Director of the
 National Museum at Dublin, whose death we have to deplore, was the
second son and fourth child of the well-known naturalist, Dr. Robert
Ball, who died in 1857. His elder brother is Sir Robert Ball, now of
 Cambridge, and his younger brother is Dr. Charles B. Ball, of Merrion
 Square, Dublin.      Dr. Valentine Ball was born on July 14, 1843, at
 No. 3, Granby Row, Dublin, a house well known in those days as a
 leading centre of intellectual resort in that metropolis.    He was edu
cated first at a private school by Dr. Brindley,at Chester, and afterwards
by Rev. Dr. Benson, in the early days of Rathmines School. Valentine
 Ball entered Trinity College in 1860, and about the same time he was
appointed by the late Master Fitzgibbon to a clerkship in the office of
 the Examiner in Chancery.          His University career was not an
 eventful one in the academic sense, for the duties of his office in the
 Four Courts did not leave him sufficient time for more than obtaining
an ordinary degree.       A taste for scientific pursuits was, however, so
 marked, that in 1864, when he was twenty-one years of age, he was
 offered a position in the Geological Survey of India, then under the
 direction of one of his father's oldest friends, Dr. Thomas Oldham.
Ball felt that this would give him the opportunity which he wanted
for the study of Nature in a wide field, and accordingly he went to
India. His duties as a geological surveyor often led him into very
unfrequented parts of our great Oriental possessions, and frequently,
for many months together, he lived in camp in the jungle, apart from
all other Europeans. Wherever Ball travelled he utilised his oppor
tunities to the utmost; indeed, throughout his life, his diligence could
hardly have been surpassed, and nothing worthy of notice that came
within his range was unobserved and uurecorded. It was presently
apparent that the young geological surveyor was not only able to
fulfil his duties in making a careful investigation of the rocks and of
their economic value, but that various other branches of natural

  history   were simultaneously sedulously cultivated by him.           He
  became an authority on the birds of India, he wrote upon the various
  jungle products, he devoted much attention to anthropology ; see, for
  example,   his study of the Songhal and other native races.           He
  recorded their racial peculiarities, and discussed their affinities, he
  made himself acquainted with their languages ; paper after paper
  flowed from his ready pen, describing well and describing accurately
  aspects of our Indian Empire which but few, indeed, have had both
  the opportunity of observing and the capacity of recording.      Steadily
  the reputation of the Indian geologist advanced in scientific circles.
  He was elected a fellow of the Calcutta University in 1872. He
  devoted a short vacation to extending his travels to the Andaman and
  Nicobar Islands, and there noted what seemed interesting and novel,
  and at every opportunity he was increasing the collection of objects
  which illustrated his studies in anthropology and natural history.
  His first important volume, ' Jungle Life in India,' gives a record of
  his travels and summarises the results of his multitudinous papers.
  This work was followed by an elaborate treatise on the economic
 geology of India. His fame had by this time become so firmly
 established that on the resignation of the Chair of Geology in the
  University of Dublin by Rev. Dr. Haughton, Valentine Ball was
appointed his successor.     Thus was brought to a close his connexion
 of seventeen years with the Geological Survey of India.       Summoned
 thus to a post of dignity and influence as a Professor in his own
 University in his native city, Ball threw himself with characteristic
ardour into the discharge of his new duties. He attracted around him
 at the outset a band of diligent students, and in 1882 became a fellow
of the Royal Society.      The Professor's intimate acquaintance with
 Indian geology led to his being frequently consulted by the Indian
Government on various scientific or economic questions.           He was,
 indeed, on one occasion requested         to visit and report upon the
 Burmese ruby mines, but he had to decline on account of his other
duties. Much of his knowledge on the practical aspect of Indian
geology was published in his book on the ' Diamonds and Gold of
India.' His valuable services were recognised by the Indian Govern
ment, and they awarded him a special pension, notwithstanding
that his residence in India fell short by several years of what would
ordinarily have entitled him to such a privilege.        But the time was
approaching     when  he was  to be  called   to the important position in
which his chief life-work was to be accomplished.           In September,
1883, Ball was appointed to the post of Director of the new Science
and Art Museum about to be established in Dublin.          He accordingly
surrendered his professorship of geology and mineralogy in the
University of Dublin after only two years' tenure. He has placed on
  record that the reason for accepting the directorship and relinquish-

                                   xlix
ing a post of much greater ease and freedom of action was mainly
this, that the management of a museum of wide range had been the
dream of his life, and the occasions when he had had temporary
charge of museums in India, including that of the Imperial Museum
in Calcutta, only whetted his long cherished desire for a permanent
appointment of the kind. The new Director devoted himself with
much vigour to the great work of developing the Museum, as well as
the affiliated institutions of the National Library, the Botanic
Gardens, Glasnevin, and the School of Art. It would bo impossible
in this place to chronicle fully the growth of the collection under the
Director's charge.    Suffice it to say that there has been a steady
influx of most valuable objects to the spacious halls in Kildare Street.
We need only mention, for instance, two collections each absolutely
unique of its kind. First of all there are the Irish antiquities,
including the famous gold ornaments from the Royal Irish Academy,
while the more recent important acquisition has been due to the
kindness of the authorities of Trinity College, who have deposited
there a superb collection of weapons and implements, brought, in part
at least, from the South Sea Islands by Captain Cook.      In the collec
tion of the multitudinous objects now brought together in the Museum,
and in the arrangements of their display, the late Director, assisted
as he was by a diligent and skilful staff, took the liveliest and most
absorbing interest.
    Though his death was premature, yet it may be said that he lived
long enough to see the substantial completion of his life's task. The
arrangement of the new Museum will remain as a testimony to his
work.
    The University of Dublin conferred on him the honorary degree of
 Doctor of Law, and by Her Majesty he was made a Companion of
 the Bath.   With most of the scientific societies of Dublin Dr. V. Ball
 was in intimate association ; especially will he be remembered in
 connexion with the Royal Zoological Society, of which he was the
 assiduous Secretary for so many years, and of which the welfare was
 so dear to him.
    In 1879, Dr. Ball married the eldest daughter of the late John
 Stewart Moore, of Moyarget, Co. Antrim.         He leaves a family of
 four young children.     For some years Dr. Ball's health had been
 failing. Towards the middle of June serious symptoms were mani
 fested, and he passed away peacefully on the afternoon of June 15, at
 his residence, 23, Waterloo Road, Dublin.
                                                             R. S. B.
    John Whitakeb Hulke      was born   in the year 1830, and died on
 Tuesday, the 19th of February, 1895.       The immediate cause of his
 death was broncho-pneumonia following influenza, and apparently
                                                                 h

caused   by a chill taken when attending, in the early morning, a
serions case at the Middlesex Hospital. Mr. Hulke was the son of
a well-known surgeon of Deal, in which town his family had resided
for several generations, and where his mortal remains are now laid
to rest. Mr. Hulke received his early education at a private board
ing school, where it appears he was very unhappy, and he was
therefore quite ready to appreciate the kindness which, notwith
standing the roughness of the school life, he experienced at the
Moravian College at Neuwied, where his education was continued
from 1843 to 1845 ; it was here that he gained his intimate know
ledge of the German language, and the groundwork of his acquaint
ance with natural history ; here also, in the Eifel district, his interest
in geology was first awakened.
    Returning to England, he studied at King's College School during
1846 and 1847, entering the medical department of that college in
1849, where for the following few years he underwent his medical
training.
    In  1855   he was attached  to the medical staff of     the   General
Hospital in the Crimea, and in March of that year was doing duty
in the English Hospital at Smyrna.     Here the medical officers appear
to have had comparatively comfortable quarters, but often very few
patients.    Some excitement was kept up by a band of brigands
roaming the neighbourhood, and on one occasion, a doctor of the town,
having been carried off by them in the hope of a ransom, Mr. Hulke
was among the first to start to the rescue.       In September he left
Smyrna for the camp before Sebastopol in the hope of gaining more
experience, and here, during the winter of 1855-56, owing to the
severe climate and other causes, he had a very trying time, on more
than one occasion narrowly escaping the shots of the Russians, but,
as he himself has said, gaining in those few months years of expe
rience.    Letters sent home to Deal at this time contain graphic
accounts of his surroundings, bnt no word of complaint of the hard
ships undergone.
    On returning to England he became a Fellow of the Royal College
of Surgeons, and received the appointment of Assistant-Surgeon to
the Royal Ophthalmic Hospital, Moorfields, in 1857. His well-known
and classical essay on ' Diseases of the Retina was written soon
                                                    '
afterwards, and was awarded the Jacksonian Prize of the Royal
 College of Surgeons in 1859.     Not long after this he published a
 treatise on the ophthalmoscope, an instrument in use in Germany,
 but at that time not known to English practitioners.      Besides other
 works relating to the diseases of the eye, Mr. Hulke made many con
 tributions to general surgery, which were published in the ' Medico-
 chirurgical Transactions,' and elsewhere.
    In the year 1862 Mr. Hulke was appointed Surgeon to the Middle

                                     li
sex Hospital, and it was here that the chief of his life's work may be
said to have been accomplished.         His skill as an operator became
widely known, while the keen interest which he took in his patients,
and his kindly sympathy with them were best appreciated by those
who in their trouble and sickness were so fortunate as to be under
his care. He eventually became senior surgeon to this hospital, a
post he retained until the time of his death.
    In 1876 he was appointed Examiner to the Royal College of
Surgeons, and in 1880 became a member of the Court of Examiners ;
in 1881 he was elected a member of the Council, in 1888, a Vice-
President, and in 1893 President, which latter position he held at the
time of his death. In 1883 he was President of both the Pathological
and Geological Societies.
     Mr. Hulke was admitted to the Fellowship of the Royal Society in
 1867, his claim being based exclusively on researches relating to the
anatomy and physiology of the retina in man and the lower animals,
particularly the reptiles. These were embodied in two papers in the
'                              '
   Philosophical Transactions (" On the Anatomy of the Fovea centralis
of the Human Retina," and " On the Chameleon's Retina "), and in
 a paper on the " Retina of Amphibia and Reptiles," in the first volume
of the ' Journal of Anatomy and Physiology.'           These are charac
 terised by patient and conscientious minuteness in the working out
 and description of details and cautious reserve in drawing inferences.
 Probably the most important and permanently valuable of Mr. Hulke's
 researches was the one relating to the retina of the chameleon, which
  the abundant material at his disposal enabled him to elaborate in a
 more complete manner than had before been possible.
     In judging of the value of histological work done nearly a genera
  tion ago, it must be remembered that at that time the minute
 anatomist had to work alone.       Hulke was the first in this country
  to follow in the footsteps of Max Schnltze and Heiurich Miiller —
 the first to employ those, at that time, new methods of research
  which have rendered it possible to acquire that relatively perfect
 knowledge of the fine structure of the organs of special sense which
 we now possess.      If the work of Hulke and his contemporaries is
 unknown, as no doubt it is to the student of the present day, it is
 not because it was unimportant, but rather because the anatomical
 facts then made out for the first time with very imperfect means of
 investigation, have been presented to him in sharper outline by men
 who, after all, only built on the foundations laid by their predecessors.
 Hulke very soon after he became a Fellow of the Royal Society
 transferred his allegiance to geology, between which and his profession
 as a consulting surgeon his energies were thenceforth to be divided.
 Had he continued his anatomical studies he would without doubt
 have attained to the foremost rank among physiological anatomists.
                                                                h 2

    During the quarter of      a  century which followed his first contribu
tions to geological science, Mr. Hulke found leisure to apply himself
to research in this field, notwithstanding his constantly increasing
practice.    He did so to so good a purpose that he became a palae
ontologist of no ordinary merit.             His knowledge of comparative
anatomy,    and  especially    of  osteology,  enabled him rapidly to grasp
the meaning of structures presented by the remains of fossil verte
brates  ; and this, combined with a naturally keen perception and a
rigid adherence to facts, soon caused his opinion on palaeontological
matters to be sought, and held in the highest estimation.
    It was the fossil Reptilia which more especially occupied Mr. Hulke's
attention, and his numerous papers on their osteology are a monu
ment to his industry. Many of the fossils which he described were,
in part at least, freed from the matrix by his own facile chisel ; and
in this mechanical work, as he himself has said, he often found
relaxation when his mind was over-wrought by professional anxieties.
    Mr. Hulke's well-earned vacations were often spent at localiti-s of
geological interest, more especially with a view to working out the
fossils which might be obtained. For this purpose he paid many
visits to Brook, in the Isle of Wight, from whence have come many
specimens of Wealden Dinosauria ; near here also, at Brixton, was
preserved the unique collection of these Wealden reptiles, made by
the Rev. W. Fox. For many years Mr. Hulke was the only palaeonto
logist who had free access to this collection ; and he did much good
work in bringing to light its hidden treasures, which otherwise
remained almost unknown until after the death of their owner, when
they were transferred to the British Museum.
    In the year 1868 Mr. Hulke was elected a Fellow of the Geological
 Society of London, and from that time onwards the pages of the
 Quarterly Journal of that Society were frequently euriched by his
writings. No fewer than six of his papers were published in the two
 volumes which followed the year of his election, and these with one
 exception were descriptions of Saurian remains from the Bammeridge
clay of Dorset.      Several other papers on reptiles from the same
 locality appeared in subsequent volumes ; but Mr. Hulke was more
particularly interested in the Dinosauria, and many contributions to
the osteology of this interesting group of reptiles have appeared in
                             '
the - Quarterly Journal          of the Geological Society, and in the
 '                                 '
   Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.
    Our first knowledge of the cranium of Iguanodon was due to
Mr. Hulke's work upon a specimen from the Isle of Wight, which did
not include the facial bones, and the affinities of which it was by no
means easy to determine.
    In 1873 and 1874 he made additions to our knowledge of the small
Wealden Dinosaur, which had been named by Professor Huxley

                                    liii
Hypsilophodon Foxii ; and in 1882 a still more important memoir on
 the same species was published in the ' Philosophical Transactions.'
    In 1874 and 1876 Mr. Hulke showed that a certain bone of
 Iguanodon, which had been regarded as a scapula, was really a part
 of the pelvis ; and, indeed, it proved to be the remarkable pubis of
 that reptile, which so nearly resembles that of a bird.
    In 1879 the two genera, Poikilopleuron and Megalosaurns, were
 shown by Mr. Hulke to be one and the same Dinosaurian genus. In
 the same year he described the remains of a new Wealden Dinosaur
 under the name of Vectisaurus Valdensis ; and in 1880 he made
 known one of the most perfect Iguanodons discovered in this country
 which had been found in the Kimmeridge clay of Cumnor ; this was
 named Iguanodon Prestwichii.
    In the following year there appeared in the ' Philosophical Trans
         '
 actions Mr. Hulke's memoir on Polacanthua Foxii.        This remarkable
 Dinosaur, the name for which     had    been suggested by Sir R. Owen,
 has a large dermal shield spread out above the iliac bones in such a
 way as to form a kind of carapace over the lumbar and sacral regions ;
 besides this, large spines and scutes were attached to other parts of
the body.
    Mr. Hulke's presidential addresses to the Geological Society,
 1883-4, formed an important contribution to our knowledge of
 reptilian osteology, and especially threw light on the structure of the
 shoulder girdle in Plesiosaurs and their allies.
    The Iguanodont remains found in England have been more or less
fragmentary,     and discoveries made by other workers helping to
elncidate their structure were hailed by Mr. Hulke with satisfaction ;
no one more heartily rejoiced than he did when the rich treasures of
the Belgian Wealden rocks were brought to light by the geologists of
that conntry, and they made known the discovery of the series of
magnificently perfect Iguanodon skeletons, several of which now
adorn the Museum of Natural History at Brussels.
   Mr. Hulke was for many years on the Council of the Geological
Society, and the high esteem in which he was held by the leading
geologists of the day, as well as their thorough appreciation of his
palaeontological work, found expression by their electing him, in
1882, to fill the Presidential chair of their Society, and, in 1887, by
their presenting him with the Wollaston Gold Medal, the greatest
honours it was in their power to bestow. In 1891 he was elected
Foreign Secretary of the Geological Society, which office he still held
at the time of his decease.
   Beloved and respected by all who knew him, Mr. Hulke          will long
be lamented as a Christian gentleman.

    Henby John Caeybk was born at Budleigh Salterton, Devonshire, on
 the 18th August, 1813. He studied medicine from the age of sixt-en,
 when he entered the Devon and Exeter Hospital as an indoor pupil,
 and in 1835 he became a student at University College, where he
 gained two silver nfbdals for Comparative and Human Anatomy.          In
 1839, after passing his examination at the College of Surgeons, he
 was appointed House Surgeon at University College, but shortly
 afterwards he gave up this appointment on account of a temporary
 failure of health, and became Conservator of the College Museum.
 In 1841 he studied in Paris, at the Ecole de Medecine, and in the
 following year received the appointment of Surgeon, in the service of
 the East India Company.
     Carter's Indian career began on the 12th February, 1842, when
 he landed in Bombay, and terminated in 1862. In the earlier portion
 of the twenty years he was engaged on military duty, in the course
 of which he was dispatched from Bombay to Calcutta by sea, and he
returned by way of Mauritius, encountering a cyclone on each
voyage.     Soon after returning he was placed in medical charge of a
battery of artillery that was ordered to join the army in Sind, under
Sir C. Napier, and he was present at the battle of Hyderabad, on
March 24th, 1843, for which he received the medal. Later in the
year he was sent with a detachment of troops to Umarkot, and sub
sequently he proceeded in medical charge of H.M.'s 21st Regim-nt,
to Nasirpur, in pursuit of Shah Mahomed.              These expeditions,
carried out   in the Indian  desert,  at a very  hot  season of the year,
entailed great sickness and mortality amongst the troops, and sev-re
exertions on the part of the medical staff. When, towards the close
of 1843, Carter returned with the 21st Regiment to Karachi, nearly
every man was on the sick list.
     His next service was of    a pleasanter    description  and may be
regarded as virtually the commencement of his scientific career. In
1844 he was appointed Medical Officer of the surveying brig, " Pali-
nurus," then commanded by Captain Sanders, I.N., and for the next
two years he remained with the vessel during the survey of the
South East Coast of Arabia, from the entrance of the Persian Gulf,
to the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb, at the southern extremity of the
Red Sea. The geological notes made by Carter, during these two
years, were published in the Journal of the Bombay Branch of the
Royal Asiatic Society, in 1852, and it may be remarked that even to
tho present day bnt few additions of importance have been made to
them ; for our knowledge of the Eocene and Cretaceous rocks, and of
the associated igneous formations of Southern Arabia, we have still
in great measure to depend upon Carter's account.
     From July, 1846, when he was appointed Assistant Civil Surgeon
    Bombay, the remaining sixteen years spent by him in India were

                                     Iv
 passed in the capital of the Western Presidency.          Here he soon
 became a scientific leader amongst the small body of men, mostly
belonging to the medical staff of the Presidency, who were interested
in the geology of the conntry, and here he published a series of
papers, many of them of considerable length, on various geological
and biological subjects.     The different offices filled by him in turn
amply testify   to  his energy and to the esteem in which he was
 held. From 1847 till he finally left India, he was Honorary
 Secretary to the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society,
having previously been for a short time Hon. Sec. of the Medical
and Physical Society.       In 1851 he was Hon. Sec. to the Bombay
 Committee of the Great Exhibition in London, in 1854 he occupied
a similar post in relation to the Paris Exhibition of that year ;
in 1859 he presided over a Committee appointed by the Govern
ment to establish an Economic Museum, and in the same year he
was elected President of the Medical and Physical Society, was
appointed a Fellow of Bombay University, and a Justice of the
 Peace for Bombay.      On his retirement, in 1862, the Bombay Branch
of the Royal Asiatic Society presented him with £100 for the pur
chase of a microscope in recognition of his services to the Society
during the fifteen years that he had held the office of Honoraiy
Secretary.
    On his retirement from India, with the rank of Surgeon-Major,
Carter settled in his native place, Budleigh Salterton, and in 1864
he married an Irish lady, who, with an only child, a daughter,
survives him.      This marriage was eminently conducive to the
happiness of  his  declining years, passed amidst the quiet surroundings
of his early boyhood. On October 4th, 1888, he suffered from a
paralytic attack, which impaired his powers of speech and his eye
sight, and caused him to relinquish scientific and literary work,
though he continued for more than six years afterwards to enjoy the
society of a few intimate friends.     In the spring of the present year
his strength declined seriously, and on the evening of May 4th, he
passed  quietly away in sleep.
    Although he was not the author of any large original work, the
list of Carter's papers in the Society's catalogue to 1873 comprises
169 entries, a number that affords abundant evidence of his scientific
industry, and that was greatly increased before his death, whilst
the subjects of the papers testify to considerable versatility. The
complete list of his contributions to science is classified by Mr. W.
Theobald, his friend and executor, from whose notes most of the
details here given are taken, under the following heads : — Ethnology,
4 ; medicine, 13 ; geology, 19 ; zoology and botany (exclusive of
the two next categories), 47 ; foraminifera, 28 ; sponges, 127 ; total,
238.   The best known of his earlier contributions to science, published

                                    Ivi
in India, were geological and palaeontological, though the index to his
original papers and compilations, published in 1862 ('Jour. Bom.
Br. R.A.S.,' vi, p. 231) shows that even then his contributions to
zoology, botany, and physiology, were more numerous than his
geological writings. His best known and most important papers,
besides that already noticed on the South-East Coast of Arabia, were
on the geology of Bombay and the neighbouring islands ; on the
Fossil Foraminifera of Sind, Cutch, &c, and, above all, the 1 Sum
mary of the Geology of India between the Ganges, the Indus, and
Cape Comorin.'      In some cases, as in the ' Geology of Bombay Island,'
later observers have seen reasons for coming to conclusions differing
from those of Carter ; and his admirable attempt, in the ' Summary
of the Geology of India,' to classify the rock-formations of the Indian
Peninsula, suffered from the disadvantage that not only had he had
no opportunity of seeing the rocks of the greater part of the country,
bnt he had to depend on the descriptions of local observers of varying
geological powers, each acquainted with but a comparatively small
area.    But no writer better deserves the respect and gratitude of
Indian geologists, or has contributed more effectively to the advance
ment of their knowledge.      His especial service to the science con
sisted in his being for many years a centre of geological energy, in
his obtaining from many local observers and thus rescuing from
oblivion notes on various parts of Western India that have greatly
facilitated later systematic work, and in his selection and publication,
as editor for the Government of Bombay, of the collected ' Geological
                            '
Papers on Western India in 1857.         The writer of the present notice
can testify to the advantage he repeatedly derived from Carter's
careful and conscientious compilation.
   Bnt it is upon his researches amongst sponges and foraminifera
that Carter's scientific fame is mainly based.     It was to the structure
and classification of these, and more particularly of the sponges, that
 he devoted himself after his return to England in 1862, and his
papers on various members of the groups appeared uninterruptedly,
 chiefly in the Annals and Magazine of Natural History, from before
the date of his retirement from India to within a few years of his
death. His last paper, which appeared in 1889, was a " Sketch of
the History of known Fossil Sponges in relation to those of the
present day."     For many years he was occupied with the description
and classification of the sponges in the National Collection, his aid
in the work having been enlisted by the late Dr.              J. E. Gray.
Amongst     other  subjects he wrote on Eozoon,      and  was  one  of the
first to support the views of King and B.owney as to the inorganic
nature of that problematical fossil.      He was a skilful microscopist
and his ability as a draughtsman enabled him to record his micro
scopical observations with fidelity.     Some years before his death he

                                     Ivii
presented his private collection     of sponges and foraminifera to the
 British Museum.
    Surgeon-Major Carter became a Fellow of the Society in 1859,
and in 1872 received a Royal Medal " for his long-continued and
valuable researches in zoology, and more especially for his enquiries
into the natural history of the Spongiadce." He was a corresponding
 member of the Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia, and of
 the Boston Society of Natural History.
                                                             W. T. B.
    James Dwight Dana was born on February 12, 1813, atUtica, New
York, U.S.A., and in his 83rd year died suddenly, from heart failure,
at New Haven, Connecticut, on April 14, 1895. He received his
early education at Bartlett Academy, Utica, while there showing
great interest in chemical experiments, and making frequent excur
 sions in search of minerals ; to the training received at this school he
 ascribed much of the success attained by him in after life.    In 1833,
 attracted by the reputation of Professor Benjamin Silliman, he went
to reside at New Haven, and entered at Yale College, where he not
only studied classics and mathematics, but made much progress in the
natural sciences, especially in mineralogy and botany.       His mathe
matical distinction led to his appointment as instructor of mathe
matics to the midshipmen of the United States Navy, and in that
official capacity he left New Haven, in 1833, to cruise in the Medi
terranean.      A visit made to Vesuvius in 1834, during this term of
 office, led to the publication of his first paper. In 1836 he returned
to New Haven, and stayed there two years, acting for the greater part
of that time as assistant to Professor Silliman. In 1837 he published
the first edition of his Descriptive Mineralogy (580 pages). In the
following year he was appointed mineralogist and geologist to the
United States expedition, which sailed, under Charles Wilkes as
commander, on an exploring voyage round the world. The expedition
consisted of two sloops-of-war, a store ship, and a brig ; the voyage
extended over four years (1838 — 1842), and the scientific staff
included, in addition to Dana, as mineralogist and geologist, Pickering,
Coathouy and Peale as zoologists, Rich and Brackenridge as botanists,
and Hale as philologist.     On the return home of one of his colleagues,
Dana further took upon himself the charge of the crustacea and
zoophytes.
    The study of the material collected by the expedition and the pre
paration of his reports occupied all the available time during the
next 13 years ; the first two or three years of this period were spent
at Washington, but after his marriage, in 1844, to Heurietta Frances,
third daughter of Professor Silliman, he thenceforward lived
Haven, and was closely associated in his work with Professor S

                                    Iviii
until the death of the latter, in 1864. In 1846 he became an asso
ciate of Professor Silliman in the editing of the American Journal of
Science, and after the death of his father-in-law, became the principal
editor of that important scientific serial.     In addition to his original
papers, upwards of 200 in number, he wrote for that journal hun
dreds of abstracts, critical reviews, obituary notices, and notes on
many topics. In 1850 he was appointed Professor of Geology and
Natural History at Yale College. In 1864, on an increase of the pro
fessoriate, his duties as professor were restricted to geology and
mineralogy.      In 1892 he formally retired, and last year was made
Professor Emeritus.
    Professor Dana's studies were thus of a manifold character, and as
a consequence he achieved distinction in various branches of science
— mineralogy, geology, and zoology. In the former subject his chief
work was his Descriptive Mineralogy, the first edition of which was
published at his own expense in 1837 (580 pages), and of which the
sixth edition — published in 1892, under the superintendence of his
distinguished son, Professor Edward Salisbury Dana — maintains th-
high reputation for completeness and accuracy attained by the pre
vious editions through which this standard work has passed.         At the
time of the issue of the first edition, the natural history method of
classification of minerals was employed by many mineralogists.           At
first Dana adopted that system, and went so far as to devise a
systematic nomenclature on the dual Latin plan ; but in the third
edition   (1850), the whole system — classes, orders, genera, Latin
names, and all — was rejected, and the importance of chemical com
position was recognised.      In the preparation of this work Dana spared
no pains, and to aid in the settlement of the vexed question of
 mineral names, made an exhaustive review of the entire literature of
 mineralogical science.     He wrote about forty separate papers on
 purely mineralogical subjects ; many are descriptive of particular
 mineral species, but most of them treat of general subjects, such as
 nomenclature, pseudomorphism, homoeomorphism, and the connection
 between crystalline form and chemical constitution.
    In geology his work was equally extensive. In 1862 he brought
 out the first edition of his excellent and well illustrated Manual of
 Geology, having special regard to the geology of the North American
 continent.     A fourth edition of this work (1087 pages) was issued
 only  two   or  three months before his death.       Each edition of this
 manual, like those of his Descriptive Mineralogy, was characterised
 by carefulness and thoroughness of treatment, the last edition being
 completely re- written from beginning to end. As illustrations of the
 variety and philosophical character of his geological studies, we may
 cite his papers on the origin of the grand outline features of the earth,
 Lhe origin of continents, mountains, and prairies, the early conditions

                                    lix
of the earth's surface, the analogies between the modern igneous
rocks and the so-called primary formations, on erosion, on denuda
tion in the Pacific, on terraces, and the formation of valleys.  Further,
he was an active field geologist, and more especially studied the so-
called Taconic system, chiefly in Western New England, and the
glacial phenomena of Southern New England. The region included
in Western Connecticut and Massachusetts, and extending west
ward into New York, and north to Vermont, was traversed many
times, and there was scarcely an outcrop in the whole of this difficult
region which was not visited by him, and carefully examined and
described.    His geological report for the Wilkes expedition occupies
756 pages, and is accompanied by 21 plates.      Further, he was particu
larly interested in volcanoes, and in 1890 published a considerable
work (399 pages) entitled " Characteristics of Volcanoes, with Con
tributions of Facts and Principles from the Hawaiian Islands," which
placed on record much useful information collected by him during
his travels in volcanic regions.
    His zoological work, which was even more extensive than that in
mineralogy and geology, chiefly related to the Wilkes expedition of
1838 — 1842.     This expedition followed in part the course taken by
the   " Beagle," in 1831 — 1836, and even where it diverged from that
route, visited coral and volcanic islands, such as have been carefully
described by Charles Darwin.        When the Wilkes expedition reached
Sydney, in 1839, Dana chanced to see in a newspaper there a state
ment of Darwin's theory of the origin of the atoll and barrier forms
of reefs. This statement, though very brief, was so suggestive as to
be of great help to him in his work, and he ever afterwards expressed
feelings of the deepest gratitude to its author.      A visit to the Fiji
 Islands in 1840 (where two of his colleagues were murdered by the
natives) brought before him facts such as had been noticed by Darwin
elsewhere ; but in the Fiji Islands they were on a still grander scale,
and of a more diversified character, thus enabling him to speak even
more positively of the theory than Darwin himself had thought it
philosophical to do. One large volume of his expedition report was
devoted to zoophytes, and described over 200 new species.             His
 report on the crustacea occupied two volumes, and described 680
 species, of which more than 500 were new to science.        Each volume
was illustrated by an atlas of beautiful plates, most of them drawn
 by himself.    Though the last half-century has brought some slight
changes to his classification of the crustacea, that of the corals stands
to-day nearly as it was given by him in the report.          This was the
first time that any considerable number of the coral animals had been
described and figured from life.      Dana further showed that the reef-
building   corals  live only in water  having a temperature of at least
68° F., and that the distribution of the corals thus depends on the

                                                      "
temperature of the water. His expedition report on Coral Reefs and
Coral Islands," separately published in 1853, was afterwards extended
                                      "                         "
by him into an elaborate account of Corals and Coral Islands (406
pages), the preface of which bears the date of 1872.
   His work procured him many marks of distinction, both at home
and abroad. He was an original member of the National Academy
of Sciences of the United States, and in the year 1854 occupied the
presidential chair of the American Association for the Advancement
of Science. He was made LL.D. by Amherst College in 1853,
and by Harvard and Edinburgh Universities in 1886. In 1851 he was
elected a Foreign Member of the Geological Society of London, and
in 1872 received from that society its Wollaston Medal. In the same
year the University of Munich conferred upon him the degree of
Ph.D. ; in 1877 he received the Copley Medal of the Royal Society of
London, and in 1884 was elected one of its Foreign Members.        He
was a corresponding member of the scientific academies of Paris,
Berlin, Vienna and St. Petersburg, and of many other learned
societies.
   During all his life he had a strong love for music. He played the
violin and the flute, was for a time the leader of the college choir,
and even made some attempts at musical composition.      As a man he
was noted for the gentleness and kindliness of his character, and was
thus on excellent terms with his colleagues.   Professor Dana leaves a
widow and four children.
   Owing to the specialisation rendered necessary by the progress of
knowledge, it will be long before we can expect to have with us a
man of science with attainments so varied in character as were
those of the United States veteran, James Dwight Dana.
