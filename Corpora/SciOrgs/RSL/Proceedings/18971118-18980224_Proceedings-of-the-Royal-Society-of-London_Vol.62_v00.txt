      Professor of Neuropathology, and William Aldren
       Turner, M.D., F.R.C.P., Demonstrator of Neuropathology,

         (From the Neuropathological Laboratory, King's College, London.)
                                  (Abstract.)
   The primary object of the research has been to elucidate by the aid
of destructive lesions, and the study of the consecutive degenerations,
the  tracts by which impressions of general and special sensibility are
conveyed to the cortex of the brain.         For this purpose, the cortical
area, supposed     to bo the sensory centre under consideration, was
extirpated ; and, secondly, the nerve, tract or primary ganglionic
structure connected therewith was divided or destroyed.
   In this -way strands of degeneration were induced, in due course, of
cortical afferent or efferent nature, revealed by the osmium-bichro
mate    method of Marchi.
   The     systems   upon    which    experiments     have     been  performed
were :  —
   (a)   The cerebral portion of the visual     system, consisting of removal
         of the occipital lobe, extirpation of the angular gyrus, destruc
         tion of the piilvinar thalami, and division of the splenium
          corporis callosi.
   The degenerations showed that this portion of the visual system
was composed of a corticifugal tract, passing from the occipital lobo,
by way of the optic radiations, to the pulvinar thalami of the same
side, and to the anterior quadrigeminal bodies of the same and partly
of  the other side.     The angular gyrus has no descending or efferent
tract to   the basal ganglia, but is connected by means of association

fibres with the superior temporal gyrus, the superior parietal lobule,
and the occipital lobe. A system of corticipetal fibres was traced
from the optic thalamus to the angular gyrus and the occipital lobe,
in which lobe their distribution was as well marked in the external
convolutions as in the cuneus and lips of the calcarine fissure.
    The angular gyri and occipital lobes are commissur.illy connected
through the splenium and forceps corporis callosi ; the callosal fibres
having the same cortical distribution as the thalamic fibres.
    In this respect our observations are in harmony with those of von
Monakow and Vialet.
    (I) The   experiments upon the auditory system consisted    of section
         of the eighth nerve distal, as well as proximal, to the accessory
         auditory ganglion ; destruction of the posterior qnadrigeminal
         body and the internal geniculate ganglion, and extirpation of
         the superior temporal gyrus.
    Inasmuch as the expeviments necessitated division of the pedun-
culus flocculi, the degenerations consequent thereon were first elimi
nated.     These were traced into Deiters' nucleus, the vermis cerebelli,
and tegmentum pontis, corresponding with the observations of Bruce
and Stscherbach by the myelination method.
    The direct connexions cf the vestibular division, as shown by
section of the eighth nerve trunk distal to the auditory ganglion,
are with Deiters' nucleus and the tegmentum ; while there is also a
probable direct connexion with the nneleus of the sixth nerve.
    The connexions of the cochlear division, forming the central
 auditory tract, were found to pass from the accessory auditory
 ganglion by way of the corpus trapezo'ides, iu association with the
lateral fillet, to the internal geniculate body of the opposite side.
 Thence a tract was found to ascend to the superior temporal gyrus.
 This forms the corticipetal or cerebral auditory tract. Degenera
 tion was also traced after destruction of tho auditory ganglion into
 both superior olives, and posterior quadrigeminal       tubercles, chiefly
 of the opposite side.     These results are compared with those of
 Flechsig, Kblliker, &c, obtained by other methods of investigation.
    After destruction of the superior temporal gyrus a tract of
 degeneration was found to descend to the upper part of the pons
 Varolii, through the outer fifth of the pes cruris. This constitutes
 the temporo-pontine tract of Bechterew and Dejerine.
    The superior temporal gyri are commissurally connected through
 the forceps of the corpus callosum, and by means of association
 fibres with the angular gyrus and occipital lobe.
     (c) The cutaneous sensory and other corticipetal systems were
         studied by the aid of destructive lesions of the tegment of
         the pons Varolii, crus cerebri, optic thalamus, the posterior

                  Cerebro-cortical   Afferent and Efferent Tracts.                3
            quadrigeminal body and adjacent tegment.         Those which
            specially caused cutaneous anaesthesia were lesions involving
            the reticular formation of the tegment of the pons and cms.
    In some of these cases           there was no obvious   loss of cutaneous
sensibility, while in others this was pronounced.        In both cases,
however, corticipetal degenerations were induced.     These were traced
throngh   both limbs of the internal capsule, the external capsule, and
the   centrum      ovale to the cerebral cortex, both on the convexity and
mesial aspect,        including the gyrus fornicatus.      This corticipetal
system      is less extensive in the frontal than iu the other regions of
the   cerebrum.  It would seem to harmonise with the thalamic corti
cipetal fibres, which   Flechsig has recently described as the first,
second, and third
                    " sensory
                              "
                                systems, ascending respectively to tho
Rolandic area, the falciform lobe, the frontal region and gyrus forni-
catns,      myelinating at different periods.
    Many of these fibres of the tegmentum  appear to pass through tho
optic thalamus  without ending in      while others terminate in this
                                            it,
ganglion.   This    shown by the fact that destruction of the lateral
                           is
and ventral parts of the optic    thalamus led to a more extensive
degeneration         than that following
                                      destruction of the tegmentum
alone,      the   degenerating towards the same cortical regions.
                  fibres
Bat we have not been able to distinguish, by the degenerative
method, between those of sensation proper and the other afferent
fibres which ascend to tho cortex in this region.
    Many fibres  from the optic thalamus were found to cross by the
corpus   callosum to the opposite cerebral hemisphere, thus supporting
the   view of Hamilton that this structure    a decussation as well as
                                                   is
a   commissure.        Our observations      show that tho decussation       is   of
thalamic      corticipetal fibres.
    (d) The     other afferent cranial nerves, which were made tho subject
            of experiment, were the sensory division of the trigeminus,
            and the glossopharyngeus,      which were divided proximal to-
            their ganglia.
    Apart      from degeneration        of the so-called ascending trigeminaV
and    glossopharyngeal         roots, traceable as far as the spinal-medullary
junction, no evidence was obtained as to their central continuation.
    Bat thesymptoms following lesion of tho tegmentum cruris placed
the sensory fibres from the face in association with those from the-
body and limbs.
      (e)   The experiments upon the prefrontal and frontal areas con
            firmed the existence of a fronto-pontine tract, which descends
            through the anterior limb of the internal capsule and the

                                      (Abstract.)
    In this paper are given details of experiments which were designed
for the purpose of investigating the grosser chemical changes which
occur in the intestinal tract, and the nature and influence of the
micro-organisms present in the contents after the ingestion of dif
ferent kinds of food or after the administration of certain drugs.
    The points taken up comprise : —
    The reaction of the contents of the alimentary tract in its various
        parts, and the bodies to which this reaction is due.
     The amount of chlorine present, and the nature of its combina
        tions.
     The solids present in the contents.                 ,
     The action of the ferments.
     The number and nature of the bacteria.
     A  serie3  of experiments were first carried out on a dog with an ileac
 fistula,   situated   at the ileo-coecal valve. As these experiments did not
 prove altogether satisfactory, a further series were made on dogs fed
 for some days on special diets, or given certain drugs, and killed
 about three hours after their last meal.           After removal of the entire
 alimentary tract, it was divided into six parts, viz., stomach, duode
 num, jejunum, upper ileum, lower ileum, and large intestine,
 double ligatures having been placed between each section.               Inocula
 tions were made from these segments with due antiseptic precautions.
 Thereafter the contents of each section was analysed.
     A similar experiment was carried out on a calf, and another on the
 contents of a portion of the intestines of a man.
     The effects of the following diets were investigated : —
     On dogs     : 1. Ordinary,    porridge and milk and    some meat.
                   2.  Porridge and milk.
                   3. Boiled beef.
                   4f. Sterilised milk.

  Research Laboratory of the Royal College of Physicians, Edinburgh, a Grant from
  the British Medical Association was received.

    In the calf : Cow's milk.     (The calf had not passed the sticking
      stage.)
    The drngs used were   : 1. Acidum hydrochloricum dilutum.
                            2. Sodii carbonas.
                            3. Salol.
                            4. Calomel.
                            5. Creasote.
                            6. Benzosol.
                            7. Guaiacol   carbonas.
                            8. Animonii chloridnm.
   In each instance, two meals were given in the day, and when drugs
were used two doses in the twenty-four hours, administered with
each meal.
   The contents of the ileum were obtained each morning from the
dog with the fistula by means of a bag tied over the opening.
                      The Reaction of the Contents.
   1. Total Acidity. —-The total acidity was estimated in the usual
way.    In the majority of the observations phenol-phthalein was used
as an indicator, with check estimations performed with litmus.
   In no instance were the contents of any part of the alimentary canal
found to be alkaline.
   The total acidity of the contents of the duodenum was almost always
above that of the gastric contents, while the acidity present in the
large intestine was usually as great as, and ofter greater than, that
of the duodenal contents.
   On an average the maximum acidity occurred in these sections of
the tract, the minimum in the contents of the lower half of the
ileum.
   A curve    formed  from the mean values for the acidities in the
different sections rises from the figure for the stomach contents to
that for the duodenal section, gradually falls until the large intestine
is reached, when it rises again abruptly.
   The greater the proportion of proteida in the food the higher was
the acidity of the stomach and duodenal contents, while the material
present in the lower parte of the small intestine was less acid, and
the contents of the large bowel of rather higher acidity.
   The administration of acid with the food increased the acidity of
the contents of the duodenum and large intestine, of alkali decreased
it in the stomach, but increased it in the other sections.      Compared
with the results obtained after the administration of the acid, the
alkali caused a marked diminution of acidity in the stomach, but an
increased acidity in the small intestine below the duodenum.
   Salol differed in its effects from calomel in that it caused no

 61     Dr. A. L. Gillespie.      Chemistry   of  the Contents of the
 diminution of the acidity throughout the tract, while calomel was
 followed by a marked fall in the acidity values obtained from the
 contents of every section, but especially of the small intestine.
 Guaiacol carbonate and benzosol increased the acidity of the contents
 of the ileum in the dog with the fistula.
    2. Acidity after Evaporation at 100° C. ami Acidity driven off. — The
 acidity remaining after drying the fluids at 100° C. was least in
the contents of the stomach, most in those of the duodennm when
the mean figures for all the observations were analysed.               With
the exception of the stomach and large intestine the acidities, after
 evaporation, exceeded those of the original samples. That is to say,
more alkali was driven off than acid.       This in all probability was due
to the breaking up of ammonium lactate by heat and the volatilisation
of the ammonia.         In all cases the discrepancy between the acidity
values obtained with phenol-phthalein and those with litmus varied
 directly with the difference between the values before and after evapo
ration. If the acidity was less in amount after evaporation than before,
the results as shown by the two indicators coincided ; if greater, the
value as shown by litmus was less than that arrived at by the use
of phenol-phthalein.
    This increase of acidity after drying was least after food containing
much proteid material.       After hydrochloric acid it was marked, and
after sodium carbonate very slight. The administration of salol was
followed by the presence of free acid throughout the tract, that of
calomel by an excess of volatile alkali over volatile acid.           Of the
other antiseptics tested, creasote acted in a similar manner to calomel
but to   a less extent, guaiacol and benzosol   like salol.
                           The Acid Factors Present.
  ^ In the stomach      the acidity was due to hydrochloric acid, either-
free or combined with proteids, and to a small extent to acid salts.
In the duodenum the acidity was caused to a great extent by the
presence of hydrochloric acid combined with proteids expelled from
the stomach, but also to organic acids, such as acetic and lactic acids.
In the lower sections of the tract these organic acids were present
along with acid salts, and smaller quantities of other acids belonging-
to the same series.
    Chlorine. — The chlorine contained in the intestinal contents was
separated into total chlorine, chlorine driven off by evaporation at
100° C. and chlorine not sb volatilised, and which was further sepa
rated into a part burnt off at a low red heat, and a part remaining-
after incineration.
    The total proportion of chlorine in the different sections showed a
slight decrease from the stomach down to the upper half of the ileum,

       Alimentani    Tract and  the Influence of Bacteria present.      7
and then an increase.     This increase in the two lower portions was
due to the    inorganic chlorides.    The chlorine, in combination with
organic bodies was found in greatest quantity in the stomach, where it
was combined for the most part with proteids.        It gradually became
less in amount in the intestines, except in the lower ileum, here, how
ever, one observation, in which the contents of that section were very
concentrated, caused its average proportion to rise to a high level.
Volatile chlorine was detected in the stomach contents, in the duode-
nnm, and other parts of the small intestine.       None was found in the
large bowel.     In the stomach and duodenum much of it was in the
form of hydrochloric acid, below the duodenum it was probably
present as unstable compounds of ammonia, or of other organic bases
formed from proteids by the action of trypsin.
   In those instances where the acidity of the stomach contents was
high, as after proteid food, the chlorine present in the bowel was
present in lai'ger quantity than the average.
   Solids. — The total solids at 110° C. were in the largest proportion
in the lower part of the ileum. Unfortunately, owing to the large
intestine having been emptied shortly before the time when many of
the analyses were made, tho values obtained for the contents of this
section of the canal must be regarded as fallacious.       The solids were
in lowest proportion in the large intestine, and only slightly greater
 in the stomach.      A much higher figure was obtained from tho
 contents  of the  duodenum than from the stomach.
    The inorganic ash was present in larger proportion in the duodenum,
jejunum, and lower ileum than in the other sections.
                               Bacteriology.
    The organisms grown from the contents of the six sections into
which the alimentary canal was divided were found to vary in number
and character with the degree of acidity present.         The higher the
acidity the greater was the proportion of acid-forming growths, the
 majority of which were unable to liquefy gelatine, and, as a rule, the
 smaller was the total number of bacteria cultivated.
    When the acidity was low a greater number of liquefying organisms
 could be grown, most of which rendered the nutrient medium alkaline
 in reaction.
   When an ordinary diet (porridge, milk, and some meat) was
given, the contents of the duodenum yielded the fewest colonies,
 those of the stomach a few more, while below the duodenum the
 numbers grown increased progressively. ¦ A purely meat diet caused
 an almost entire disappearance of growths from the tubes inoculated
 from the stomach, duodenum, and jejunum, a marked fall below the
 average in the numbers in the ileum, although the colonies obtained
from the large intestine were as numerous as usual.

8        Dr. A. L. Gillespie.   Chemistry  of the Contents of the
    No growths were obtained from the contents of the stomach or
jejunum of a dog fed on sterilised milk, and only four from the
 material in the duodenum.     Large numbers were present below this
part.     The contents of the entire intestinal canal of a calf did not
yield single liquefying organism, while the total number grown was
        a
 very small, as far down as the lower half of the ileum.
    The administration of dilnte hydrochloric acid was followed by a
 decrease hi the number of organisms present in each section of the
 janal, and especially of the organisms capable of liquefying gelatine.
 Carbonate of sodium, on the other hand, caused no diminution in the
 numbers found in the upper parts of the tract, but — corresponding
 to an increase in acidity in the contents of the lower sections —
 occasioned a diminution of liquefying forms in the ileum and large
 intestine.
    The administiation of antiseptic drugs yielded very      interesting
 results.   When salol was given, no diminution in the       number of
 organisms was observed until the ileum was reached,          when the
 organisms capable of liquefying gelatine became very few    in number.
 After calomel, the upper sections contained    a small number of bac
 teria, the lower parts a large number which were chiefly of the class
 able to liquefy gelatine.
    No trace of the decomposition products of salol could be detected
 in any of the sections above the uppor half of the ileum. In this
 portion of the canal only a faint reaction was obtained.         In the
 lower part of the ileum and in the large intestine the reaction was
 well marked.
    The exhibition of other antiseptic drngs was quickly followed by
 a sensible diminution in the nnmber of the organisms present.
    Extract of hematoxylin was given for the purpose of testing the
 action of an astringent on intestinal fermentation.    The number of
 organisms was rather increased during its administration.
                                 Trypsin.
    Although the contents of the bowel were always acid, trypsin was
  found to be active in them.   Perhaps this fact may explain why this
 ferment is secreted for so many hours after food, when pepsin is only
 secreted during the duration of stay of food in the stomach.     Acids,
 however weak, gradually destroy trypsin ; the acid in the bowel
 must do so, but this destructive action is compensated for by a con
 stant secretion of more of the ferment.
    The action of trypsin on proteids in the presence of organic acids
 was investigated in the dog fed upon sterilised milk.
     To 10 cub. cm. of a solution of egg-albumin containing 0'115
 gram albumin, 5 cub. cm. of the contents of each section of the

         Alimentary        Tract and   the Influence    of Bacteria present.        9
alimentary canal were added. This mixture was rendered alkaline
with sodium carbonate, and then just made acid by the cautious
addition of acetic acid until the neutral point was passed.         The
mixtures   were then kept at 38° C. for four hours.             A check
experiment  with  liquor pancreaticus  in  place of the contents showed
that it could digest 68"5 per   cent, of the albumin in a slightly acid
solution.  The amounts digested by the intestinal contents varied
from 48 per cent, in the case of the lower ileum, 37 per cent, in
the jejunnm, to 17 per cent, in the large intestine.
     A small proportion of free mineral            aoid arrested   the proteolytic
action    of trypsin   ;    a larger   percentage       of hydrochloric acid com
bined     with proteids was necessary to cause a corresponding                 degree
of    inhibition.
                                        Pepsin.
  Artificial digestion experiments, in which 5 cub. cm. of the con
tents of each portion of the alimentary canal were added to a
mixture containing 01 15 gram of egg albumin and 20 cub. cm. of
decinormal HC1, resulted in a certain amount of the albumin
being digested in each. Seventy-seven per cent, of the proteid was
digested  after fonr hours at 38° C, when 5 cub. cm. of the
stomach contents had been added, 20 to 28 per cent, in the experi
ments with the duodenal, jejunal, and upper ileac contents, only
12"9 per cent, when the contents of the lower ileum were used, and
19 per cent, when the large intestine was tested.
                            Distillate of   Contents   of Bowel.
   When the contents of a portion of the intestine were distilled
after the addition of water, if the combined acidity after evaporation
was greater than the total acidity as originally estimated, the first
portions of the distillate were alkaline and contaiued ammonia,
even although the contents       had been of highly acid reaction.
When the acidity after evaporation was lower than before            as in it,
the stomach and large intestine, the distillate was acid from the first,
due, as a rule, to acetic acid. In most cases the acidity of the residue
was found to be chiefly composed of lactic acid.
   Proteids. — Coagulable proteids were obtained from the contents
of the lower ileum from the dog with a fistula on each occasion,
varying from 1*92 per cent, to a mere trace. No relation could be
traced between the other factors and the quantity of coagulable
proteid present.
   On another occasion half-saturation of the contents with am
monium sulphate, which precipitates globulins, brought down much
more than the half of the total coagulable proteid present, except
in the contents of the stomach.        Albumoses were found in the

10       Chemistry   of the  Contents  of the Alimentary  Tract,  §-c.
stomach in large amount, none in the duodenum or jejunum, and
traces in the lower sections of the bowel.         Peptones were present
in traces in the contents of the stomach and jejunum and in the
parts below it.
                             General Conclusions.
   1.  The contents of the intestinal canal in the dog and calf,
and probably in man, are acid in reaction throughout ; the acidity
being due to organic acids formed by micro-organisms,         hydrochloric
acid in combination with proteids and proteid          derivatives,   and to
acid salts.
   2.  When the food passes from the stomach into the duodenum it
rapidly becomes more concentrated from absorption of water, and
consequently     more acid ; it still contains a large proportion of
hydrochloric acid in combination with proteid bodies, but the
increased proportion of inorganic chlorides indicates that this acid
is rapidly being acted on by the soda of the pancreatic secretion.
   3. The organisms present in the bowel are divisible into two great
groups, those which are able to give the medium in which they grow
an acid reaction, and those which cause it to become alkaline or
neutral.    The first class, as a class, are usually unable to liquefy
gelatine.     The second class can do so, and form the ordinary putre
factive organisms.       These classes arc mutually antagonistic.      If tho
number of acid-forming organisms be in large proportion to the total
number present, the second class of bacteria fails to grow in any
luxuriance, and the intestinal contents do not putrefy in the ordinary
sense of the word.        Per contra, should the liquefying and alkali-
forming organisms be in the majority, the first class is less numerous,
and intestinal putrefaction may be present.             As, however, the
diminished acidity which follows the growth and action of the second
class of bacteria is favourable for the multiplication of members of
the first class, sufficient acid is formed by them in ordinary cases to
neutralise the alkali, and generally to cause the reaction to remain
acid.    The ammonia formed by the second class often unites with
the lactic acid produced by the first, creating, in fact, a salt which
is very advantageous for the further development of both classes.
    4. A normal acidity of the stomach contents with the presence
of free HC1, or an increased amount of each of these factors,
causes a greater destruction of the alkali-forming or putrefactive
 bacteria than of the acid-forming and more resistant organisms.
 This naturally leads to diminished decomposition in the bowel. A
 diminished gastric acidity, or a largo meal chiefly proteid in
 character, allows a larger number of the second class of bacteria to
 reach the bowel, and may thus cause intestinal decomposition and
 indigestion.    But such a result is not invariable, as the diminished

       Discontinuous Variation occurring in Biscutella lfevigata.              11
 acidity of the tipper parts of the canal favours, in health at least, the
 growth of the acid-forming bacteria, and may thus lead to an in
 creased acidity and diminished decomposition in the lower parts of
 the canal.
    5. Some antiseptic substances appear to act more on the first class
 of organisms than on the second.             Thus salol seemed to act more
 energetically on the liquefying forms than on the acid-forming class,
 calomel the converse ; while salol exerted a greater antiseptic power
 in the lower part of the intestinal canal, calomel in the upper
 portions.
    6.  Trypsin is capable of energetic proteolytic action in the presence
of organic acids, bat, as it is slowly destroyed by these acids, it has
to be    constantly supplied in fresh quantities.
    7. The figures obtained for the total solids of the different sections
show that absorption of fluids is greatest in the duodenum and
lower ileum. The absorption from the large intestine can not be
compared with the absorption from the other parts owing to the
number of times its contents represented the material newly passed
from the ileum.

        Cambridge. Communicated by W. Bateson, F.R.S. Re
        ceived June 9, — Read June 17, 1897.
   The observations recorded in this paper were made upon Biscutella
Icevigata, a cruciferous plant occurring as a perennial herb in the
alpine and sub-alpine regions of middle and southern Europe. It
was observed by Mr. Bateson that in a valley of the Italian Alps this
species exhibits two distinct forms,* which exist side by side, the one
hairy and the other glabrous.             Plants showing various degrees of
hairiness, and constituting a series of intermediate forms connecting
the two extremes, were also found, but were comparatively scarce.
As it may be presumed that in the state of nature the two varieties
intercross freely, the question arises — how is their distinctness
maintained ? For on the supposition that hairiness and smoothness
are characters capable of blending freely, it might be expected that
offspring derived from a cross between hairy and smooth parents
would tend constantly to regress to a mean condition of texture.
It was in order to test the validity of this supposition, and to ascer-
   * Mr. Bateson's attention was drawn to the variations of this species whilst
staying in the Val Formazza, for the purpose of studying the alpine forms of tho
butterfly Fieri* napi, for it is upon these plants that the variety bryonia chiefly
lays its eggs in this locality.

12              Miss E. R. Saunders.           On a Discontinuous
tain the facts of inheritance, as regards this particnlar character,
that the following observations were undertaken.
    Biscutella laevigata lias a perennial rootstock bearing a crown of
radical leaves.
    The leaves are obovnte, oblanceolate, or spatulate, tapering down
wards to the petiole ; the apex is obtuse, and the margin either entire
or dentate-sinuate, with a water gland at each marginal tooth or
lobe.      The cotyledons are obovate, they scarcely taper, and the
margins are invariably entire.           In those plants in which the more
elaborate type of leaf occurs, the first post-embryonic leaves are
transitional between this and the simple entire form of the cotyledons.
    In respect of flexibility, the leaves of different individuals show
very considerable variations.         In some plants (and this is more par
ticularly the case with those which are glabrous) they are stiff and
brittle aud readily crack if the lamina is bent upon itself; in others
this bending produces no lesion.
    Far more striking, however, are the variations in the character of
the leaf surface, which, as stated above, include intermediate grada
tions between leaves in which both the superficies and the margin
 are thickly covered throughout their whole extent with rather stiff
 hairs, and leaves in which the lamina is completely glabrous.
    Upon referring to the descriptions of previous observers, I found
 that several agreo in recording the variable character of the leaf
 surface ; as regards the predominance of the different forms, their
 statements are, however, not altogether in accord.
    Rouy and Foucaud* describe the leaves of Biscutella laevigata as
 rough and hirsute, rarely glabrous and smooth.
    Parlatore.f in his simple unqualified statement that the leaves are
 glabrous or hispid, gives no hint that he regards the latter as the
 predominant and typical form ; in a concluding note he adds that
 the variations in the degree of hairiness, as of other characters, form
 such a continuous series, that to consider them of taxonomic value in
 distinguishing varieties (unless almost infinite in number) would be
 entirely arbitrary.
     Christ,^ in contrasting the variety saxatilis with the type form
 (i.e., laevigata), in like manner describes the latter as glabrous or
 pnbescent.
    Mertens and Koch§ deal with these variations iii greater detail ;
 according to them the leaves may be either thickly covered on both
 surfaces with rather stiff, spreading hairs, or they may be rough in

consequence of tufts of stiff hairs borne on the leaf teeth, or the
glabrous character may be even more pronounced, the leaves being
destitute of hairs except for a few bristles on the petiole.
    Reichenbach* and Borean,t on the other hand, mako no mention
of a glabrous variety; the former describes the leaves as strigose
hispid, the latter as pilose or hirsute.
    The occurrence of glabrous and hairy varieties within the limits of
a single species is not unknown ; but in those cases previously
investigated it has been found that this divergence of character can
be correlated with some sensible inequality in the environment, and
that where similar conditions constantly prevail there is uniformity
of type. A familiar example of this kind of adaptation is afforded
by the well authenticated case of Polygonum amphibium which was
noticed by Linnaeus ;£ this plant is invariably glabrous when
growing in wet ditches or ponds, but it produces leaves more or less
downy if for any cause the ponds or ditches dry up. By placing the
land variety under appropriate conditions, Hildebrand§ was enabled
to convert it into the typical aquatic form — a sufficient proof that
both tjpes are rightly referred to the same species. Nor is this the
only instance that can be adduced; Linn8Dus|| observed a similar
variability in Plantago coronopus and other plants ; he also records
that Ltlium Martagon assnmes a glabrous habit when cultivated
in gardens, and that Thymus serpyllum becomes more or less hairy
when growing on sea-coasts. It was further noticed by Moquin-
Tandon"J that plants occurring at high altitudes were generally
more hairy than these found in the plains. More recently, a large
 number of comparative                 experiments         have been undertaken           by
 Bonnier,** who enumerates a list of species in which, among other
 changes, a greater or lesser increase in general hairiness resulted
 from transplantation from valleys to high mountain slopes. Again,
 Warmingtt states that smooth plants occupying dry areas become
 hairy in moist situations, and, similarly, those which otherwise are
 somewhat hairy, under the latter conditions exhibit this chaiacter
 in a more marked degree ; he quotes, in support of his statement,

 Stacliys palustris.    Vesque and Viet,* in a note to the same effect,
also draw attention to an experiment made by Kraus npon the
etiolated shoots of the potato, in which he found that those formed
in the dark are glabrous when grown in damp air, and downy when
the atmosphere is more or less dry.
   In the case of Biscutella Iwvigata, however, it seems impossible to
explain the variations which, occur as the result of a direct modifica
tion of habit to habitat — to conceive of them as due to differences in
temperature, in illumination, in the humidity of the atmosphere, or
in the nutritive capacity of the soil. For in all the instances quoted
above, a certain constancy of form is associated with, and character
istic of, a particular environment ; whereas in the species in question
no such connexion is apparent, the two extreme types are not
infrequently found in groups in close proximity to one another, or a
hairy and a glabrous plant may even be growing in the same sod of
turf, and presumably, therefore, under identical external conditions.
   With the immediate cause of these variations, however, I am not
here concerned further; whatever may be the active agent in their
production, their occurrence suggested that a detailed study of these
differences in the leaf surface might lead to interesting results
bearing upon the views which have recently been brought forward
with regard to discontinuous variation and its value as a factor in
the origin of species.
   Before entering upon an analysis of the experimental results it
will be necessary to consider somewhat more in detail the variations
in the degree of hairiness or smoothness exhibited by the leaf-
surface.     The following types may conveniently be distinguished : —
      I. Surface hairy. — In the leaves of this class both the upper and
           the lower surfaces are thickty covered with hairs.               In some
           individuals the hairy character of the leaf surface is easily
           recognisable at a glance ; in others, in which the hairs are
           short, a closer inspection is necessary.
     II. Surface intermediate. — To this type belong —
           (a) Leaves in which a few stray hairs are scattered                thinly
                   over the upper surface.
            (6) Leaves in which (more frequently) some portion of the
                   upper surface is quite glabrous.               This smooth area,
                   usually  forms     a longitudinal       zone  of varying breadth
                   on either side of the midrib ; the hairs, indeed, may
                   be  restricted to the margin and to a narrow belt of
                   marginal surface. In rare cases the hairs are grouped
                   differently : thus, the apical region may be hairy while
                   the basal and middle portions are glabrous.

         Surface glabrous. This class includes
                                                    —
            (a) Leaves in which the whole npper surface is glabrous,
                  except, perhaps, for one or two hairs which, as it were,
                  overflow from the continuously hairy margins at the
                  level of the leaf-teeth.
           (6)  Leaves    in which both surfaces are glabrous, and, further,
                  the marginal hairs are being confined to certain
                  definite points — the leaf-teeth,
           (c) Leaves in which the lamina is wholly destitute of hairs.
   [In   type3   II   and Ilia the nnder surface of the leaf was not
      examined, and the scattered hairs occasionally occurring on the
      midrib were also disregarded.]
   Types I and    II  are so well marked that it is rare to find a leaf full
grown, and with hairs on the surface, which cannot be referred with
confidence to either category.
   The flowering stem is hairy for a longer or shorter distance from
the base in plants belonging to type       I ; whereas in those belonging to
types   II and  III  it is usually glabrous..
                            Details op  Experiments.
   Ripe seeds collected from plants growing in the Val Formazza
were divided into three sets, which were sown respectively in August,
1895, and in February and March, 1896 ; in addition to this material
a  few plants which survived transplantation from Italy, together
with some specimens in the Cambridge Botanical Garden (which
had been raised from seed supplied by M. Correvon, of Geneva), were
also placed at my disposal.        The seedlings were raised in pots under
glass, and either planted out in the open in the spring, or repotted
singly for greater convenience of manipulation. A careful examina
tion of each leaf of the young plants brought to light a fact of con
siderable interest ; it was noticed that in certain cases the first-formed
leaves exactly resembled one another as regards the nature of the
leaf snrface, whereas in others the successive leaves exhibited degrees
of hairiness varying more and more widely from the original type.
In order to obtain a record of each leaf, it was found necessary to
take special precautions to protect the plants as far as possible from
the attacks of slugs and snails, to whom the leaves of this species
seem to be especially palatable.       The pots were therefore placed upon
cinders, or surrounded with soot ; if not thus protected many of the
younger leaves would in a single night be reduced to bare midribs, or
in the case of seedlings, the stump of the stem was often all that re
mained. The plants with smooth-surfaced leaves were more liable to
attack lhan those that were hairy, although the latter did not wholly
escape. In one batch of seedlings, which were all placed under the same

  16             Miss E. R. Saunders.            On a Discontinuous
 shelter, 107 leaves, belonging to 72 different plants, suffered more or
 less mutilation.       Of these the leaf surface was glabrous in 94, inter
 mediate    in   5, and   hairy in 5 ; in the remaining 3, so much of the
 leaf was devoured that its character could not be ascertained with
 certainty.*
     It soon became     evident that the individuals in which the nniform
 character of the       leaves was maintained (not only in the seedling,
 but, as it proved,      in the adult stage also) were those which as seed
 lings conformed        to one or other of the extreme types, the leaves
 being either very hairy, or else destitute of hairs, except perhaps
 at the leaf-teeth.        On the other hand, the plants exhibiting more
 than one grade of hairiness were those in which the first formed leaves
corresponded to one of the types intermediate                  between these two
extremes ; among these latter the variations in different individuals
 were always along the same lines, and consisted in a gradual diminu
tion in the number of hairs in successive leaves, until sooner or later
a stationary point was reached, after which the character of the leaf
surface usually remained constant.f
    In enumerating the various grades of hairiness occurring in a single
individual, I have intentionally disregarded the character of the
cotyledons, for the reason that they do not appear to bear any constant
relation     (as regards texture) to the leaves which follow. In the
case of a seedling in which as yet only the cotyledons were developed,
I found it impossible to predict with certainty the character of the
succeeding leaves. It is true that in nearly all hairy plants the
cotyledons were also hairy, and that in many that were smooth the
cotyledons were almost glabrous ; but exceptions to this rule were
not wanting, while in intermediates the cotyledons exhibited every
gradation between the two extremes.                 Hence there was alwaj-s an
uncertainty     as  to   whether     hairy cotyledons indicated a hairy or an
intermediate plant, and whether smooth cotyledons would be suc
ceeded by glabrous or intermediate leaves. That this want of agree
ment between the cotyledons and the later leaves is a condition not
peculiar to this species, but is one of common occurrence, needs no
further proof than that furnished by a comparative study of the
leaves and cotyledons of other members of the same natural order.J
   * The insufficient protection against such attacks afforded by the marginal tufu
of hairs has already been noticed by Stahl (' PfUnxen und Sohnecken,' Jena, 1888,
p. 58).
   t  The stunted leaves which are sometimes formed at the beginning or the close
of a period of vegetation, as, e.g., in late autumn or early spring, may prove excep
tions to this rule; they are often distinctly less hairy than those of normal size
borne on the same individuals.         But when active growth once more sets in,
the new leaves resemble the type previously established in those that developed
normally.

              Variation occurring in Biscutella laevigata.                           17
 The nature and extent of these individual variations -will be seen
on  reference to Tables IV, V, and VI.
   Exceptions to the foregoing statements are rare, yet now and again
 a plant may be found exhibiting an appearance strikingly suggestive
 of a bud variation.    The development of accessory crowns of leaves,
 sometimes crowded together, sometimes borne ou runners, is com
paratively common, and as a rule the character of the leaves in such
cases is uniform throughout the plant ; but in these exceptional indi
viduals the leaves of a secondary crown may differ widely from the
original type. In one instance I found aplantbearingacrownof twenty
leaves, with the hairs confined to the margin, which had produced a
second cluster borne on a runner 3 — 4 inches long, and composed of
eleven leaves, all with a very hairy surface.                In another example,
a young plant bearing a crown of seventeen leaves, belonging to
intermediate types, developed another so close to the first that their
leaves intermingled ; those of the latter (four in number at the time
of observation) were all very hairy.
   A few other cases lend themselves less readily to so simple an
explanation ; in them the tendency to
                                               " sport "
                                                              (if such it be) mani
fests itself not in a bud but in a single leaf.            In such plants a leaf
may appear showing a marked access of hairiness whicb is fre
quently asymmetrical ; so that on one side of the midrib both the
npper and under surfaces may be hairy, on the other the hairs may
be confined to the margin ; or again the hairs may be continuous
along the margin of one side, and be entirely absent from the other ;
in these cases the succeeding leaves show a return to the normal
symmetrical type.
   Postponing for the present further reference to these exceptional
cases,  I pass on to a consideration of the results summarised in the
following tables.
   The total number of seedlings obtained from the three sowings
»as 280 ; seventy-two of these were not classified owing to the early
death of the plant, or to the want of a continuous record of the leaf
character, or in a few cases to the " mixed " character of the plant to
which allusion has been made above. The distribution of types
among the remaining 208 was as follows            : —

These numbers are not of value as indicating the relative proportion
of the different types occurring in the particular locality from which
Hie   seeds       were obtained;             for in the first place a certain selection
was intentionally employed in their collection, and secondly it
happened that the majority of the seventy-two plants which were not
included in Table I, for the reasons previously stated, belonged to
types     II      (surface        intermediate) and                III    (surface smooth), con
sequently the proportion                    of   hairy      individuals        appears to be much
larger than it actually was. As a matter of fact it is practically im
possible to determine the numerical ratio of the different types in
their natural habitat, owing to the characteristic habit previously
mentioned of producing accessory crowns of leaves on runners or
suckers, a habit which renders actual removal from the soil the only-
method by which it is possible to ascertain the limits of the " in
dividual."
    Of the 208 plants seventy-six were obtained from seeds gathered
from two very hairy individuals (A and B) ; the character of the
male parents was unknown, since these two plants like all the others
J'rom which seeds were collected had been naturally and therefore
possibly promiscuously fertilised.                          The character of these seventy-
six plants is shown in Table II.

    From the observations summarised in the foregoing tables, it will
be 6een that the cas?s in which the whole number of leaves produced

              Variation occurring in Biscutella laevigata.             21
by one individual exhibit a fairly uniform degree of hairiness (or
smoothness) are almost invariably those belonging to the extreme
types ; the plants are either very hairy (type I) or almost glabrous
(types IIIc and the smoother forms of Illfc).          All the plants in
which the leaf surface was originally free from hairs remained
smooth, while out of the total number of hairy plants only two
varied from the original type. It is those in which the first formed
leaves are intermediate in character between these two extremes that
the change from a more to a less hairy condition may generally be
traced (types II, Ilia, and the hairier forms of III6).     Consequently
we find that the continuous series of gradations from the condition of
ab&olnte smoothness to that of extreme hairiness, which may be
observed npon examination of the leaves of a large number of seed
lings taken at random, is not met with in an equally large and hap
hazard collection of adult plants ; among the latter certain forms
have disappeared, and the types which obtain are more sharply
marked off from one another.         In fact adult plants fall into two
groups ; the type    with  leaves  with an intermediate surfaco is not
found, or occurs as a rare exception.       It follows, therefore, that a
census compiled     from  a  set of adult plants, and a similar record
 obtained from the same individuals before the stationary point has
been reached will not give concordant results ; in the former case the
 proportion of plants bearing leaves with a glabrous surface will be
 higher than in the latter.
    In order to ascertain the nature and amount of the variations
 occurring among the offspring of unlike parents, certain individuals
 which flowered in the summer of 1896 were intercrossed.       The plants
 were placed under muslin covers in order to exclude insects, and the
 flowers were emasculated while still in bud before the anthers had
 dehisced, in order to prevent possible self-fertilisation.    The seeds
 tbus obtained were sown the same year after having been allowed to
 ripen for a few weeks ; the character of the cross-bred seedlings is
 sbown in Tables VII and VIII.

   In all the "very smooth" plants used                           as     parents in these experi
      ments, the leaf-surface               was quite        smooth, and if marginal hairs
      were       present they were confined to the leaf-teeth.                                        In the

    From the observations made upon this one generation of cross -
breds, it would appear that when the extreme forms are intercrossed
the offspring seldom exhibit the degree of hairiness characteristic
of the more hairy parent ; in most cases the first formed leaves corre

  the general level of hairiness       in the offspring was very considerably
  higher.
      At the time of writing the character of the twenty-one hairy
  plants was unchanged.         The fifty-four plants bearing leaves with a
  smooth surface were still smooth, and the number of marginal hairs
  was gradually becoming            less. The remaining            forty-five plants
  originally bearing leaves with an intermediate                  surface were all
  tending to become less hairy, in fact the leaf surface was free from
  hairs in all those which had apparently                 reached the stationary
  point.*
     A few experiments were also made with the view of determining
  the character of the offspring in cases in which the parents resembled
 cue another in texture.       To this end certain individuals were placed
  under muslin covers, and either self-fertilised or crossed with others
 of the same type.           Unfortunately none of the plants that were
 smooth set seed ; four hairy individuals of the Genevese stock,
 however, fruited freely, and from them sixty plants were obtained,
 all of wbich showed the same degreo of hairiness as the parents.
 It is of interest to compare these numbers with those obtained from
 the two bairy plants A and B (see Table II), which were freely
 exposed to insect visits ; in the case of the latter only about 80 per
 cent, of tbe offspring belonged to the hairy type.
     Althougb the results tabulated in the preceding pages have been
obtained from observations upon a comparatively                    small number of
plants, tbey are,     I think, sufficiently concordant to justify the follow
ing conclusion.       The experiments went to show that a blending of
parental characters       as regards      hairiness and smoothness occurs to a
certain   extent in the offspring of plants of dissimilar types, giving
rise to intermediate forms.             But this intermediate condition in
respect    of  hairiness    is  only  found     exceptionally among full-grown
individuals.      For  whereas   in  plants    which  at first are distinctly hairy,
the hairiness persists almost without exception, I have found that
in nearly every case those plants which as young seedlings present
an intermediate      condition, assume, as they grow older, a more dis
tinctly glabrons habit. This change of character in the cross-bred
seedlings which are originally intermediate, takes place gradually;
occasionally it does not occur until several leaves have been produced,
but more often it is apparent as soon as the second and third leaves
have developed.
     • Though the seeds were all eown together, they germinated at such unequal
 intervals that the plants were at this time in very different stages of development.

                            Histological Note.
   A  microscopical examination of the leaves revealed the presence of
a histological feature of   some interest.      The general arrangement of
the tissues follows the normal dorsiventral type ; it is the mesophyll,
however, which claims especial attention, and exhibits a structural
peculiarity which consists in the thickening and lignificalion of the
cell walls in such a way as to form a latticed network.              The meso
phyll cells of the cylindrical leaves of some species of Sansevieria
exhibit a somewhat similar appearance as has been previously recorded
hy De Bary,* and figured by Henfrey.f            These bands of thickening
give the characteristic lignin reaction with Schnlze's solution and
with phloroglucin. In all respects, save for this modification of the
walls, these cells resemble the rest of the mesophyll, and judging
from the amount of chlorophyll contained in them, their capacity for
amylogenesis is not less than that of the unaltered cells. The number
and distribution of these cells varies considerably in different cases,
but so far as I have been ablo to ascertain, their occurrence is not
correlated with auy other structural feature.          In order to determine
their presence or absence in any given case, the leaves to be examined
were allowed to rot in water until the epidermal layer could be easily
peeled off with forceps from the under surface              ;  they  were then
mounted whole, with the under surface uppermost.                 When sufficient
transparency could only he attaiued by decolorisation, the leaves were
placed in alcohol, and afterwards boiled for a few minutes in water or
in dilute HC1, to facilitate the removal of the epidermis.          The method
of examination by sections was found to give unreliable results, since
the distribution of the cells is so erratic that their non-occurrence in a
number of sections affords no certain criterion of their absence from
the whole leaf. They may occur singly and remote from one
another, or in groups in the meshes of the fibro-vascular network ; or
continuous layers of the spongy mesophyll or of the palisade cells may
undergo this modification ; in one case they may cover an un
interrupted area almost as large as the leaf surface, in another they
may perhaps be confined to one side of the midrib, and he wholly
 wanting on the other, in fact, their distribution would appear to be
entirely haphazard.       In some cases they are present in the cotyle
dons, but more often they are absent from these organs, though they
may be present in the later-formed leaves of the same plants; their
presence in one leaf does not necessarily imply their occurrence in
other leaves of the same individual.        To take a single instance — nine
leaves belonging to a very hairy plant were examined ; in five of these
the cells were abundant everywhere ; in two a few were present; and

 species  (?) — viz., B. raphanifolia, B. ambigua, B. lyrata, and B. auricu-

 mesophyll of these plants.
                         Addendum, July 28, 1897.
    Since the foregoing paper was communicated to the Society,        I have
 myself visited the Val Formazza, and examined the character of the
 Biscutella plants in this locality, and also in one or two Swiss
 valleys.    The results of these observations are given below : —
    Val Formazza,      from the head of the valley down to the Tosa
 Falls (5500 feet).
    In this reach of the valley the plants are abundant everywhere —
on the banks of shingle and sand and in the low-lying meadows near
the stream, and on the grassy slopes of the surrounding heights, up
to the Val Toggia on the one side, and as high as the lower limit of
the Hohsand Glacier on tho other.          Both the hairy and the glabrous
types    were found, each variety often forming patches of varying
size  ; such groups of dissimilar plants may occur side by side on
exactly similar ground ; or, on the other hand, a small area may be
occupied by both forms, which are indiscriminately mixed together.
On the whole the smooth individuals were more numerous thau the
hairy, especially in the low-lying meadows near tho river, on the
steep slope up to the Val Toggia, and on tho slopes on the opposite
side of the river between the chalets of Morasco and Riale. In the
above-mentioned meadows intermediate plants were also found,
especially the smoother forms, and though very few iri number
compared with the extreme types, they were more numerous here
thau in any other locality which 1 had the opportunity of observing.
Many of these intermediates were apparently young plants, and
their comparative abundance in this spot may, I think, be explained
by the fact that the season was a late one, and that consequently
some individuals were ranked as intermediates, which had not yet
reached the stationary point, and which would eventually conform to
the smooth type.
    Val Formazza below the Falls and at Al Ponte (4200 feet).
    Here the plants were much fewer in number than in the upper
reach of the valley ; immediately below the falls they were almost
all smooth (no intermediates were seen) ; at Al Ponte the hairy and
the glabrous types       were found    together  on the   shingle  near the

   The plants were exceedingly abundant in this part of the valley,
both on the lower grass slopes and close to the stream ; in both
places the great majority belonged to the hairy type. Intermediates
of the more hairy kind occurred here and there, generally in patches.
The very smooth type was not common.

predominated, but some hairy intermediates were also found.

   The memoir, of which this is an abstract, deals with the sori of all
the four living genera of Marattiacere ; the development has been
traced in Angiopteris and Marattia from the earliest             stages to
maturity, in Bancea and Kaulfussia from such early condition as the
material would permit.     Some of the results from Dancea have been
already  submitted  to the Society in a preliminary statement.*        One
result of the investigation has been to demonstrate, as regards their
development, the substantial unity of type of the sporangia in the
four genera. In all of them a single " superficial parent cell " of
prismatic form is to be recognised embedded in the massive sporan
gium when young, not in a central position, but directed obliquely

  towards the centre    of the soma. By periclinal division this forms
 internally   the  archesporiam, externally that part of the wall where
 dehiscence takes place. The tapetum arises, typically in them all,
 from the cells surrounding the archesporium.         The dehiscence is in
 all by a slit in a radial plane, which may widen to a circular pore in
 Dantea.     In those sori where the sporangia are united laterally there
 is no annulus ; it is present only where the sporangia are separate, as
 in Angiopteris.
    An interesting feature is disclosed by estimates of the potential
 spore-production of the single average sporangium in the four
 genera ; the results in round numbers are, in Angiopteris 1,450, in
 Dancea   1,750, in Marattia 2,500, in Kaulfussia 7,850.       It is to be
 remembered that the usual numbers in Leptosporangiate             ferns are
48  — 64;   in some Leptosporangiate    ferns (Osmunda) the number may
rise to    500.    I  have ascertained  in Oleichenia, however, that tbe
number may be as high as in Angiopteris.          This large potential out
put of spores goes parallel with the broad base of the sporangia ; in
fact, the Eusporangiate condition is that best adapted for maturing
large numbers of spores in the individual loculus.
    Frequent deviations from the type have, however, been observed,
as   well as variations of size and mode of segmentation of the
sporangia, and it is not possible in certain cases to refer the whole
sporogenous tissue of one sporangium to a single parent cell. A
special study of the irregularities has been made in Dancea, iti which
geua~ they are most marked ; incomplete septa are frequent, and the
sporangia are of very unequal size. The main features have already
been   noted in the preliminary statement on that genus, where it has
been    pointed out that comparison of the details with those of the
septate anthers of some Angiosperms shows that there is a remark
able resemblance between the two cases.         Similar irregularities havo
been noted, though less commonly, in Kaulfussia, and Marattia, and
rarely in Angiopteris.
    Those fossil Marattiaceas which are best known as to the details of
the sorus have beeu compared, and the substantial similarity of the
sori in certain cases to those of the modern genera recognised.         The
facts from fossils and from the modern Marattiaceaa have been made
the basis for a fresh discussion of the theoretical question, whether
the synangium is or is not a result of coalescence of sporangia ? It
is concluded that the palaeophytological evidence leaves the question
open as to the priority of existence of forms with synangia, or with
separate sporangia,       in the Marattiaceee.       Notwithstanding that
writers of authority have treated the question as decided, that the
synangia are a result of fusion of distinct sporangia, it is held with
some persistence that it is still open; the palaeophytological evidence
is inconclusive, while the comparative          evidence from the living

genera  will not only accord with, but appears actually to support a
view of septation.
   For the analogy with septate anthers, wbere septation must have
occurred, and the similarity between the details of these and those in
Danaa, and especially the partial septations in both, make it appear
probable that in this genus progressive septation has taken place. It
is thought probable that progressive septation has been a feature, at
least where the sori are elongated, as in Bancca. But the question
is left over for future discussion whether or not a similar septation,
rather than coalescence, may bo accountable also for the origin iu

united together as in Asterotheca, or in Tecopteris unita.
" On the       Development of Marsupial and other Tubular
      Enamels, with Notes upon the Development of Enamel in
      General."     By Charles S. Tomes, M.A., F.R.S. Received
      July   12, 1897.
                                (Abstract.)
   It was pointed out by my father, the late Sir John Tomes, that
the enamel of marsupials was peculiar in that in the whole class,
with the solitary exception of the Wombat, the enamel is freely pene
trated by tubes which enter it from the dentine, and are continuous
with the dentinal tubes at the junction of the two tissues. This
character is met with sporadically in other mammals- — for example,
in the Jerboa among rodents, in the Shrew among insectivora, and
notably in the Hyrax, in which animal the free penetration makes its
enamel look quite like that of a marsupial.
   Whilst there is a large literature upon the development of ordinary
enamel, little or nothing has been written about that of tubular
enamels.
   The outermost portion of marsupial enamel is always devoid of
tubes, and the exteut to which the tube system exists varies greatly
in different members of the group, so that the same enamel organ is
obviously capable of forming either tubular enamel or enamel with
 solid prisms.     Moreover,   the sporadic reappearance      of tubular
 enamels amongst     mammals     who  have  for the most    part lost this
character, and its occasional occurrence in a rudimentary condition
as an abnormality in man, point to its not originating in any manner
fundamentally different from that of ordinary enamel development ;
and it is claimed that the study of its development in marsupials
affords the clue to the real nature of enamel development in all
animals.

              Marsupial and other Tubular Enamels,      #c.          29
    The nature of the question renders it impossible to convey in brief
space the grounds upon which the conclusions have been arrived at,
hot they are —
    That the special cells of the enamel organ (Ameloblasts) do not
themselves calcify.
    That they each furnish from their free ends ootgrowtbs or pro
cesses which are continuous with their own plasm, and which may be
traced through the entire thickness of young enamel.
    That one ameloblast furnishes the whole length of an enamel prism.
   That the fibrillar outgrowths, previously more or less correctly
described by other observers in other enamels, but apparently not
appreciated at their full importance, do calcify from without inwards
in such a manner that an axial canal is left uncalcified.     Hence the
canals of marsupials are in the centres of the prisms, and not, as
supposed by Von Ebner, in the interspaces of the prisms.
   And that towards the completion of the full thickness of the enamel
the central axis is no longer left soft, but the whole calcifies into a
solid prism.
   It is claimed that other enamels, for instance human enamel,
calcify in the same way. It has long been known that short pro
cesses hang out from the ends of the ameloblasts, and these, having
first been  described by my father, are generally styled Tomes' pro
cesses ; and also that the earliest formed layer of enamel is per
forated, so that acids will peel up a perforated membrane from its
surface during its development. Longer fibrils have also been detected
by Andrews, Williams, and others ; but so small a thickness is
occupied by these structures, and the full solidification of the prism
follows   so close upon the heels of any change in the direction of
calcification, that the true nature of these structures has not been
detected.
    But in marsupial enamel, owing to the tubular condition which is
so  very transient in human and other mammalian enamels being per
manently retained, the problem is presented under conditions more
favourable for elucidation.
    Hence it is my belief that all enamels alike are formed by the cen
 tripetal calcification of fibres furnished by the ameloblasts, and that
 tubular enamels are nothing more than the perpetuation of a stage
 which is passed through, though only for a brief period, by every solid
 enamel prism. This view serves to explain the occurrence of the various
forms of tubular enamel which are found in fish, in some of whom —
       Sargus — the reverse order of things is met with — that is to
 say, the prisms first formed near to the dentine are solidly calcified,
 but as their growth goes on the later-formed portions become
 tubular, so that in the completed enamel there appears to be a
 system of tubes entering it from its free surface.

30               Prof. R. Boyce and Dr. W. A. Herdman.
    In   certain   cartilaginous     fish tliere is a combination of both of
these arrangements         of  tubes,   from the dentine and from the sur
face, and sundry other apparently anomalous conditions are met
with.
    But if the views advocated in this paper be accepted, all diffi
culty in accounting for these arrangements, very difficult to explain
from any teleological standpoint, disappear, for they become merely
slight variations or arrests at different stages of a process common to
all enamels during their formation.

    In  the course of an investigation upon oysters under normal and
abnormal conditions, upon which we have been engaged for the last
two years, and upon which we propose to submit to the Society a
detailed    memoir    during next session, we have come upon a pheno
menon which we regard of such considerable importance that we
desire to publish a brief record of our observations and experiments,
 as we believe they may prove of interest to other biologists who are
engaged in work on the micro-chemistry of the cell.                   The phe
 nomenon we have now to describe is the presence of large quantities
of copper in certain green leucocytes found in a diseased condition
of the American oyster. The oysters suffering from this leucocytosis
jire always more or less green, but must not be confounded with
 ordinary green gilled oysters, where tho colour is duo to a totally
distinct cause.
                                       History.
     Green oysters have been known from an early period, and there
 are various historic cases on record* of people having been poisoned
 by eating green oysters, and of the oyster merchants being put upon
 trial because of the deleterious nature of their goods. Periodically
 green    oysters   have been suspected or convicted of being coloured
 with copper, and just as often it has been proved by competent
 authorities that copper has nothing whatever to do with the green
 colour.    This difference of opinion in the past has undoubtedly been
    • An interesting historical survey of the subject up to 186R, was given by the
 late  Mr. Arthur O'Shaughnessy, in the ' Annals and Mag. Nat. Hist.,' ser. 3,
 vol. 18.

largely due to the fact that the observers worked with different kinds
of oysters.     Some have investigated           the celebrated " Huitres de'
Marennes" (a form of Ostrea edulis), and have found that while
having'   dark blue-green gills, they were still in a perfectly healthy
6tate, that they contained very little copper, and that some iron was
present in the pigment.           All that is perfectly correct, but it does
not enable ns to draw any conclusions                 in regard to other green
oysters.     There are evidently several kinds of greenness in oysters,
and whereas some may be due to normal and healthy processes, others
must be regarded as abnormal or diseased conditions.                       It is the
latter, in our experience, that contain the copper.
   As early as 1835, Bizio showed that certaiu oysters he obtained at
Venice contained copper, and he attributed (18-Ao) their bluish-
jreen colour, and that of the Marennes oyster, to the presence of
that metal.        Two subsequent discoveries have thrown a certain
amount     of  probably undeserved discredit upon Bizio's work. These
are (1) the determination          by Fredericq and others that a certain
small amount of copper is present normally in the hajmocyanin
of the blood of crustaceans and molluscs ; and (2) the excellent
work of Lankester* and others on the Marennes                        oysters which
established, the normal, healthy condition of the greenness, and the
absence in that form of any copper beyond the trace duo to hasmo-
cyanin.      We now think it very probable, in the light of our recent
experience, that Bizio was dealing, in the case of his Venetian
oysters,    with the same copper-bearing           green pigment       that we have
met    with.
    About 1880 Ryder investigated some green oysters in America,
and   from his description of what he found we cannot doubt that he
bad before him the same kind of green American oyster (Ostrea
tirgxnica') that we have been examining.              He showed that the green
colouring matter was taken up by            the  amoeboid     blood cells, and that
these wandering cells containing the pigment were to be found in
the heart, in some of the blood vessels, and in aggregations                        in
 "cysts" under the surface epithelium of the body. He describes
the colour (in the ventricle) as a
                                             " delicate
                                                          pea-green," and states
 that it is not chlorophyll nor diatomine : he suggests that it may be
phycocyanin or some allied substance. f
    So far as we are aware there has been no workj since Ryder's,

ance from the blue-green of the                                        ") which we
have met with in some American oysters laid down in this country,
 and which we regard as a disease. It is characterised by a lenco
 cytosis, in which enormous numbers of leucocytes come out on the
surface of the body, and especially on tho mantle.                       The green
patches     visible   to  the  eye correspond      to accumulations   of  the leuco
cytes, which in mass have a green tint. These cells are granular
and amoeboid.             Tho granules do not give any definite reaction
with the aniline stains, and, so far, we have not made out their
precise nature."
    Finally, towards the end of last year, in the 'Supplement to the
Twenty-fourth Annual Report of the Local Government Board,' Dr.
Bulstrode corroborated our statement as to the presence of the pale
green disease from the examination of specimens from Truro and
Falmouth. Dr. Thorpe stated in the same Report that he had found
that some green oysters from Falmouth, f sent to him for examina
tion by Dr. Bulstrode and Mr. R. Vallentin, contained notable
amounts of copper, in some cases as much as 0"02 grain per oyster,
while the amount normally present is only 0'006 grain.
    Dr. Charles Kohn has kindly, during the last year or so, made a
number of analyses for us of different kinds of oysters — " natives,"
" Marennes," Dutch, and American — and whereas in most of these
he has found the copper to be present only in small quantities, on
the average agreeing well with the amount (0'006 grain) usually
stated as present in the tissues of the normal healthy oyster, in some
green Americans which we gave him recently for the pnrpose he has
found a very much larger amount of copper. These circumstances
induced us to reopen, in our investigations, the question of copper in
certain green oy'sters, with the results that are detailed below.

                           The Oreen Leucocytosis.
   We first noticed this diseased condition in the autumn of 1895, in
some ordinary American oysters (" blue points "), belonging to the
species Ostrea   virginica, which had been imported into Liverpool aud
relaid near Fleetwood, in the estuary of the Wyre.      Since then many
hundreds     (probably several thousands) of American oysters have
been examined      by us, and we have seen all degrees of the leuco
cytosis.   It manifests itself in patches and streaks of green on the
mantle and other parts of the integument, in engorgements of the
blood vessels, especially of those that ramify over the surface of
the viscera, and in masses of green-coloured     leucocytes in the heart.
This green condition, although much less frequently seen in
                                                               " natives "
(0. edulis), is occasionally met with there also, aud we have recently
had some specimens from Falmouth with very well-marked green
hearts,   due to an accumulation of leucocytes laden with green
granules in the ventricle.     Such hearts are of frequent occurrence
in the diseased American oysters ; after death the mass of leucocytes
sulsides to the bottom of the cavity, leaving the clear plasma above.
It Ls thus easy to demonstrate that the colour is due to the leuco
cytes, and to the leucocytes alone.
   The blood of these oysters contains a great variety of more or less
colourless    and more or less green and granular corpuscles, all of
which may be termed leucocytes.        They are apparently all amoeboid
wandering cells, comparable to the colourless corpuscles of the blood
of  higher animals.      The larger and (probably) older of the leuco
cytes   are very coarsely granular and very opaquely green. It is
these  that give the colour in bulk. We find them in masses in the
heart, in both auricle and ventricle, in the vessels, where they are
sometimes so abundant as to engorge or inject certain parts of the
system, in the lacunar spaces of the connective tissue of the mantle
and other organs, and also in the more solid parts of the tissues
wandering amongst the other cells, wedged into the epithelium aod
coming ont in great numbers on the surface of the body.           Some of
these latter, when found in the ectoderm and on the surface, are
rery markedly eosinophilous ; those in the vessels are not so markedly
to. When stained with osmic acid the granules of the leucocytes
become black.       After treatment with fat solvents, however, some of
the leucocytes are still very granular.
   In sections which have not been stained, the granules of the
leucocytes have a distinctly brown colour, recalling the appearance
of the granules in the liver cells in unstained sections in cases of
 pernicious aniemia.
   We opened many batches of American oysters, 100 at a time, and
 in all cases -where the green tint was present in the mantle, heart, ox

   vessels we found the accumulations of leucocytes.         From 120 oysters
   we chose the sir greenest and the six whitest.          Dr. Kolin analysed
   these two sets of six for us, and found that the green contained
|
 I between three and four (3'7) times as much copper as the white.        This
   shows that it is not merely a redisposition in the body of the copper,
   due possibly to the hjemocyanin, but that there is an absolute increase
   in the amount present in the body.
       We also found that the greenest parts of the body contained far
   more copper than corresponding tissues which had no green deposit
   in them. Not only then do these green oysters contain a largely
   increased amount of copper, but we have also shown that the copper
   coincides in its distribution with the green leucocytes, and, conse
   quently, we regard the copper as the cause of the green colour.         We
   then passed on to a more minute examination of the pigment and to
   histo-chemical    reactions.
                                 Chemical Reactions.
       The Oreen Colouring Matter. — The greenest portions of the green
   oysters were snipped out and dried on the water bath.             The dried
   pawdered     residue    was    treated  with   alcohol, ether,  chloroform,
   benzene, turpentine, xylol, but these reagents failed to extract the
   colouring matter ; we concluded, therefore, that the pigment was not
   of the nature of a lipochrome.         On the other hand, the pigment was
   readily soluble in dilute acids and in alkalis ; the addition of am
   monia gave rise to a distinct bluish tint, and fresh pieces of the green
   oysters reacted instantly with ammonia, with the formation of a
   beautiful blue.
       We next determined whether the pigment was due to iron or
   copper.    The dried residue treated with dilute hydrochloric acid
   and potassic ferrocyanide gave a marked red reaction, thus indi
   cating the pi'esence of copper, and it was then found that very
   small quantities of the green colouring matter treated with dilute
   hydrochloric acid were sufficient to produce a well-marked deposit
   of metallic copper upon polished iron.              In several instances a
   deposition of copper occurred when a piece of polished iron was
    laid upon a green patch on the surface of the mantle of a fresh
   oyster, dilute hydrochloric acid having been previously used to
    moisten the mantle.         Control experiments were made with the
    whitest portions of the American oysters and with natives,             and
    traces only of copper were fonnd.           These results have been    also
    quantitatively controlled by Dr. Kohn.
       A series of histo-chemical reactions were then carried out.         For
    the purpose the oysters were hardened in absolute alcohol,             and
   pieces were then imbedded in paraffin, great care being taken          that

                        On a Green Leucocytosis        in Oysters.
   every reagent was perfectly pure, firstly, with regard to the absence
   of copper or iron, and, secondly, that no acid was present ; thus, for
  example,      commercial turpentine may give a distinctly acid reaction,
  and this would be sufficient to remove the copper.                     If sections
  were imbedded in gum — and often the best results were obtained
  by this method — the tissues were allowed to remain for as short a
  time as possible in distilled water and then transferred to perfectly
  fresh neutralised solution of gum-arabic, and allowed to remain in it
  for only a short period.        The pigments appeared partially soluble in
  water.
      Comparatively thick sections were cut, in which the distribu
  tion of the green colour could be seen with the naked eye. These
 were placed in absolute alcohol in every case before proceeding to
 test.     The reagents which we employed were potassic ferrocyanide,
  1'5 per       cent, solution,* freshly prepared             ammonium-hydrogen
 sulphide, and pure hiematoxylin.
     Potassic Ferrocyanide. — Sections were taken from absolute alcohol
 and passed into distilled water for a moment in order to remove the
 alcohol.       They were then placed in the potassic ferrocyanide solu
 tion, when the portions previously green assumed a red colour ; this
 reaction set in immediately.            The presence of a 05 per cent, solu
 tion of hydrochloric acid added in equal quantity to the ferrocyanide
solution* previous to use (as recommended by Macallum for iron)
tended to hasten the reaction, and in some cases was necessary in
order to obtain it.
     The sections were then washed in distilled water, dehydrated in
absolute alcohol, cleared in cedar oil, and mounted in Canada
balsam.        The red coloration was found located to the masses of
leucocytes, and the individual lencocytes themselves were of a faint
yellowish-red colour.          In the cases of the very granular pigmented
leucocytes the granules assumed a distinct red-brown colour.                      In
this way the distribution of the leucocytes and of the vessels which
contained them was mapped out.                   Very beautiful preparations of
the engorged green vessels were obtained by partially dissecting the
nan tie in the fresh oyster so as to expose the ramifying vessels, then
hardening in alcohol, and subsequently treating with ferrocyanide
solution, when the vessels assumed a well-marked red colour; beautiful
results were also obtained by ammonia.               Fresh blood obtained from
the heart in which vast numbers                  of the green leucocytes were
present also gave a red reaction with acidulated ferrocyanide solu
tion.     Control bloods from white oysters gave an exceedingly faint
or no reaction.

    Ammonium-hydrogen          Sulphide. — Sections taken otit of the alcohol
and placed in this solution instantly gave a marked dark yellow-
brown reaction wherever there were green patches.              This reagent is
more striking in its results than the potassio ferrocyanide, and very
good cover-slip preparations of the blood can be obtained, the cor
puscles staining dark yellow-brown.
   Hematoxylin. — We were led to use this reagent from knowledge
of its reaction in the case of Weigert's nerve-staining method. The
results   are most striking.          Sections placed in a watch-glass of
distilled water, to which a few crystals of pure hematoxylin are then
added, begin at once to assume a distinct blue colour in the place of
the previous green ; this occurs whilst the solution itself remains
free from colour, and therefore whilst the quantity of hematoxylin
dissolved must be very minute.            Microscopic examination shows the
corpuscles    dark  blue,   and the  vascular   network beautifully differenti
ated. The connective tissue and gland cells and nuclei remain un
stained, or occasionally show a very faint blue reaction, most marked
immediately around the vessels. This reaction appears to us to be
as specific for copper as Macallnm showed it to be in the case of
inorganic iron. Just as in the test-tube, so in the cell, a blue-black
reaction is obtained not only with iron (as in the state seen in the
liver cells in pernicious anemia) but also with copper.           It therefore
follows that hematoxylin is a most sensitive test for either metal,
and that consequently in the outset it is necessary to determine
whether copper or iron is present exclusively in the cells, and to
which of these elements the reaction is due.
    Iron is found in the ash of the oyster, and the green coloration of
the Marennes oysters has been attributed to it by Carazzi and others.
In the case of the green oysters which we have examined, Dr. Kohn
found, in addition to the copper, traces of iron — the iron was, how
ever, far below the copper in quantity. In the detailed and valuable
paper of Macallnm, previously referred to, a series of histo-chemical
reactions are described in order to demonstrate the presence of iron
in cells, and he with others distinguishes two forms, organic and
inorganic.      The latter, like, we presume, the iron in the liver cells in
pernicious anemia,* gives an immediate reaction with potassic ferro
cyanide and dilute hydrochloric acid, and as Macallum has shown,f
a dark blue with pure hematoxylin.               But the organic iron behaves
differently, giving, according to Macallum, a yellow colour with
hematoxylin, and requiring previous treatment with dilute nitric,
sulphuric, or hydrochloric acids in alcohol before a Prussian blue
reaction is obtained with acidulated potassic ferrocyanide, or prolonged

treatment      with ammonium snlphide before any dark coloration is ob
tained with that reagent. Now it will be observed that all our reactions
were immediate, taking place directly on the addition of ammonium
sulphide, or potassic ferrocyanide        alone, or aided by a trace of acid.
The copper was therefore present in a condition analogous to the
inorganic      iron, or at least so loosely combined with the cell proto
plasm as to be readily discharged, but in none of these cases did we
get any indication of inorganic           iron, except in the case of thu
amtents of the alimentary tract of the oyster.             When the sections
were treated with 3 per cent, nitric acid in alcohol for half an hour
tie green colour disappeared, and then neither the copper reaction
nor the striking reactions with ammonium sulphide and hsematoxyliu
took place.        Subsequent treatment of these sections with acidulated
potassic ferrocyanide, and again washing in dilute nitric or hydro
chloric acid, yielded a general and very faint Prussian bine reaction,
in which the nuclei of the gland cells were more markedly bine than
the leucocytes.        If the method is reliable it shows that traces of iron
are present in the cells in addition to the copper, but it is the organic
iron.     Some oysters gave this Prussian blue reaction more markedly
 than others; this was the case with some Falmouth "natives."
    Haemocyanin        containing copper has been shown to be an
 important       constituent of the blood in many of the invertebrate,
 taking the place of haemoglobin.          We have examined the blood of
 Tery many oysters, and only in two instances, and these in green
 oysters, have we thought that the plasma became very faintly blue
 on exposure to oxygen, whilst, as previously indicated, qualitative tests
 either failed to give any indication of copper or, at most, only a very
 faint reaction, and even in these cases the reaction appeared confined
 to the leucocytes which were present in the plasma.             The ash, how
 ever, of the white oyster yields about 0-006 grain of copper, and it
 is probable     that minute traces are present in the plasma as hsemo-
 cyanin.      The cause, then, of the presence of the copper in such
 abundance in the green leucocytes is very obscure.             The quantity of
 copper    in the green leucocytes        themselves    varies,  as our  histo-
 themical reactions demonstrated        ; some    corpuscles could    be found
 which    were     conspicuous  by  their  red  reactions   on the addition of
  potassic   ferrocyanide, whilst others in the same preparations only
  ?&ve very faint indications, and occasionally          a cell could be seen
  which gave a      marked Prussian blue reaction instead of the red.
                                   Conclusions.
     Oar resul ts   demonstrated the presence of copper in comparatively
  large quantity      in the green leucocytes, chiefly in the American
  °jster,but also in the " natives " from Falmouth and other localities.

   38           Mr. J. W. Swan.    Stress and other Effects
   We have shown that the colour was in proportion to the amount
  of copper present, and that the colourless leucocytes contained
  only traces of that metal. The deposition of the copper in this
  large qnantity appears to us to represent a degenerative reaction ;
  it was accompanied by a most striking increase of leucocytes,
  which tended to distend the vessels and to collect in clamps,
  phenomena which are abnormal in our experience in the oyster.
  The presence of the copper in the leucocytes in these cases might
  be compared to that of the iron which is met with in some of the
  leucocytes in cases of old hfBmorrhages, pernicious anaemia, or in
  other cases where iron is set free. We are not prepared to state
  whether copper in the food can bring about the condition, but cer
  tainly we have abundant evidence to show that it can occur where
  no copper mines or other evident sources of copper are present.
     We are inclined to suggest that the increase of copper may be due
 to a disturbed metabolism,      whereby the normal copper of the
 hoamocyanin,    which   is probably   passing through the body in
 minute amounts, ceases to be removed, and so becomes stored up in
 certain cells.
     Our results also show that haamatoxylin is a most valuable
 reagent, not only as Macallum has shown in the case of iron, but also
 in that of copper, and that care must be taken to distinguish between
 the two reactions ; and this must be especially the case in those
 invertebrata where copper plays an important rSle in the physiology
 of the blood.

    While making an experiment with the object of finding the degree
 of resistance to puncture offered by paper coated with a soft com
pound of resin and oil, when placed between the secondary terminals-
of an induction coil, the tension being regnlated by a spark-gap in &
parallel branch of the circuit, observed that on the passage of a
spark at the spark-gap, while no spark passed between the paper-
separated terminals, a sudden roughening or puckering of the-
previously smooth surface of the coating took place.
    A number of experiments were made with the object of ascertain
ing the nature of the action which produced this effect, and these led
to further experiments and to results which, though closely related
to well-known phenomena, possess features of novelty and interest.

                 produced in Resin, fyc, by Electrification.               39
    It was found that clear Bordeaux resin in a viscid state (viscidity
being brought about either by heat or by the addition of resin oil) is
responsive to the mechanical stress consequent on electrification by
non-luminous discharges ; and if it is so acted upon while in the
solid state, and afterwards         superficially   softened  by heat, there
results a new kind of electric discharge figure, analogous to the dust
figures of Lichtenborg and Lord Armstrong, but showing some remark
able peculiarities which throw additional light on the mechanism of air-
couveyed electrical discharges, and on the location and nature of the
stresses imparted to the dielectric.        I ascertained that a smooth sur
face  of resin is retentive of an electric charge to an extraordinary degree,
that  after more than two months the lines of an electric discharge
figure, as developed by heat, and as further developed by the acci
dental attraction of atmospheric dust to the electrified parts of the
surface, 'were still attractive of dnst in a discriminative manner, no
change being observable upon re-dusting either in the arrange
ment      or definition of the lines of electrification as originally
developed.
    The apparatus employed consisted of an induction coil or a Wims-
hnrst machine, and a supporting stand, the rod of which carried two
clips  and a stage, the supporting part of the stage being made of
strips   of thick plate-glass, and the rest of wood. The clips held
conducting wires, which passed through bent glass tubes, and went
to the secondary terminals of the induction coil, or to the conductors
of the Wimshurst machine ; the discharging arms in either case con
stituted an adjustable spark-gap in parallel with the wires ending
above and below the stage.         The stage terminals were balls, discs, or
points ; the pairs employed in different experiments varied in size and
form, and the pair used together were sometimes dissimilar. The
resin was the colour of amber ; in some of the experiments it was
used in a solid state, but fused to the form required for experiment ;
in other experiments it was softened to semi-liquidity by the addition
of 20 per cent, or more of resin oil, the mixture being made by fusion
together of the resin and oil. The compound with 20 per cent, of
 oil has the consistency of treacle at a temperature of 20° C. ; at
 12"J C. it is nearly solid, yet plastic enough to yield to the mechanical
 stress-action generated by the projection upon its surface of an
 electric discharge of the kind employed in the experiments.           At the
 higher   temperatnre    the  viscid  liquid  is well suited for showing  the
 (rrcat disturbance produced by repeated discharges, and when at the
 lower temperature it is convenient for observing the more persistent
 forms of the figures produced on the surface by single discharges
 under various conditions.         When it was required that the stress
 figures   should  be permanent, resin either alone or with not more than
  2 or 3 per  cent, of resin oil was used.

   The dielectric was either contained in glass basins or spread as a
coating of 0-5 to 1 mm. thick upon glass or mica plates, and in a few
cases on copper plates.   Also plates consisting wholly of rosin were

                                                                       a
diameter under the basin, or to a disc of tinfoil attached to the
underside.     On breaking the primary circuit by means of a mercury
break with a trigger action (the spark-gap having been momentarily
short-circnited while the primary circuit was closed), and the con
sequent passing of a single spark at the spark-gap — no visible dis
charge occurring between the ball and the dielectric — there suddenly
breaks out on the surface of the viscous liquid a star-shaped figure
formed of deeply fnrrowed, closely clustered, outward-branching rayp,
extending from       circular frill near the centre to the margin of the
                       a
liquid.    The  figure gradually dies down, and on the surface becoming-
smooth      can, with slight variations, be reproduced again and again

by repeated breaks of the primary circuit.
   If the commutator       reversed (the spark-gap being momentarily
                                 is
closed while the primary circuit         re-made), then on breaking the

primary   circuit as before,   figure acharacteristic of the negative con-
vective discharge           is
                        produced.     This figure      much smaller and    is
weaker      than the positive             one   ;   most        frequently      it   consists   of a

circular, or nearly circular, band or ring, more or less indented in
outline, enclosing leaf-like rays which tend towards the centre.
 These are relatively broader and less branching than the rays of the
 positive figure, and they are characterised by having their outlines in
relief, wbile the rays of the positive figure are sunk below the plane
of the surface.    When the electrification is strong, the ring enclosing
the rays stands up as a frill in considerable relief.
    Effect of the Form of the Terminal. — The character, both of the
positive and negative figures, is greatly affected by the form of the
discharging electrodes. When the upper terminal is a metallic disc
of 25 mm. diameter, hanging in a plane parallel to, and 2 mm.
above, the dielectric surface, and the other terminal is a 50-mm.
metallic disc supporting the basin, complicated, but nearly symmetri
cal, figures of great beauty are obtained.     A metal point opposed to a
metal point, or a metal point above and a small metal ball below,
give smaller figures of more elementary forms, having the general
characteristics of the larger figures.
    Balls and points as terminals tend to produce circular figures in
which the rays converge to, or diverge from, one centre. This rule
applies with fewer exceptions to the + figure.          The negative figure,
even when produced by a discharge from a brass ball, is frequently a
combination of sectors, whose centres are not far apart, and are concen
tric with the centre of the group.       The effect of this is to produce a
figure of nearly circular outline broken by more or less regular inden
tations.
    If  the ordinary vibrating contact-breaker be employed instead of
the trigger-break used in the foregoing experiments, the rest of tlx-
arrangement remaining as described, larger and more complicated
effects are obtained.    When the ball above the liquid is positive, the
resin and oil being at a temperature of 20° C, on breaking the
 primary circuit the first effect of the make-and-break is the produc
tion of the characteristic star with arborescent rays ; the repetitions
of the impact which instantly follow indent the lines of the
figure more and more deeply, and result in the effacement of the
 more regular figure, and the development of a large and turbulent
 movement of the liquid, tending to its division into two masses : a
 central mound with a flat or concave top and a concentric ring. At
 first the two masses are joined by radial ridges, but these gradually
 thin, and (if the discharges at the spark-gap are continued) eventually
 break down and leave the central mound and the embracing ring com
 pletely separated.    During the progress of the action the ring por
 tion is driven outwards, and when the limit of outward movement is
 reached, there is a subsidence of the more violent agitation, the outer
 ring becomes somewhat smoother and flows inwards ; this is followed
 by a recurrence of the repellent action, and a repetition of the last

  the appearance at the middle and final stage of the action.

      If a metal ring (of 90 mm. diameter) is substituted for the disc, similar
   but more sharply defined effects are obtained.          When the arrangement
  described is varied by making the ball over the basin negative, instead
  of positive, on breaking the primary circuit there is less displacement
  of the viscid material consequent on repeated interruptions of the
   circuit.   To obtain a characteristic effect of repeated negative dis
   charges,  the  spark-gap should be widened to 50 mm., and to prevent
  sparking over the edge of the basin, it should be at least 150 mm.
  diameter.     There is then formed, immediately under the ball, a
   concavity the counterpart          in size and curvature of the ball, and
  outside this there is the general figure, somewhat faint and tremulous,
  which seems to be a complication of the positive and negative figures,
  the characteristic positive figure encircling the more distinctly negu-
. tive portion.     Fig. 3 is a profile view of the negative displacement.
  The extent of the effects described is considerably modified by the
  degree of viscosity of the liquid, and this can be controlled by tem
  perature.

      Corresponding but modified phenomena are produced by means of
  the Wimshurst induction machine.                When, for example, an 8 mm.
  metal ball connected to the + arm of the discharger hangs 15 mm. from
  the surface of the resin and oil mixture of the consistency of treacle
  contained in a large basin, and the — arm of the discharger is con
  nected to a metal disc of 100 mm. diameter under the basin, the dis
  charger balls being 75 mm. apart, the result of continuously working
  the machine is the production of a turbulent motion, attended by the

 formation       of vortices into which the upper stratum of the liquid
 pours downward,          carrying adherent air with it, while an equal and
opposite       movement takes place from below, producing worm-like
eruptions of spirally twisting or wriggling jets o£ liquid at the sur
face.     If the margin of the dish beyond the surface of the liquid is
thinly    smeared     with the viscid liquid, the film breaks up into dew-like
beads.
    With a metal ball of 150 mm. diameter, 6 mm. above the surface of
the   liquid and a proportionately larger disc basin and depth of liquid,
acted upon by a machine of moderate power, the spark-gap being
adjusted so as to prevent sparks passing from the ball to the liquid,
and the tension such as to keep up a strength of electrification               of the
jorface    only slightly less than that which would cause disruptive dis
charges to pass, a column of liquid rises and connects the overhanging
ball and the surface of the liquid in a manner strongly suggestive of
water-spout phenomena.                The ascent of the column of liquid is
followed by the descent of numerous thin surrounding streams,
and these        keep up a regular system of upward and downward
'•ircnlation.
    fixation of Characteristic Effects. — In order to fix the various forms
produced in the viscous mixture of oil and resin, an experiment was
made with nearly pure resin, rendered plastic by heat, and cooled to
solidity while under the action of electric discharges.             It was found to
 be difficult to carry this out in a satisfactory       manner, but it suggested
 a reversal     of the procedure, viz., the electrification of a surface of
 resin in a    solid state, and the subsequent development of the stress
 effect by rendering the surface superficially             plastic by heat.      This
 mode of operation resulted in the production of permanent relief and
 intaglio figures,        corresponding    to Lichtenberg's dust figures, to
 Brown's photographs,* and to the dust figures and photographs more
 recently described by Lord Armstrong.f
    The preparation of the resin surface for the production of the
 permanent        figures requires care.        The method I employed is as
 follows : — A thin glass basin was filled with a mixture of resin and
    per cent, resin oil, the oil being added to lessen the tendency of the
 twin to fracture on sudden change of temperature.                       The resin,
  melted in a metal pan, was poured through a filter of muslin into the
  •asm,    while embedded in small shot and raised to the fusion
  temperature of resin.         On slowly cooling, the basin being meanwhile
  wered with a plate of glass or an inverted basin, the resin solidifies
  with a smooth bright surface.             The resin-filled basin was partly
  wered, on the bottom, by a disc of tinfoil, and was placed centrally

44              Mr.  J. W.  Swan.      Stress and oilier Effects
on a metal disc in contact with one of the wires from the spark-gap
of the induction coil, the other wire, ending in a point, disc, or ball,
overhanging the snrface at the distance of a few millimetres as in the
experiments with the viscons material described.           On the production
of a single spark at the Bpark-gap by means of the trigger-action
mercury contact-breaker, a charge is conveyed to the resin.             The
peculiar distribution of this charge, and that it is attended by strong
and enduring mechanical stress, can be made manifest either immedi
ately, or many hours afterwards, by slightly warming the surface of
the resin.     The result is a deeply impressed figui-e, having the same
character     as the figure   produced on the viscid dielectric. These
solid figures, if carefully developed, show much fine detail ; unfortu
nately, this is not capable of complete illustration by photographs.
Difference of depth in the grooves is not fully indicated, neither is
there represented adequately a peculiar bnrring of the margin of the
grooves, especially in the negative figures, their edges rising slightly
above the plane surface, as though the resin had been finely carved.
   Persistency of the Stresses. — The persistency         and fixity of the
electrification     of the resin surface, determining the form and
character of the eventual figure, are very remarkable.               If the
development      of  the effect of the  charge  is delayed   for twenty-four
horn's there is but little difference in the result from that which
follows immediate development.
   Dust Figures and Stress Figures combined. — It was found that the
heat-developed figures attracted dust from the atmosphere, and thus
formed, accidentally, a combination of a stress figure and a dust
figure.    The attracted dust gave clear indications of electrification
beyond the limit of the stress figure, and brought out features of
detail which helped to explain the nature of the electrification.
Analysis of the character of the figures in this respect is still further
helped by combining a modification of the dust process of Liclitenberg
with the stress effect described in this paper.             The modification
referred to consists in allowing the dust—the mixture of red lead
and sulphur proposed by Lichtenberg — to be drawn up to the elec
trified surface from a cloud of dust. This assists in the selective
appropriation of the two substances, giving a redder colour on the
negatively electrified portions of the figure, and a yellower colour on
the positive portions ; and showing what the stress figure alone does
not show with equal clearness, how inseparable are the + and —
actions.     The best effect is obtained by applying the dust process
before development by heat.          Figs. 4 and 5 (Plate 1) represent
characteristic    forms obtained by positive and negative discharges
with a metal ball electrode above the surface and a metal disc below,
fig. 4 being + and fig. 5 — . Figs 6 and 7 are corresponding figures
obtained with discs above and below, fig. 6 being +- and fig. 7 — .

                  produced in Resin.   $c,  by Electrification.             45
 Figs. 8 and 9 are additional examples of negative discharge figures
 with larger disc electrodes.
     An excellent dust figure, in which the result of + electrification is
strongly developed, is obtained by suspending, face downwards, an
electrified resin snrface in a very thin fume-cloud produced by burn
ing magnesium ribbon.            The fume should be enclosed in a box, or
under a glass shade, and an hour should elapse for the coarser parti
cles to subside before the introduction of the electrified            surface.
Sulphur      in a  state of sublimation can   also be used  in  the same way
with good effect, especially for very small areas of electrification,
where microscopically fine development is required.            On the whole,
however,      I have found nothing better than red lead and sulphur
ground separately to very fine powder, and used very dry in a dust
ing box, the electrified surface always being downward when exposed
to   it.
     With the     object of finding the degree and kind of interaction
between     the positive and negative electrification produced on opposite
sides of a solid dielectric, interposed in the path of a single discharge,
the following experiment was made : — A thin plate of glass was
coated on both sides by dipping in melted resin, this was electrified
 by bringing the secondary terminals of the induction coil, arranged
as in the experiments already described, to opposite sides of the plate.
 The terminals were brass balls 8 mm. diameter, placed in a vertical
 line, the + above, the — below the plate in a horizontal position ;
 the + ball was 1 mm. distant from the upper surface of the plate,
 and the — ball was in contact with the under surface.            Under these
 conditions when an 8-mm. spark passed at the spark-gap, reciprocal
 figures of a very interesting character were produced, a + figure on
 the tipper surface and a — figure on the under surface.
     To enable photographs to be taken of these figures without in
 terference, the experiment was repeated with the variation that a
 plate of ruby glass coated with resin on both sides was used instead of
 clear glass.     The latent figure was first developed by means of the red
 lead and sulphur cloud, and afterwards the stress effect was brought
 out by heat. Fig. 10 shows the form of the fignre on the + side, and
  fig. 11 that on the — side. When these double figures are viewed by
  transmitted light, it is seen that the interior — rays on one side,
  coincide with the inner ends of the outward streaming + rays on
  the opposite side.
      That the depth of penetration of the charge which produces these
  figures is very small is shown by the almost complete discharge
  effected by washing the electrified surface with water.
      The experiments seem to show that when an electric discharge
   takes place through air, its propagation is attended by a structural
   arrangement of the air brought under the influence of the discharge,

 46                           Dr. C. I. Forsyth Major.
 and that when a dielectric like resin is interposed in its path, some
 of the characteristics of the form into which the electrified air has
 been thrown are transferred to the resin surface as an electric charge,
 generating the stresses and other inductive effects which result in
 the dust and stress figures.
    Experiments corresponding to those described made in an atmo
 sphere of carbonic acid gas at normal atmospheric pressure, and in
 air at pressures lower than the normal, show that the character of
 the figure imprinted on a dielectric in receiving an electric charge
•through a gaseous medium is largely dependent on the density of the
 atmosphere conveying the charge ; greater density tending to con
 centration of the figure and attenuation to diffuseness.               With an air
 pressure supporting 85 mm. of mercury, the other conditions being
 such as would have given at normal pressure a characteristic + star
 figure, there was diffuse electrification of the resin surface, but there
 were no rays.

    The casts here described and figured have been moulded from the
 brain-cavities of the skulls of two sub-fossil Lemuroids from Mada
 gascar, the descriptions of which I have already published.                For com

 P. Gervais* arc the best adapted for the present purpose, since they,
 too, are drawn from moulds of the brain cavity, and give on one

in their posterior moiety and suddenly attenuated anteriorly. Apart
from the Sylvian fissure, the brain surface of Microcebus is perfectly
smooth, whilst the cast of the fossil shows a greater complication than
in any other known Lemurid. This is in accordance with what might
have been anticipated,               Globilemur being larger than any living
Lemnrid, and, as Broca states : " TJn cervean qui grandit doit seplisser
                                " this, in
tout peine de dechoir*             ;           my opinion in fact, means that for
economy       of   space plication is resorted to as a means of increasing
the surface.
    In the arrangement of its convolutions (fig. 2), the fossil departs
likewise from what is known of Lemurid brains, and approaches
rather more to what is presented by some of the larger Cebidce and
Cercopithecidm.          In Lemurids the fissures and the corresponding con
volutions show a tendency towards a longitudinal arrangement, quite
different from the more radiating direction exhibited by the fossil. Its
Sylvian fissure («./.), on the other hand, corresponds in its more vertical
direction to what we find in Lemurids, and in this respect departs
more from the Old and New World monkeys, though less from the
former than from the latter. The character mentioned is in relation
with the development of the occipital lobe, the Sylvian fissure being
always more horizontally directed in those brains in which the
occipital lobe is well developed and in which, as a consequence, the
cerebellum is covered. In fact, in Globilemur, the cerebellum is much
less overlapped than in the monkeys.
     In the lesser development of the frontal lobes we find a f urther
agreement with Lemurids as compared with monkeys, and equally
 ro in the more macrosmatic character of the brain of Globilemur, as
 revealed by its voluminous olfactory lobes.
      I shall not enter into farther particulars as it is never safe to
 attempt to make out the exact homologies of the fissures in a cast of
 the brain cavity.          Moreover, in this case, I find that the two sides of
 the hemispheres do not agree in every respect, owing partly to the
 incomplete condition of the skull and partly to the difficulties encoun
 tered by the artist in the moulding.

of the smaller animal exceeded that of Megaladapis.          So far as can
be judged from the cast (fig. 4), the hemispheres were much less
convoluted than in the large existing recent Lemurids, their fore-
and hind-parts being apparently almost smooth in the fossil form.
  The reduced proportions of, or, more properly speaking, the
absence of, the occipital lobe, is testified by the cerebellum remaining
uncovered.
  But the most remarkable character is exhibited by the anterior
beak-like continuation of the hemispheres (fig. 5, 6), which presents
in section a triangular form with a broad, flattened base and a
trenchant superior margin.     The corresponding part of the skull has
been elsewhere described,* when it was shown that the correspond
ing constriction of the brain cavity is due to the enormously
developed frontal sinuses protruding into the anterior portion of the
cerebral and olfactory fossro.
    The optic nerves will help us by indicating the orientation in this
curiously shaped brain (fig. 3 and fig. G). From a comparison of
the inferior part of the brain of Megaladapis with that of an Indris
(fig. 7), it will be seen that in the former the frontal lobes are
absent, and the part of the hemispheres situated in front of the
optic nerves is represented by scarcely anything but the posterior
part of the before-mentioned beak (fig. 6), which continues anteriorly

diles (fig. 8), the fore part of the hemispheres, anterior to the optic
nerves, appears less reduced than in this Mammal.

                                be obtained as to the
tractus and the bulbi, as it was not possible to mould this portion
of the narrow channel running between the internal walls of the
frontal sinuses nor could this unique skull be bisected. As far as
                     ;
can be made out, the canal in question widens in proximity to the
cribrif orm plate, so as to form the chambers for the lodgment of the
olfactory bulbs.t

          On    the Brains  of two Sub- Fossil Malagasy Lemuroids.          4'J
    As has been pointed out in the description of the skull of Megala
dapis* its post-orbital region is remarkably elongate in the lateral
parts, in a manner quite unusual amongst Lemuroidea, and for
parallels of which we have to look amongst Carnivora, and especially
Iasecticora (e.g., Centetes).     An external and superficial examination
of the skull might lead to the belief that this elongation has resulted
in an anterior elongation of the brain-cavity as well. But as we
hare just seen, in Megaladapis the elongation in question is brought
about by the development of air sinuses, whilst the cranial cavity is
on the contrary shortened, as well as narrowed.
    Although in this skull the sutures are almost entirely obliterated,
it is obvious that in the elongation of the lateral parts of the post-
orbital region, the orbits and the alisphenoids participate as well as
the frontal8.        This is well shown by the fact that, whilst in
 Lemnrids generally, as well as in monkeys, the passage for the
optic nerves from the internal cavity to the orbits, of which we
speak as the optic foramen, is a very short one — very oblique in the
 former, almost parallel in the latter, — we find in Megaladapis that
 the second pair of nerves traverse a canal of no less than 24*3 mm.
 length, before appearing at the outer side of the skull, in the orbits.
So that, in lieu of a foramen opticum, we have here a canalis opticus.
 The united foramina rotundum and lacerum anterius form likewise a
canal of about 21*5 mm. length.
    When describing the skull of Megaladapis, I endeavoured to show
 that its peculiar low condition is not primitive, but pseudo-primitive
 (Furbringer), that is to say, that it has been brought about by a
   retrogressive evolution," or a retrograde metamorphosis, if the last
 u
 term be preferred.       If any further proof were needed for this asser
 tion, it would be furnished by the conformation, of the brain, as
 described above, for I trust that no anatomist will maintain that this
 was the primitive condition in Lemuroids.         It may fairly be predicted
 that, when we come to know the skulls of very young specimens of
 Megaladapis, they will show a much closer approach to the ordinary
  Lemnrid type in the conformation of the brain cavity and its walls,
  and the gap between the young and the adult in this respect will
  prove to be wider than perhaps in any other known Mammal.             How
  ever, in the Insectivora and most of all in Centetes, we find also a
  very great difference between young and adult in the relative size and
 conformation of the brain (the brain being even absolutely smaller in
  the old), whilst the least divergence is to be found in Marsupials
  on the one side, in Man on the other, and this obviously for opposite
  reasons.

 " On the Occlusion of Oxygen and Hydrogen by Platinum

    The heat of occlusion of hydrogen in platinum black was deter
 mined by saturating the platinum black with hydrogen, extracting-
 as much of this as possible at 184° C. by means of the pump, and
 then readmitting it again whilst the experimental tube was placed in
 an ice calorimeter.          By proceeding in this way, errors due to the pre-
 existence of oxygen in the platinum black were avoided, and it was

           Occlusion   of Oxygen and Hydrogen by Platinum Black.         51
found that 68"8 K (6880 j-calories) were evolved per gram of
hydrogen occluded.          It is shown that the arguments put forward by
Berthelot in favour of the existence of the compounds PtjoH, and
Pt»Ha are not justified. According to Favre there is a difference
between the behaviour of palladium and platinum to hydrogen, inas
much as when hydrogen is admitted fractionally, in small portions at
a time, the heat evolved in the former case is constant, whilst in the
latter it becomes less and less. This difference is apparent only and
not real, and is due to the presence of oxygen in the platinum black.
     In order to determine the heat of occlusion of oxygen in platinum
black, a great many experiments were made to try to remove the
oxygen, which is always present, without destroying the occlusive
property of the platinum, and so obtain platinum black which would
per & occlude oxygen directly at the temperature of the calorimeter,
and thus eliminate all corrections for the simultaneous occurrence of
other reactions.        Several reducing agents were employed, including
 sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide, ammonia, methyl alcohol, and
 formic acid in the state of vapour and in dilute solution, and it was
 found that, although the oxygen was removed, the reducing sub
 stance or its products of decomposition were occluded by the plati
 num black, and were just as difficult to remove as the oxygen itself ;
 and, fnrther, the volume of gas given off, derived from the reducing
 agent or its decomposition products, was approximately equal to the
 volume of oxygen originally contained in the platinum black.            In
 most cases this was about 100 volumes.
     An extended series of experiments is described showing how
 platinum oxygen and platinum hydrogen can exist in the presence of
 each other.        If the quantity of hydrogen which is theoretically
 necessary to remove all the oxygen in the form of water be admitted
 to platinum black, then, instead of removing all the oxygen first with
  formation of water, the hydrogen only removes the oxygen from the
 platinum black with which it first comes into contact, and imme
  diately takes its place.
     The heat of occlusion of oxygen in platinum black was finally
  Measured both directly and indirectly in the following ways.        Plati-
  anm black fully charged with hydrogen was exhausted at 184° C. to
  remove as much of this gas as possible.       The experimental tube was
  then placed in the calorimeter, and oxygen was added in small quan
  tities at a time.   From the experiments on the co-existence of platinum
  oxygen with platinum hydrogen, the heat evolved during this process
  was known to be partially due to the formation of water and partially
  to the occlusion of oxygen.        The vacuum in the apparatus remained
  perfect up to a certain point, when the presence of a slight excess of
  oxygen caused the pressure to increase.        On now admitting oxygen
   op to full atmospheric pressure, a further small quantity of oxygen was
                                                                 I 2

52       Mr.  J. Norman     Lockyer.         On t/ie Appearance      of tlie
occluded, and the heat evolved represented the true heat of occlusion
of this quantity of oxygen.
    Indirectly, the same value was obtained by charging the platinum
black up fully and alternately with hydrogen and oxygen, and finally
with oxygen.      The amount of oxygen really occluded in the last
charge, and independent of that which had gone to form water, was
then    found by exhausting in vacuo at a red heat.                 The difference
between this quantity and the total amount of oxygen used is a
measure of the oxygen which formed water with twice as much
hydrogen by volume.           Knowing these quantities, the total heat
evolved, the heat of formation of water, and the heat absorbed on
the removal of hydrogen, we have             all the data for calculating the
heat of occlusion of oxygen.
    In a similar way the amount               of heat absorbed per gram of
 oxygen removed was      calculated from the data obtained during the
penultimate charge.
    The mean value for the heat of occlusion of oxygen, from the
direct and indirect measurements, which did not differ much from
each other, is +110 K (1100 (/-calories) per gram.                    This value
referred   to 16 grams   of oxygen    is  +176     K,  which   is almost   identical
with Thomsen's measurement of the heat of formation of platiuous
hydrate    Pt(OH)„   viz., +179 K.
    This agreement suggests the possibility that the two phenomena
may in reality be identical, the necessary water being always present
in platinum black dried in vacuo.
    The paper concludes with some speculations on the nature of the
occlusion of gases.
" On the Appearance of the Cleveite and other New Gas Lines
       in the Hottest Stars."            By J. Norman Lookyer, C.B.,

    In  my recent paper on
                                " The Chemistry of          the Hottest Stars," *
 I left for future discussion the spectra of those stars apparently at
 or near the apex of the temperature curve, for the reason that in
 them the lines of known gases do not show very great variations,
while the enhanced lines cease to be of service as a criterion of
temperature.      I pointed   out, however, that there were several lines,
as   yet of unknown origin, which are strong in some of these stars
and weaker in others, and that the study of these might eventually
help us in classifying such stars and arranging them in temperature

             Cleveite and other new Gas Lines in the Hottest Stars.                    53
order, but that before attempting to use the unknown lines in these
inquiries it was important in the first instance to discriminate, if
possible, between gaseous and metallic lines. Until this point was
investigated the relative behaviour of the lines of hydrogen and
cleveite gases near the npper temperature limit could not be satis
factorily discussed.
     The work has now been carried on a stage further, and in the
present paper I propose to give the results of the inquiry into (1)
the appearances of the lines of gases, both old and new, in the
spectra in question, and (2) the most probable sequence of tempera
ture in the stars under discussion.
 The    Spectral Lines      by which the     Sequence   of the Hottest    Stars can     be
                                         determined.
     In the former paper I stated the sequence of certain stare, both of
 increasing and decreasing temperature, as determined chiefly by the
 enhanced lines of iron and the lines of the cleveite gases.                      At the
 junction of the two series I provisionally grouped together Bellatriz,
 T Orionis,         UrssB Majoris, X Tauri, and 7 Pegasi, pointing out that
 their spectra were not quite identical and might afterwards be
 >eparated when the criteria had been further studied.*
     Further inquiry has shown that 7 Pegasi may be regarded as
 practically identical with Bellatrix, while 7 Ursse Majoris and X Tauri
 differ from it chiefly in the general haziness of the lines ; no attempt
 has been made, therefore,             to separate these stars from Bellatriz.
 Other stars included in the present discussion were c and e Orionis.
  At the top of the ascending series of stars I placed Rigel and
  C Tanri.t and, among others, at the top of the descending series
  were /3 Persei and a. Andromeda3.
     The sequence of the still hotter stars can, therefore, be deter
  mined by an investigation of the varying intensities in their spectra
  of lines which        appear ; also in stars on one side or other of the
  temperature        curve.    The principal lines utilised in this inquiry are
  as follows :    —

     t This   is one of the most extraordinary spectra which has heen met with in the
  Kensington series of photographs, as     I have already pointed out (' Roy. Soe. Proc.,'
  toL 61, p. 18i).     While the lines of hydrogen are fairly sharp and not very broad,
  many of the lines, especially those of the cleTeite gases, are broadened almost into
  MTi»ibility. On the meteoritic hypothesis this is explained by the great differences
  of Telocity and direction of the meteoritic streams, the special broadening of the
  lines of the cleTeite gases indicating that these gases are chiefly concerned    in dis
  turbances at high temperatures.
      On account of the indistinctness of many of its lines, ? Tauri is omitted from the
   present discussion.

   The accompanying map shows the sequence of spectra in the
hottest stars deduced from the behaviour of the above lines in passing
from the stars of increasing temperature to stars of decreasing tem
perature, and includes also some of the typical stars on both sides of
the curve, namely, a Cygni, 7 Leonis, and Rigel, and ft Persei,
a Andromeda, 7 Lyrse, and a. Canum Venaticorum, in the order pre
viously determined.      In each case the intensities of the various lines
are indicated by their thicknesses, so that the variations in passing
from star to star are plainly shown.          The wave-lengths of the lines
and the origins of the known lines are shown at the bottom of the
map.
    The map enables us to discuss the relative behaviour of each of the
lines, and to notice which thin out or become more intense as the
temperature changes.
    It will be seen that when one set of lines becomes very faint or
disappears, another makes its appearance or becomes intensified.
    The map thus shows the most probable sequence of spectra among
 the stars near the acme of temperature as deduced from the changes
of intensity of the lines given above.

 cussing the appearance of gas X in relation to helium, it is necessary
 to deal with the subordinate series in each case, as the only line of
 the principal series of helium (\ 3888'785) which falls in the photo
 graphic region considered coincides with a hydrogen hue, and           cannot
 therefore be compared with the line of the principal series of         gas X,
 which does come within range.          Taking the lines 4471-6 and     4026'3
  as representing helium, and 4388'1 and4009-4 as representing          gas X,
  the comparison shows that : —
     1. Gas  X does not vary   absolutely   with helium.
     2. Gas  X increases its    intensity at a different rate from that of
           helium.
     3. When helium is at about a maximum so is gas X. The maxi
           mum of gas X is, however, very short lived, while that of
           helium extends very considerably.

with the laboratory work, which indicates that helium and gas X
are to be regarded as distinct substances.
   Comparison of the Lines of the Subordinate Series. — In the above
investigation it has been found that, in tracing the progress of gas X
through the stars of increasing and decreasing temperature in the
photographic    region, the relative intensities of the lines of the
different series are changed from those tabulated in the laboratory.
The lines of tho principal series, as indicated by the line at 39G4 9,
are no longer the strongest, but become of secondary importance as
regards intensity, whilst the first subordinate series now takes the
pi e-eminent position, and the second subordinate series nearly dis
appears altogether, being only represented very feebly near the point
of highest temperature.

  The     above            investigations show that while helium and
                     detailed
gas  X   behave differently as regards their appearance in stars, the
constituent series of each, so far as we can at present study their
behaviour, do not exhibit any remarkable differences.        Thus in the
stars of increasing temperature    there    a steady increase of intensity
                                                           is
of  the three series of lines of gas X, and of the two series of helium
lines, while in the case of cooling stars there           decrease in the         is   a
intensity of each series.
   In the case of gas X      will be seeu that the principal scries
                                it                                    not                                 is
intensified to the same extent as the first subordinate series in passing
from Rigel to Bellatrix, and this seems to suggest that the molecules
corresponding to the principal series do not survive so high a tem
perature as those which produce the lines of the first subordinate
series.
     There   is, however, no sufficient reason for regarding the three
series    of gas X or of helium as representing separate constituents of

58       Mr.    J. Norman Lockyer.           On the Appearance         of the
those gases, and for the present, at all events, each of the three
series of helium or gas X may be taken to represent the vibrations
of molecules of the same gas but of different complexities.
   The differences in the stellar behaviour of helium and gas X have
been confirmed by reference to the researches of Professor Vogel*
and Professor Pickering.f
   I suggest that the time has come to give gas X a definite name.
It -will be remembered that I pointed out in May, 1895,J that helium
•was only one constituent of the gas discovered by Professor Ramsay,
¦which he imagined          to consist of helium alone, and that there was
spectroscopic evidence suggesting at least one other new element
 associated with helium.
   Afterwards, in September, 1895, Professors Runge and Paschen
came to the same conclusion,§ but their work still left indeterminate
 the number of elemental gases in the mixture.
    In the many comparisons of the lines I had to make in my investi
gations I soon found the inconvenience of not having a name for the
gas which gave 667, 501, and other lines, and 1 called it gas X for
laboratory use. When, therefore, Professors Rnnge and Paschen,
who    had endorsed my results, and had extended them, called upon
me,   I thought     it right to suggest to them that, sinking all questions
of priority, we should all three combine in suggesting a name for
 this gas, the elemental character of which we had demonstrated.
                                                      I
    This offer they declined,|| and so far as was concerned the matter
 dropped.
    In the meantime Dr. Stoney has suggested the name " parhelinm."
 But seeing that this word is already in use in another connection for
 a " mock-sun," its acceptance is,           I  think, impossible.        I    propose,
 therefore, the word "asterium," since it is in the stars that the
 behaviour of the new element has been best studied, and its appear
ance furnishes valuable evidence as to their chemistry.

    Discrimination       between Gaseous    and Metallic Lines. — The lines of
 helium, asterium, and hydrogen in the hottest stars are accompanied,
 as I have stated, by others which may either represent gases of a
similar character, or metals at very high temperatures.                  It becomes
 important to consider the means at our command for distinguishing
 between gaseous and the metallic lines.

           Cleveite and other new Gas Lines in the Hottest Stars.              59
     One possible method is this. In the nebulae are found the lines of
hydrogen, helium, and asterium associated with other bright lines of
unknown origins ; it is fair to assume that if other similar gases
exist in the nebulsB, the other bright lines should belong to them.
In the nebulas all these probably exist at low temperatures, since no
indication of the enhanced lines of Fe, Mg, Mn, Ti, &c., have been
detected in the spectra of nebulae, and on this ground we are
driven to give up the old arguments in favour of the high tempera
ture of the nebulae, which depended for their validity upon the
presence of " chomospheric
                                    " lines in the spectrum. The discovery
©f terrestrial helium has enabled              its behaviour, when rendered
luminous, to be studied, and we now know that its presence in a
spectrum is no proof of a very high temperature.
    Further, of all the lines other than hydrogen, helium, and asterium,
so far discovered in the nebulas, it would appear that only a few, if
any, are certainly produced by metallic vapours.*
    If, then, their origins be gaseous, as opposed to metallic, we should
expect to find these lines in the spectrum of those stars in which the
 absorption of hydrogen and the cleveite gases which are associated
with them in ^the nebulas is strong. At present, this method of
separating the gaseous from the metallic lines in the hotter stars
 cannot be finally applied, for the reason that the wave-lengths of
 many of the nebular lines are not sufficiently accurate for the
object in view. But there is little doubt that it will furnish a
 valuable criterion when photographs with larger dispersion become
available.
    Another possible method, however, is open to us.                 In  a. Cygni,
 where the enhanced metallic lines are so strongly developed, the
 helium lines appear very feebly, and it is only in stars at still higher
 temperatnres that helium is strongly represented.                Hence, if there
 are other gases which behave like helium, in stars as well as nebulae,
 they would be intensified in passing from at Cygni through succes
 sively hotter stars, while the enhanced metallic lines become feebler.
 Some of the principal lines which become thus intensified in passing
 to the hottest stars are indicated in the following table.
    Five of the lines given in the table approximately coincide with
 enhanced lines, two with lines of cadmium and three with lines of
 sulphur, but since in the spectrum of the former substance there are
 fifteen enhanced lines    in the same region, and in the latter twenty-
 nine,   the coincidences     may for the      present     be regarded   as  acci
 dental.
     It seems  highly probable therefore that the lines recorded in the
 table represent    gases which have yet to be discovered, and that the

 intensification of lines in the hottest stars in passing from a Cygni is
 a trustworthy criterion for gaseous lines.
    If there are other gases which, like hydrogen, give indications of
 their presence at the temperature of a Cygni, or lower, the lines in the
 spectrum do not, like those of hydrogen, become more intense with
 increased stellar temperature.            In such cases it does not seem
 likely that anything short of the actual discovery of terrestrial
 sources of the gases can help us to differentiate the lines belonging to
them in stellar spectra from those due to metallic substances.
    Attempts to trace Terrestrial Sources of the New Gases. — In a series
of papers communicated to the Eoyal Society I have given an account
of the attempts which         I  have made to find new gases by experi
ments upon minerals similar to those adopted for the extraction of
helium and the associated gases from cleveite.                 In the last paper of
that series I summarised the results which had been obtained, indi
cating that lines occnrring in the spectra of gases from minerals for
which no known origin could be assigned were represented in the
spectra of some of the hotter stars.*
    From this I extract the following list of the lines thus found to

    The  lines thus observed in the spectra of mineral gases may             be
divided     into two    groups, the first comprising those which are
strongest    in  a. Cygni and thin out at higher temperatures, and the
 second    those which are either absent from « Cygni or become
 stronger as the temperature of a Cygni is exceeded.             The lines of
 the first group behave like the enhanced lines of the metals, and,
 unless the gases can be isolated, it is impossible to say whether the
 corresponding stellar lines are produced by gases or the coincidences
 are merely accidental.
    In the case of the second group of lines, however, the probability
 that the mineral gases which give them really represent new lines is
 much greater, since, like the lines of helium, they are most intense
 in the stars which we have every reason to believe to be the hottest.
    Attempts to Trace Series of Lines. — A minute examination                of
  Bellatrix has been made by Dr. W. J. S. Lockyer with a view of
  inquiring whether some of tho many still unknown lines might
  possibly form series like those of helium and asterium.
    With this object the lines in the spectrum were carefully plotted,
  special attention being given to the intensities of the individual lines.
  An examination of the residual spectrum formed by omitting all
  those lines the origins of which were known, showed that possibly
  two further series were present, but a better photograph of the star
  spectrum is required to settle the matter definitely.

  Professor        E. C. Pickering
                                 has recently    announced* that the
spectrum of        f
              Puppis contains  a  new series of lines, which he at first
apposed to be due to some new element.        In a second communica
tion to the same journal.t   he pointed out that he had reason to
suppose that this  new series was in some way connected with
iydrogeu, since he found that the observed lines occupied the same
positions           computed from the same formula and constants,
              as those
from which the ordinary series of hydrogen was calculated, but using
odd values of n instead of even values.

    From the above it will be gathered that the only really marked
difference between f Puppis and Bellatrix is the presence of this new-
series of lines in the spectrum of the former.                As I have only at my
command the published accounts of Professor Pickering and not an
original photograph of this star, a more detailed comparison of tlie
spectra cannot be made, but there seems to be evidence which points
to a higher temperature for the star than that of Bellatrix.
    Professors Pickering and Kayser both concede that this new form

  of hydrogen     is due most probably to a high temperature, and Pro
                                                     " this series has never been
  fessor Kayser       expressly states that
 observed before, and can perhaps be explained by insufficient tem
 perature in our Geissler tubes and most of the stars."*                      I pointed
 out in my former paper that this new series and the one previously
 known are probably of the subordinate type, and that the principal
 series is still unrecognised, f although some of the
                                                                     " unknown " lines
 in stars may possibly belong to it.
     On the supposition that the new series of probable hydrogen lines
in f Puppis represents the effect of a transcendental temperature, an
jttempt has been made to produce this spectrum in the laboratory.
 In the high-tension          spark in hydrogen at atmospheric pressure the
ordinary series of hydrogen lines is very broad, and none of the new
Kiies have so far been detected.                 The use of the spark with large
jars in vacuum tubes results in the partial fusion of the glass and the
appearance of lines which have been traced to silicium, while the new
H'ries has not yet been observed.
                          Final Result     as to Temperature.
    In the    preliminary attempt to determine which are the hottest
.•tars, the following facts and deductions aavo been considered : —
    1. With     increasing temperature hydrogen is first visible, then
helium and asterium appear nearly together, and finally unknown
.ines at   \\  4088-7 and 46509 make their appearance.
    2. The chief helium lines in the region covered by the photographs
become      much thicker after the a Cygni stage has been passed, and
are practically       of equal thicknesses in the stars Bellatrix, Spiea,
f Orionis,        Ononis, c Orionis, and y3 Persei, after which a sudden
diminution in intensity takes place.                These lines give us no criterion
iorthe hottest star of the serieB.
    3. With regard to the chief lines of asterium, namely, 40087 and
1388-1, in the region under            investigation, these both rise to a very
decided maximum in Bellatrix, diminishing afterwards                       in intensity
!«s rapidly than they increased.              The great development of asterium
 after the lines of helium have reached a considerable                  thickness sug
gests a higher temperature            for Bellatrix than      the   neighbouring stars
in the    series.
    4.  As asterium begins to decrease in intensity, the two unknown
 lines before      referred to at         \\    4088-7 and 4650'9 commence to
 brighten,    reaching       a  maximum      at   e Orionis, in which the hydrogen
 iines are still at   a   maximum, but asterium has considerably decreased.
 Only a trace, if any, of these lines can be found in Bellatrix.                      If

(36        Mi*. J. Norman Lockyer.          On the Appearance   of the
these lines when at maximum          are indications of a higher tempera-
tnre than those of asterinm, then, since the hydrogen and helium
lines are also at a maximum, e Orionis on this assumption would be
the hottest star of the series.
     With our present data it is, however, difficult to state with certainty
whether      the principal series of helium or of asterium makes its
appearance first.        There seem, however, to be indications which
 3uggest that asterium is a somewhat later development.
     In summing up        I  may say that e Orionis may be considered the
 hottest star from the behaviour of the lines at 4481'3, 4088 7, 4650"9,
 while    4008-7,   4267  G, and 43881    favour  the star Bellatrix   in this
 respect.
     The helium lines (4026-3 and 447TG) have practically the same
 intensity in both stars, or at any rate there is not sufficient difference
 to serve as a criterion.
                               General Conclusions.
     1.  The order of temperature of stars at and near the apex of the
 temperature curve can only be determined by reference to unknown
 lines, since the enhanced lines of iron are absent, and those of mag
 nesium and calcium are exceedingly feeble, while the lines of the
 known gases show no very marked variations.
     2. The varying appearances of the lines of the cleveite gases indi
 cate, as laboratory work has done, that helium and gas X are distinct
 substances, but there is not yet sufficient evidence for regarding the
 constituent series as belonging to separate substances. It is therefore
 considered that gas X should be definitely named, and the name
 " asterium " is suggested.
     3. There    are two methods open to us for discriminating between
 gaseous     and   metallic lines of still unknown origin in the spectra of
  the hottest   stars,   (a) Gaseous lines like those of helium and hydro
  gen will be common to nebul® and the hottest stars.           (6) Metallic
  lines like those of iron, magnesium, and calcium will thin oat at
  increased stellar temperature, while gaseous lines will become inten
  sified.
      4. Several unknown lines in the spectra of the hottest stars are
  thus shown to be most probably of gaseous origin.
      5. Attempts to trace terrestrial sonrces of these stellar gases have
  resulted in the detection of lines which probably coincide with lines
  in the spectra of the hottest stars.
      6. On the supposition      that these stellar gases are more or less
  allied to helium and asterium, since they have their maximum inten
                                                                     " series "
  sity in the same stars, attempts have been made to trace
  of lines in the spectra. In the case of Bellatrix two probable series

     A    Maya Calendar Inscription, interpreted by Goodman's
          Tables."       By Alfred P. Maudslay.                 Communicated by
          F. Ducane Godman, F.R.S.                    Received April 2, — Read
          June 17, 1897.
                                   [Introductory    Note.
     Chr     knowledge of the Maya Calendar is chiefly derived from                the
  Writings (a.d. 1566) of Diego de Landa, Bishop of Yucatan, who                   not
  ¦sly gave some account           of the divisions of time in use among           the
playas.       but   also  copied,  somewhat roughly, in his manuscript             the
    rns    employed to represent the eighteen named months, and the
     enty    named days into which each month was divided.
     Landa's statements are, however, by no means clear, and there has
          much discussion both as to their correctness in themselves and
      to the interpretation which has been given to them ; moreover, it
         been    found difficult in some instances to Mentify the day and
  ¦onth signs given by him with those used iD the Dresden Codex and
    it few Maya manuscripts          which have been preserved, and still more
            t to identify them with the signs used in the carved inscrip-
     In the accompanying         paper an examination is made of a recently
         vered    inscription, by the aid of calendar tables prepared by Mr.
      T. Goodman, and published             with an explanatory essay in the
     'iologia Centrali- Americana.'          These tables consist of a chrono-
   >fpcal and an annual calendar.            The chronological calendar is based
    'the Ahan, a period of 360 days, and is divided thus : —
                        20 days                     1 chuen
                        18 chnens                   I ahau* (360 days)
     * It
           U  unfortunate that the ahau, or period of 3G0 days, bears the same name 11s
    *of    the  twenty days of the Maya month, and that the chuen, or twenty-day
!           bears the name of another day of the month.

  68       Mr. A.  P. Maudslay.         A Maya Calendar Inscription
                     20 ahaus                     1  katun
                     20 katuns                    1  cycle
                     13 cycles                    1  great cycle
                     73 great cycles     ....     1  grand era
      The annual calendar is divided into eighteen named months, each
  consisting of twenty named days, and one short month (named
  Uayeb) of five days.
      The twenty named days of the month are numbered continuously
  from 1 to 13, so that if the first-named day of the month has the number
  I attached to it, the last-named day of the month will be numbered
  7 (13 + 7 = 20), and the first day of the next month will be num
  bered 8, and so on.
     There are fifty-two annual calendars in a calendar round, and at
  the end of the 52nd year the series is repeated.
     All the dates and reckonings found on the monuments which can
 be made out by the aid of these tables are expressed in Ahaus,
  Katuns, &c, and not in years ; but Mr. Goodman maintains that the
 true year was known to the Mayas, and that it is by the concurrent
 use of the chronological and annual tables that the dates carved on
•the monuments can be properly located in the Maya Calendar.
     All the dates which have as yet come under notice fall within the
 three Great Cycles, numbered by Mr. Goodman the 53rd, 54th, and
 oath.
                                                        '         '
     The following extract from       an  article in      Nature       (July 8, 1897)
 gives a good example of the manner in which a date is expressed : —
     " called attention, some years ago, to the fact that the greater
       I
 number of the carved inscriptions commenced with tasily recognised
 series of glyphs with numerals or faces attached to them, which I
 called the Initial Series. Mr. Goodman now shows that the Initial
¦Series expresses a date thns :
                                   —
                  5.               6.               7.             8.
    (1) The Great Cycle sign. (2) The Cycle.     (3) The Katun.       (4) The Ahau.
(3)   The Chuen.   (6)  The Day.    (7)  The  named    day.   (8) The    named month.

                          interpreted by Goodman's          Tables.                 09
  As has been        long known, each bar counts as five, and each dot as a
  nnir.     (The   roundish      marks under the glyphs are not part of the
 numerical series.)
     "The sigtis in front of the Ahau, Chuen, and Day signs denote a
 'full count ' of those periods. The date thus reads : —
                     (1.) 54th                             great cycle.

                     (8.)   13  Yax (month).
    "A
           reference to Mr. Goodman's chronological calendar shdws that
 'he 15th Katun of the 9th Cycle of the 54th Great Cycle commences
 *ith the day 4 Ahau, the 13th day of the month Tax, the date which
 is here given        in the inscription. The combination 4 Ahau 13 Yax
  •aa only occnr once in a period of fifty-two years.
    "
       One of Mr. Goodman's diseoveries is the system on which the
Mayas numbered the different series of time divisions.                  For instance,
the twenty Ahaus are not numbered                    1, 2, 3, &c, up to 20, but they
 *ere numbered 20, 1 2, 3, Ac, to 19.
    "If we should nowadays wish to use a similar notation, we should
probably number the series 0, 1, 2, &c, 19 ; but it seems as though
tie Mayas, having no sign for 0, wrote the sign for 20 or a 1 full
         '
count of Ahaus in the first place.
    "
       The eighteen Chnens are in like manner numbered 18, 1, 2, 3,
ic, to 17, the same sign being used for a ' full count ' of Chuens as
                                   '
  - ris^d for a ' full count          of Ahaus.
    "As a     ' full          '                                                   '

              Maya Inscription from Piedras Negras.
   (The glyphs are read downwards in double columns from left to right.)

                    interpreted  by Goodmans 'lables.                   71
easy (published      in the Archaeological Section of the ' Biologia
Centr&li-Americana ') were issuing from the press, I received from
Mr. Teobert Maler a number of photographs             of sculptures and
inscriptions which he had recently discovered in Yucatan and the
country   to the south of it as far as the banks           of the River
Usamaciuta.
   One  of these inscriptions from Piedras Negras on the Usumacinta
s in a good     state of preservation, and a drawing made by Miss
Annie Hunter from the photographic      print is here reproduced (p. 70).
   As Mr. Goodman has never seen this inscription, an examination
if it with the help   of his notes and calendar tables will be a fair test
 f their value.
   Tbe following signs are figured in Mr. Goodman's essay, and        will
wfonnd to agree fairly well with those in the inscription.

72       Mr. A. P. Maudslay.        A   Maya Calendar Inscription
Signs for the named davs —
           Cimi.            Crb.             Ymii.            Ahau.
Signs for the named months
                           —
     Yailfin.      Kankio.          Uo.           Tax.           Mnan.
   The glyph     A 1 is the initial glyph indicating the Great Cycle.         It
has more the appearance ©f the sign for the 53rd than for that of the
54th Great Cycle, but the signs for the different Great Cycles are
still in need of elucidation, and the subsequent reckoning shows
clearly that the dates fall within the table given by      Mr. Goodman as
that of the 54th Great Cycle.
   The next glyph B 1 is the Cycle sign •with the numeral 9 in front
of  it (one bar = 5 and four dots = 4).
   A 2 is the Katun sign with the numeral 12 in front of it (two
bars = 10, and two dots = 2 ; the hollow curve between the two
round dots is merely used to fill up the space, and does not count).
   B 2 is the Ahau sign with the numeral 2.
   Turning to the tables of Mr. Goodman's chronological calendar, of
which an extract showing the 10th to the 14th Katuns of the 9th
 Cycle is here given, we find that the first day of the —
                                2nd Ahau,
                               12th Katun,
                                 9th Cycle,
                               54th Great Cycle,
falls on the day 2 Ahau, the 18th day of the month Xul            (which is
underlined in the table).
   This is as far as the chronological calendar can guide           us.     We
have next to find the position of this date in the annual           calendar.
The date can only occur once in the fifty-two years which         constitute
a calendar round, and an examination        of the tables shows that    it falls
in the first year of the calendar round (where it is marked with a
square).

    The next glyph in the inscription A 3 is the Chuen sign with the
                        " foil count " of Chuens, in front of it. As a
 sign which signifies a
full count of Chuens is 18 and equals 1 Ahau, and as the number of
Ahaoa has already been recorded, tbe glyph A 3 means that no odd
Chuens are to be added to the date already expressed.
   The glyph B 3 is the sign for a day (of twenty-four hours) pre
ceded by the numeral 16.
   TnrniDg to the first year of the annual calendar, we now add
these 16 days to 2 Ahau 18 Xul, the date already arrived at, and
it will he found to bring us to 5 Cib 14 Yaxkin (marked with a
circle).
  That this reckoning is correct is shown by the inscription itself
where  the result is expressed; A 4 being 5 Cib, and B 7 14 Yaxkin.
The six glyphs in the inscription intermediate between the sign of
tbe day Cib, and the sign of the month Yaxkin, have not yet been
thoroughly deciphered, but there is reason to suppose that they
contain a parallel reckoning differently expressed.
  The next three glyphs are undeciphered ; then comes another
reckoning : —
   C 1 is the Chuen sign with the numeral 10 (two bars = 10) above
it, and a " fnll count" sign at the side.   Whether the 10 applies to
'.he Chaens or days can only be determined    by experiment, and such
experiment in this case shows that the reckoniug intended to be
                               " full count " of
expressed, is 10 Chuens and a                    days, that  for prac-
                                                                    is
tital   purposes   10 Chuens only,   for   as in the last    reckoning when the
fall    count of Chuens was expressed in the Ahaus, so here the full
count     of days  isexpressed in the Chuens.
      The next glyph D    1   an Ahau sign, preceded by the numeral
                              is                                              12.
      This gives us —
               12 Ahaus (12 x 360) = 4320 days.
               10 Chuens (10x20) = 200 „
                                           4520 days.
                                           4380     ,i= 12 years.
                                               140 days.
  Adding 4520 days, «r 12 years and 140 days, to the date          Cib   5

              it     us to  the date  Cib 14

   It is  true   that in the sign in the glyph E    2 is  not the sign usually
employed, for the day Ymix, but that it is a day sign we know from
the fact that it is included in a cartouche, and I am inclined to think
that  the more usual Ymix sign (something like an open hand with
the fingers extended) was inclosed in the oval on the top of the
grotesque head, hut it is too much worn for identification.

the inscription with those to which the computations have guided us

"Influence of Acids and Alkalis upon the Electrotonic Cur
     rents of Medullated Nerve." By Augustus D. Waller,
     M.D., F.R.S. Received June 10,— Read June 17, 1897.
                      A. The Effect   of   Acids and   of   Alkalis.
   Considering that electrotonic currents are characteristic of living
medullated nerve, that such currents are due to electrolytic polarisa
tion, and that such electrolysis must primarily consist in     libera       a
tion of electronegative principles (oxygen, acid, Ac.) at the anode,
and of electropositive     principles (hydrogen, base, <fec.) at the
kathode, the  first and most obvious test to be made to examine com
                                                                  is
paratively the action of acids and bases upon anelectrotonic and
katelectrotonic currents.
  On the supposition that a medullated nerve-fibre      composed of    is
two different electrolytes, white fatty sheath and grey proteid axis,
and that electrolytic polarisation       aroused at the interface of
                                              is
separation between these two electrolytes, we may expect to find, as
the characteristic acidic effect, diminution of A and increase of               K,
and as the characteristic basic effect, increase of A and diminution
of   K.
        expectation is in the main substantiated
     This                                          by experiment,

within which moderate effects are produced,       not common to

    Partly for this reason, and partly in order to eliminate the re

    In the earlier observations      series of anelectrotonic and of katelec-
trotonic    currents were separately recorded.          In the later observa
tions   the A and K currents were taken at alternate minutes by
means     of a rotating reverser in the polarising            circuit.    In the
finished   records A currents read upwards, and              K currents read
downwards.

 experiments     (e.g., in plates 2429 and 2424) the diminution of A/K i
 principally due     to  increase of K.
    An increase of the quotient A/K may be by increase of A or bi
 diminution of K. In plate 2360, and in most of my other experi
 ments, it is mainly by diminution of K.
    The two plates illustrate the points that acid affects           A  more thai
 it does K, and that base affects K more than it does A.
    As mentioned above, acid above optimum strength causes a diminu
 tion of K ; we may, therefore, say that weak acid causes augmented K
 and stronger acid diminished K.
    On testing carefully with very weak acids we shall find that at :
 strensth below the optimum (giving diminished A and increased K
                             "              "
 e.g., Plate 2429) the         very weak acid causes augmented A. W<
 may, therefore, say that very weak acid causes augmented A and
 rather stronger acid diminished A. And in general summary of tht
 action of acid from minimal to maximal effective we may state that: —

            upon   the Electrotonic Currents      of Medullated Nerve.        85
    (1)    The weakest acid gives increased A.
    (2)    Slightly stronger acid gives diminished A and increased K.
    (3) Still stronger acid gives diminished K.
    These statements are the outcome of a considerable number of
observations, and one may hardly hope to verify the progressive
action of acid from minimal to maximal in a single observation with
i single acid. Nor is it easy to give numbers in lien of the indefinite
                    " weak " and "                  This much may, however,
qualifications                         strong."
be    said   to give an idea of the order of magnitudes dealt with.
The     second degree of change may be expected in consequence of
bathing the nerve for one minute in an acid solution of a strength
between N/20 and N/10.              The free passage of " much " C02 into
the nerve-chamber usually affects the second degree of change in its
most typical form.          A small amount of C02, e.g., a few puffs of
expired air, will more probably affect the first degree of change.             A
b»th of one minute's duration in a N/5 solution of mineral acid will
almost certainly affect the third degree of change.              A diminution of
K by CO! is rare (e.g., 2363).
              B.  The Effect »f Carbonic Acid and of Tetanisation.
     I have given particular attention to the action of carbon dioxide
 iod    of tetanisation    upon the A and K currents, in prosecution of
 :beervations already reported concerning                 the action-currents of
 nerve* and the influence of temperature upon the A and K currents.
     The usual and typical effects of carbonic acid are of the charac
 teristic   acidic type, consisting in    a diminution of     A and an augmenta
  tion  of  K.

     Less commonly, and by a slighter degree of action of CO,, the A

 action of COj the K current may be diminished.

 The second being the usual and typical result, the first and third
 being less frequently observed.
    Prolonged tetanisatiou (five minutes) modifies the A and K currents
 in a similar direction, causing a diminution (but sometimes an aug
 mentation) of the A current and an augmentation (nearly alwjys) of
 the K current (2424).

               Fig. 11— Effect  of tetanisation on A and K  (2424).
   Thus it will  be seen that the two groups          of results, although not
absolutely coincident, are in reasonable agreement, the two points of
difference being that an augmentation of the A current has been
more frequent by tetanisation           than by CO» ; while a diminution
of the K current, rarely observed in consequence of the full action
of C02, has been still more rare (once only, and that not very
markedly, 2287) in consequence of tetanisation.
   Of these several effects the most characteristic has been the
augmentation of K (2424, fig. 11) with a consequent diminution of
the quotient A/K. And although — in correspondence with the not
infrequent augmentation of A, there has been not infrequently an
augmentation of A/K — this latter augmentation has generally beer
slight or even doubtful as compared with its opposite.              I have been
led to admit diminution of A/K as typical (2424, fig. 11, 242J
2427), and a distinct augmentation of A/K as exceptional (2387,
2388, 2393) or doubtful. (A similar augmentation of A/K by pre.
dominant augmentation of A has not hitherto come under mj
observation in consequence of the action of COj.)

              Fio. 15. — Effect of tetanisation on  A (diminution)  (2296).
    The   chief results of these experiments (and of those on tempera
 ture* )  are to the following effect : —
    The    katelectrotonic current is augmented in consequence of (a)
rise of   temperature, (b) acidification, (c) tetanisation.
    It is diminished by basification.          Its augmentation by tetanisation
gradually declines during repose.
   The anelectrotonic current is diminished in consequence of rise of
temperature.        It is augmented by " very slight " acidification and
                                        "         "
by tetanisation, diminished by slight acidification and tetanisation.
   The characteristic effect of the presumably " dissociative
                                                                               " in
fluence of rise of temperature, of acidification, and of tetanisation, is
a diminution of the quotient A/K.              A slighter and less assured effect
of tetanisation consists in an augmentation of the quotient A/K.
   Note. — The foregoing observations form part of an investigation of
the action of reagents on nerve, towards the expenses of which a
grant was made by the Physiological Sub-committee of the British
Association to Miss S. C. M. Sowton, acting as my assistant in
the prosecution of the research.              Our experiments during the last
year have fallen under four heads: — (1) On the action of acids and
alkalis upon action-currents ; (2) on the action of acids and
alkalis upon electrotonic currents ; (3) on the action of temperature
upon electrotonic        currents ; (4) on the action of anesthetics,              of
neutral salts, and of alkaloids upon electrotonic currents.                 The first
and fourth of these four groups are not sufficiently advanced for
publication, and have required to be prefaced by the second group
which is now reported upon. The third group is briefly reported on
in ' Roy. Soc. Proc.,' Dec. 17, 1896.
   I wish to acknowledge Miss Sowton's active participation during
the past year in the work above specified.                      Experiments under
headings (1) and (4) will, it is to be hoped, be sufficiently advanced
for publication during the coming year.

100      Mr. W. Gardiner.                     The Histology     of the Cell Wall,
" The Histology of the Cell Wall, with Special Reference to
 * the Mode of Connexion of Cells. Preliminary Communica
    tion." By Walter Gardiner, M.A., F.R.S.. Fellow and
       Bursar of Clare College, Cambridge.                         Received August 11,
       1897.
  Since 1883* I have repeatedly endeavonred to discover some refined
and generally applicable method by meaas of which the fine fibrillse,
or " connecting threads," traversing the cell membrane might be
identified       certainty, and the fact of their existence settled
               ¦with
beyond dispute.    I was also anxious to be in a position to investigate
the development of the threads in endosperm tissue.       My researches
met with little encouragement until 1894, when       succeeded in findI
ing a new method, by means of which I obtained excellent results
with the young developing endosperm tissue of Tamus communis.
This I have further elaborated, so that either the original method, or
modifications of           it,
                  can be applied to tissues generally.  In the present
communication    propose
                   I       to give  a brief account  of my researches,
leaving a more detailed description to a future occasion.
   The methods used by earlier observers for the investigation of
connecting threads are essentially based upon those of Sachs and of
Hanstein, by means of which they demonstrated the characteristic
structure of sieve-tubes. Tangl's important results of 1880, which
were   confirmed            and       myself in 1883, were in fact
                                  extended        by
obtained     by Hanstein's method     such, and are the outcome of
                                                   as
quite special conditions, and a happy combination of circumstances,
depending upon the fact that in dry ripe seeds the tissue is so poor in
water that with the iodine and Schulze's solution (Chlor. Zinc. Iod.),
the cellulose fails to give the usual blue colour, and thus allows the
darkly stained threads to come into view. The method ceases to
work with unripe seeds, or even with ripe seeds which contain a
certain percentage of water, and with ordinary tissue       quite useless.     is
   Certain modifications  of  the method of    Sachs, and the method of
Hanstein, which may be described in general terms as involving both
a more regulated application of the swelling agents and the use of
aniline dyes in place of iodine, were first and independently intro
duced by Rus80w and myself in the years 1882 and 1883.        As regards
my own researches, my    first results in 1882  were obtained by a modi
fication of Sachs' method, and consisted in swelling sections of fresh
tissue with snlphuric acid, and then staining with Hofmann's violet
(methyl violet) washed out with glycerine, or with Hofmann's blue
dissolved in picric acid (picric Hof maun's blue). This was succeeded
                       *

  in 1883     by a second method, which was a modification of that of
  Hanstein, and consisted in treating sections of fresh material •with
  iodine solution, swelling with Chlor. Zinc. Iod. and staining with
 picric    Hofmann's blue or methyl violet.             Certain results obtained by
 this   latter treatment were so promising that in my final paper in
 1883, with the customary rashness of youth,                  I described the method
              "
 as  being      perfectly satisfactory ;" but no long period elapsed before
 I found in practice that it was of but limited application.
    Speaking generally, and excepting Poirault's* researches, I think
one   is  justified in saying that since 1883 little or no advance has been
 made     in the improvement of methods, and that later observations
 rest  mainly on small modifications of the methods of Russow and
rnself.
    The     careful and detailed work of Kienitz-Gerlofff unfortunately
 serves    in great measure to demonstrate the unsatisfactory nature of
 the results obtained        by the sulphuric acid method, and to prove that
 unless the threads are of exceptional size, as in Viscum album, or as
in sieve-    tubes, the method is unreliable.            The above remarks equally
apply    to such of my own results as depend upon the sulphuric acid
 modification.
    An advance was, however, made               by Poirault.      In place of experi
menting on sections of fresh tissue, he killed and hardened pieces of
timie in dilute iodine solution, and from the preserved material he
then cut sections,          which were swollen with Chlor. Zinc. Iod., or
 sulphuric acid, and stained either with eosin, Poirrier's acid brown,
methyl violet, crocein, or aniline green.                  Poirault's researches are
limited to the ferns aud other vascular cryptogams, and lie buried,
v> to speak, in his paper
                                     " Anatomical Researches on the Vascular
Cryptogams." While certain of his figures are, perhaps, not entirely
convincing, the results of his research are most important, and of
great interest.        I am ashamed to say that I was unaware of the
existence of this paper until the autumn of 1895, w hich was a year

it with success to the study of young endosperms.                     The great merit
of Poirault's modification          is that here for the first time provisions are
made for preserving and hardening the tissue before taking sections.

appears      to have   given   excellent   results.

vations on this particular branch of cytology, certain salient facts
come to the fore.          In the first place one learns that material pre
 served in alcohol does not appear to be suitable for the investigation,

 102     Mr. W. Gardiner.        The Histology of  the   Cell Wall,
appears generally necessary to bring about a definite swelling of the
cell wall. Thirdly, that it is not easy to stain and isolate the threads,
even when they are known to be present.
   These facts place many obstacles in the -way of successful research.
The difficulties attending the manipulation of fresh tissue are
sufficiently obvious, and are apt to be so increased by the subsequent
swelling    as  to render   any really refined investigation well-nigli
impossible, and as long as the threads cannot be stnined so as to
stand out clearly from the rest of the wall their identification is out
of the question.    These difficulties, which are sufficiently pronounced
in the case of peculiarly favourable material such as that of endo
sperm, are only magnified when the investigation is concerned with
ordinary or young tissue. In addition to the drawbacks alrpady
mentioned, the existing methods of research hitherto in use make
no provision for the preservation of tissue.
   It became obvious, therefore, that if the inquiry into the relations
of the cell wall and the connecting        threads was to be prosecuted
•with success, a more refined     method must be devised, which could
be reduced to terms of the usual procedure, viz., killing, fixing,
hardening, preserving, cutting section, staining, and mounting, and
that the methods heretofore in      use were too coarse   for so delicate an
investigation.
   I do not propose in the present paper either to give an account
of the discovery of my method, or to go into elaborate technical
details.    It is sufficient to say that, expressed in the simplest
terms,   the   method appears to depend upon the use of two prin
cipal reagents, viz., the osmic-acid-uranium-nitrate mixture of
Kolossow ns a fixative, and safranin as a dye. As a preservative           I
have used thymol water, and have obtained excellent results with
material which has remained in it for as long a period as three years.
Sections may be cut by hand or with the freezing microtome.
   The fixing and staining reagents must be introduced and employed
in different ways, the exact manner of procedure depending upon
the character and age of the particular tissue under observation.
This can be best illustrated by means of definite examples, and since
the whole method is somewhat complicated, it will be expedient to
consider under separate heads (1) the killing and fixing, with which
is also associated the swelling, and (2) the staining.
   In material such as that of young endosperms (e.g., the endosperm
of Tamus communis), no swelling is required, and the tissue, cut
into small pieces, may be both killed and fixed at one and the same
time by Kolossow's reagent, and then preserved in thymol water for
future nse. Where only slight swelling is necessary, treatment with
water may precede that of Kolossow's reagent. In certain classes of
tissue, where the walls are swollen with comparative ease, such as

       tcith special Reference to the Mode   of Connexion of Cells.    103
 that  of the ordinary vegetative tissue of Phaseolus vulgaris, Tamus
 communis, Nerium oleander, Salisburia adiantifolia, &c, small pieces
are killed and swollen in an aqueous solution of picric acid, and then
5xed in the Kolossow's reagent and preserved            in thymol water.
Finally, where the tissues are more resistant, as, for instance, in
Rj.'linia pseudacacia, Prunus laurocerasus, or Aucuba japonica, treat
ment with picric acid may be followed by more severe swelling by
means of solutions of zinc chloride or sulphuric acid, to be succeeded
as before     by fixing, hardening, and preserving.    The blackening of
the cell contents caused by osmie acid may be removed by bleaching.
   From such preserved material sections may be cut when required.
   The process of staining is no less complicated than that of killing
and fixing, and is best considered under two heads, viz. : — (1) The
methods applicable to certain endosperms and tissues of similar
character. (2) The methods applicable to the majority of tissues.
   In certain special eases it is possible to stain the threads directly
either with safranin alone or by introducing safranin by means of a
somewhat intricate substitution method such as that which I used
with excellent results in the case of the endosperm of Tamus com-
mun/*, where the sequence of staining was Hofmann's blue (or
soluble water blue), methylene blue, safranin, and in which more
over the Hofmann's blue was dissolved            in dilute picric acid or
-rani am nitrate, and the methylene blue in dilute salt solutioa.
Unce stained with safranin, all sorts of modifications are possible.
Thus, the safranin may be succeeded by gentian violet or by eosin, and
*ith gentian violet Gram's method is applicable and most advan
tageous.      As safranin forms a precipitate with chromic acid, sections
stained with safranin may be treated with this reagent, and then
with silver nitrate, thus effecting a silver staining of the threads.
Silver nitrate itself also forms a precipitate with safranin.       In a.,
cases the Btaining is practically limited to the threads.
    When the above methods of direct selective staining are applie I
to ordinary tissue they are found to fail, for it usually happens that
the whole of the wall becomes deeply stained, so that the threads
are no longer visible.     I was for some time completely baffled by this
circumstance, but I ultimately adopted the well-known method of
 staining and washing out, using for the purpose orange G or acid
 fachfeiu.   With ordinary tissue the staining appears to be more easily
 accomplished than with the thick mucilaginous walls of endosperm
 cells, and the method may be somewhat more syncopated.          Excellent
 results may be obtained by staining at once with safranin and wash
 ing oat with orange G.        This may be followed by staining with
  gentian violet, succeeded by treatment with acid fuchsin, or the
  sequence of staining may be safranin, gentian violet, acid fuchsin.
  Substitutions in which safranin, gentian violet, and eosin are included

 104       Mr: W. Gardiner.         The Histology       of the Cell Wall,
give good results.        The method of staining indirectly by washing
out may also be applied to endosperm tissues generally.                The staim d
sections are best examined either in water or in very dilute glyce
 rine.    I have as yet given little attention to the question of making-
 permanent preparations, although I have initiated certain experi
 ments which may possibly lead to a satisfactory result.
    It is probable that the method in its present form will not he found
 to be available     for the study of adult lignified or suberised cells,
though up to the present I have made no observations upon such
tissues.     The investigation of young tissue will, however, doubtless
give good results, and will establish that in them, also, the general
structure prevails. 1 am strongly convinced that the above method,
or similar methods, based upon "non-alcoholic" treatment, will be
found to be peculiarly suitable for the investigation of the tissues of
plants, and will in the future lead to observations of interest and
importance.
    A  summary of results may now follow.
    As my new method owes its origin to a study of the cells                      of
endosperm I propose to deal with that tissue first.
    The    present investigation entirely confirms and extends the
results   I obtained in 1883.* At that time, however, many important
problems still awaited swlution. In the first place, what was believed
to be the typical and universal structure could only be demonstrated
with particularly favourable material and in a limited number of
plants.     Further, even in ripe seeds, where treatment with iodine
proved that connecting threads were present, special difficulties were
experienced when attempts were made to stain them with aniline
dyes. Lastly, for young seeds the methods were quite unsuitable.
With the present methods we are in a position to investigate the
structure of endosperms generally, and to follow their development
even from the earliest stages.           The more refined method also gives
more sure and satisfactory results.
    It is possible to make certain general statements concerning the
connecting threads of endosperm cells. In the first place, the his
tological structure of endosperm establishes a point of great im
portance which is only emphasised by the study of tissues generally,
viz., that in pitted cells the pit-closing membrane is invariably
traversed by threads.        For descriptive purposes these may be called
" pit-threads."       Threads     may also be present which traverse the
general wall, and these may, similarly, be called
                                                             " wall-threads." In
the somewhat exceptional cases of unpitted cells the thread system
is necessarily composed of " wall-threads
                                                      "
                                                         only.     In many pitted
cells both " pit-threads
                             " and " wall-threads " arc
                                                               present ; but in the
majority of      cells   the  threads     appear    to be limited to the pits,

 though    it is not improbable that even in such cases other threads
 traversing    the general wall will be found to occar.
    Where both " pit-threads " and " wall-threads " coexist in one and
 tie same cell, the former are stouter and more readily stainable than
the latter.     In pitted cells the pit-threads are necessarily in groups,
and it is a point of some interest that the wall-threads also are
tisoallj- in groups — as though a pit were present.      This is especially
striking in such cases as the unpitted cells of Tamus communis
(fig. I) and Eordeum tulgare.         In Tumus communis, while the side
walls exhibit the usual arrangement of isolated groups of threads,
the end walls are traversed bj a single large group, as in sieve-tubes.

of some     interest.   The cells are pitted and each pit has its group of
 "pit-threads."       In any given group the threads are arranged in
 bandies, recalling the similar arrangement        of achromatin fibres,
 which Strasburger and others have found to accompany nuclear
 divisions in this plant.      The mode of development of the threads

106      Mr. W. Gardiner.         The Histology     of  the  Cell Wall,
and the     phenomena which accompany germination were investi
gated in the endosperm of Tamus communis only. The threads are
found to be present at a very early stage, and can be detected even in
the very youngest and thinnest walls. They are at first uniformly
distributed over the cell membrane.         In the case of the side walls, as
surface growth proceeds, small groups of threads become separated
from one another by intervening areas of clear membrane, while in
the en l walls, where the extension of surface is less, this segregation
into groups does not take place. In the early stages the growth in
thickness of the wall is not uniform, and pits are formed on the side
walls at those points where thread groups occur; but they have only
•a transient existence,    and ultimately disappear.            It is, however,
interesting    to note  that  the  vegetative    tissue   of  Tamus    communis
consists for the most part of pitted cells.
   In germination the ferment, in the first instance,             appears to be
conducted     into the wall by means of certain            of the threads, but
when     once an entrance       is effected the corrosive action rapidly
spreads quite independently of the threads, becoming the more
potent as it reaches the neighbourhood            of mucilaginous and less
resistent middle lamella. In a given wall the penetration commences
simultaneously at several centres, and at each centre the affected areas
assume the general form of small cones with their apices directed
towards the cell lumen (fig. 3). Moreover, since the action of the
                                     Fie. 3.
 ferment    soon extends from cell to cell in two adjoining cell?, where
 the common wall is affected on both sides, each side having its cone,
 the base of one cone appears opposed to that of the other.              At this
 stage, by appropriate staining, the threads may still be seen shining
 through the disorganised mucilage of the affected areas. As the
 ferment action proceeds the boundaries of the several areas con
 tinually extend and at length unite when the whole of the wall is
 involved.      The disorganisation of the wall is accompanied by
 marked    stratification.   The sphere of influence of the ferment action

       vith special Reference to   the Mode   of  Connexion of Cells.    107
is  curiously limited and hardly extends beyond the immediate neigh
bourhood     of the absorbent foot of the young embryo. The mode of
disappearance of the wall by the coarse corrosive action of the
ferment, and the manner of its proceeding with so little relation to
the threads, seems to indicate      that the structnre of endosperm cells
baa more     relation to the conduction of impulses and of food supply
than to the needs of germination.
    Satisfactory as are the results derived from the study of endo
sperm cells, the real success was achieved when tho method was so
modified that it could be applied with certainty and success to the
investigation of ordinary tissue, and to specialised forms of it, such
as pulvini and tendrils.
    The unsatisfactory      character of the somewhat meagre results
hitherto obtainable have not, I think, succeeded in generally estab
lishing a conviction that the structures postulated have necessarily
»n actual    existence.    Botanists have, on the contrary, been inclined
to look askance at results       depending upon such statements as "a
stained area
                 "    "
                   or a doubtful striation," and there lurked in the
Bunds of many, the suspicion that the histology of endosperms was
possibly exceptional, and peculiar to that tissue.
    1'or the fnture such doubts need no longer be entertained, since
it is now easy to demonstrate           that tho structure exhibited by
endosperm tissue is in all respects entirely typical of plant tissue
generally.
    In these days of active investigation, it is not often given to   one to
be   the medium for the criticism of his own research.          This good
fortune, however, now falls to ine, and I hasten to say that in the
lijjht of the present investigation it is quite clear that apart from
endosperms, and with such exceptions as Aucuba japonica, my earlier
work on the continuity of the protoplasm, in pulvini and other
tissues,   does not afford absolute proof that a communication between
ceils   actually occurs, but for the most part only brings forward
 strong evidence that such connection is exceedingly probable.            At
 this juncture, also,    I  note, with satisfaction, that the results then
 obtained were able to save me from the error of a belief in the
 existence    of a system of open pits which have since then been
 repeatedly figured and described, and against which I have persist
 ently spoken.
     As  I have already remarked, my new method makes it possible to
 establish with certainty that the structure of all kinds of plant
  tissue is precisely similar to that of endosperms, and that exactly
  the same modifications are exhibited.         In pitted cells every pit-
  closing-membrane is traversed by its group of threads, and in un-
  pitted cells similar groups also occur. In square-ended tubular cells,
  suuh as those of ttie leaf stalk of Lilivm martayon (fig. 4), the

numerous     small isolated gronps of wall-threads are present on the
side walls, and a large group occupies each end wall. In certain cells
both "pit-threads" and "wall-threads" may simultaneously be
present.    The method gives equally good resnlts with thin or thick-
walled tissue, and in the case of the thinnest walls an " en face "
view can be obtained where a sectional view fails. The threads vary
in size. They are, for instance, exceedingly thick in Viscum album,
where they are seen with the greatest ease ; they are well developed
in Phaseolus multiflorus and Lilium martagon, and they are fine and
delicate in Aucuba japonica (fig. 5).      The connecting threads may be

observed equally in the epidermis and cortex, and in all the living
cells of the tissues of the central cylinder. In a section of any given
tissue, it can be readily seen that all the cells are placed in commu
nication with one another.       One is tempted to expatiate upon the
wonderful beauty of the appearance presented by the walls slndded
with their pits, each pit with its closing membrane traversed by the
thread complex after the manner of sieve-tubes.             It is indeed a
sight  which  cannot  fail to convey  a lasting impression of wonder and
surprise.
   The pit-threads of such pulvini as were examined presented no
striking difference, either in appearance or distribution, to the
 similar structures in ordinary tissue, and the same appears to be
true of the sieves of tendrils. The important point, however, is this,

       aith special Reference      to the  Mode of Connexion of Cells.     109
tint in   all these tissues the threads perforating the pit-closing mem
brane   can be   readily seen, and even counted.
   A point of interest was observed in the epidermal cells of Tamus
¦¦¦mmnnisand Lilium martagon (fig. 6), viz., that the external or free
walls   are penetrated    by   a system of threads    which radiate from the
eell lumen and     extend to the cuticle, so       that the lattsr is the only
^.ractnre    intercalated between the protoplasm and the environment.
The   important bearings of this observation are obvious.

    Although the research is still in its preliminary stages, since      my
attention    has been   chiefly directed to the elaboration of the new
method, yet the results already obtained are sufficiently numerous
and suggestive to enable one to make certain remarks and general
statements.
    It is impossible to resist the conclusion that the connecting
threids consist either wholly or partly of protoplasm, and this view-
is largely confirmed by the staining reactions.        It is, however, not
improbable      that the protoplasurc filament may be surrounded by a
mucilaginous sheath. Osmic acid induces no blackening as it does
in the threads of many sieve-tubes, and I am inclined to believe that
in ordinary tissue the threads consist for the most part of ectoplasm,
and are to be regarded in fact as extensions of it.
    The threads appear to be present ab initio. This fact, coupled
 with the surface-growth of the cell wall, furnishes a sufficient expla
nation of the "barrel figures" so generally assumed by the various
thread groups.        The resemblance to the similar figures which
accompany nuclear division is therefore superficial.         Nevertheless it
seems     certain that the threads do, as a matter of fact, arise from
 that part of the cytoplasm which at the period of formation of the
 ceil plate forms the fibres of the so-called " nuclear spindle," and
 that these fibres become, so to speak, partially imprisoned in the
 young wall.
    My results appear to indicate that in a given cell the whole
 system of connecting threads arise at this early stage, and that no
 subsequent development occurs.          This statement will, however,
 require    careful  confirmation,  and    has certain bearings on such
 interesting questions as the theory of grafts and " sliding growth."
    In dead cells, such as those of ripe endosperm, the threads appear
 to degenerate into mucilage, and this is possibly also the case in adult
 lignitied and other cells.
     In the particular tissues which I have investigated, the threads
 can be shown to be present in all cells which still retain their cellu
 lose character,     and although I have not actually succeeded iu

      witJi special Reference to the Mode     of Connexion of Cells.       Ill
 observing them       in adult lignified and suberised tissue, it seems
certain   that they will be found there also. There can be little doubt
that   they   occur universally     in the cells of all the tissues of all
plants.
    From   this arises the fundamental conception that the plant body
most    be regarded as a connected whole, and that the cell walls
occupy only a subservient position.         Thus our views as to the ulti
mate histology of tissue must be considerably modified.           A new vista
ilso opens to cytological research in the direction of the accurate
determination of the distribution and orientation of the threads in the
various tissues, which can hardly fail to lead to important results.
    Should the structnre presented by the external walls of the epi
dermal   cells of Tamus communis and Lilium mariar/on lie found to be
of general     occurrence, we shall be prepared for most interesting
results when the examination         is extended to secreting gland cells :
to such non-cellular     organisms as certain alg» and fungi, and to such
unicellular bodies as spores and pollen grains.
    Two important functions are, doubtless, performed by the con
necting threads, viz., the conduction of impulses and the conduc
tion of food.        As to the first, there can be no question ; and
w to the second, one cannot but reflect that it mnst be of the
ersatest advantage to the plant to be able to transmit from cell to
cell as occasion requires, and in a definite and determinate        direction,
highly organised food supplies and even protoplasm itself.            It is, of
worse, possible that in the threads themselves a definite division of
labour may occur as regards the transmission of food and the con
duction of stimuli.
    The consequences which arise from our more perfect knowledge of
plant histology are obvious and far reaching.
    In the first place we learn that the structure exhibited by sieve-
tabes, which in the past was regarded as peculiar,               is shown to
 be typical    of cells generally, with this slight difference, however,
 that in sieve-tubes a secondary enlargement        of the pores appears to
 occur.    All the cells of a tissue must be regarded as being connected
 together by delicate groups of protoplasmic threads, which traverse
 either the general wall or the pit-closing membrane, just as the
                                               " sieve
 sieve-tube threads traverse the so-called              plate," a fact which
 »t length    enables   us  to do  tardy justice  to  the dominant position
 occupied by the protoplasm oE the plant body, and to understand
 how the deep-seated cells of a tissue can telegraph           their needs to

stitute a factor, which cannot fail to have an important bearing
in all general questions, such as the growth of the cell wall, the
conduction of food, the ascent of water, the process of fertilisation,
the penetration of fungi into their host, the process of secretion, and
the transmission of the impulses which determine growth and move
ment of plant organs.
   Concerning certain of these problems, I should like to make a few
concluding remarks.
   As to the passage of water from the root hair to the vessel, the
presence of connecting threads in the cells of root tissue makes it
possible to imagine that the ordinary laws of osmosis may be pro
foundly modified, and that the filaments which establish protoplasmic
continuity may conduct stimuli, leading, for instance, to a difference
in reaction of the proximal and distal halves of any given cell.
 Similarly, it is conceivable that a definite polarity is established,
which helps to determine the direction of the flow. As to the larger
 question of rapid water movement, although this is neither the time
nor the place to enter into theory, yet I cannot refrain from remark
ing that it is not impossible that the threads, doubtless present in
large quantities in dead vessels, may, if they suffer mucilaginous
change, have some bearing on the question, e.g., by assisting to
 sustain the water at any given level or attracting water in the imme
diate environment.        In any case, I am strongly of opinion that the
 part played by mucilage and the force of hydration have not as yet
received sufficient attention.
   As to movements generally, I am still unable to accept PfefFer's
view of the subsidiary part played by the protoplasm in connexion
 with turgidity,* and I am still of opinion that the ectoplasm is the
 master factor which determines the condition of the cell. The present
research demonstrates among other things that there are fixed points
in the ectoplasm, and this may have some bearing on the possibility
of establishing the periodic or sudden contractions and dilatations
 which I believe are associated with turgescence, and of which such a
phenomenon as the effusion of water from the cells of a stimulated
Mimosa pulvinus is but an abnormal instance.

ing at the subject for more than a year, it was discovered that the
discrepancy arose from a trace of water obstinately held by the
hjdrogen—an impurity which behaved as                      I  explain farther on in
tie case of air and water vapour."
     When occupied in 1888 with the density of hydrogen,                     I  thought
 tiat viscosity might serve as a useful test of purity, and I set np an
 apparatus somewhat on the lines of Sir W. Crookes.                   A light mirror,
 Warn, in diameter, was hung by a fine fibre
                                                               (of  quartz   I believe)
 ibout 60 cm. long.             A small attached magnet gave the means of
 starting the vibrations whose subsidence was to be observed.                         The
 ^jcosity      chamber      was   of glass, and   carried  tubes   sealed  to   it  above
 ind below.          The window, through which the light passed to and fro,
 *ss of thick plate glass cemented to a ground face.                    This arrange
 ment has great optical advantages, and though unsuitable                   for experi
 ments involving high exhaustions, appeared to be satisfactory for the
 purpose in hand, viz., the comparison of various samples of hydrogen
 k atmospheric pressure.              The Toppler pump, as well as the gas
 venerating apparatus and purifying tubes, were connected by seal-
 ing.     But      I   was not able to establish any sensible differences
 ;s<>ng    the    various     samples of hydrogen experimented upon at that
 tine.
     In view      of the importance of the question, I have lately resumed
 tbese experiments.             If hydrogen, carefully prepared and desiccated
 :a the ordinary way, is liable to possess             a viscosity of 10 per cent, in
 excess,    a   similar    uncertainty   in  less  degree may affect the density.
 1 must confess that I was sceptical              as to the large effect attributed
 to water vapour in gas which had passed over phosphoric anhydride,
  Sir W. Crookes himself described an experiment (p. 428) Irom which
  it appeared that a residue of water vapour in his apparatus                  indicated
  the viscosity due to hydrogen, and, without deciding between                      them,
  be offered two alternative explanations.             Either the viscosity of water
   vapour    is really    the  same  as that  of  hydrogen,    or under the action of
   the falling mercury in the Sprengel pump decomposition occurred with
   absorption of oxygen, so that the residual gas was actually hydro
   gen.    It does not appear that the latter explanation can be accepted,
   at any rate as regards the earlier stages of the exhaustion,                    when a
    rapid current of aqueous vapour must set in the direction of the
    pump; but if we adopt the former, how comes it that small traces of
    water vapour have so much effect upon the viscosity of hydrogen ?

114                            Lord Rayleigh.
   It is a fact, as was found many years ago by Kundt and Warbnrp*
(and as I have confirmed), that the viscosity of aqueous vapour is
but little greater than that of hydrogen.              The numbers (relativel y
to air) given by them are 0 5256 and 0-488. It is difficult to believe
that small traces of a foreign gas having a 6 per cent, greater
viscosity could produce an effect reaching to 10 per cent.
   In the recent experiments the hydrogen was prepared from
amalgamated zinc and sulphuric acid in a closed generator con
stituting in fact a Smee cell, and it could bo liberated at any
desired rate by closing the circuit externally through a wire resist
ance.     The generating vessel was so arranged as to admit of
exhaustion, and the materials did not need to be removed during
the whole course of the experiments.                The gas entered the vis
cosity chamber from below, and could be made to pass out above
through the upper tube (which served also to contain the fibre) into
the pump head of the Toppler.                By suitable taps the viscosity
 chamber     could  be isolated,    when      observations      were to be com
 menced.
    The   vibrations were started by a kind of galvanometer coil in
 connection (through a key) with a LecJanche cell.                  As a sample
 set of observations      the following relating to hydrogen at atmo

giTes the     actual arcs of vibration, the fourth their (common) loga
rithms, and the fifth the differences of these, which should be con-
stint.     The mean logarithmic decrement can be obtained from the
first and last arcs only, but the intermediate                  values are useful
ss a check.          The time of (complete) vibration was determined
occasionally.        It -was constant, whether hjdrogen or air occupied
the    chamber,     at 26*2 seconds.
    The    observations      extended themselves       over two months,       and    it
would be       tedious     to give the results in any detail.            One of the
points to     which     I   attached importance was a comparison between
hydrogen       as it issued from the generator without any desiccation
whatever       and hydrogen carefully dried by passage through a long
tube     packed      with phosphoric anhydride. The difference proved
itself to be comparatively trifling.           For the wet hydrogen there were
obtained on May 10, 11, such log. decs, as 0-0594, 0 0590, 0-0591, or
sa a     mean     0'0592.     The dried hydrogen, on the other hand, gave
M588, 0-0586, 0058-1,            00590 on various repetitions with renewed
supplies     of gas, or as a mean 0'0587, about 1 per cent, smaller than
for the wet hydrogen.              It appeared that the dry hydrogen might
 stand for several       days   in  the viscosity chamber without alteration of
 logarithmic decrement.            It should be mentioned that the apparatus
 wss set up underground, and that the changes of temperature were
 usually small enough to be disregarded.
    In the next experiments             the phosphoric tube was replaced by
others     containing sulphur (with the view of removing mercury
 rapour) and solid soda.            Numbers were obtained on different days
 such as 0-0591, 0-0586, 0'0588, 0-0587, mean 0-0588, showing that
 the desiccation by soda was practically as efficient as that by phos
 phoric    anhydride.
    At this stage          the   apparatus was rearranged.           As shown by
 observations upon air (at 10 cm. residual pressure), the logarithmic
 decrements        were increased, probably owing to a slight displacement
 rf the   mirror relatively to the containing walls of the chamber.                The
 sulphur     and   soda   tubes   were   retained, but  with  the  addition    of  one
 of hard glass containing turnings of magnesium.                   Before the mag
 nesium was heated the mean number for hydrogen (always at atmo
 spheric pressure) was 0'0600.               The heating of the magnesium to
 redness, which it was supposed might remove residual water, had the
 effect of increasing         the viscosity of the gas, especially at first.*
  After a few operations the logarithmic decrement from gas which
  tad passed over the hot magnesium seemed to settle itself at 0-0606.
  When the magnesium was allowed to remain cold, fresh fillings gave
  again 0-0602,       0-0601, 0-0598, mean 0 0600.           Dried air at 10 cm.

mean 0 01120.
   In the next       experiments  a phosphoric    tube was added     about
60 cm. long and closely packed with fresh material.           The viscosity
appeared to be slightly increased, but hardly more than wonld be
accounted for by an accidental rise of temperature.             The mean
uncorrected number may be taken as 0-0603.
   The evidence from these experiments tends to Hhow that residual
moistnre     is without appreciable influence upon the viscosity of
hydrogen ; so much so that, were there no other evidence, this con
clusion would appear to me to be sufficiently established.      It remains
barely possible that the best desiccation to which     I  could attain was
still inadequate, and that absolutely dry hydrogen would exhibit a
less viscosity.     It must be admitted that an apparatus containing
cemented      joints and greased stop-cocks is in some respects at a
disadvantage.        Moreover, it should be noticed that the ratio
0'0600 : 0'1120, viz. 0'536, for the viscosities of hydrogen and air is
decidedly higher than that (0-500) deduced by Sir G. Stokes from
Crookes's observations.        According to the theory of the former, a
fair comparison may be made by taking, as above, the logarithmic
decrements for hydrogen at atmospheric pressure, and for air at a
pressure of 10 cm. of mercury.        I may mention that moderate rare
factions, down say to a residual pressure of 5 cm., had no influence
on the logarithmic decrement observed with hydrogen.
   I am not able to explain the discrepancy in the ratios thus
exhibited.      A viscous quality in the suspension, leading to a sub
sidence of vibrations independent of the gaseous atmosphere, would
tend to diminish the apparent differences between various kinds of
gas, but   I  can hardly regard this cause as operative in my experi
ments.      For actual comparisons      of widely differing viscosities I
should prefer an apparatus designed on Maxwell's principle, in
which the gas subjected to shearing should form a comparatively
thin layer bounded on one side by a moving plane and on the other
by a fixed plane.

       Montreal. Received August 12, 1897.
                      §   1. Objects of the Investigation.
    The  primary object of the present series of experiments was that
of  equipping the McDonald Physics Building of McGill University
 with a reliable and accurate set of standard cells, and not that of
forming the subject of a communication to any scientific paper.            In
the coarse of the work, however, several points have come under our
aotice, which we venture to think may be of interest to others
engaged    in any investigation requiring the employment or construc
 tion of such standards.
    Among other points, we have devoted special attention to the
 accurate    determination     of the temperature-coefficients    of various
 forms  of Clark cell   ;  to the construction of cells free from " diffu
 sion-lag
           " consequent upon change of temperature; and to the inves
 tigation of the limits of accuracy attainable with Clark cells under
 both constant and varying temperature conditions.
    We   have succeeded in making         a very simple modification in the
 Board    of Trade form of Clark        cell, which makes it equal to any
 '.tier form in respect of freedom from diffusion-lag ; and we have
 made    several forms of cell hermetically sealed with glass and
 platinum, which we hope will stand the test of time better than
 those  sealed with wax and marine glue.
    We have also made a special investigation of the effect of changes
 of strength of the solution of zinc sulphate on the E.M.F., involving
 determinations of the solubility of zinc sulphate and of the density
 of the solntions, which appear to lead to very simple formula? of
 some theoretical interest.
                            § 2. Preliminary    Work.
     At the outset of our work, we were extremely fortunate in finding
  the  laboratory already equipped by the liberality of Mr. W. C.
  McDonald, the donor of the Physics Building, with a very fine and
  complete set of resistance standards and electrical measuring in
  struments, collected by Professor John Cox, under whose supervision
  the laboratory was planned and erected.           There were in the collec
  tion several portable Clark cells by Muirhead, and a set of Carhart
   «!Ls by Queen and Co. were shortly added.
                                                                  K 2

118          Prof. H. L. Callendar and Mr. H. T. Barnes.
   Soveral   comparisons of these portable cells were made early in
1894 at different dates and tinder ordinary laboratory conditions.
The results, when corrected for temperature by means of the enclosed
thermometers, showed irregular differences,          often amounting to
nearly 3 millivolts.      Of a pair of cells enclosed in one brass case
together with a thermometer, one wonld be sometimes higher and
sometimes     lower than the other, although the utmost care was
observed    in using them, and they were both necessarily always
under closely similar conditions as regards change of temperature.
   The set of Carhart cells were much better in this respect. They
rarely showed irregular differences of more than half a millivolt;
but one of the cells, owing to defective sealing, was generally some
2 millivolts lower than the others, and has since that time fallen
still further. It appeared probable at first that these discrepancies
were partly due to inequalities of temperature between the cells and
their attached thermometers, and, if so, that they wonld be insepar
able from portable cells of such a form under these conditions.
About the same time, a number of Clark cells were set up by
Professor Callendar and some of the advanced students and demon
strators, in accordance with the form described in the Board of
Trade Memorandum, as figured in Glazebrook and Shaw's ' Practical
Physics,' p. 576. Every detail of manipulation and construction was
carefully followed, except that the cells were set up in test-tubes
6 inches long, to permit of their being more deeply immersed in
water, and that the glass tubes containing the electrodes were pro
vided with mercury cups at the top to facilitate the making and
changing of connections.        The cells were kept immersed in water in
large glass bottles provided with a stirrer and thermometer.
   The cells set up in this way, although made by different students
with different solutions at different dates, were found to agree more
closely among themselves than the portable forms, owing probably to
 the more constant and certain conditions           to which they were-
 exposed.     They still,  however, exhibited  irregular differences, even
 when exposed to precisely similar variations of temperature, and it
 was felt that they could not be used with confidence for any work in
 which an accuracy of one part in 10,000 was desired.
    Some determinations were also made of the temperature coefficients
 of these cells when exposed to a variation of temperature at the rate
 of about 10° in two hours.      The results were very fairly consistent
 for each cell, but gave very different values for the mean coefficient
 between 10° and 20° C.       The lowest value obtained was 0 00045, the
 highest 0-00069.      The value commonly given for these cells is
 0 00078. They were all saturated cells containing an abundance of
 crystals, which remained visible on the top of the paste and through
 out the mass at the highest temperatnre.

    In examining the results it was noticed that the value of the co
efficient did not depend on the quantity of crystals in the cell, hut
cn the distance of the end of the zinc rod from the crystals.            The
difference of the results was, therefore, evidently due to slowness of
diffusion of the state of saturation through the body of the solution.
    So long; ago as 1886 a set of five cells was set up by one of the
present writers at the Cavendish         Laboratory, Cambridge, with zinc
rods of different lengths, with the object of testing the effect of
diffusion on the temperature-coefficient.       These five cells were of the
original Rayleigh pattern, with platinum wires sealed through the
bottom.     They could not be immersed in a water-bath, and were
found to "be of a somewhat unsuitable form for the experiment,
which was then discontinued for more important work.              Some more
recent tests of this set of cells will be found in the paper on the
Clark cell, by Glazebrook and Skinner.*            The cells are numbered,
6, 7, 8, 9, and    10 in the paper, and are among the oldest in the
possession of the Cavendish Laboratory. It will be seen from the
tests that     they exhibit small discrepancies such as might very
probably arise from differences in the time required for diffusion in
the different cells.     From a study of the above-mentioned paper, it
appears likely, in our opinion, that the differences observed in the
case of the other cells of the same type may have been affected by a
omilar cause.
    It wonld appear, in fact, inevitable that cells of the simple Board
<sf   Trade pattern should exhibit some effects of diffusion-lag,
especially if subjected to considerable or rapid changes of tempera-
 tare.    This form of cell, however, is so convenient to use, and so
easy to make, that it seemed to us desirable to make a more careful
examination of the case, with the object,          possible, of constructing
                                                            if
cells of this   form  with a definite   temperature-coefficient  and a negli
 gible diffusion-lag.
     In October, 1894, the class was joined by Mr. H. T. Barnes, who,
 as assistant to Dr. Harrington, Professor of Chemistry, had obtained
 considerable experience in chemical manipulation. From this date
 onwards the work of making and testing various forms of Clark
 cell has been performed almost entirely by Mr. Barnes,              but the
 observations    and  calculations    throughout   have    been checked  and
  verified by Professor Callendar, who has devoted special attention to
  the thermometry.
                           §    3.   Constant-temperature Baths.
      The first step   in the investigation consisted in making   pair of         a
 suitable   water-baths, controlled by delicate thermostats, which could
                       *   «

be set in such a manner as to keep the temperature steady for any
desired length of time at any point between 5° and 30° C.
   The method of regulation adopted for these baths was similar to
that described by Griffiths,* but much less elaborate.                The baths
were made of copper, and were encased in felt and wood.                    They
were heated by a stream of tap-water passing through a copper tube
over a regulated gas flame. The regulators were made to cut off the
gas so sharply that a difference of temperature of one-tenth of a
degree sufficed to chango tho gas supply from full flame to no flame.
With these very sensitive regulators, some trouble was experienced
at first, partly owing to the excessive variations of the Montreal gas
pressure, and partly owing to the sudden changes of the climate.
In the end, however, these difficulties were so successfully overcome
that, on the longest continuous run, extending over nearly a fort
night, the temperature of the bath did not vary by so much as
0"02° C. throughout tho whole period.
   The temperature of the tap-water averaged about 8° C. in mid
winter, and seldom rose above 13° C. in summer.                   This generally-
sufficed to keep the baths steadily at 15° C.        even  if the temperature of
the room was as high as 25° C. In order              to obtain steady tempera
tures at points below 15° C, the stream of           tap-water was led through
a copper spiral immersed in melting snow             or ice before passing over
the gas flame. In this manner           the baths conld be set to regulate
steadily at temperatures as low as 5° C.
   The two baths were generally set to regulate at different tempera
tures, so that by transferring a cell from one bath to the other the
effect of a sudden and definite change of temperature could be ob
served.     The time required by cells of different forms to reach their
steady    final values could thus be determined,              and the effects of
diffusion-lag could be readily distinguished from the immediate
change of E.M.F. consequent upon a change of temperature.
                          § 4.  Electrical Apparatus.
   By the use of these accurately regulated water-baths, the tempera
ture of the cells became so much a matter of certainty that we
found it desirable to make the comparisons to the hundredth of a
millivolt, corresponding to the hundredth of a degree Centigrade of
temperature.      From the results of our experiments, we have reason
to conclude that the Clark cell, under suitable conditions, permits
the attainment of this order of accuracy, and is far superior to the
silver voltameter for accurate determinations.
   The comparisons of the cells were made by the nsnal Poggendorff
method, with a 6000-ohm galvanometer.                  The potentiometer used
                   * '

       Electromotive Force  of different Forms of the Clark Cell.    121
for the earlier   comparisons was a long wire, having a resistance of
6«5 ohms, wound     on a cylinder in one hundred turns. Each turn
was divided into one hundred parts, and readings were taken to one
tenth of a division. Each division corresponded approximately to one
five-thousandth part of a volt, a storage-cell being used to supply
the steady current through the wire.       This potentiometer had been
accurately calibrated throughout its length at. two different dates.
The results agreed so closely that it could be used with confidence
for measuring relatively large differences of potential with an
accuracy of at least one-half division of the wire, equivalent to
0-0001 of a volt.     The errors of the uncorrected wire amounted to
over ten divisions in many places.
    For the later experiments a simpler, and in many respects more
convenient, form of potentiometer was used. Two resistance boxes,
containing resistances adjustable up to 2000 ohms each, were con
nected by a platinum-silver bridge-wire having a resistance of
18 ohms.      The wire was 2 metres long, in four lengths of 50 cm.
each, with a millimetre scale, and was adjusted to read direct in
 volts, at the rate of 1 mm. to one-hundredth of a millivolt, in the
following manner :— A resistance of 18/20 X 1420 ohms was taken
out of the first box, and the resistance in the second box was
adjusted to make the standard cell at 15° C. read near the point
 140 cm. of the wire, i.e., 14 millivolts      above 1*420 volts.    The
bridge-wire could thus be used directly for measuring small diffe
rences of E.M.F. not exceeding 20 millivolts, with an accuracy of at
least one part in a thousand on a difference of this order.       Larger
differences could be readily dealt with by transferring resistance
from one box to the other in such a way as to keep the sum con
 stant, each ohm transferred being reckoned at 20/18 of a millivolt.
 It will be understood that the resistance of the bridge-wire was
 carefully measured in terms of the boxes, that their temperature-
 coefficients were very nearly the same, and that the wire was tested
 for uniformity, to insure the above order of accuracy in the deter
 mination of differences of E.M.F. of this magnitude.
                             § 5. Thermometry.
     In working to the hundredth of a millivolt, it was necessary to
  icnow the temperature of the haths to the hundredth of a degree C.
  Two thermometers were generally used, one in each water-bath.
  They were both carefully compared with a platinum thermometer,
  and their indications were in all cases reduced to the absolute scale.
     One of the thermometers was by Geissler, divided to tenths of a
   degree.   This thermometer had evidently been graduated to read
   temperature on the absolute scale direct. Its errors, after correcting

122          Prof. H. L. Callendar and Mr. II. T. Barnes.
for rise of zero, were found to         be very small and irregular, seldom
exceeding 0-01° C.
   The second thermometer         was by Hicks, divided to twentieths of a
degree. Its corrections were found to be very nearly the same as
those of the Kew mercurial standard.
   Over the range 0° to 30° C. the changes of zero of these thermo
meters would never exceed 0 01° C, and were, therefore, disregarded.
The correction for the length of stem exposed, never exceeding two
or three hundredths of a degree, could be applied with sufficient
accuracy when required.
   The comparisons were made with a platinum thermometer con
structed of special wire, which has been repeatedly tested by Pro
fessor Callendar, and also by Mr. Griffiths, and by Messrs. Heycock
and Neville. The wire is the same as that used in the thermometers
made for the Kew Observatory, and its " delta-coefficient " has been
taken as 1'50.
   The resistance box used was of special design, reading to O'OOOl0 C.
It was exhibited by Professor Callendar at the May Conversazione
of the Royal Society in 1893.           The box used at Kew for platinum
thermometry has recently been constructed on the same model, and
has been described in ' Nature,' November 14, 1895.                The Kew box
differs chiefly in the use of plugs for mercury contacts, and in the
absence of the temperature compensating coils.
                 § 6. Comparisons of Board of Trade Cells.
    With this  apparatus many more accurate and careful comparisons
of Board of    Trade cells were made. Several new cells, prepared by
 H. T. B. and   by other students, were compared with those a year old.
 The newer     cells were generally found to have a slightly higher
 E.M.F.   than the old, and in general differences of the same order as
 before were observed, if the cells were subjected to different treat
 ment.    It was noticeable, however, that B.O.T. cells, prepared abont
 the same time in a similar manner, if kept exposed to similar stable
 conditions, would generally attain the same E.M.F., within one or
 two tenths of a millivolt, after a day or so in the constant tempera
 ture bath at 15° C.     The importance of keeping cells of this type at a
 constant temperature has been shown by Griffiths,* who has obtained
 very consistent results with B.O.T. cells treated in this manner.
    Kahle, on the other hand,f finds differences, amounting to 4 or
 5 millivolts in some cases, between the nine B.O.T. cells which he
 tested under constant and similar temperature conditions. Such differ
 ences are quite beyond the range of our experience, and we do not

think     that they fairly represent the performance           of B.O.T. cells
aider the conditions that he describes.
                 § 7. Temperature Coefficients   of B.O.T. Cells.
   Fresh    determinations    of the temperature      coefficients  of the old
cells,  in addition to those of the new cells, were made nnder different
conditions     and with greater accuracy by means of the constant
temperature baths.
   For four of the cells in which the end of the zinc rod was at a
snail distance from the crystals, the mean coefficients obtained on
raising the temperature from 15° to 25° C. varied from O00046 to
i/OOOol, and were in practical agreement with previous tests of the
same cells under similar conditions.          Precisely similar values were
obtained after keeping the cells at 25° C. for the night, and then
lowering the temperature to 15° C. In another case, after keeping
tiro of the cells at 25° C. for the night, the changes of their E.M.F.
from their values at 15° C. wore found to be 9-0 and 8'6 millivolts,
jiving co-efficients 0'0Q063 and O'OOOfK) respectively.            The greater
change is evidently due to the time allowed for diffusion.
    On cooling the cells down from 15° to 0° C, allowing them to
remain for an hour at the latter temperature, the mean coefficients
obtained were invariably much larger.           The reason is evidently that
the zinc becomes        partially imbedded in the crystals at the lower
temperature, and is necessarily in contact with a normal saturated
Miction throughout a considerable portion of its surface.               In one
case a coefficient as high as 0"00075 was obtained ; in another           a co
efficient as low as 0"00059.      In the latter case the rod was very long,
and a considerable      length was probably exposed to a supersaturated
solution.
    That this state of supersaturation     is likely to occur, and to persist
for a    considerable time, is also illustrated by another experiment
 with a cell containing very few crystals.         After keeping the cell in
question at 25° C. for a day, it was observed that all the crystals had
 disappeared, whereas the other cells still 6howed considerable quanti
 ties.    On cooling the cell down to 15° C, the E.M.F. rose with a
 coefficient 0'00040, and then remained steady for some time, no
 crystals reappearing.       After a time a sudden rise in the E.M.F. was
 observed,     and the crystals were seen to have reappeared on the
 jorface of the paste.
    On transferring the cells back from the melting ice to the constant
 temperature bath at 15° C, the E.M.F. of the B.O.T. cells was
  almost invariably found to be from 2 to 4 millivolts higher than before
  cooling.    The difference was greatest in those cells which contained
  the greatest    quantity of solution, and persisted for several days if

124          Prof. H. L. Callendar and Mr. H. T. Barnes.
the cell were not disturbed.       In one case, after cooling to 0° C, a
cell remained nearly 5 millivolts too high when kept for one hour at
15° C.    After twenty hours at 15° C, the difference still remained
3 millivolts.    In the course of the next two hours it was shaken
twice, and returned to within one-tenth of a millivolt of its previous
value.    On further shaking the cell it was noticed that, if the mer-
cnrous sulphate were disturbed so as to come in contact with the zinc,
the E.M.F. temporarily fell some 2 or 3 millivolts, but recovered
very quickly on the mercurous powder subsiding. This observation
illustrates the necessity, now well understood, of keeping the zinc
from direct contact with the mercurous paste.
                      § 8. Illustration 'of Diffusion-lag.
    To illustrate the extreme slowness of the diffusion process,
and to show that all saturated cells have really the same coeffi
cient, if sufficient time be allowed for diffusion, the following
experiment      was tried.      Two exactly similar Board of Trade
cells of normal E.M.F. were taken from the constant-tempera
ture bath at 14° C, and placed in the other bath at 25° C. Two or
three observations were taken each day of their subsequent changes
of E.M.F. After the lapse of two days, one of the cells was occa
sionally shaken, and rapidly gained the correct value of the E.M.F.
of a saturated cell at 25° C. The other cell was left undisturbed,
the temperature being maintained constant to one-fiftieth of a degree
 Centigrade.     The E.M.F. of the latter cell fell slowly and almost nni-
formly as the diffusion proceeded, but it was not until after the
lapse of nearly a fortnight that it reached the correct value.
    The annexed curves (Fig. 1) illustrate the rate of diffusion in
these cells.    The abscissas represent time in days ; the ordinates,
fall of E.M.F. in millivolts from 15° C.
    For the sake of comparison, a cell of a different type, which we
            " B.O.T.
designate              crystal," was submitted to the same treatment at
the same time.      The straight line BC relates to this "crystal" cell.
 It will be seen that it shows no appreciable diffusion-lag. In fact
 its E.M.F. had arrived in twenty minutes within a tenth of a milli
 volt of its final value.
    Curve No. (1) relates to the B.O.T. cell which was shaken.        The
points at which the shaking took place are marked by the sudden
 falls of E.M.F.
    Curve No. (2) relates to the cell which was left undisturbed. The
 rate of diffusion would probably have been much slower and more
 uniform, but for the slight vibration due to the running of the stirrer
 in the water-bath. The changes in the rate of diffusion shown a,b
 the points 2-5 days and 8"5 days were probably due to excessive
 stirring about those dates.

   We have      also tested several of the Muirhead portable cells in a
special   water- jacketed air bath, the temperature of which was regu
lated by a thermostat.          We find that for comparatively rapid changes
of temperature,        such as 10° C. in two hours, they have a temperature-
coefficient   of 0-00050, on the average, between 10° and 30° 0. They
We also a slow diffusion-lag similar to other B.O.T. cells.                 It must

not  intended      for the most accurate laboratory tests, and that they
are qnite   sufficiently constant        for the purposes     for which they are
generally    used.
   It is sufficiently        evident from the examples above given that a
Clark cell      of the B.O.T. form containing clear solution cannot be
aid to have a definite temperature coefficient.            The change of E.M.F.
is seen to depend on the previous history of the cell, on the rate of
change of temperature,           and on the quantity of solution and relative
sze and position of the zinc rod.                The temperature-coefficient at

cient time is allowed, and sufficient crystals are present, the higher
value is the more correct one to use ; bat we are inclined to think
that many observers are not aware how extremely slow the process
•of diffusion really is, and how considerable a time is required for the
attainment of the limiting value.
                                         " Crystal " Cells.
                  § 9. Board of Trade
    The defects of the ordinary B.O.T. form of Clark cell in this
respect of diffusion-lag have long- been recognised, and various
methods have been proposed to remedy the disadvantages          resulting1
from it. Lord Rayleigh himself preferred the H-form of cell, in
which the zinc is buried under a layer of crystals.         This form of
cell has been adopted by the Berlin Reichsanstalt, and has been
shown by Kahle to be practically free from the defects of the other
pattern.     We have made several cells of the H-form, but we are
strongly of opinion that, besides being more difficnlt to make, they
are not so convenient to work with as the B.O.T. test-tube pattern.
   On considering the matter in the light of the preceding obser
vations with regard to the great differences in the temperature-
coefficient produced by different degrees of immersion of the zinc
rod in the crystals, it occurred to us that the diffusion-lag of the
B.O.T. pattern might be entirely removed by a very simple modi
fication of procedure ; so simple, in fact, that it would seem scarcely
to deserve mention, were it not that of the many hundreds of
B.O.T. cells which we have seen and examined, not one has been
constructed in the manner to be described.
   The modification we have adopted in these cells, which we term
Board of Trade " crystal " cells, consists simply in filling the cell
above the mercurous paste with moist crystals, instead of with satu
rated solution.    Under these circumstances no part of the solution,
can remain either supersaturated      or unsaturated for any appreciable
time.
   We have subjected these and other cells to the severest tests, and
the most sudden variations of temperature, such as 0° C. to 25° or
¦30° C, and we find that the B.O.T. cells, when filled in this manner
with crystals, have no appreciable diffusion-lag, and are not sur
passed in quickness by any other form.
                    § 10. Preparation   of Crystal Cells.
   The procedure which we adopt in making these crystal cells
differs only in one or two small details from that prescribed in the
Board of Trade memorandum on the Clark cell.
   A stock solution with mercurous sulphate paste is prepared

      Electromotive Force of different Forms          of the Clark Cell.     127
 exactly   as therein     described.    When cool, the supernatant liquid
 may be decanted off to be used for the preparation             of crystals.   A
supply   of  suitable    crystals is easily "obtained  at  anytime    by  taking
this solntion, or any other solution of zinc sulphate which has been
neutralised and treated with mercurous sulphate at 30° C, and cool
ing it down to 0° C. The liquid is then decanted off, and the crystals
drained on a piece of filter-paper.          This method leaves them suffi
ciently   moist    for  the  purpose.    The  crystals are filled into the cell
tlirongh a class tnbe or funnel to a depth of about 2 cm., and a hollow
is made in the surface with a glass rod to facilitate the introduction
of the zinc.       When the cell has settled it should be free from air-
babbles, and should show the merest film of liquid above the surface of
the crystals.       Inasmuch as zinc sulphate does not tend to form any
hydrate higher than the hepta-hydrate between the limits 0° and
yf C, the crystals will remain equally moist, or very nearly so,
between these limits.
    After soldering the platinum wire on to the zinc rod, we prefer to
seal the    end of the zinc rod with marine glue into a glass tube
 which nearly fits it.      The object of this is to make the best possible
seal to protect the solder joint, which may otherwise            be injured by
the creeping of the solution.           The upper part of the glass tube is
then sealed on to the platinum wire to form a mercury cup.                   The
glass tnbe also forms a convenient handle to use when inserting the
 cork and the zinc rod into the cell.          We prefer to amalgamate the
 line rod,  as   this  proceeding appears     to  protect the zinc from local
 tction, and to give more uniform results. We may here remark that
 in the B.O.T. cells containing solution the zinc rod, even if amalga
 mated,   rapidly becomes corroded near the top by local action.               In
 the  cells filled with crystals,     on the other hand, the zinc remains
 perfectly   hright and clean.
                  §  11. Decomposition    of Mercurous Sulphate.
    After neutralising the zinc sulphate solution with zinc oxide, we
 prefer to   filter in a jacketed funnel at 40° C, for the sake of obtain
 ing a  stronger solution. Mercurous sulphate is then added to remove
  any traces of zinc oxide or other impurities which have any action
  apon it.    We have observed that if, after the addition of the mer-
  enroua sulphate, the solution be heated to between 35° and 40° C, a
  alight change may be noticed in the appearance of the mercurous
  sulphate.     The filtrate, when cooled to 15° C, may remain clear, but,
  if further cooled to 0° C, a yellow turbidity makes its appearance,

 •with the mercurous       sulphate,  the filtrate will remain clear when
 cooled to 0° C. It appears probable that if a Clark cell is heated
above 30° O, or is made from paste which has been so heated, it*
 E.M.F. may be affected by a similar canse. The temperature of
30° C. appears, however, to be a perfectly safe limit.             It is not
unlikely that the decomposition is determined by the presence of
zinc oxide, as we have rarely observed changes of more than one or
two tenths of a millivolt even after heating a cell to 50° C.
                     § 12.  Tests of B.O.T. Crystal Cells.
   Several of these crystal cells were made by H. T. B., and later by
the advanced     electrical students in the ordinary course of their
work.    The cells so set up at different times by different students
were rarely found to differ under any conditions by so much as the
tenth of a millivolt from the mean at any given temperature.           If, as
occasionally happened, a new cell, within an hour or so of sealing np,
was found to have an E.M.F. as much as two tenths of a millivolt
too high,  it was short-circuited for half an hour or so with a piece
of copper wire. This procedure invariably had the effect of reducing-
the E.M.F. to its normal value.
   It might naturally be supposed that with so small a quantity of
solution, these cells would be serionsly affected by short-circuiting.
We have found, on the contrary, that they are much less affected
than the ordinary B.O.T. form or than unsaturated cells. The
crystal cells on short circuit were found to give a current of about
5 or 6 milliamperes, falling gradually to 2 or 1 in the course of an
hour. On removing the short circuit the cells instantly recovered to
within a millivolt of their normal value, so quickly, in fact, that it
was found impossible by the balance method to obtain any inter
mediate readings showing the rate of recovery.             In less than five
minutes the value had generally recovered to within a tenth of a
millivolt of the normal.
   The ordinary B.O.T. cells of the same size, containing clear solu
tion, were found to give a similar current on short circuit, but the
recovery was never so rapid or perfect.
               § 13.  Temperature Coefficient of Crystal Cells.
   Having satisfied ourselves by various preliminary trials that the
crystal cells were practically free from diffusion-lag, and finding that
the temperature coefficient between 15° and 0° C. appeared to be
somewhat higher than that given by Kahle and other authorities, we
determined to make a systematic series of observations under definite
and uniform conditions.

         Electromotive   Force of different Forms of   the   Clark Cell.   129
     For this test   four crystal cells of different dates were selected,
differing       widely as possible (one-tenth of a millivolt either way)
                 as
 from the mean at 15° C.       Six other cells were set apart as standards
 of comparison, and were kept at a constant          temperature of 15° C.
 light   and  day throughout   the series of observations.    The cells were
 »11   of the same form and dimensions as the B.O.T. cells above
 ascribed, and were all sealed with marine glue.
    At starting the mean of the test cells at 15° C. agreed to one
 tradredth of a millivolt with the mean of the standard cells.           The
 tartest cells were then immersed in melting snow, and comparisons
o:   their E.M.F. with the standards were made at intervals of six,
 fljhteen, and twenty- four hours after immersion. For the next twenty -
 t'tr hours they were kept at a temperature            of 5° C, next day at
 KPC, then for three days at 15° C, then for a day each at 20°, 25°,
 ad 30° C.      In this manner the comparisons at each point were made
    nearly as possible under similar conditions.
a
   The small     differences which the cells possessed at starting were
maintained, within two or three hundredths of a millivolt, throughout
      series of observations.    They were possibly due to inequalities of
i«, or to slight differences in the preparation of the solutions and
crystals, or to the fact that the platinum wires in the mercury cups
 fro not amalgamated. No systematic difference in their temperature-
e«fficients could be detected.
   At each point the mean of the observations            taken at the end of
it   first six hours showed a slight lag, as compared with the obser
vations taken at eighteen and twenty-four hours, amounting             on the
«erage to nearly two hundredths of a millivolt.             It necessary to
                                                                is
remark, however, that a difference        of one hundredth of a degree of
temperature means rather more than one hundredth of a millivolt              ;
isd that this apparent lag, corresponding         to less than 0"02° C., may
tave been due to some constant error of observation           of temperature
inder different conditions in the morning and evening.            In any case
       evident that the diffusion-lag,
 ¦t
is                                       if  any,is   so  small that  itwould
k    quite useless to consider     it in any case, unless the greatest pre-
aations were taken to secure a constant and uniform temperature,
ad to measure the temperature to at least 0"01 C.
   After the three days at 0°, 5°, and 10° C, the mean of the four
cells returned in less than twenty-four hours to within one hundredth
rf
a       millivolt of the mean of the standard cells. After three days
it  15°     the mean values were identical. At the conclusion of the
            C.
observations at 30° C, the cells were replaced in the bath at 15° C.
lc  fifteen hours the mean value had returned to within two hundredths
d    4 millivolt of the standards.
    Some two months after the above series of experiments,           a second
 *t    ofobservations at 30° C. was taken with three of the same cells, by

130           Proi. H. L. Gallendar and Mr. H. T. Barnes.
way of verification.     The cells at 15° C. were still found to preserve
their relative differences to within one or two hundredths of a milli
volt, and the mean still agreed with that of the standards.             The
difference at 30° C. was observed directly in terms of the resistance
boxes, as well as in terms of the bridge-wire, at each observation.
The fall of E.M.F. fonnd was less by four hundredths of a millivolt
in l9-4 millivolts, than on the preceding occasion. After twenty-
seven hours at 30° C. the cells, when replaced in the 15° C. bath,
returned in twenty hours to within two hundredths of a millivolt of
their previous values.
                        § 14.  Quickness of Recovery.
    It must not be hastily assumed from the foregoing observations
that the cells in each case took nearly a day to recover their original
values at 15° C.       The observations were taken in this particular
series after the lapse of several hours in order to make sure that the
cells had not undergone any permanent change as the result of
prolonged exposure to 0° and 30° C.
    We have made several special tests with regard to this point. We
find that B.O.T. crystal cells of this size, set up in test-tubes nearly
2 cm. in diameter, when suddenly transferred from melting snow, or
from the other bath at 30°, or even 40° C, back to the constant tem
perature bath at 15° C, return to within a tenth of a millivolt of their
previous values in less than ten minutes.
    For cells of a smaller size, of which we have made several, the
recovery is still more rapid.       It appeal's to be chiefly a question   of
the time required for the change of temperature.         After exposure    to
a temperature above 15°      C,  the cells frequently  return, at 15° C,   in
less than half an hour to within one or two hundredths of a millivolt
of their previous values. After exposure to a temperature below
 15° C, the recovery is a little slower.         This might naturally be
expected, as crystallisation is generally more rapid than solution.
    We have also taken a series of observations at 40° C, though         this
 temperature lies outside the limits of practical utility.     On suddenly
 raising  the   temperature   to  40-6°  C. the  value  observed  after ten
minutes was one millivolt higher than the final value.            The next
 observation   was taken after three hours, by which time it was      found,
on subsequent reduction, that the E.M.F. had become constant.            The
 E.M.F. at 40    60° C. was found to    be 35 81  millivolts lower than at
 15° C.
    The recovery on returning to the 15° bath after a day at 40-6 C.
 was quite unexpectedly rapid. In ten minutes the value was found
to be within a tenth, in two and a half hours within a hundredth of
 a millivolt.    Later observations   showed no further change.

   The results of these experiments on the temperature- variation of
theE.M.F. of B.O.T. crystal cells are given in the above table, and
ire plotted in the accompanying curve (fig. 2).                   The curve is drawn
to show not the whole temperature-variation                of   the E.M.F., but the
defect   of the change from lineality.
  The    observed E.M.F. in volts at a temperature t° C. is                less at     all
points   than that calculated by the simple linear formula,
                         E, = E15-0001,200         (i-lo)                            (L).

   The full curve in fig. 2 represents this difference-term on a scale of
2 \ cm. to 1 millivolt.         The crosses represent the results of actual
observation at the different points.              The mean difference of the
observations from the curve, if we except those at 30° C, is only
three-hundredths of a millivolt.           The observations at 30° C. differ by
more than one-tenth of a millivolt, and those at 40° C. by a whole
millivolt from the simple parabolic curve. These differences cannot,
we think, be explained as being due to errors of observation.                This is
proved by the accuracy with which the cells returned to their
original values at 15° C, and also by the agreement of the twenty or
thirty different readings at each point. Moreover, the observations
have been repeatedly verified by others, not shown on the curve,
with cells of different types, to within one or two-hundredths of a
millivolt.    We conclude that no simple parabolic formula can be
made to fit the observations throughout the range 0° to 40° C. Over
the range 0° to 28°      C,   however, the differences, even       if real, are  not
of great importance,       and we may take the formula,
 E, = E„-0-001200 (<-15)-0 0000062                  (t-lh)\             (L) + (P)
as representing     the temperature-variation of the E.M.F. of these cells
within about one-twentieth of a millivolt between these limits. The
symmetry of the eurve shows that we may fcike the very convenient
round number 1'200 millivolt, for the change of E.M.F. per 1° C. at
15° C.
   Taking formula (P), we find for the teviperature-coeflicient            at t° C,
             ti/d* (E,/E„) = -0-000837-00000087                (t-lb),
and for the mean temperature- coefficient between t° and 15°           C,
         (E,/E„— 1)/(*— 15) = -0-000837-0-0000043 (t                  -  15).
It is generally, however, more convenient to use the formula (L -f- P) .
Between the limits of 12° and 18° C. we may use the simple linear-
formula (L), without risk of making an error greater than one-
twentieth of     a millivolt.    If, however,   we were to use the    temperature-
coefficient 0'()0076 (which is very commonly taken) over the same
range, the error might amount to nearly three-quarters of a millivolt.
                      § 16. Results    of Precious    Ohservers.
   The formula given above for the temperature- coefficient differs
from that of previous observers chiefly in the direction of making the
change of E.M.F. more nearly uniform.
   Lord Rayleigh* tested two cells under similar conditions of slo"\v
temperature change.          For one cell lie found the temperature-coeffi
cient^ at t given by the formula 000083 -|-0000018(<- 15), which

      Electromotive Force of different Forms            of the Clark Cell.    133
 agrees -with    our value, except that the rate of change of the coeffi
cient    is twice as great. For the other cell he found a coefficient
 12 per cent, smaller with a similar rate of change.                His cells, in
which the zinc was pushed down into the paste, would be certainly
less   liable to diffusion-lag than the ordinary B.O.T. pattern, and
might     possibly possess a different coefficient; but we think that the
difference is most probably to be explained by diffusion-lag, and in
that case the higher value would be the more correct.
   Glazebrook and Skinner find the valne 0"O0O76 for the mean
coefficient between 0° and 15° C, under conditions in which diffusion-
lag would be approximately            eliminated.     Our value between theso
limits is 0-000773.
   Our value for the coefficient at 15° C, namely, 0'000837, is also in
fairly close agreement with the value 0'00082 for an H-cell at 15° C,
found by Fleming.           The lower values obtained by many observers
for ordinary B.O.T. cells, are doubtless vitiated by the effects of
diffusion-lag, and are, in this respect, in agreement with our own
results for such cells under, similar conditions as given in a previous
section.
   The observations of Kahle* are probably the most                   systematic.
He   finds for the E.M.F. in volts at t° C. the formula
               E^E.s-O-OOllG^-^-O-OOOOl^-lo)2                                (K).
   The difference between this formula of Kahle and the linear
formula (L) is shown by the dotted curve in fig. 2.               It will be seen
that the agreement with our observations is very close between 25°
and 30°    C,  but that the valne of the coefficient at 15° 0. is some
what smaller.        Below 10° C. the divergence is very marked.              The
formula     of Kahle gives a change of only 15-15 millivolts between 0°
and   15°  C., corresponding to a mean coefficient of 0-000704, values
which are evidently much smaller than those given above.
   We do not think, however, that it is necessary to assume that
there is any real difference of behaviour between our cells and those
tested by Kahle.        The discrepancy is more probably to be explained
by  the   fact that  the   observations on which the formula of Kahle is
founded were taken between the limits 12° and 28° C, under condi
tions less favourable to the cells.         Between these limits, so far as we
arc able to judge,      we  are  in agreement with Kahle, within the limits
of accuracy of his observations.            Kahle does not give any detailed
observations or any statement of the probable error of his results, but
it is  possible to form     a general idea of the    limits of accuracy from the
account    which he gives of his method.          The cells were kept immersed

 day in either bath, or by more than a tenth of a degree in the courses
 of an observation.           From other observations given by Kahle* ifc
 would appear as though his cells were subject to a temperature or
  diffusion-lag of the order of half a millivolt, when the temperature-
 was changing at the rate of 1° C. per hour.                From these and other
 considerations it is evident that Kahle did not aim at an order of
 accuracy higher than one or two-tenths of a millivolt, and that his
formula could not be expected to give correct results beyond the
 limits of observation.
    Thus, although his formula is practically correct between the
limits of his observations, namely 12° and 28° C, it is quite possible
that it may be as much as 10 per cent, in error at 0° C.                       On the
other hand, we regard it as quite impossible that our observations at
this point should be in error by even a tenth part of the amount,,
namely 1^ millivolts, by which they differ from the formula of
Kahle. Again, although the observations of Glazebrook and Skinner
between 15° and 0° C. may have been affected to a slight extent by
diffusion-lag, it is plain that the effect of diffusion-lag, if any, must
have been to reduce the extent of the change, and could not explain
the fact that the change which they observed was so much largei-
than that given by Kahle's formula, and so nearly in agreement with
onr own.
    In this connection it is necessary to refer to an opinion which
we have often encountered in conversation and otherwise, and which
is possibly still current, namely that the observations of Glazebrook
and Skinner are in precise agreement with those of Kahle on this
point.       For instance, Schuster* quotes correctly Kahle's formula
for the mean temperature-coefficient between t° and 15° C, namely,
                          o = 0 000814 + 0-000007 (r— 15),
and states that Glazebrook and Skinner's coefficient (o = 0-00076^
refers to a mean temperature of 7'5° C., and is identical with the
above at that temperature.              This is obviously true if we put t = 7-5°
in the formula, but not if we put t = 0°.                 The mistake appears to
have arisen from the above formula having been inadvertently-
described by Kahle as being the temperature-coefficient              at t, instead of
the mean coefficient between t and 15° C.                But although the worcls,
" Fur     eine   beliebige   Temperatur t," used by Kahle, may, perhaps,            be
ambiguous, the complete formula (K), from which the other                            is
derived, leaves no possible doubt as to the true meaning.^

       Electromotive Force of different Forms of                      the   Clark Cell.   135
                        § 17. Hermetically           Sealed Cells.
   We have always felt somewhat dissatisfied with the usual practice
of sealing up standard cells with marine glue or paraffin wax.  Pro-
rided that the marine glue sealing is carefully and conscientiously
performed, it may, doubtless, remain good for a considerable time,                          it'
the  cell is not exposed to extreme variations of temperature.       We
have  not, however, ourselves   succeeded  in  making  the  marine glue
seal stand many repetitions of the 0° to 30° C. treatment.          Cells
which have been thus treated for a month or two have invariably
shown some signs of creeping.      Except in extreme cases, this creep
ing does not appear to produce         much effect on the E.M.F. of
saturated cells, but in the case of unsaturated cells the effect is
serious.    The set of twelve Carhart-Clark cells in our collection,
though evidently prepared and sealed with the greatest skill and
care, have all suffered from the creeping out of the solution in the
lspse of two years.    One of the cells       now    millivolts below its
                                                       is         5
normal value.     It is only fair to add that, owing to the extremes of
the   Montreal climate, they have               been    subjected           to an annual tem
perature range of 5° to 27° C, and that all the Muirhead cells in our
collection are similarly affected.
   We have succeeded in making several forms of hermetically sealed
cells, and we are of opinion that such cells are much to be preferred
as standards to those sealed in any other way.        The following are
the principal varieties on which we have made experiments.
   (1) Cells   of the H-Type with Zinc Amalgam. — We prefer to make
this cell in the form (^) of an inverted Y. Fine platinum wires are
first sealed into the lower extremities of the inverted Y, the limbs
¦are then filled with zinc amalgam and crystals of zinc sulphate, and
with mercury and mercurous paste as usual.              When sufficient
materials have been introduced, the middle leg          sealed off. Thisis
inverted Y-form          much easier to make than the H-form, as
                        is                                                                 it
involves only one T-joifl.     In making these cells, we prefer to use
lead glass tubing about       to  5 mm. in bore. Hermetically sealed
                                         8
cells of  this  form   were made   many years ago by Wright* for the
 purpose of testing the effect of dissolved air on the E.M.F.
    Yf-Form. —When intended for immersion in a water bath, the
 lower limbs of the inverted Y are continued upwards beyond the
 seal to a height of    4or  inches forming
                                 5             W. The upturned limbs

 are partly filled with mercury, and are used for making connections.
    As the result of our experience with cells of this description, we
 are not inclined to recommend the nse of cells containing zinc
 amalgam at temperatures above 25° C. or below 10° C. As Lord
Rayleigh has observed, these cells show a very remarkable tendency

to crack in the platinum seal of the leg containing the zinc amalgam,
especially if exposed to low temporatnres.        We do not think that
they could be trusted to stand the Montreal climate.         Very few of
our cells constructed on this pattern have survived a month or two
of the 0° to 30° treatment, if they contained more than a mere button
of amalgam.
    (2) H-Form Cells with Zinc Hod. — We have generally found cells
made with zinc rod to be more reliable.         The zinc rod is cast in a
small glass tube of suitable size.       The platinum wire, previously
enclosed in a capillary glass tube, is thrust into the fused zinc.
When cool, the glass mould is broken off, and the zinc rod cleaned
and amalgamated, and introduced into one leg of the H.         The other
leg is partly filled with mercury to which connection is made by a
platinum wire in a glass tube after the Board of Trade method.
The other materials are filled in as usual.       The two legs of the H
are then fused np at the top, the upper portions serving as mercury
cups.
    Wo prefer to uso tubes of very small dimensions, and to make the
horizontal connecting limb as short as possible.         This cell is not
veiy easy to make, owing to the double fusion on to the platinum
wires after the materials have been filled in, when the cell cannot bo
inverted.    If, however, the tubes are made sufficiently small, it is a
very convenient and sensitive form of cell.
    (3) Board of Trade Form with Crystals. — The single tube form
with the zinc rod cast in a similar way on to a glass capillary, is
equally efficient if filled with crystals, and is much easier to seal.
There is only one tube to seal, and it is possible to get at it evenly
from all sides.    There is generally no difficulty in keeping the two-
wires separate, provided that the capillaries through which they pass
have been drawn sufficiently thick and strong.       Both the capillaries
may be expanded into mercury cups at the top, or. the outer tube
itself may conveniently be used to form the mercury cup for the zine
terminal.
    Portable Form. — This cell is still more easily made in a portable
form, in which the mercury is replaced by amalgamated platinum.
The cell may then be made upside down, the difficult seal being
 made first, before the materials are tilled in. The process of making
the cell is briefly as follows. A platinum wire is sealed into a thick
glass capillary with a small mercury cup at one end. The wire is
 left projecting some 2 or 3 cm. beyond the glass at each end. One
end is then hammered flat to serve as the positive element, and both
ends are amalgamated by heating and plunging in mercury.                A
platinum wire capillary without a mercury cup is cast into a small
zinc rod, and the free end is amalgamated.       A glass tube of suitable
 size and length to form the cell is melted down in the middle till it

      Electromotive Force of different Forms        of the Clark Cell.    137
 is of sufficient size to just admit the passage of the two capillaries
 from    opposite sides. The capillaries are then held in their proper
 relative positions while the seal is completed, and the free ends of the
 Hires are coiled down in their respective mercury cups.           The lower
 end  of the tube is then drawn out slightly to facilitate the final
sealing    off.
    The materials are filled in after the usual method, but in the
reverse of the usual order.          Moist crystals of zinc sulphate are
packed round the zinc till it is covered to a depth of about a centi
metre.       After inserting about half the mercurous paste, the flattened
and amalgamated platinum wire is coiled down into a suitable posi
tion, and more paste is added.        The end of the cell close to the point
where it is to be finally sealed, is preferably filled with moist crys
tals instead of paste.      The object of this is to avoid leaving any of
the paste close to the seal, where it might suffer decomposition         from
the heat in scaling off.     Any excess   of  solution is dried ofT with filter
paper, and the narrow neck is then sealed off with a fine flame.
    On the whole, we prefer this portable form of cell to any of the
other forms we have tried.        The shape of the cell and its small size
make it very convenient.         The seal is comparatively easy to make,
and the narrow glass neck separating         the cell from its connexions is
also an advantage, as it diminishes the risk of any error of tempera
ture arising from conduction along the tube.
    We have not found that there is any advantage in using mercury
as compared with amalgamated            platinum. The cell has a higher
internal resistance, and gives a smaller current on short circuit, but
the recovery appears to be equally rapid and complete.             We cannot
find any systematic difference in the electromotive             force at any
temperature. If anything, the amalgamated platinum has the advan
tage over the mercury, as the purity of the mercury is then compara
tively unimportant, and redistillation is unnecessary.             There does
not appear to be any advantage gained, in our experience, by using a
strip of platinum foil in place of the fine flattened wire.
                    § 18. Tests of Hermetically   Sealed Cells.
    We have similarly tested several saturated cells of the H-form,
 and various      other patterns   above described     as hermetically sealed
 cells.    We find that they all show the same temperature change of
 E.M.F. as the B.O.T. crystal cells. The agreement in nearly every
 case   is within one or two-hundredths of a millivolt even at 0° and
  30° C,    the limits of the range.
     The largest divergence was found in the case of a portable cell of
  type (3), with an amalgamated platinum wire in place of mercury.
  In this cell, both at 0° and 30° C, the difference from 15° C.

138           Prof. H. L. Callendar and Mr. H. T. Barnes.
exceeded by one-tenth of a millivolt that of all the other crystal cells
we have tested.      Even in this case the cell was at least consistent
with itself.    It was first tested at 15°, 30°, 15°, 0° and 15° C, allow
ing  a day at each temperature.         It was a new cell, the first of this
type which we tested,       and   its value   at the time was nearly three-
tenths of a millivolt higher than the standard.          The value found at
0° C. was 16 72 millivolts above, and at 30° C. 19 72 millivolts below
its value at 15° C, instead of +16"62, and — 19-58 millivolts respec
tively.    The cell being of    a very small and sensitive form, the test
was repeated a few days        later  in the reverse order, allowing only
half an hour at each temperature.           The values found in the second
test were + 16"71 and — 19'70 millivolts respectively.          We thought
at first that the discrepancy might be due to some inherent peculi
arity of this type of cell. We have since tested other cells of the
same type and size, with results which agree to 0'02 millivolt with
the B.O.T. crystal cells.     The agreement is not confined to points 0°
and 30° C.      For instance, the difference found at     24° C. was 0'05 of
a millivolt less than that calculated by the formula (P). The B.O.T.
crystal cells at this point show a difference of 0-04 millivolt from the
curve (P) in the same direction. We consider that the divergence
of one-tenth of a millivolt in the case of this particular cell must be
regarded as exceptional.
         § 19. Importance    of Constant Conditions of Temperature.
   We have quoted the above test partly as an illustration of the kind
of agreement between cells of different types which it is possible to
attain with suitable cells under definitely known conditions of tem
perature.
   In attaining this    order of accuracy the chief difficulty lies in the
certain determination of the temperature of the cells. To attain a
certainty of the order of 0'01° C, the following conditions are
necessary   : —
   1. The cells should be of an elongated form, and should be deeply
immersed in a bath of liquid, which is constantly and vigorously
stirred.
   2. The temperature       must be kept constant to 0'01° C, and the
thermometer used must be read and corrected to the same order.
   If tho cells are not deeply immersed their temperature will be
affected by external conditions.           If  the liquid is not constantly
stirred it will tend to be hotter at the upper surface, especially if the
liquid be very expansible, like paraffin, and the bath be hotter or
colder   than its surroundings.       If the temperaturo is changing the
cells will not be of an uniform temperature throughout, and will lag
behind the thermometer, unless they happen to be of a smaller size.

        Electromotive     Force of different Fornix of    the Clark Cell.
     The electrical conditions are not less important, but are more easily
  realised and maintained.       Our galvanometer is sensitive to much less
  than a millimetre of the bridge-wire (one hundredth of a millivolt)
  Great attention is paid to the perfection of the insulation, and to the
 avoidance     of thermo-electric effects, which may readily amount to
  more   than ten microvolts. We may here remark that in testing any
  sew batch of cells it is quite impossible to tell, till the results are
 worked out, whether they are in agreement with others.              The many
 coincidences found cannot therefore be the result of bias on the part
 of the observer.
    We    think  we may fairly claim for the Clark cell an order of con
 sistency approaching one-hundredth of a millivolt in the temperature
 changes    of its E.M.F.
       § 20.  Clark Cells in which   the  Solution is of Constant Strength.    .
    It is well known that Clark cells, not containing crystals, in which
 the  solution does not change its strength with change of temperature,
 have the advantage of possessing a temperature-coefficient            which is
less than half that of the saturated cells.           They are also practically
free from the effects of diffusion-lag,       as the density of the solution is
always     nearly uniform.
    The best known cell of this type is the Carhart-Clark cell, in which
the zinc sulphate solution is chosen as being saturated at 0° C.              An
error of 2° C. in the temperature at which the solution is saturated,
will make an error of only one millivolt, approximately, in the E.M.F.
of the cell.
    We have prepared several cells of this type at different dates and
in different forms, with separately prepared solutions.             In cells so
prepared,     of  similar  patterns, we  have  not  as a rule found  differences
greater than two or three-tenths of a millivolt. These differences
were probably due as much to other cause as to difference of strength
of solution.       We have generally sealed the cells hermetically to avoid
creeping of the solution, which has a tendency to lower the E.M.F. in
the case of unsaturated cells.
    It is evident that these cells must, on the whole, be less accurately
reproducible than the saturated cells. We have also found that they
are more liable to undergo slight changes of E.M.F. as a result of
.short-circuiting, or of exposure to high or low temperatures.              They
appear, in fact, to be less stable than the cells containing crystals.
    We have also prepared experimental cells with solutions weaker
than the cell saturated at 0° C. We have observed in these cells a
similar instability, becoming more marked as the solution is weakened.
We are inclined to attribute this instability to a difference in solubility
or diffusivity of the mercurous sulphate in the weaker solutions.

140          Prof. H.  L.  CaUendar and Mr. H.          T. Barnes.
    We also found it possible to obtain observations of the change of
E.M.F. of cells saturated at 15° and 30° C, under conditions in whicl«
the solution was considerably supersaturated.            The cell saturated at
15° C. was kept for several hours at 0° C. without showing any trace
of crystallisation. This cell agreed at 15° C. with the saturated cells,
and gave very consistent readings throughout the range 0° to 30° C.
The change of E.M.F. per 1° C. was found to be 0 567 of a millivolt
between 0° and 15° C, and 0*560 of a millivolt between 15° and 30°.
As the whole change of E.M.F. between 0° and 30° C. was only 16 90
millivolts, and as the E.M.F. of the cell rose by one-tenth of a milli
volt after keeping for six hours at 0° C, the observations may be
taken as showing that the temperature-coefficient of this cell, whether
in the supersaturated or unsaturated condition, is practically constant
over the range 0° to 30° C. This is in marked contrast with the case
of the cells containing crystals.
    The tests of the cells saturated at 0° C. were very fairly consistent,
but not quite so good as those of the cells saturated at 15° C. They
showed a mean temperature change of E.M.F. per 1° C. of 0-543 of a
millivolt. There was no decided evidence of any variation of the
temperature-coefficient     over the range 0° to 30° C. Carhart gives
the formula : —
          E, = E„ [1   -  1-000387  (f-15) +0     0000005     (t-15)*],
which would make the temperature-coefficient diminish slightly as
the temperature rises.       (Change of E.M.F. 0'56 mv. per 1° C).
    The tests on the weaker cells were much less consistent, owing to
the instability of E.M.F. above referred to. The results of the tests
pointed to a mean change of 0'55 of a millivolt per 1° C. The change
observed between 0° and 15° C. was sometimes greater and sometimes
 less than that between 15° and 30° C, but there was no decided ten
 dency either way.     After keeping for some time at 0° or 30° C. these
 weak cells sometimes showed permanent changes amounting to as
 much as half a millivolt.
            § 21. Oh the Density of Solutions of Zinc Sulphate.
    A knowledge   of the density of solutions of zinc sulphate is required
in order to trace the relation between the changes of E.M.F., which
 depend on change of strength and density of the solution.                 This
 point has been investigated by two of Professor Carhart's students,
 the result of whose work has been published by Professor Carhart.*
 These observers find for a cell saturated at 15° C. an E.M.F. nearly
 five millivolts higher than that of a cell containing crystals, and a
 density which appears to be correspondingly low. For this and

       Electromotive Force of different Forms of                the   Clark Cell.     141
 otter reasons,     we thought it wonld be desirable to repeat the deter
 minations.       The observations of Lannoy,* though evidently under
 taken    with great care, did not extend to the                  case of solutions as
 dense as     those occurring in Clark cells. Other observers appear to
 hare    confined themselves chiefly to the case of very dilute solu
 tions.
    According to the views of Valson and Bender, which are quoted
 by   Ostwald and other authorities, the density of a salt solution, such
is zinc sulphate, may be additively deduced from the observed den
 sities in the      case of some standard solution (e.g., a solution of
 ammonium chloride), by means of two moduli representing the acid
and the base respectively.            We have calculated the densities accord
ing to the valnes which they give for the moduli at 18° C, but it
appears      that the results are only          a rough approximation, and miss
what     seems to     be the most      characteristic feature of the change of
density.
    In determining          the  relation betwepn        density and       strength of
solution,      the chief difficulties to         be encountered       are in the exact
measurement of the strength. If the composition of the solution is
determined by weighing out known quantities of the hydrated salt
into a litre flask, it is very possible that errors may arise from
evaporation or efflorescence, or from the presence of other hydrates.
In   order    to avoid   these possible errors, we adopted the much more
laborious method of evaporating a known weight of solution to
dryness at 100° C, assuming that the residue was the monohydrate.
Two     determinations were made in this manner for each solution
tested,     and in addition, two control experiments were made in
"hich the strength of the solution was measured by estimating the
-alphate by means of barium chloride.                  The following table contains
the results of these determinations               for seven different solutions.

    The first column contains the percentage by weight, p, of ZnSO«
in grams per 100 grams of solution, as deduced from the observa
tions on each solution.         The second column contains the values of
the density, d, at 20° C, obtained by weighing a special form of
pipette carefully filled with the solution.         The third column gives
to, the weight of ZnSO« in grams per cubic centimetre of solution,
and is obtained by dividing the product of the numbers in the first
two columns by 100.         If we add to this weight tc, the number 0'9982,
representing the weight of water in grams per c.c. at 20° C, and
subtract the observed density, d, of the solution, we obtain as the
•difference given in the fourth column, the weight of water displaced
per c.c. by the zinc sulphate in solution.
    The observations of Lannoy reduced on a similar plan are as

    These observations,       taken  in conjunction with our own, would
appear to indicate a simple relation between the density and the
composition, of a kind which so far as we are aware has not been pre
viously observed. Up to a density of about 1-150, the solution of
sine sulphate appears to take place approximately withont change of
 volume.     The added molecules of ZnS04 do not appear to displace
any of the molecules of water, so that the density at 20° C. is very
nearly 0-9982 + u>. Beyond this point, it appears that each added
 molecule of ZnSO« displaces one molecule of water, so that the
density of the solution is very approximately represented by the
expression
                     d  = 0-9982+ (p-18(w-0-150)/1C1                           (D).
    The nature of this relation is perhaps more clearly shown by the
curves given in fig. 3. In this figure, the values of to are taken as
abscissas, and the corresponding values of the difference 0-9982 -+-
to — d, as ordinates.       The sharp break which occurs at the point
 w — 0-150 is very clearly shown both by the observations of Lannoy,
 which are represented by crosses, and by our own which are
represented by the dots enclosed in circles.                 Those of Lannoy
 unfortunately   do  not   extend   far  enough to  afford   a satisfactory veri
 fication throughout the range, but we have no reason to distrnst onr

 own    observations at the higher points, as they were all carefnlly
 verified.     The dotted curve, which is practically a straight line,
 represents the formula of Bender and Valson, which smooths out the
 break.
    It is not theoretically improbable that a simple relation of this
type should be found to hold approximately in the case of salt solu
tions.     At the same time it is hardly to be expected that any such
simple     expression  should represent accurately the changes of density
-t all temperatures.         The expansion of water is anomalous in the
neighbourhood of the freezing point, and the coefficients of expan
 sion of solutions differ considerably        from that of water at low tem
peratures, and generally increase with increase of strength of solution.
 These variations in the coefficients of expansion may well introduce
secondary effects of a corresponding order in the changes of density.
    In comparing the observations of Lannoy with our own, which
 »ere taken at a slightly different temperature,          it would appear not
improbable that systematic differences of this kind may exist, but
•he point obviously requires much more careful investigation, as the
differences shown are so small, and might readily be explaiued by
errors of observation.          For instance, at the two lowest points the
density according       to Lannoy is greater than 0'9992 + to. Since he
ipparently determined the composition of the solution by weighing
out quantities     of the heptahydrate, the discrepancy might be explained
by a slight degree of efflorescence of the sample used for these deter
minations.       In the table of densities given by Carhart, the com
position of the solution in each case is stated in terms of the per
centage of ZnSO« by weight in 100 parts of solution.             If we assume,
ia the absence of any definite           statement, that the symbol ZnS04
st&ndB in this case also for the heptahydrate,         we find that the den
sities which he gives are much greater than those found by Lannoy,
or by ourselves, the value of the density at 45 per cent, of the hepta-
bydrate, according to Carhart, being T343, instead of 1'318, as given
by our observations.           It is possible that the sample used in this
case may have consisted            largely of the hexahydrate, or the dis
crepancy may       be  due  to  other  causes.
    If we take older determinations of the density of zinc sulphate
solutions, such as those of Gerlach or of Schiff (1859), we find that
they show a general agreement with our observations                 rather than
 with the formula of Bender, but that the characteristic point to
 which we have drawn attention is neatly smoothed out in the tables
 which tbey give as deduced from the results of their observations.
 The point in question would not be noticed at all nnless the obser
 vations were plotted by the method of differences, as shown in Fig. 3,
 and even in that ca.se it might readily be mistaken for an error of
 observation, unless      the points were numerous,       and had been     inde

pendently checked. If we Lad ourselves foreseen a simple relation
of this character, we should have taken even greater pains in verify
ing the observations about this point. As it is, we hope shortly to
be able to investigate     the subject further, and in particular to
•endeavour to find similar relations in the case of other solutions.

  § 22. Change    of E.M.F.    with   Strength  of Solution   at Constant
                                Temperature.
   A   number   of Clark cells of the B.O.T. pattern, but without
crystals,  were  set up with the solutions above described, of which
the density and composition had been carefully determined.            Due
precautions were taken in each case to avoid evaporation.              The
difference of E.M.F. from     the standard   at  15° C,  and also at other
temperatures, was carefully determined in the case of each of these
cells. On plotting the results, we could not find any simple relation
between the change of E.M.F. and the density or the percentage
strength of the solutions.       But on expressing the observations in
terms of w, the weight of ZnS04 per c.c, and not per gram, of solu
tion, we found that the values of <ZE, the difference of E.M.F. from
the standard at 15°   C, fell very nearly on a straight line, represented
by the formula : —
                     dE = 42-0 -88'Ow (millivolts).

   The differences           given in the last column are of the same order as
 he  accidental changes of E.M.F. observed in the case of these weaker
cells.     It would therefore appear probable that in this type of cell
the diminution of E.M.F. is simply proportional to the volume                           con
centration      of the salt.
   lo comparing the above results, a curious point remains to be
noticed.       Taking a cell saturated at 15° C, the increase of E.M.F.,
 •n cooling      down to 0° C, has been shown above to be 8'4 millivolts, if
there   is no change of strength of the solution.                 The increase of E.M.F.,
•he    to change of strength of solution from saturation at 15° C. to
•duration at 0°            C,    has been found       to be 6'5 millivolts.    We might,
"iitrefore,     naturally expect the total effect due to both causes com
bined      to be 14-9 millivolts, whereas the saturated crystal cells, in
»hich both causes are operative, show an increase of E.M.F. of
16-6   millivolts.
   The      explanation of this apparent discrepancy is to be found
probably in the lowering of E.M.F., due to the greater diffusivity of
¦hemercurous sulphate                  in the weaker solutions.          In the saturated
crystal     cells   this     diffusion   is  practically prevented by the dense layer
of crystals.           In order to test this hypothesis, some weaker cells were
*t up in the W form, in which the possibilities of diffusion are dimi
nished by the smallness of the tube and the increased distance
between        the electrodes.              These cells showed, as was expected,
higher values             of  the   E.M.F.     than those given by the formula, the
difference amounting in some cases to between 2 and 3 millivolts.
                         § 23.    On the Solubility of Zinc Sulphate.
    It  is  well known that zinc sulphate forms various hydrates, which
may he obtained by crystallisation at different temperatures.                          These
 hydrates differ in point of solubility, and it is important for Clark
 cells to employ the heptahydrate,                   which has the lowest solubility at

 140           Prof. H. L. Callendar and Mr. H. T. Barnes.
temperatures between 0° and 30° C, and may therefore be considered
 the normal hydrate at these temperatures.
    The peculiarities of the curve representing the temperature-varia
 tion of the E.M.F. of Clark cells are undoubtedly due in the main to
 the very considerable changes of solubility of this hydrate with rise
of temperature, and are closely associated with the formation of
 different hydrates at higher temperatures.              We therefore thought
 that it would be of interest to investigate this point more closely, at
least within the range of temperature over which accurate measure
 ments of the E.M.F. may be readily obtained.
    The solubility of zinc sulphate has been studied by Etard,* who
discovered that the solubility of the sulphates decreased with rise of
 temperature at higher points of the scale. His results are expressed
 in terms of the percentage weight, p, dissolved in 100 parts of the
solution at a temperature t° C. Expressed in this manner, he finds
that the curve representing the solubility is a straight line, the
equation of which for zinc sulphate is given as being
                       p = 276 +        0-2604*                         (Etard.)
This equation is given as representing the solubility up to a tempera
ture of about 80° C, above which the solubility decreases.
    Roscoe and Schorleminer,t on the other hand, give the following
table of solubility expressed in terms of the weight of ZnSO« dis
solved in 100 parts by weight of water.           For the sake of comparison,
we have reduced their results to the corresponding percentage, p, of
solution,    and have added two lines of results calculated            from the
formula of Etard, and from the observations of Poggiale.

    It is evident from the discrepancies shown in the last three lines
that the matter requires further investigation.                   From our own
experiments we find that the rate of diffusion in these extremely
dense and viscous solutions is so slow that it is much more difficult

to  obtain     correct results than might at first sight be expected. In
particular, we find it extremely important to maintain the solution
for a  considerable      time with continual stirring at each point at a
perfectly     constant   temperature.       This essential condition could be
readily   secured by     the aid of the constant temperature baths already
described.
   The method        which we adopted at each temperature was to prepare
&  saturated     solution with repeated stirring in a large test-tube in the
constant temperature bath.               This solution, mixed with crystals,
was maintained for several hours at a constant temperature.                   Samples
of  solution     free from   crystals were drawn off in a special pipette at
intervals and weighed.            They were then evaporated to dryness at
1<J0° C, and the percentage            of ZnSOt in each case was calculated,
fcsuming the residue to be the monohydrate.                  The different samples
it each    temperature always agreed very closely, showing the solution
to  have   been saturated and free from crystals.
   The    resnlts of our      observations are contained in the following

single observations, each line is the mean of two or three determina

    In order to exhibit the nature of these results on a convenient
scale, it is necessary to plot, not the whole percentage, as is usually
the case, but the small differences from the linear formula given in
the fourth column.           It is then apparent that there is a singular
point in the curve of solubility at a temperature of 39° C. At this
point, as the temperature rises, the rapidly increasing solubility            of
the heptahydrate begins to exceed that of the hexahydrate, which              is
also increasing, but less rapidly. At temperatures above 39°, a
solution containing only crystals of the heptahydrate becomes super
saturated with respect to the hexahydrate, so that if any crystals of
the latter are formed or introduced, there will be rapid crystallisa
tion, and the strength of the solution will diminish. At 39° C. the
solubilities of the two hydrates are equal and amount to 41'1 per
cent, of the solution ; but whereas the rate of increase of the solu
bility of the heptahydrate is 0"33 per cent, per 1° C, that of tbe
hexahydrate is only 0 22 per cent, per 1°.
    The crosses marked R. and S. in fig.            4, at the points 0° and 20°,
correspond    to   the  values    given by     Roscoe  and Schorlemmer plotted
on the same scale.            The remaining observations of Roscoe and
Schorlemmer,        and also those of fi'tard, differ so much from ours that

 tions of Poggiale do not show the diminution of solubility above
 80° C. which fitard gives.              There is a general agreement in the
 results quoted, especially between those of Roscoe and Schorlemmer
 and Poggiale, but if the differences may be taken as indication of the
 order of accuracy attained, it is evident that the results of these
 observers could not be expected to show the critical point at 39° C.

    Finding that there was a change in the continuity of the curve
representing the temperatnre variation of the E.M.F. at temperatures
above 41° C, we decided to investigate this point more closely, although
tie temperatures in question lie beyond the range of the practical use
of Clark cells.          By a slight modification of the heating arrangements,
the  constant temperature baths were enabled to reach steady tempe
ratures up to and beyond 50° C.                  The following series of observations
»ere taken with several cells of different types, in a manner similar
to  that  which has been already described. Each line represents the
nean    of the different cells at each point. The observations given in
different lines were taken on different days, in the order in which
they are given in the table.                 An interval of several months inter

    The differences from the linear formula given     in the last column of
Table VI are shown by the crosses on the curve        in fig. 5. This figure
is plotted, as in the previous case, to exhibit not     the whole change of
the B.M.F., but only the defect of the change          from lineality.   For
 instance, at 39° C, the E.M.F. does not suddenly begin to increase,
 but continues to diminish at a slower rate.
    It  was evident    on plotting   these observations that there was a
break in the curve, and that the observations        after 41° C. belonged
to a   different branch.     To investigate this point more closely, a con
tinuous     set of readings was taken on a pair of very sensitive cells.
Starting at a temperature of 35° C, the temperature of the bath was
                                     Flo. 5.
very slowly and continuously raised by disconnecting the regulator,
and readings were taken of the temperature and E.M.F. of the cells
alternately every few minutes.        The E.M.F. of the cells was observed
to fall at a steady rate, accurately following the curve already found
for the observations at steady temperatures, until a temperature of
42"4° was reached.'        At this point there was a sudden increase of
more than 2 millivolts in the E.M.F., due to rapid crystallisation of
the hexahydrate, and in less than five minutes the cells had reached
a point on the other branch of the curve.
   After remaining at this point for some hours, the bath was slowly
and continuously cooled, observations being taken in the same manner
during the cooling.        As had been expected, the cells were found to
follow the branch of the curve shown in fig. 5, corresponding to the
solubility of the hexahydrate.       The solution remained supersaturated
with respect to the heptahydrate until a temperature of 31° was
reached, at which point the E.M.F. had fallen nearly five millivolts
below the normal.        At this point there was a sudden crystallisation
of the heptahydrate, and the E.M.F. rose in a few minutes to its
normal value.       It will be observed that the two branches of the curve

  It is now more than a year since the completion of the experiments
described in the preceding pages, and we are able to add the results
•jf      recent comparisons of the cells as evidence of the order of
      more
their permanence and reproducibility.   Of the original crystal cells,
nade more than two years ago, we still have a few remaining.     None
of the cells of this type have shown any signs of failure, in spite of
the treatment to which they have been subjected, but many of them
Lave been taken away by the students who made them.

wtainable with Clark cells set up at different times.

average change in the value of any one cell, as compared with the
 mean, may be expected not to exceed two or three hundredths         of a
 millivolt, but for longer periods, such as a year, the mean change
 reaches one-twentieth.

of  the close agreement in the temperature variation of the E.M.F.,

   It should be observed that the cells were, in most                      cases, testec
rather too soon after being sealed up.                In the course        of a week o
two, they were usually found to have settled down into                    closer agree
ment with the standard.          When kept for a longer time               than half aj
hour at 30° C, they showed a slightly greater change                      of E.M.F. a
this point.

   The    President reported that during the recess, at a Court held at
 Windsoron       July 15, 1897, he, accompanied by Sir J. Evans, Treasurer;

Gracious Majesty the loyal Address which had been approved                    by
She Fellows at their meeting of May 20, and that Her Majesty in
accepting the Address made a gracious reply.
   The Address and Royal Reply are as follows : —
                     " To  the Queen's Most Excellent   Majesty.
   "Mat      it   please   tour Majesty!
   "
      We,    your loyal and dutiful subjects, the President, Council, and
fellows     of the Royal Society of London, humbly beg leave to offer
to your Most Gracious Majesty, the beloved             Patron of our Society,
rar respectf al and sincere congratulations on the happy conclusion
of the sixtieth year of your Most Gracious             Majesty's reign, a reign
*hich has extended over a longer period than has that of any of your
Majesty's illustrious Predecessors.           Not in the number of years only
ias your       Majesty's reign surpassed all others: it has also been
marked by unexampled              prosperity and progress.       Conspicuous in
that progress,        and an acknowledged        cause of that   prosperity, has
 teen the marvellous advancement              during your Majesty's reign of
that Natural Knowledge to promote which your Majesty's illustrious
 Predecessor, King Charles II, founded the Royal Society.                   Your
 Gamble and devoted servants, the Fellows of the Royal Society, feel
 that they, in common with all men of science, have especial reason
 to rejoice in the long continuance of your Majesty's beneficent rule.

           beg your Majesty graciously to receive this token of the loyal
devotion which the men of science of this country feel towards their
 Sovereign Lady the Queen.
   " And we shall ever
                           pray that your Most Gracious Majesty may
be spared for many years to reign over your dutiful and loving;
people."
                           Her Majetty's Reply.
   " I thank you for your loyal and dutiful Address. I am much
gratified by the attachment which your ancient and learned Society
expresses to My Throne and Person.
   I am fully sensible how far the labours and ingenuity of men of
science, whom you worthily represent, have advanced the industrial
and social prosperity of My people, and have tended alike to their
good and refinement, and I confidently expect the same excellent
fruit in years to come from the indefatigable and reverent Investiga
tion of Nature for the promotion of which the Royal Society was
founded."

        Received October 26,— Read November 18, 1897.
   Last    July, M. T. Moureanx,     of the Pare Saint-Maur Observatory,
near    Paris, brought   over to  England   the travelling instruments em
ployed in his magnetic survey of France, and a comparison was made
between       these and the standard magnetic instruments at Kew
 Observatory.       At the expressed desire of the Kew Observatory Com
 mittee, I submit     on their behalf a brief account of the comparison
 »sd   its results.
    The    comparison serves to connect the standard instruments at
 Kew     Observatory with the standard French instruments at Pare
 Saint-Maur. the latter, as M. Moureanx has had the goodness to
                                                                  » 2

inform   me,  being in excellent agreement with his travelling instru
ments.     Pare Saint-Maur may be regarded as the base station for
M. Moureaux's great survey of Prance and Algeria, while Keiv
Observatory performed a similar function in the surveys of Great
Britain and Ireland, by Professor Rucker and Dr. Thorpe. The
existence of the English Channel introduces uncertainty into any
conclusions based on the trend of the magnetic lines in France and
England, and the instruments employed in the two countries are
sufficiently dissimilar to justify scepticism as to their close agreement
in the absence of direct experiment.      The interest of the comparison
is thus far from being limited to the two observatories most imme
diately concerned.
   M. Moureaux's observations at Kew Observatory occupied the
afternoon of July 2G, and the forenoons of July 27, 28, and 29.        On
the afternoons of the last three days, observations were made with
the Kew standard instruments, by Mr. T. W. Baker, chief assistant
at the Observatory.      All the observations were made in the " mag
netic house   " in the Observatoiy garden.
   The comparison was really between M. Moureaux's absolute
instruments and the Kew absolute instruments, but the observations,
being made at different hours of the day, had to be connected through
the intermediary of the enrves from the self-recording magnetic
instruments.     The elements recorded photographically are the decli
nation, horizontal force, and vertical force.     The value in magnetic
units of 1 cm. of the ordinates is known, but the value of the base lines,
answering to zero ordinates, of the several curves is to a certain
extent variable.      The usual practice at Kew Observatory is to
treat  each  month   separately, deducing the value of the base line for
any element from a comparison of the absolute ohservations for that
month with the curve ordinates at the times of the observations.
   In the case of the declination and horizontal force, the standard
ization of the enrves is comparatively simple.         In the case of the
 vertical force, the influence of temperature is unfortunately some
 what large, a rise of 1° F. equalling in effect a fall of 0*0001 C.G.S.
 unit in the vertical component.        There is also the complication
 that what    the  curve  gives  is the  vertical force, while what the
 absolute instrument gives is the inclination.
    Thus to compare inclinometers used at different hours, one has to
 follow a circuitous route by way of the horizontal and vertical com
 ponents, allowing a correction for changes of temperature in the
 magnetograph     room during the observations.
    M. Moureaux observed the inclination early, and Mr. Baker late,
 in the day, and there happened to be a slight difference in the mean
 temperature of the magnetograph room at the times of their obser
 vations.

      Comparison      of Magnetic Instruments at Kew           Observatory.        J 57
    Taking into consideration the above facts, and the further fact
 that M.      Monreanx's visit occurred at the end of a month, it was
 decided to standardise          the curves exclusively        from Mr. Baker's
 special observations, on July 27 to 29.           These gave three or more
 complete      determinations of each element, under conditions which
 might     be described, on the evidence of the curves, as an almost per
 fect  magnetic calm.
    Mr.     Baker's absolute observations and the corresponding curve
 measurements were          in good agreement, especially in the case of the
 horizontal force, where the individual calculated values for the base
liae of the curves showed no difference greater than 0 00002 C.G.S.
unit.
   Owing to the less direct method of comparing the inclinometers,
I regard the results obtained for them as somewhat less trustworthy
than    the others.
                                                                              " are to

arithmetical operations.      The Kew unifilar magnetometer reads to
 10", but with M. Moureaux's much smaller instrument readings
could not he taken to less than 30".          The great skill of the two
observers       beyond question,
                is                   and   the   mean of several results
obtained without mental bias may possess an accuracy greater than
that which any individual reading can lay claim to. Still, personally,
I  should be very sorry to claim accuracy of the order of            in the            1
last significant figure of the mean differences.
   In the use of the results, one should remember the possibility, or
rather probability, of the occurrence of change in magnetic instru
ments.    This      a vicissitude to which travelling instruments are
                     is
probably most exposed, but even in an obser/atory standard                is               it

certainly        impossible.     The  constant          appearing
factor 1— Pr~2, which allows for the departure of the horizontal
force magnet from the ideal infinitely short magnet, appears to be
to some extent variable, at least in the Kew instrument. This par
ticular variation does not necessarily affect the calculated horizontal
force, because the proper value of "
                                            " for

vations can be calculated from the experiments themselves.             This
precaution was, in reality, actually adopted in the present case.
Still the fact that a change does take place, which,           undetected,  if
would appreciably influence the results, shows that assumptions of
absolute constancy are at present acts of faith, not reason. Until
there exists a regalar system of intercomparison of the instruments
at different observatories, our information on this head       likely to be  is
limited.

     After this remark,        I   think I may safely utilise the present com
  parison to extend a table,* in which Professor Riicker and Mr. W.
  Watson embodied the results of their comparison of the standard
 instruments at various English and Irish observatories, made by
 means of travelling instruments, in 1895.                   The differences between
 the declination,       horizontal force, and inclination instruments are
 given in order, one below the other, the unit in the case of the
 horizontal force being 0-00001 C.G.S. unit.
    The table is to be read as follows : — " Standard declinometer at
 Kew reads higher than that at Pare Saint-Maur by0'5', but lower
 than that at Falmouth by 0'8','' and so on.                     The last column gives
the differences from the mean instrument, so to speak, of the five
observatories.

    The apparent        agreement between the standard instruments at
Pare Saint-Maur and Stonyhurst is noteworthy.                         The fact that the
Kew standard instruments agree so closely with the imaginary mean
instruments     was, it may be observed, not noticed by the writer until
after he   had constructed the table.               In his opinion the phenomenon
is probably     purely fortuitous.          In searching, however, for explana
tions of the discrepancies             between the several instalments, or in
attempting      to remove them, a consideration of the denartnres from
the means      might   be profitable.

     A considerable difference of opinion still exists
                                                                amongst biologists
  as to the condition  of the protoplasts of resting seeds,
                                                                    spores, &c, in
  which all ordinary signs of life
                                       may be unrecognisable for a consider
 able period.
    According to one view, the essential elements of the cell,
                                                                             during
 the period of inertness, are still
                                        undergoing feeble but imperceptible
 alteration, accompanied by gaseous
                                              exchange with the surrounding
 atmosphere ; and, even when ordinary
                                                respiration is in abeyance, it is
 assumed there are small internal
                                         changes going on, due to the inter
 action of certain constituents of the
                                             protoplasm, reactions which may
 be independent of the outside
                                      gaseous medium, and which are often
 referred to under the somewhat
                                            vague term of " intramolecular
 respiration."
    On the other hand, it is sometimes
                                               maintained that all metabolism
 is completely arrested in
                              protoplasm when in the dormant state, and
 that it then loses, for the time
                                       being, all power of internal adjust
ment to external conditions.
    According to one view, therefore, the machinery of the dormant
 protoplasts is merely "slowed down " to an
                                                         indefinite extent, whilst
according to the other it is completely brought to rest
                                                                       for a time,
to be once more set
                        going when external conditions are favourable.
    It appears to us that the advocates of the "                          "
                                                           slowing-down      hypo
thesis have scarcely given
                                  sufficient attention to the experimental
evidence available, and that
                                   they have been somewhat biassed by a
supposed analogy between the
                                      dormant state of seeds and the hiber
nating state in animals, and have also,
                                                  perhaps, been unconsciously
influenced by Mr. Herbert
                                  Spencer's well-known definition of life,
which implies a constant interna)
                                         adjustment in the living protoplasm.
    The experiments of the late G. J. Romanes,
                                                           which were described
in a short paper laid before the
                                         Society in 1893* are full of      interest
in their bearing on this
                             question.      Seeds of various plants were sub
mitted in glass tubes to high vacua of
                                               1/1000000 of an atmosphere for
a period of fifteen months.
                                   In some cases, after the seeds had been
in vacuo for three months,
                                    they were transferred to other tubes
charged respectively        with oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon
monoxide, carbon dioxide, hydrogen
                                               sulphide, aqueous vapour, and
the vapour of ether and chloroform. The results
                                                              proved that neither

     Influence   of very Low    Temperatures   on Germinative    Power.  16i
  the above gases or vapours, exercised much, if any, effect on the sub
  sequent germinative power of the seeds employed.
      These experiments of Romanes are certainly of the highest im
  portance, since the seeds were submitted for a long period to condi
  tions which must certainly have excluded anything like respiration
  by ordinary gaseous exchange, but the conditions did not preclude
  with the same certainty the possibility of chemical interactions of some
  kind or other within the protoplasm, those ill-understood changes, in
 fact, which have been referred to " intramolecular respiration." It
 is trne that in some of the experiments, notably those in which the
 vapours of chloroform and ether were employed, the probability of
 any such internal reactions is rendered somewhat remote, but still,
 in most cases, the experiments admit of the possibility of feeble
 metabolic activity continuing in the cytoplasm.
     It occurred to us, some months ago, that more evidence would
 probably be forthcoming on these points if we could submit seeds to
a temperature below that at which ordinary chemical reactions take
 place, thus eliminating any possibility of interactions between the
constituents of the protoplasm.
    Owing to the kindness of Professor Dewar, who has been good
enough to place the resources of his laboratory at our disposal, and
to undertake this part of the work for us, we have been able to
ascertain how far the subsequent germinative power of a consider
able variety of seeds is affected by prolonged exposure to the very
low temperatures produced by the slow evaporation of liquid air.
    The seeds, enclosed in thin glass tnbes, were slowly cooled, and
immersed in a vacnum-jacketted flask containing about 2 litres of the
liquid air, which was kept replenished so as to submit the seeds for
110 consecutive hours to a temperature               of from —183° C. to
 —192° C. About 10 litres of liquid air were required for the experi
ment.
    The seeds had been previously air-dried only, so contained from
about 10 to 12 per cent, of natural moisture.         After the above treat
ment they were slowly and carefully thawed, a process which occupied
about 50 hours, and their germinative power was then compared
with control experiments made on other portions of the seed which
had not been treated in any way.
    The seeds experimented on were as follows : —
          Hordeum distichon.               Trigonella fcenum-grcecum.
          Avena sativa.                   Impatiens lalsamina.
          Cucurbita Pepo.                 Helianthus annmis.
          Cyclanthera explodens.          Heracleum villosum.
          Lotus Tetragonolobus.            Convolvulus tricolor.
          Pi sura elatius.              I Funkia sieboldiana.

162                Messrs. H. T. Brown and               F. Escombe.
   These include representatives of the following natural orders : —
Graminea?, Cucurbitacero,              Leguminoseas, Geraniaceee, Compositse,
UmbelliferK', Convolvulaceas, and Liliaceae.
    Some of the seeds are endospermous, others non-endospermous,
and the reserve material consists in some cases of starch, and in
others of oil or of mucilage.
    Their germinative power, after being submitted                         to the low tem
perature, showed no appreciable difference from that of the controls,
and the resulting plants, which were in most cases grown to full
maturity, were equally healthy in the two cases.
    In 1892 Professor Dewar and Professor McKendrick found that a
temperature        of   — 182°     C. continued for one hour is insufficient to
sterilise putrescent substances such as blood, milk, flesh, &c, and
that seeds would germinate after the action of a similar temperature
for the same period of time.*
    When we commenced our experiments we were unaware that any
other observations of a similar nature had been made, but whilst they
were in progress our attention was drawn to an important memoir
by C. de Candolle.t in which the latent life of seeds is discussed in
the light of a number of low temperature experiments made princi
 pally by himself and R. Pictet, and described at intervals in the
 Geneva ' Archives. 'J In the earlier experiments of C. de Candolle
 and Pictet, made in 1879, temperatures of -39° C. to —80° G.
 were employed, and these only from two to six hours, whilst Wart-
 mann in 1881 exposed seeds for two hours to —110° C. without
 effect. In 1884 Pictet found that an exposure of various kinds of Bacte-
 riaceoe for three days to —70° C, and afterwards for a further period
 of thirty-six hours to — 120°, did not destroy their vitality, and in the
 same year       Pictet and C. de Candolle exposed seeds to —100° C. for
 four days with the same result. Pictet, in 1893, further extended
 his observations to various microbes and also to a large number of
 seeds, and claims to have cooled them down without effect tp nearly
 —200° C, but he gives no details of the experiments, nor any
 indication of the length of time during which the cooling lasted.
 His conclusions, however, are that, since all chemical action is
 annihilated at —100° C, life must be a manifestation of natural laws
 of the same type as gravitation and weight.
      In his memoir of 1895 (loc. cit.) C. de Candolle discusses very

    Influence  of very Low   Temperatures on Germinative Power.       163-
  fully whether we must regard the life of the resting seed as com
  pletely arrested for a time or merely temporarily slackened (ralentie),
 and he gives the results of some new experiments on seeds maintained
 at from — 37° C. to — 533 C. in the "snow-box" of a refrigerating
 machine for a period of 118 days. Most of the seeds resisted this
 treatment successfully, and the author concludes that after a suffi
 cient interval of time has elapsed the protoplasm of the ripe seed
passes into a state of complete inertness in which it is incapable
either of respiration or assimilation, and that whilst in this condition
it can support, without detriment to its subsequent revival, rapid
and considerable lowering of temperature.
    De Candolle then points out that if it really be a fact that the
suspended life of a resting seed is in any way dependent on respira
tion, we might expect this to be shown by submitting seeds to a
barometric vacuum for some time. He does not appear to have
followed out this suggestion, and is apparently unaware of the direct
experiments on this point carried out by Romanes two years pre
viously ; he argues, however, that if ordinary respiration is a factor
of any importance, this may be determined by immersing the seeds
in mercury for such a length of time as to ensure the complete con
sumption of the small amount of oxygen contained within their
tissues.    It was fonnd that when seeds of wheat, and of Lepidium
sativum were thus treated, for periods varying from one to three
months, their power of germination was not sensibly affected.
   Although these last described experiments of C. de Candolle go
far to show that any considerable amount of respiration is unnecessary
for the maintenance of potential life in the protoplasm of resting
seeds, they are not inconsistent with the view that some minute
amount of gaseous exchange may be going on during the whole
course of the experiment at the expense of the oxygen contained in
the seeds at the time of immersion in the mercury.           The results
would have been far more conclusive on this point if it had been
shown that the gaseous oxygen originally contained in the seed
tissue had been completely used up in an early stage of the experi
ment. The experiments of Romanes, however, conducted with high
vacua and atmospheres of various gases, leave no room for doubt on
this question, and we must consequently abandon all idea of the
dormant state of resting seeds having any necessary dependence
 whatever on ordinary respiratory processes. Neither set of experi
 ments, however, excludes the possibility of molecular interchanges
 in the protoplasm itself, such molecular transpositions in fact as those
 which can often be induced in living cells placed under anaerobic
 conditions, and which are all exothermic in character, and generally,
 but not necessarily, attended with the liberation of more or less COy
 The great value of the low temperature experiments we have described

164               Messrs. H.    T. Brown and F. Escombe.
lies in the fact that such processes of autoxidation, and in fact any
conceivable internal chemical change in the protoplasts, are rendered
impossible at temperatures of —180° C. to —190° C, and that we
must consequently regard the protoplasm in resting seeds as existing
in an absolutely inert state, devoid of any trace of metabolic activity,
and yet conserving the potentiality of life.               Such a state has been
admirably compared by C.             de   Candolle    with   that of an explosive
mixture, whose components can only react under determinate con
ditions of temperature ; as long as these conditions remain unfulfilled
the substances can remain in contact with each other for an indefinite
period without combining.
    It appears to us that the occurrence of a state of complete chemical
inertness in protoplasm,           without a necessary destruction of its
potential activity,      must  necessitate    some modification in the current
ideas of the nature of life, for this inert state can scarcely be included
in Mr. Herbert Spencer's well-known definition, which implies a
continuous adjustment of internal to external relations.* The defi
nition doubtless holds good for the ordinary kinetic state of proto
plasm, but it is not sufficiently comprehensive to include protoplasm
in the static condition in which it undoubtedly exists in resting seeds
and spores. The definition becomes in fact one of " vital activity
                                                                                      "
rather than of life.
    As it is inconceivable that the maintenance of " potential vitality "
in seeds during the exposure of more than 100 hours to a temperature
of —180° to — 190° C. can be in any way conditioned by, or correlated
with, even the feeblest continuance of metabolic activity, it becomes
difficult to see why there should be any time limit to the perfect
stability of protoplasm when once it has attained the resting state,
provided the low temperature is maintained ; in other words an
immortality of the individual protoplasts is conceivable, of quite a
different kind from that potentiality for unending life which is
manifested by the fission of unicellular organisms, and with which
Weismann has rendered us familiar.
    In what manner and to what extent " resting " protoplasm differs
from ordinary protoplasm we do not at present know, but there are
indications,     notably those afforded by the resting state of desiccated

that the author in constructing his definition had not anticipated the possibility of
a living organism attaining a state of absolutely stable equilibrium.

    In 1871, Lord Kelvin, in his Presidential Address to the British
 Association, threw out the suggestion              that the origin of life as we
 know it may have been extra-terrestrial, and due to the
                                                                        "

went investigation by M. R. Chodat, on the influence of low tempera-
feres on    Mucor mucedo.$         He found that a lowering of temperature for
*veral hours to —70° to —110° C. failed to kill young spores of the

convincing, that even the mycelium itself, when cultivated on Agar-
Agar, and whilst in active growth, is able to resist the action of these
iow   temperatures.        The author sums up his opinion as to the bearing

                                    (Abstract.)
    The fossils which form the subject of the present paper are
¦Cryptogamic strobili, showing evident Lycopodiaceous affinities, but
 differing in important points from other fructifications of that family,
 so that it appears necessary to establish a new genus for their recep
tion.
    Two species ai* described, one of which (Spencerites insignis) is
already known to us from the investigations of Williamson, who
named it first Lepidostrobus insignis, and afterwards Lepidodendron
 Spenceri,* while the other (Spencerites majusculus) is new.
    In one of his latest publications, Williamson pointed out that it
 might ultimately be necessary to make his Lepidodendron Spenceri the
type of a new genus.t The separation thus suggested is now carried
 out, on the basds of a renewed investigation of the structure of this
fossil.
    Spencerites insignis is a pedunculate strobilus ; the vegetative
organs are not as yet identified.           The specimens are calcified, and
their structure admirably preserved.
    The anatomy of the axis is of a simple Lycopodiaceous type, but
differs in details (such as the course of the leaf-trace bundles) from
that of the axis of Lepidostrobus. The peduncle bears sterile bracts,
similar to the sporophylls of the cone itself ; the latter are arranged
spirally, or in some cases in alternating verticils.
    The individual sporophylls are of peltate form, consisting of a
short cylindrical pedicel, expanding into a relatively large lamina.
The sporangia are approximately spherical bodies ; unlike those of
Lepidostrobus, they are quite free from the pedicel, and are attached
by a narrow base to the upper surface of the lamina, where it begins
to expand.
    The details of the sporangial wall are quite different from those of
Lepidostrobus, and the spores are also characteristic.             In size they
are intermediate      between the microspores            and macrospores of

                   Organization of the Fossil Plants of the Coal-measures," Parts
IX, X, XVI, and XIX, ' Phil. Trans.,' 1878,  1880, 1889, and 1893.

Lepidostrobus.       They are of tetrahedral form, becoming spheroidal
when mature,        and each spore has a hollow, annular wing running
round its    equator.       The wing is no doubt formed by a dilation of the
cuticle,* and not,       as  Williamson supposed, from the abortive sister-
cells.
    Speneerites majusculus, the new species, is much larger than the
former, the axis of the cone being twice as thick. The anatomy is
similar, but the sporophylls, and consequently the leaf-traces, are
more numerous.             The sporophylls, which are arranged in alter
nating    verticils,   are  relatively short, and of peculiar form ; the lamina
is very thick, and of great tangential width.                 The sporangia are like
those of the former species, and similarly inserted, but the spores
are quite different.         They are smaller than those of S. insignis, and
have the form of quadrants of a sphere, with narrow wings along
their three angles.
    The genus is separated from Lepidostrobus, mainly on account of
 the very different mode of insertion of the sporangia, a character
 which is accompanied by differences in the form of the sporophylls
and sporangia, the structure of the sporangial wall and of the spores,
and the whole habit of the strobilus.
    Speneerites, and especially S. insignis, bears a considerable re
semblance to the Sigillariostrobus Crepini, of Zeiller, but cannot be
united with the genus Sigillariostrobus, for the insertion of the
sporangia in the latter, as shown in the Sigillariostrobus ciliatus of
 Kidston, is totally different. The author is much indebted both to
 M. Zeiller and Mr. Kidston, for the loan of their specimens for
examination.

     Sporangia solitary on each sporophyll, inserted, by a narrow base,
 on the upper surface of the lamina, but free from the pedicel.

from the base, and PT the tangent, OM . MT = ar, O being a fixed
point in the base.        The area bounded by the curve and the base
OMT is called a normal figure. The length 2a is the parameter oi the
figure.    The definition of the curve leads at once to its projective
properties, and also to the formula for the mean value of a?i"+l or
3rnJ~2, where x denotes the distance of an element of area from the
central ordinate.
   If the normal curve or normal figure is rotated about its central
ordinate, it generates the normal surface or noi-mal solid. It is
proved geometrically that any vertical section of this solid (i.e., any
section by a plane perpendicular to its base plane) is a normal figure
of the same parameter as the central sections ; and, therefore, if the
sections   of the surface by any series of parallel vertical planes are
projected on any plane of the series, the curves so obtained are ortho
gonal projections of one another with regard to their common base.
The converse propositions are also established geometrically.
   The volume of the solid is obtained in terms of its central ordinate
and of the parameter of vertical sections; and thus it is found that
the central ordinate of a normal figure of semi-parameter unity and
area unity is 1/\/2t7-.
   Let 2 be any closed curve in the base plane. Then it is shown
how to construct a curve whose area shall be proportional to the
portion of the solid which lies vertically above 2, i.e., to the volume
which would be cut out of the solid by a cylinder having 2 for its
cross-section.      Thus, when 2 is given, this volume can be measured
mechanically.

   Let L and M denote the measures of two co-existent attributes,
Lt and M, their mean values, a' and b* the mean squares of the
respective deviations from the means, and ab cos D the mean product
of the deviations from the means. Then the angle D is called
the divergence.       The solid of frequency of (L — L|)/asin D and
(M — Mi)/6 sin D, the planes of reference being inclined at an angle D
to one another (so that the included angle is 180°— D), is called the
correlation- solid.
                                                                     0 2

     It ia shown   that, whatever the laws of distribution may he, the
 correlation-solid of the distributions of L and M is the same as that
 of the distributions of ZL-f-ntM and Z'L + wi'M, where I, m, V, m!
 are any constants whatever.
     If L  and  M are distributed "normally," and the distributions are
 independent, the correlation-solid will be a normal solid.       Hence it
 follows that the distribution of ZL + toM is also normal.
    .Galton's definition of normal correlation is adopted; his "coeffi

 correlation-solid of two normally correlated distributions is a normal
 solid, and, therefore, if the distributions of L and of M are normally
 correlated, the values of /L + mM are normally distributed, and the
 distributions of ZL + mM and of Z'L + m'M are normally correlated.
    The value of D, in a case of normal correlation, can be obtained
without calculating the means, mean squares, and mean product.          If
we find the medians L1 and Mi, and form a table of double classifica

   If we know the proportions of individuals for which L exceeds
values X and X', and the proportions for which M exceeds values Y
and Y', we can, for any particular value of D, construct an area
representing the proportion of individuals for which L lies between
X    and  X', and M between Y and Y'.       The simplest case is that in
which the distributions of     L and of M are classified in the same way,
e.g., according to the "decile" method.          The proportions of indi
viduals falling into the 100 classes corresponding to a double decile
classification are obtained by constructing a certain figure, which is
the same whatever the value of D may be, and moving the figure
through a distance equal to D/360° of its whole length. The diagram
so obtained     contains 100 areas, representing the proportions in the
100 classes in question.
   The definitions of independence and of normal correlation are ex
tended to any number of distributions, and it is shown that if the
distributions of L, M, X. . . . are normal, and either independent or
correlated, the values of ZL +     wM + nN +....are normally distri

    1.  This memoir starts with        a general theorem, by which the
probable    errors   made  in calculating   the constants of any frequency
distribution may      be  determined.     It  is shown that these probable
errors form a correlated system approximately following the normal
law of frequency, whatever be the nature of the original frequency dis
 tribution, i.e., whether it be skew or normal.          The importance of this
 result for the theory of evolution is then drawn attention to. It is
 shown that any selection, whether of size, variation, or correlation,
 will in general involve a modification not only of the size, but the
 variation and correlation of the whole complex of correlated organs.
  The subject of directed selection, of which this random selection is
  only a special case, is reserved for another memoir, nearly completed.

  Thus a random selection of size differing in its mean valuefrom (he
population mean, gives in all probability an alteration in variability,
but none in skewness.        Increased size means decreased variability.

skewness of distribution.

       5. Aualogous     results   are next    obtained   for the skew frequency
   curves :
   and
       It is shown that in these cases the mean size, variation, modal
   frequency, and skewness are in general all such that their errors are
   correlated.     Hence any selection of sizo modifies both the variation
   and skewness of the distribution. This is of considerable importance
  for the theory of evolution, as in most cases of zoological frequency
   the distribution is of tho second, or tangent curve, type.                  Hence
   random selection of size tends to modify not only variation but skew
   ness of distribution.       The results are too long to be cited, and their
  application     to special cases involves somewhat lengthy, but not
   complex arithmetic, which in practical caRes we have found much

      In previous communicationsf          I have given experimental evidence
  in favour of the view that the paired suprarenal bodies and the
  interrenal gland of Elasmobranch fishes correspond respectively to the
  medulla and cortex of the suprarenal capsules of the higher Verte-
  brata.     I have further stated, as the result of numerous experiments,
 that the medullary portion of the suprarenal appears to be absent in
 Teleosts, the suprarenal bodies in this order of fishes consisting
 solely of cortex.

           Comparative       Physiology of      the  Suprarenal Capsules.           177
 obtained from suprarenal capsnles.*              The extracts were made sepa
 rately  from    cortex and      medulla,    and    injected subcntaneously into
 various mammals.           It was noted that the injection of medullary
 material was invariably fatal if a sufficiently large dose were
 administered,      while the cortical extracts          produced     no appreciable
 physiological effects.
     In the present communication the above views have been corrobo
 rated by testing the effects of the two kinds of gland in Elasmo-
 brauchs and of the cortical snprarenals of Teleosts, when extracts of
 them are injected snbcutaneously into small mammals.                       Naturally
 only very small quantities of material have been available for this
 purpose, bnt the effects upon mice have been quite definite.
     The suprarenal bodies obtained from six specimens of Qadus
 morrhun (weighing in a moist state 0'4 gram) were extracted by
 boiling. The filtered extract was then injected beneath the skin of
 the back of a mouse. No effects whatever supervened.
     Again, the paired bodies from seven specimens of Scyllium canicula
 (weighing when moist 0'3 gram) were similarly extracted, and the
 filtrate administered to the same monse (which had remained in
 perfect health) a few days later.            The animal was immediately and
powerfnlly affected. The breathing became very rapid, the limbs
became weak, the temperature lowered, and death ensued after con
vulsions in less than five minutes.
    The interrenal gland produced no effects when similarly adminis
tered.
     [A further experiment with material obtained from Raja clarata
has been performed.           The " axillary hearts " (anterior paired bodies)
were removed from three fair-sized specimens, and found to weigh in
a moist state 0-2 gram.           The interrenal bodies were also removed,
and weighed also 0'2 gram.            Extracts were then prepared of each of
these, and injected subcutaneously into two separate mice of as
nearly as possible the same weight.               The mouse which was injected
with the extract from the paired suprarenals, was affected in a few
minutes. The respirations were very quick at first, afterwards
becoming slower and slower.             Paralysis quickly came on, first in the
hind limbs. All the four limbs were distinctly stiffened before death,
which supervened in two hours after injection.
    The other mouse, injected with extract of interrenal, died about
24 hours after injection.+ — November             15.]

   t This result must be attributed to contamination with the paired bodies, and is
analogous    to the effect one sometimes obtains upon the blood-pressure when
interrenal extract is injected intravenously.

    In    1890   I  recordedf an experiment designed to show that it is
possible to make use of the uterus of oue variety of rabbit as a
medium for the growth and complete fcetal development of fertilised
ova of another variety of rabbit.
    The experiment was further undertaken in order to determine
 what effect, if any, a uterine foster-mother would have upon her
 foster-children, aim whether or not the presence, during development,
 of foreign ova iu the uterus of a mother would affect offspring of
 that mother present in the uterus at the same time. In the experi
 ment above referred to, two fertilised ova were obtained from an
 Angora doe rabbit which had been inseminated thirty-two hours
 previously by an Angora buck, and they were inserted into the
fallopian tube of a Belgian Hare doe, which had been inseminated
 three hours before by a Duck of the same breed as herself.
    In due course the Belgian Hare doe littered six young, four of
 which were Belgian Hares, while the other two were Angoras. There
 was no trace of any cross in any of these young, the four Belgian
 Hares and the two Angoras were true bred.
    The experiment seemed to me to show, so far as a single experi
 ment could show, that a uterine foster-mother has no power of
 modifying the breed of her foster-children, and that her uterus
 during gestation and the nourishment she supplies to the embryo is
 analogous to a bed of soil with its various nutrient constituents.
    I  had hoped to follow this experiment with others on a larger scale
 the following year, but was unable to make the attempt until 1893.
  That year 1 had extraordinary bad luck with my rabbits.                        I used
 Angoras and Belgian Hares as before, and out of ten Angora does
 used, four had no ova in their fallopian tubes after being satis
 factorily covered, two had dead ova, and only four produced                        seg-

     In 1896 1 again attempted the same experiment, using this time
 Duteh and Belgian Hare rabbits; and again I failed, but from a
 different cause.    The Dutch rabbits produced segmenting ova, and
 the Belgian Hare does stood the operation perfectly satisfactorily,
 but they were bad breeders. Two of them had only one young one
 each, one had two, and one six young ones ; they were all undoubt
 edly Belgian Hares.
     These Belgian Hare does     I had kept for one, some of them for two
years,   without  allowing  them                 I
                                   to breed, and am inclined to think that
 was the reason why they were not so prolific as usual.        1 considered
 also that their disinclination to breed might operate adversely on the
foreign ova which were introduced, and so check their development.
    This year I made five experiments, using again Dutch and Belgian
Hare rabbits. The method adopted was the same as that already
described.    A Dutch doe was covered by a Dutch bnck, twenty-four
or thirty hours later a Belgian Hare doe was covered by a Belgian
 Hare buck; the Dutch doe was then killed, and segmenting ova, by
this time divided into two or four segments, were taken from her
fallopian tube and placed into the open anterior end of the fallopian
tube of the Belgian Hare doe.
    The operation is a very simple one. The Belgian Hare doe is put
under anaesthetics and stretched out on her stomach.               A longi
tudinal incision, 2 in. long, is then made through the skin at a place
1£ to 3£ in. from the anterior edge of the pelvis, and on a level with
the ventral border of the lumbar muscles.         A smaller incision is then
made through      the  body-wall just  ventral  to the lumbar muscles, and
the anterior end of the fallopian tube is readily found and pulled out
through the opening with the help of a pair of forceps. The foreign
ova are then taken out of their maternal fallopian tube on the point
of a spear-headed needle, the foster-mother's infuudibulum is held
open with a pair of forceps and the ova placed well within the
anterior end of her fallopian tube ; after pushing the latter gently
back again and washing with some antiseptic solution, the wound is
sewn up and dressed with collodion and cotton-wool.
    In one case the rabbit died under anaesthetics before the opera
tion began, from heart failure (degeneration), but in the other lour
cases the recovery was rapid and no discomfort even shown, after
the effects of the anaesthetic had worn off.
    Of these four experiments, in one case the Belgian Hare doe
proved barren; in another she gave birth to eight Belgian Hare

180     Mr. W. Heape.         On the Transplantation and Growth      of
young    ; in a third she gave birth to eleven Belgian Hare young ;
¦while in the fourih case the Belgian Hare doe gave birth to seven
young, of which five were Belgian Hares and two were apparently
Dutch.
    When the young began to run about,          I  observed that both these
Dutch young were irregularly marked, and at first I was inclined to
think it was possible, after all, either —
    (1) That the Belgian Hare foster-mother had influenced the Dutch
            fertilised ova ; or
    (2) That these two young were really a cross between Dutch and
            Belgian Hare.
    In order to test the first of these possibilities, I made the following
experiment.        I put the same Dutch buck which had been used in the
foregoing experiment, to a thorough-bred Dutch doe, and she pro
duced a litter every one of which was badly marked, most if not all
of them, were as badly marked as the Dutch foster-children, while
certain of them were even worse marked.
    This Dutch doe I bred myself ; she was one of an exceptionally good
litter, and I obtained out of her by another buck, the previous year, a
very good litter. I have no donbt the bad marking of the young in this
last litter is the fault of the buck now being used ; he is not well bred.
Dutch rabbits frequently have some badly marked young in their
litters, even when they are themselves excellently well-bred animals,
but the litter described above consists altogether of outrageously
badly marked young; in fact most of them could not be recognised
as Dutch at all, as far as their marking is concerned.
    This experiment therefore shows that the bad marking of the foster-
children can be fully accounted for by the fact that their father is
badly bred, and it is not necessary therefore to suppose that the
foster-mother is the cause of the irregularity.
    The second possibility is, however, far more difficult to test, and I
 do not hold that, under the circumstances attending my experiment,
 it is possible to determine it quite satisfactorily ; at the same time I
think a strong case of probability can be mado out.
    With regard to the possibility of getting a cross between the
 Dutch buck and the Belgian Hare foster-mother, in oonsequence of
 my experiment, it is by no means impossible this should have been
 done ; for it must be remembered that when the foreign Dutch seg
 menting ova were introduced into the fallopian tube of the Belgian
 Hare foster-mother, they were still surrounded by spermatozoa from
 the Dutch buck, spermatozoa that were still alive though perhaps
 failing in vigour; and numbers of these Dutch spermatozoa, there
 can be little doubt, were introduced into the foster-mother's fallo
 pian tube along with the Dutch fertilised ova.

           Mammalian Ova within a Uterine Foster-mother.            181
   Then again the Belgian Hare foster-mother had not ovulated when
the operation was performed ; ovulation in the rabbit does not take
place until about ten hours have elapsed after the act of coition, and
the operation was performed one hour or less after coition.
   It was quite possible then, that when ovulation did take place,
some nine hours later, some Dutch spermatozoa might still be
alive and in a condition to fertilise the Belgian Hare ova when they
were produced.
   But the Belgian Hare doe had been inseminated by a Belgian Hare
buck just before the operation ; and the spermatozoa from this buck
would arrive at the end of the fallopian tube before ovulation took
place  ; this spermatozoa would be at least twenty-four hours younger
than the foreign Dutch spermatozoa, and both more vigorous and iu
far greater numbers than the foreign spermatozoa.
   It seems to me that the possibilities are distinctly in favour of the
host of younger and more vigorous Belgian Hare spermatozoa beating
the comparatively small body of older and less vigorous foreign
Dutch spermatozoa, in the struggle for the Belgian Hare ova, but at
the same time it is possible the latter won, and that, in the case now
under consideration, these two badly marked young nre the result of
a cross between Dutch spermatozoa and Belgian Hare ova.
   The only way to test this at all seemed to be by crossing the same
Dutch buck with Belgian Hare does, and comparing the offspring of
such crosses with the young foster-children. But even this could
not be conclusive proof no matter what result was obtained, for, as
is well known to rabbit breeders, although probably the majority
 of offspring    got by crossing two distinct breeds will be of a
nondescript    character,  yet cases continually occur where apparently
thorough-bred young, of one breed or the other or perhaps of both
breeds, are produced in the same litter together with obvious cross-
breds.
    However,   I crossed this Dutch buck with two Belgian Hare does
and in the first case there were five young, one of which was Belgian
Hare purely in colour, two were coloured like a Belgian Hare with
 white spots or patches here and there, one was black with a couple
 of white spots, and one was white speckled with the characteristic
 Belgian Hare brown colour.
    In the litter out of the second Belgian Hare       doe by this same
 Dutch buck    there  were  also five young, two of which were of pure
 Belgian Hare colour, one was a light fawn colour mixed with a bluish
 dun and with one white shoulder and fore leg, a fourth was a slightly
 darker shade of the Fame colour with white fore feet, and the fifth a
 very light fawn underneath, while somewhat darker on the back and
 with white fore feet and white dash on the tail.
    None of the ten young produced in these two cross-bred litters at

 182        Transplantation and Growth     of Mammalian    Ova.
all closely resembled their Dutch father, but three of them were
apparently thorough-bred Belgian Hares ; it certainly seems that in
the case of these animals the Belgian Hare strain is mnch the
stronger of the two; at the same time the father's influence is seen
in the very general introduction of white and in the fawn and dun
colours of certain of the young.
   With regard to the foster-children, one of them unfortunately died
at an early age, but the second one lived and is now more typically
Dutch than it was when very young. It is coloured like its mother,
fawn and white, and has no trace of the blnish dun shade noticeable
here and there in its father's coat.       Its head, feet, and legs, are
remarkably like its     mother's, the  saddle  on the back is fairly well
denned, especially on one side, and the main faults are white tips
to the ears and patches of white across the fawn colour of tho back
and sides.
   In reviewing the whole question     one may  claim : —
   (1) That in two litters got by the Dutch buck out of Belgian
          Hare does, there were ten young ones, not one of which so
          nearly approaches the Dutch type as does the single Dutch
          young one borne by the Belgian Hare foster-mother.
   (2) That    the bad marking of the young got by the Dutch buck
          out of a pure-bred Dutch doe is shown to be the fault of the
          father, and that, consequently, it is not surprising his other
          offspring, the foster-child, should also be badly marked.
   (3) That the probability of the Dutch buck begetting character
          istic Dutch young when crossed with a doe of another
          species, is reduced to a minimnm ; while, on the other hand,
          the probability is increased that a young one, with such
          strongly marked Dutch characteristics as the foster-child is
          possessed of, is derived from the ovum of a Dutch mother.
  (4)  That   the chance of producing a cross-bred young one out of
         the Belgian Hare foster-mother by the help of Dutch
         spermatozoa, which was twenty-four or more hours old
         when introduced into her fallopian tube, is remote ; and is
         rendered still more improbable when it is remembered that
         fresh Belgian Hare spermatozoa in ample quantity would
         also be present.
  (5) That the similarity of the result now obtained with that
         obtained in 1890, is striking evidence in favour of my con
         tention that these experiments        present strong evidence
         towards the proof, (1) that it is possible to make use of the
         uterus of one variety of rabbit as a medium for the growth
         and complete foetal development of fertilised ova of another
         variety of rabbit ; and (2) that the uterine foster-mother

            exerts no modifying influence upon her foster-children in ro
            far as can he tested by the examination of a single
            generation.
   (6)  It  follows, if the above is true, that in case telegony be actually
            demonstrated, the characteristics            of a primary husband
            ¦which are transmitted       to the offspring got by a secondary
            husband, can only be so transmitted through the ovarian
            ova of the mother.
   Romanes,      in his work      on   'Darwin and after Darwin,' vol.          2,
pp. 146 — 148, refers to my earliest        experiment;      he thereon remarks
that rabbits when crossed in the ordinary way never throw inter
mediate characters, and that the experiment is clearly without
significance as far as it bears upon the inheritance of acquired
characters.
   Mr. Romanes       does  not give his authority for the statement that
rabbits when crossed never throw intermediate characters, and                    I
venture to think he was mistaken in his view ; that they do produce
young which are apparently pure bred of the one type or the other,
and possibly both, in the same litter is no doubt true, but it is also
true that some at any rate of the young got by crossing are of an
intermediate      character.     An examination of the litters T got by
crossing a Dutch buck with Belgian Hare does confirms this view.

    The object of the present communication is to report to the Society
further on the occurrence in so-called " voluntary " muscles of in
hibition as well as of contraction, as result of excitation of the cortex
cerebri. We have obtained by excitation of the cerebral cortex some
remarkable instances of what one of us has described* under the
name of
             " reciprocal innervation," that is, a species of co-ordinate
innervation in which the relaxation of one set of a co-ordinated
 complexus of muscle-groups occars as accompaniment of the active
 contraction of another set.
    The experiments, the subject of the present communication, have
 been carried out in the monkey (Macacus cynocephalus)                   and the
 cat.   The appropriate region of the cortex cerebri has been freely
 exposed after removal of part of the cranium and subsequent

slitting and turning aside of the dura mater. The cortex has then
been stimnlated by rapidly repeated induction shocks, obtained by
the Du Bois inductoriutn.        The Helmholtz equaliser has always
been employed.     The intensity of the faradic currents used has
been usually such as to be barely perceptible when the platinum
electrodes were applied to the tongue-tip.      The anaesthetics used
have been   either  ether  alone  or ether mixed  with chloroform in
equal volumes.    The degree of narcotisation forms an important
condition for the prosecntion of the observations. When the narcosis
is too profound the results to be recorded are much less obvious than
when the narcosis is less deep.     It is best, starting with the animal
in a condition of deep etherisation, to allow that condition gradually
to diminish.   As this is done it almost constantly happens that at a
certain stage of anaesthesia the limbs instead of hanging slack and
flaccid assume and maintain a position of flexion at certain joints,
notably at elbow and hip. This condition of tonic contraction having
been    assumed, the narcosis    is,   as   far                     par
                                                  as possible, kept at that
ticular grade of intensity.     The area of cortex cerebri previously

The result of excitation of the appropriate focus in the cortex, e.g.,
that presiding over extension of tho elbow,    an immediate relaxation
                                                         is
of the biceps, with active contraction of the triceps.  As regards the
condition of the biceps, the   relaxation     usually so striking that
                                                    is
merely to place the finger on     enough to convince the observer
                                 it    is
that the muscle relaxes. The following   however, a good mode of
                                                   is,
studying the phenomenon      :In   monkey with strongly developed
                                       a
musculature the forearm, maintained by the above-mentioned steady
tonic flexion at an angle of somewhat less than 90° with the upper
arm,   islightly supported by the one hand of the observer, while with
tho finger and thumb of the other the belly of the contracted bicepa
is  felt through the thin skin of the upper arm. On exciting the
cortex the contracted mass becomes suddenly soft — as     were melting
                                                                   it
under the observer's touch.    At tho same time the observer's hand
supporting the animal's forearm tends to be pushed down with a
force unrristakubly greater than that which the mere weight of the
limb would exert. If the triceps itself be felt at this time      easy   it   is
to perceive that     enters contraction, becoming increasingly hard

and tense, even when its points of attachment are allowed            to
approximate, and the passive tensile strain in    should diminish. If

                                                         is
at the elbow-joint.  On discontinuing the excitation of the cortex the
forearm     usually immediately, or almost immediately,             returns to its

            Antagonistic Muscles and Reciprocal Innervation.         185
 previous   posture of flexion,  ¦which is again as before steadily main
 tained.
    Conversely, when, as not nnfrequently occurs in conditions of
narcosis resembling that above referred to, the arm has assumed a
posture of extension, and this is tonic and maintained, the oppor
tunity is taken to excite the appropriate focus in the cortex, pre
viously ascertained, for flexion of forearm or upper arm. Triceps
is then found to relax, and the biceps at the same time enters into
active contraction.    If the biceps be hindered from actually moving
the arm, the prominence at the back of the upper arm due to the
contracted triceps is seen simply to sink down and become flattened.
When examined by palpation the muscle is felt to become more or
less suddenly soft, and the biceps at the same time to become tenser
than before. The movement of the limb, when allowed to proceed
nnhindered, is flexion with some supination. It is noteworthy that
in this experiment not every part of the large triceps mass becomes
relaxed; a part of the muscle which extends from humerus to the
scapula does not in this experiment relax with the rest of the muscle.
This part, if the scapula be fixed, acts as a retractor of the upper
arm, and is not necessarily an antagonist of the flexors of the elbow.
This part of the triceps we observed sometimes enter active contrac
tion at the same time as the flexors of the elbow. It should be
 remarked that under use of currents of moderate intensity we find
that not from one and the same spot in the cortex can relaxation and
contraction of a given muscle be evoked at differeno times, but that
the two effects are to be found at different, sometimes widely sepa
rate, points of the cortex, and are there found regularly.
    We have obtained analogous results in the muscles acting at the
hip-joint.     When in the narcotised animal the hip-joint is being
 maintained in flexion, the thighs being drawn up on the trunk,
excitation of the region of the cortex previously ascertained when
the limbs hang slack to evoke extension of the hip, produces relaxa
tion of the flexors of the hip and at the same time active contraction
of the extensors of the thigh.           We examined particularly the
psoas-iliacus, and the tensor fascia? femoris, also the short and long
adductor muscles. Each of these was found to relax under appro
 priate cortical excitation.    If the knee were held by the observer it
 was found at the time of relaxation of the flexors of the hip to be
 forced downward by active extension of the hip.
    Similarly with other groups of antagonistic muscles both those of
 the small apical joints of the limb, e.g., flexors and extensors of the
 digits, and those of the large proximal joints, e.g., adductors and
 abductors of the shoulder.       At these also instances of reciprocal
 innervation were obtained.
    That a part of the triceps brachii (that retracting the upper arm)

should actively contract exactly when another part (that extending
the elbow) becomes relaxed is exactly comparable with a phenomenon
which has been described by one of us in treating of spinal reflexes,
both in the triceps itself and in the quadriceps femoris.           And we
 have similarly seen in the quadriceps femoris, on exciting the cortical
region yielding extension of the hip, a relaxation of a part of the
quadriceps (a part which flexes the hip) with contraction of another
 part (which extends the knee).
     We hope, in a longer communication, in which the literature can
 be dealt    with, to give a more detailed account of other instances of
 co-ordination, in which inhibition of the contraction of the so-called
 voluntary muscles makes its appearance in result of excitation of the
 cortex cerebri. The examples cited in the present Note are evidently
 intimately related to those to which attention has been already called
 iu Second* and Third Notesf on the co-ordination of antagonistic
 muscles already presented to the Society.
                                  Addendum.
     Since the above was written, one of us (C. S. S.) has had oppor
 tunity to perform further experiments both on the monkey and the
 cat, and has carried out excitation of the fibres of the internal
 capsule, as well as excitation     of the cortex cerebri. Knowledge is at
 present completely vague as to which of the many elements in the
  cortex constitutes the locus of genesis of the reaction obtained by
  electrical stimuli applied from the cerebral surface.      It is therefore
  conceivable that the elements of the pyramidal tract are only
  mediately excited by moderate faradisation of the cortex.           If so,
  inhibitory effects produced by excitation of the cortex might likely
  enough not occur under direct excitation of the cut fibres of the
  capsula interna.
     As a matter of fact, however, the results obtained from the in
  ternal capsule have been as striking as those obtained from the
  cortex    itself.  From separate points of the cross-section of the
  capsula, relaxation of various muscles has been evoked.
     Among the muscles, inhibition of which has been directly observed,
   are supinator longus, and biceps brachii, the triceps, the deltoid, the
   extensor cruris, the hamstring group, the flexor muscles of the ankle
  joint, and the sternoinastoid.
      The spots in the cross-section of the capsula which have yielded
   the inhibitions are constant, that is, the position of each when
   observed has remained      constant    throughout the experiment.     The
   area of the capsular cross-section        at which the inhibition of the

activity of, e.g., the triceps, muscle can be evoked is separate from
(that is to say not the same as) that area whence excitation evokes
contraction of the triceps (or of that part of the iriceps, inhibition of
which is now referred to).             On the other baud, the area of the
section of the internal capsule, whence inhibition of the muscle is
elicited, corresponds with the area whence contraction of its antagon
istic muscles can be evoked.           Yet synchronous contraction of such
pairs of muscles as gastrocnemius and peroneus longus is obtainable
from the cortex.
    The observations make it clear that "reciprocal innervation" in
antagonistic muscles is obtainable by excitation of the fibres of the
internal capsule. It is probable, therefore, that the inhibition elicit-
able from the cortex cerebri is not due to an interaction of cortical
neurons one with another.          The variety of nervous reaction in which
I have been able to establish existence of the reciprocal form of
muscular co-ordination is now pretty extensive.             In some the condi
tion described in the previous (3rd) Note (the state shewn to ensue
                                                                         "

was of course not removed. The reactions examined for the pheno

                                                  matter, such as pure cultures
    (1) That finely divided tuberculous
of the bacillus, or tuberculous       matter     derived   from sputum, in day
light and in free currents of air is rapidly deprived of virulence;
     (2)  That even in the dark, although the action is retarded, fresh
air has still some disinfecting influence ; and
                                                  in confined air, the bacillus
     (3) That in the absence of air, or
retains its power for long periods       of  time.
     These  observations afforded an explanation of the immunity of
 certain places, and the danger of infection in others.                   They show
 that where tuberculous sputum is exposed             to sufficient light and air,
 to deprive it of virulence before it can be dried up and powdered into
 dust, no danger of infection need be dreaded. It would appear further,
 from this research and others, that it is only when there is sufficient
 organic material in the air, derived from impure ground air, or from
 the reek of human bodies, that the tubercle bacillus can retain its
 existence and its virulent power.        Long-lived though it may be under
 these latter conditions, it is rapidly disinfected by the natural agencies
 of fresh air and sunlight ; so rapidly that, when these agents are
                                                                   the tuberculous
 present, even in comparatively moderate degree,
  material cannot reach its dangerous state of dust before it is deprived
  of all power of doing harm.
      But, in addition to the above-mentioned researches, it seemed
  desirable that an attempt should be made to ascertain what part was
  played respectively   by the several forms of organic impurity that are
  present in insanitary dwellings.
                                            Hitherto, so far as         I  know, no
  attempt has been    made,  in  the laboratory      or elsewhere,    to  imitate  the
  actual conditions that prevail       in   such    houses.     It was   determined,
  therefore, to collect the aqueous vapours arising from the ground or
  from human bodies, and to submit these products to the test of trying
  whether they would serve as cultivating media for the bacillus of
  tubercle.
      Many years ago in   a research, the      particulars of which are given in
  an appendix to my treatise on
                                      " Stethometry,"         I  examined the'eon-
   densed aqueous vapour of the breath, in health and disease, and
  ascertained the quantity of organic matter that it contained.                   The
  breath of fifteen healthy    persons   and    of  twenty-seven     cases  of disease
   was examined chemically by Wanklyn's method of water analysis,
   and microscopically.     The fact of chief importance obtained was, that
   every specimen contained a small, but appreciable, quantity of both
   free and organic ammonia.         The quantity from the cases of disease
   varied considerably,   but   that  from healthy persons was remarkably
   constant, varying from 0 325 milligram to 0 45 per 100 minims of

                  the  Cultivation of     the   Bacillus   of Tubercle.             180
the fluid collected, the average being 0'4.                  Hence, by calculation,
we obtain the rough estimate that about 3 grs. of organic matter is
given off from a man's lungs in the course of twenty-four hours.
Doubtless a very small amount, but sufficient to render the aqueous
vapour thus thrown off more impure than most sewage water, and
ample in quantity, to foster the growth of organic germs.
   It was the result of this research that induced me to try to culti
vate the bacillus of tubercle upon these and similar organic fluids,
such as were likely to be met with in dwelling-houses.
   By means of a simple freezing mixture of ice and salt it was easy
to condense the aqueous vapour, both of the breath and that coming
from ground air; and, in order to make the inquiry more complete,
the vapour of the breath was collected in a flask, surrounded by this
mixture, from both healthy and diseased sources. In other words,
both healthy persons and those affected by phthisis were prevailed
upon to breathe into the flask, until a sufficient quantity of aqueous
fluid had been obtained.
   With another apparatus, consisting of a framework supporting
beakers containing freezing mixture, collections of aqueous fluid
                                                "
were obtained from " ground air coming from a wine cellar in a
gravelly subsoil, and from cellars under several low-lying, unsanitary
cottages in Southampton.               Some of the moisture from a weaving-
shed in Blackburn was also thus collected and used as a culti
vating medium.             The composition of these latter fluids is given

and were         then used, in various         ways,    for the cultivation of the
bacillus of tubercle.*
     Two well-grown specimens of pure cultivations were obtained
 (both through Dr. Childs), one (A) from the Institute of Preventive
Medicine, the other (B) from a private source, but the latter specimen
could     not be guaranted as human bacillus,              it was therefore labelled
as of    doubtful origin, and the cultivations made with it were kept
separate.
     In order to test the activity of these cultures they were each, in
the first instance, sown upon (a) sterilised blood-serum, and (6) upon
" glycerine
                  agar peptone," as these media were known to be the best
for cultivating purposes, and the results could then with advantage
be compared with those from the other materials used.
     Both specimens were found to be capable of active growth, though
the cultivation (A) was somewhat tardy.

     It was then thought well, in the first instance, to attempt to culti
vate the bacillus upon media, on which it grows with difficulty, with
out the presence of added peptones ; in other words, to find out
whether the presence of the condensed organic fluids from the sources
that have been mentioned would replace the peptones.
     Accordingly, simple agar jelly, with 6 per cent, of glycerine, was
made with each of the fluids mentioned, after careful sterilisation.

were soaked in the fluids and inoculated and similarly disposed of.
   As a control experiment, the agar jelly was made with simple
distilled water and glycerine, charged and disposed of in the same
way.
   The results of these several experiments are shown on the two fol
lowing tables. It will be observed that, out of the eighteen speci
mens, only two (two of those from the impure cellars) failed to
produce growth to some extent ; those that did best were the fluids
from the cellar in porous soil, and those condensed from the breath
of phthisical patients.          But all kinds of organic fluid showed growth
on either agar jelly or potato.

    There is thus some evidence that the organic fluids facilitated
 cultivation to some extent ; experienced bacteriologists, who have
 attempted to use simple potato or glycerine agar as the cultivating
 medium, have assured me that failure is much more common than
 success, and that the growth, when it does take place, is usually very
 slow.     With the organic fluids there were only two failures, and
 growth was fairly rapid.

   In the next series of trials, it was decided to                use as the material
bases some     no a -nitrogenous      substance,      and attempts were made to
employ pieces of wood, cork, cotton-woo), and fine spun glass, the
last named at the suggestion of a distinguished bacteriologist.                   None
of these bases were found to be satisfactory; and at length it was
determined to use a particularly pure " filter-paper," manufactured
by Messrs. Schleicher and Schiill, from which even the salts had
been extracted by washing                  with hydrochloric and hydrofluoric
acids.*    This paper was folded in a convenient form, sterilised,
inserted in the test-tubes, and charged with the several organic fluids,
to which, as before, 6 per cent, of pure glycerine had been added.
It was then inoculated, stoppered as before, and in the first trials
these tubos were placed         in the incubator at the usual temperature of
35° C.
    The results are shown on Table V.
   It will be seen that some degree of success was attained in twolve
out of fifteen specimens of the organic fluids.                The degree of growth
was also much the same as in the previous series, though perhaps
slightly less vigorous.

194              Dr. A. Ransome.       On certain Media  for
    It  was now    determined to try to do without the help of the
glycerine, which, as is well known, so greatly assists the ordinary
cultivations of the bacillus.      Accordingly, four tubes with simple
filter-paper  as the  supporting medium,   and condensed fluids, from the
breath of a healthy person, and from that of a phthisical pntient, as
nutrient fluids, were inoculated, and no glycerine was added. In
these tubes the same cultivation was used as in      the previous experi
ments.
    Shortly afterwards, two similar tubes with        fluid from healthy
breath alone, but with 5 per cent, of glycerine,     were sown with the
pime cultivation, and were left at the ordinary       temperature of the
laboratory, about 21° C. (see Table VI).
    All of the former group took on active growth within four weeks,
and one of the latter.       In other words, it was proved that pure
filter-paper, moistened with these condensed fluids, alone would
suffice to nourish and promote the growth of the bacillus, and,
further, that this growth would take place at ordinary temperatures.
It may henco be concluded that when this organic fluid is present in
ordinary dwellings, the bacillus may grow at the temperature of
living rooms as well as at the temperature of 35° C.
    In September,    1896, another  attempt to test this point was made
by inoculating a dozen more tubes in which the various condensed
fluids were employed as nutrients.       Some of thorn were placed in the
incubator, the others being placed outside.
    In this series, however, a sub-culture on agar peptone, taken from
the old Preventive Institute tube, was used as the seed ; and it was
soon evident that this sub-culture had greatly declined in vigour.
For three months no perceptible growth took place on any of the
specimens, and then only on phthisical breath to a very slight
extent.     Although they mnst be counted for the most part as
failures, the results of the inoculations are given in Table VI.
    In consequence of this failure in vigour of the last used cultivation,
n fresh series of eight tubes was commenced on October         31 with the
same cultivation, which also failed.
    Then, in February, 1897, through the kindness of Dr. Childs and
of Dr. Curtis, a fresh tube of apparently vigorous cultivation of the
tubercle bacillus, guaranteed to be of human origin, was obtained
from University College, London.
    By way of control, this culture was sown upon blood sorum and
upon agar peptone, and incubated at 37° C, and a copious growth
was found to be commencing on the blood serum within ten days
time (see Table IX).
    Two sets of tubes were then prepared of condensed vapour from
breath, and from ground air from a pure sandy soil.           No glycerine
 was added; but for the solid medium, in some instances, the pure

               the Cultivation of    the Bacillus of Tubercle.                199
    It will be seen that in many of the tabes a free growth was
observed as early as the end of the first fortnight.
    Out of the total number in this series of 37, in thirty-six instances
there was free growth on the medium employed, on both kinds of
paper, and all kinds of condensed fluid.         Eleven of them were grown
at a temperature of about 20° C. In only one instance was there
complete failure (vapour from healthy breath).
    Most of these tubes have been left intact, in order that they may be
inspected ; but six of them were removed, stained, and examined
microscopically, in order to determine whether they were true
cultures ; this they proved to be.
    Two of the cultures, after two months' growth, were sent away to
be inoculated into guinea-pigs, but both they and the original culture
were found to be non-virulent.*
                           Microscopic Examination.
    Nearly all the earlier cultures, in which theTe appeared to have
been any growth, were submitted to microscopical examination.                   In
 all the specimens in which this examination did not show distinct
 signs of growth the result was put down as "nil," even though a
 small number of bacilli might have been found.                These few bacilli
 might    have  come  from  the  inoculation.    It   was  not difficult to recog
 nise the abundant growth of a true cultivation.
     These examinations, however, gave remarkable results in a large
 number of the specimens grown upon paper. Many of the bacilli
 were gigantic in size, and a considerable number of them showed
 distinct branching.       Others were knobbed at one end or at both
 ends, when they looked like miniature "life preservers."                In many
 of the specimens the culture seemed to have penetrated into the sub
 stance of the paper.
     The bearing of these researches upon the subject of the prophyl
 axis against tuberculosis seems to be of some importance.
     They prove that any one of the various organically charged vapours,
 whether coming from healthy or from diseased lungs, from the air of
  cellars, or from comparatively pnre ground, forms an excellent culti
 vating medium for the bacillus of tubercle when kept away from the
  disinfecting influence of air and light.
     This power of promoting its growth is particularly manifest when
  the supporting substance is common wall-paper, though it is quite
  apparent when very pure filter-paper is used.
     It is further proved that, on these substances, the growth of the
  bacillus may take place at the ordinary temperatures of dwelling-
    * A further research, with cultures of the bacillus of undoubted Tirulence, has
  now been undertaken.

their virulence.
" Summary of Professor Edgeworth David's Preliminary Report
       on the Results of the Boring in the Atoll of Funafuti."
       Communicated by Professor T. G. BOXNEY, F.R.S., Vice-
       Chairman of the Coral Reef Boring Committee.              Received
       November 25, — Read November 25, 1807.
    The boring at Funafuti, according to the latest advices, had reached
a depth    of 643 feet.    Professor David's report is transcribed from
notes made during the progress of the work, and gives his first im
pressions of the materials brought up, down to a depth of 557 fept,
which had been reached when he quitted the island to return to his
duties at. Sydney, leaving the work in charge of his assistant.        The
 latest advices informed him that the boring was arrested at 643 feet,
 but as it was hoped this was only for a time, we are daily expecting
 to hear yet more gratifying news. His last letters, received during
the present week, give a few particulars of the materials pierced
between 557 and 643 feet. The work, Professor David states, often pre
sented mostserious difficulties, which would probably have frustrated
their efforts, but for the experience gained on the former occasion.
    The bore hole is situated about half a mile N.E. of the Mission
 Church, and its height above 'sea level is about 1 foot above high
 water mark at spring tides.        The diameter is 5 inches down to
 68 feet; it is lined with 5-inch tubing down to 118 feet, and 4-inch
from surface to 520 feet, so that on September 6 a 4-inch core was
being obtained.
    The following is   a general  description of the materials pierced  : —
For about     a yard at the top there was a hard coral breccia.       This
was    followed   down    to  a depth  of  40 feet by  "coral  reef rock,"
into the composition of which Heliopora eerulea, with spines of
 eohinids and nullipores, entered largely, the last predominating over
the coral at from 15 to 20 feet. From 40 to 200 feet came more or
less sandy material, but with a variable quantity of corals.         These
were scattered through the sand (calcareous and of organic origin ;
foraminifera, at about 40 feet, making from one-half to two-thirds of
the   whole) sometimes as fragments (forming occasionally a kind
of rubble), but sometimes in the position of growth.              Between
120 and      130   feet, and from    about 190 to 200 feet, the material

               Report on the Boring in   the Atoll of Funafuti.        201
 is described as fairly compact coral rock, so that very probably reefs
 in situ, though of no great thickness, were pierced at these depths.
 The sand appears to be largely derived from coral, bnt foraminifera
 occur, sometimes in abundance; so too do nullipores, and here and
 there spines of echinids.    Towards 150 feet signs of change begin
 to appear in the corals, and these become more conspicuous as the
 boring approaches its greatest depth. In such case, if I understand
 rightly, some of the branching corals crumble away and are repre
 sented only by casts, while others remain, the surrounding matrix
 becoming solid, cemented apparently by calcite.         Below 202 feet a
 decided change takes place in the character of the deposit. All
above this seems to be largely composed of material derived from
corals, with occasional rather brief interludes of true reef, and this
 mass, measuring, as said above, rather over 200 feet in thickness,
 may be termed the first or uppermost formation. Below this, down to
 about 373 feet, sandy material distinctly dominates, which sometimes is
 almost a calcareous mud. Still even there coral fragments and rubble
 occasionally appear, and now and then a few isolated corals. Other
organisms may be detected, including nullipores, foraminifera, and
mollusca; but until this material has been examined microscopically,
it would be premature to attempt any precise statement. This mass,
in thickness about 170 feet, may be termed the second or middle
formation. It is not reef, though obviously produced in the vicinity
of a reef. Below 370 feet is the third or lowest zone ; in this beds
composed of broken coral become frequent, which are intercalated
with masses of dead coral, though sandy bands also occur. The
character of the material suggests that it has been formed in the
immediate vicinity of a reef, which has occasionally grown out
laterally, though only for a time, and has built up a layer of true
reef, from 2 to 3 feet in thickness, upon a mass of detrital coral.
In one place the rock is specially noted as " hard," and hereabouts
even the shells of gasteropods have perfshed, only their casts remain
ing. From 526 to 555 feet the bore passed through fairly compact
and (in places) very dense and hard "coral limestone" and " cav
ernous coral rock." in which dendroid forms were numerous.             As
i-egards   the   part between  557  feet  and 643  feet only  brief infor
mation is to hand, but Prof essor David states that it is reported to be
chiefly coral limestone, hard and dense, with occasional soft bands of
coral sand or coral rubble.      Thus the third, or lowest zone, about
270 feet in thickness, corresponds apparently with the first, but it
seems to contain larger and more numerous masses of true reef.
   Professor David has also forwarded with his latest letters a section
of the boring and of the exterior form of the island, down to about
730 fathoms : the one drawn from his notebook, the other from
 Captain Field's record of soundings.         From this I gather the

following particulars : — The borehole     roughly speaking, rather
                                           is,
over 100 yards from the margin of the ocean, and about 165
yards from that of the lagoon     ;   it     about 240 yards from
                                            is
the spot where a sounding of 10 fathoms was obtained, nearly
400 yards from a 36-fathom sounding, and rather more than a
quarter of a mile from one of 130 fathoms.       After this the sub
marine slope, for a  considerable depth,    not quite so steep.
                                            is                    He
also states that, at Funafuti, the vigorous growing portion of the
reef appeared to be limited to within about 40 feet of the surface.
   It would be premature, as Professor David remarks, to express an
opinion as to the theoretical bearing of these results until the core
has been thoroughly studied.     But two things seem clear, (1) that
true reef has been pierced at depths down to more than 600 feet,
and (2) that throughout the whole of the time represented by the
mass which has now been tested, coral must have grown in great
abundance in some part or other of the locality now represented by
Funafuti for the atoll,
         ;               it  must bo remembered,      surrounded by

from any other coralliferous locality.

     The observations here recorded were carried out by the method
 and with the apparatus described in a former paper,* to which
 reference must be made for details.           It must suffice to say that the
 globe containing the gas to be weighed was filled at 0° C, and to a
 pressure determined by a manometric gauge.                 This pressure, nearly
 atmospheric,     is  slightly  variable   with     temperature on account of
 the expansion of the mercury and iron involved.                       The actually
 observed weights are corrected so as to correspond with a tempera
 ture of 15° C. of the gauge, as well as for the errors in the platinum
 and brass weights employed.             In the present, as well as in the
 former, experiments        I  havo been ably assisted by 5Ir. George
 Gordon.
                                 Carbonic Oxide.
    This gas was prepared by three methods.                In the first method a
flask, sealed to the rest of the apparatus, was charged with 80 grams
recrystallised ferrocyanidc of potassium and 360 c.c. strong sulphuric
acid.    The generation of gas could bo started by the application of
heat, and with caro it could be checked and finally stopped by the
removal of the flame with subsequent application, if necessary-, of
 wet cotton wool to the exterior of the flask.           In this way one charge
could    be  utilised with great advantage for several fillings. On
leaving   the  flask the gas was passed through a bubbler containing
potash solution (convenient as allowing the rate of production to bo
more easily estimated) and thence through tubes charged with frag
ments of potash and phosphoric anhydride, all connected by sealing.
When possible, the weight of the globe full was compared with the
mean of the preceding and following weights empty.                     Four experi
ments were made with results agreeing to within a few tenths of a
milligram.
    In the second set of experiments              the flask was charged with
100 grams      of oxalic acid and 500 c.c. strong sulphuric acid. To
absorb the large quantity of C02 simultaneously evolved a plentiful

supply of alkali was required.                  A wash-bottle and a long nearly
horizontal tube contained strong alkaline solution, and these were
followed by the tubes containing solid potash and phosphoric anhyd
ride as before.
     For the experiments of the third set oxalic acid was replaced by
formic, which is more convenient as not entailing the absorption of
 large volumes of C02. In this case the charge consisted of 50 grams
 fonnate of soda, 300 c.c. strong sulphuric acid, and 150 c.c. distilled
 water.       The water is necessary in order to prevent action in the
 cold, and the amount requires to be somewhat carefully adjusted.
 As purifiers, the long horizontal bubbler was retained and the tubes
 charged with solid potash and phosphoric anhydride.                         In this set
 there were four concordant experiments.                     The immediate results
 .stand thus     : —

  This corresponds to the number 2'62704 for oxygen,* and is subject
  to    a correction (additive) of 0'00056 for the diminution of the
  external volume of the globe when exhausted.
     The ratio of the densities of carbonic oxide and oxygen is thus
  2-29906 : 2'62760 ; so that if the density of oxygen be taken as 32,
  that of carbonic oxide will be 27'9989.                   If, as some preliminary
  experiments by Dr. Scott f indicate, equal volumes may be taken as
  accurately representative of CO and of Os, the atomic weight of
  carbon will be 1T9989 on the scale of oxygen = 16.
     The very close agreement between the weights of carbonic oxide
  prepared in three different ways is some guarantee against the
  presence of an impurity of widely differing density.                     On the other
  hand, some careful experiments led Mr. T. W. RichardsJ to the
  copclusion that carbonic oxide is liable to contain considerable quan
  tities of hydrogen or of hydrocarbons.                  From 5^ litres of carbonic
  oxide passed over hot cupric oxide he collected no less than 25 milli
  grams of water, and the evidence appeared to prove that the hydrogen
  was really derived from the carbonic oxide.                   Such a proportion of
  hydrogen would entail a deficiency in the weight of the globe of
  about 11 milligrams, and seems improbable                     in view of the good
  agreement of the numbers recorded.                    The presence of so much

206           Lord Kayleigli.         On the Densities     of Carbonic
hydrogen in carbonic oxide is also difficult to reconcile with the well-
known experiments of Professor Dixon, who found that prolonged
treatment with phosphoric anhydride was required in order to render
the mixture of carbonic oxide and oxygen inexplosive.                       In the
presence     of  relatively large    quantities    of free  hydrogen    (or hydro
carbons) why should traces of water vapour be so important ?
    In an experiment by Dr. Scott,* 4 litres of carbon monoxide gave
only 1'3 milligrams to the drying tube after oxidation.
    I have myself made several trials of the same sort with gas pre
pared from formate of soda exactly as for weighing.                    The results
were not so concordant as I had hoped,t but the amount of water
collected was even less than that given by Dr. Scott.                 Indeed, I do
not regard as proved the presence of hydrogen at all in the gas that
I  have employed.     J
                                Carbonic Anhydride.
   This gas was prepared from hydrochloric acid and marble, and
after passing a bubbler charged with a solution of carbonate of soda,
                                                '
was dried by phosphoric anhydride.                Previous to use, the acid was
caused to boil for some time by the passage of hydrochloric acid
vapour from a flask containing another charge of the acid. In a
second set of experiments the marble was replaced by a solution of
carbonate of soda. There is no appreciable difference between the
results obtained in the two ways ; and the mean, corrected for the
errors of weights and for the shrinkage of the globe when exhausted,
is 3 6349, corresponding to 2'6276 for oxygen.               The temperature at
which the globe was charged was 0°             C,   and the actual pressure that
of the manometric gauge at about 20°, reduction being made to 15°
by the use of Boyle's law. From the former paper it appears that the
actual height of the mercury column at 15° is 762'511 mm.

    In preliminary experiments the gas was prepared in the labora
tory, at as low a temperature as possible, from nitrate of ammonia,
or was drawn from the iron bottles in which it is commercially sup
plied.     The purification was by passage over potash and phosphoric
anhydride.       Unless special precautions are taken the gas so obtained
is ten or more milligrams too light, presumably             from admixture with

   t  One obstacle was the difficulty of re-oxidising the copper reduced by carbonic
oxide.   I have never encountered this difficulty after reduction by hydrogen.
   X In Mr. Richards' work the gas in an imperfectly dried condition was treated
with hot platinum black. Is it possible that the hydrogen was introduced at this
stage ?

nitrogen.    In the   case  of the commercial supply, a better result is
obtained by placing the bottles in an inverted position so as to draw
from the liquid rather than from the gaseous portion.
    Higher and more consistent results were arrived at from gas which
had been specially treated.         In consequence of the high relative-
solubility of nitrons oxide in water, the gas held in solution after
prolonged agitation of the liquid with impure gas from any supply,
will contain a much diminished proportion of nitrogen.                      To carry
out this method on the scale required, a large (11-litre) flask was
mounted on an apparatus in connection with the lathe so that it
could be vigorously shaken.          After the dissolved air had been suffi
ciently expelled by preliminary passage of N20, the water was cooled
to near 0° C. and violently shaken for a considerable time while the
gas was passing in large excess.          The nitrous oxide thus purified was
 expelled from solution by heat, and was used to fill the globe in the
 usual manner.
    For comparison with the results so obtained, gas purified in another
 manner was also examined.          A small iron bottle, fully charged with
 the commercial material, was cooled in salt and ice and allowed
 somewhat suddenly to blow off half its contents.               The residue drawn
 from the bottle     in   one or other position was employed for the
 weighings.

 The mean value may be taken to represent the corrected weight of
 the gas which fills the globe at 0° C. and at the pressure of the gauge
 (at 15°), corresponding to 2 6276 for oxygen.
     One of the objects which     I  had in view in determining the density
 of nitrous oxide was to obtain, if it were possible, evidence as to the
 atomic weight of nitrogen.       It may be remembered that observations
 upon the density of pure nitrogen, as distinguished from the atmo
 spheric mixture containing argon which, until recently, had been
 confounded with pure nitrogen, led* to the conclusion that the densi
 ties of oxygen and nitrogen were as 16           :  14"003, thus suggesting       that
  the  atomic weight of nitrogen might really be 14 in place of 14'05,
  as generally received.     The chemical evidence upon which the latter
  number rests is very indirect, and it appeared that a direct compari-

                                       Phil. Trans.,' vol. 186, p. 190, 1895.

208             On the Densities  of Carbonic Oxide, §c.
son  of the weight of nitrous oxide and of its contained nitrogen
might be of value. A suitable vessel would be filled, under known
conditions, with the nitrous oxide, which would then be submitted to
the action of a spiral of copper or iron wire rendered incandescent
by an electric current.      When all the oxygen was removed, the
residual nitrogen would be measured, from which the ratio of equi
valents could readily be deduced. The fact that the residual nitrogen
would possess nearly the same volume as the nitrous oxide from
which it was derived would present certain experimental advantages.
If indeed the atomic weights were really as 14 : 16, the ratio (x) of
volumes, after and before operations, would be given by
                            2 2996 X x         14
                        30359— z2996xa;        8

                            11x2*996
3"6359 and 2'2996 being the relative weights of nitrous oxide and
of nitrogen which (at 0° C. and at the pressure of the gauge) occupy
the same volume.       The integral numbers for the atomic weights
would thus correspond to an expansion, after chemical reduction, of
about- one-half per cent.
   But in practical operation the method lost most of its apparent
simplicity. It was found that copper became unmanageable at a
temperature sufficiently high for the purpose, and recourse was had
to iron. Coils of iron suitably prepared and supported could be
adequately heated by the current from a dynamo without twisting
hopelessly out of shape ; but the use of iron leads to fresh difficulties.
The emission of carbonic oxide from the iron heated in vacuum
continues for a very long time, and the attempt to get rid of this gas
by preliminary treatment had to be abandoned.       By final addition of
a small quantity of oxygen (obtained by heating some permanganate
of potash sealed up in one of the leading tubes) the CO could be
oxidised to C02, and thus, along with any H20, be absorbed by a
lump of potash placed beforehand in the working vessel. To get
rid of superfluous oxygen, a coil of incandescent copper had then to
be invoked, and thus the apparatus became rather complicated.
   It is believed that the difficulties thus far mentioned were over
come, but nevertheless a satisfactory concordance in the final num
bers was not attained.     In the present position of the question no
results are of value which do not discriminate with certainty between
14*05 and 14'00.     The obstacle appeared to lie in a tendency of the
nitrogen to pass to higher degrees of oxidation.    On more than one
occasion mercury (which formed the movable boundary of an overflow
chamber) was observed to be attacked.       Under these circumstances

    The former part of this paper deals with solutions of Laplace's
 differential equations for the tides symmetrical with respect to the
 axis of rotation. In the present part the restriction of symmetry is
 no longer imposed, and a general solution is sought, the law of depth
 of the ocean, however, being limited to the case which will admit
 of both the interior and exterior surfaces being regarded as spheroids
 of revolution. It is found that, subject to this limitation, if the
 solution sought represent a simple harmonic motion of any period
 whatsoever, and the height of the surface-waves be expressible as an
 infinite series of tesseral harmonics of the same rank but different
 orders, a linear relation connecting three successive coefficients of
 the series can be deduced similar to that obtained in Part I.f
    From this relation a period-equation for the free vibrations is
 deduced, and a method of determining approximate values of the

higher roots is given.  The earlier roots are examined numerically,
and tabulated for four different depths of the ocean for the types
involving tesseral harmonics of rank 1 and 2, these types presenting
special interest in connection with the diurnal and semi-diurnal
forced tides respectively.
   The types of free oscillation are found to be of two classes, dis
tinguishable by their limiting forms when the rotation-period is
indefinitely prolonged. In the former class the motion remains oscil
latory when the period of rotation becomes infinitely long, while in
                        "
the latter the " speed     of the oscillation always bears a finite
ratio to the angular velocity of rotation, so that the oscillation will
be replaced by a steady motion when the angular velocity of rotation
is reduced to zero.
   In dealing with the forced oscillations, the theorem of Laplace
that in an ocean of uniform depth there will be no diurnal rise and
fall at the surface is obtained and generalised as follows : — In an
ocean of uniform depth the tides due to a disturbing potential of
degree s +¦1 and rank s will involve no rise and fall at the surface if
the period of the disturbing force be ^(s + l) sidereal days.
  A     theorem given by Professor Darwin with reference to the
expression  of the semi-diurnal tides in finite terms, as also Laplace's
solution of the problem of the diurnal tides in an ocean of variable
depth, is found to admit of similar generalisation.
   Tho general problem of the forced tides due to any disturbing
force derivable from a potential function in the cases where infinite
series are required for the solution is treated analytically, and is
further illustrated by numerical examples typical of the leading
tidal  constituents which occur on the earth, the results where
possible being compared with those obtained by other methods.

  The            investigation, which has been carried out in the
              present
Physical Laboratory of the Owens College, Manchester, was under
taken at Professor Schuster's suggestion with the object of ascertain
ing what kinds of iron and steel are least liable to a change of
magnetic intensity under moderate fluctuations of temperature.
   Specimens of steels containing severally tungsten, manganese,
cobalt, and nickel, also cast irons, of different blends of pig irons, and

                    independent    of Changes of Temperature.                     211
of different percentages of carbon, were procured from a number of
different English and Scotch firms. The size of these specimens was
in general about 15 cm. long and 1 or 2 thick, but as it was not
uniform the dimensions and weight in grams of eacli are given in
the accompanying table, columns I, II, and III.
    In column IV has been entered the dimension ratio, i.e., the ratio
of the length to the diameter or breadth, so that a comparison may
more consistently be made of the magnetic behaviour of any two
specimens.        For thin rods, Cancani* finds that increase of this ratio
tends to diminish the temperature coefficient of a magnet.
    The course of an experiment was as follows: — The rod or bar in
its normal state, or after being hardened or annealed as occasion
required, was magnetised between the poles of a powerful electro
magnet excited by a battery of twenty-six storage cells. The magnet
was then fixed rigidly in a horizontal tube, through which a stream of
cold water and steam could be alternately passed.                The tube and its
contents were placed at a convenient distance from a sensitive dead-
beat    magnetometer       and at      right angles to the magnetic meridian.
The deflections of the magnetometer needle were read by the usual
mirror and scale, the distance of the scale from the mirror being
1 metre, and from the readings were               deduced directly the tempera
ture coefficient and the total irreversible loss of magnetism.                 As the
deflections were never more thau a few degrees of arc the angles an'1,
their tangents were virtually equivalent.              The intensity of magneti
sation in C.G.S. units or magnetic moment per unit volume, although
not necessarily required, was approximately determined from the
formula

in which the earth's horizontal force, H, was considered throughout
as constant      and equal to 018 C.G.S. unit and also a, the density,
was uniformly taken to be 7-8 ; m signifies the mass in grams ; d the
distance from the centre of the magnet to the magnetometer needle ;
I the half length of the magnet, and 0 the deflection.
    The process of heating and cooling the magnet was continued until
the intensity fluctuated between two nearly constant values corre
sponding to the temperatures of the cold water and steam. Tho
coefficient a given in the eighth column was then calculated by
inserting these values in the equation
                                ltl = I, (l — a.7^i).\

    Each number in the first column represents a separate piece of
 iron or steel, but where comparative tests of the same material were
 desired, as, for example, in the cast irons, when either annealed or
 hardened, the precaution was taken to employ two pieces of origin
 ally a single rod. Thus Nos. 15 and 16 are two parts of the same
 rod cut through the middle, and similarly with Nos. 17 and 18 and
 others.
    In the first place, several varieties of steels were tested.            No. 1 is
 a steel   from Sheffield, supplied specially for making magnets ; Nos.
 2 and 3 are Hadfield's well-known non-magnetic                    steel ; the next
 four are tungsten steels, of which Nos. 6 and 7 are known as Mushet's
 self-hardening steel, having the property of hardening even when
 cooled slowly. These were both cut from the same rod; No. 6 was

  214        Mr.  J. R. Ashworth.       Methods     of making Magnets
  magnetised at the air temperature ; No. 7 was made red Lot and
  allowed to cool whilst in the magnetic field.              No. 8, a specimen of
  cobalt steel, was kindly supplied by Mr. Hadfield, and is probably
  unique.     All of these and the first example of nickel steel, No. 9 on
  the list, are Sheffield steels.
     Attention was then directed chiefly to three classes : Nickel steels,
  cast irons, and steel pianoforte wires.
     Nickel Steels. — The first of these, No. 9, is a crucible steel from
  Sheffield, containing 3 per cent, of nickel and about 0'45 per cent, of
 carbon.     The next two are from Scotland.                They contain 2-4 per
 cent, of nickel and 019 per cent, of carbon.              Nos. 12, 13, and 14 are
 also from Scotland, and contain 3 per cent, and 27 per cent, of nickel.
 They were kindly supplied by Mr. Riley, of the Glasgow Iron and
 Steel Company.       The behaviour of the last three was remarkable, as
 when hardened they exhibited a small, negative coefficient.                   On
 heating and cooling they continuously lost magnetism for the first
 three alternations ; at the fourth and fifth heating and cooling there
 was hardly any change of intensity ; afterwards a small increase of
 intensity with rise of temperature and decrease with fall of tem
 perature regularly took place.          In the specimen containing 3 per
 cent, of nickel these operations caused a total loss of no less than 50
 per cent, of the original magnetic intensity.               This same piece was
 then annealed and magnetised ; the coefficient was now positive, the
 intensity rather higher, and the total loss 30 per cent. On re-
 hardening the events first described were reproduced, the negative
 coefficient and large total loss being almost exactly as before.            It is
 very likely that by carefully adjusting the degree of hardness in this
 kind of steel a zero coefficient could be obtained.
    The 27 per cent, nickel alloys, after hardening in cold water, became
 almost non-magnetic, as discovered by Dr. John Hopkinson,* and it
 was only in this state that they were tested.            No. 13 was magnetised
 nt the air temperature; No. 14 at —16°. All the other examples of
 nickel steels had positive coefficients.
    Cast Irons. — Specimens of grey cast iron, as used for general castings
made at different times and of different blends of pig irons behaved
very similarly.      Magnetised as supplied they did not take a high
intensity,   lost  permanently 30 to 40 per cent, of their magnetism,
and had a large temperature coefficient.                  When hardened their
magnetic properties were very different ; the intensity was then com
parable with that of tungsten steel, the total loss only about 15 per
cent., and the temperature coefficient as low as, or lower than, the
best examples of hardened steels.           In three different kinds of care
fully hardened cast-iron magnets it was from O'OOOie to 0 00018 per
degree centigrade.      The average value for steel magnets of a similar
                   * Hopkinson, '

size tested at the Kew Observatory is given by Whipple as 0 00029.*
The change of intensity with temperature is almost strictly linear in
these cast-iron magnets, and they are very constant when subjected
to   blows and shocks.
   Pianoforte Wire.
                    — Lengths of 12 cm. each were cut from a coil of
wire, and tested after various treatments.   Magnetised in the normal
state this material unexpectedly gave    a negative coefficient. When
heated to bright redness and chilled rapidly or slowly the coefficient
became positive.
   As it was thus possible to change the sign of the coefficient, an
attempt was made to find the particular temper which would give a
zero coefficient. Lengths of the wire were heated severally in oil to
200° and 260°, and in air to a temperature producing a film of oxide,
and rapidly chilled in water.   The coefficient still remained negative,
and of nearly the same magnitude.    But when heated to dull redness
and quenched, the coefficient was very nearly reduced to zero.
Heated to higher temperatures and quenched, the coefficient became
positive.

     It
      is a curious coincidence that the intensity of magnetisation
attains a maximum for the condition producing minimum tempera
ture coefficient, and this maximum has the exceptionally high value
of 892 C.G.S. units.

216           Mr.    J.   K. Ashworth.          Methods           of making Magnets
intense hardness.     In contrast with this it may be mentioned that
music wires are not at all hard, being easily touched with a file.
   In order to gain further insight into the cause of the negative
coefficient in these wires, some experiments were made to test the effect
of removing successively the outer layers of the wires by dissolving
them in nitric acid.  This revealed the important relation that the
coefficient became more negative as the diameter became less, the
length remaining               the same, that is to say, as the dimension                        ratio
increased.
   To verify this carefully a series of stout music wires of different
thicknesses, but in other respects as uniform as possible, were pro
cured from a manufacturer at Warrington, to whom I am also
indebted       for kindly supplying other samples                           of steel    wire. The
results of these experiments are most conveniently                                     exhibited in
tabular form, and are here annexed.

other respects) the coefficients become progressively more negative
as the dimension ratio increases.   The increasing product of the co
efficient into the diameter  shows  that the coefficient changes more
rapidly than the dimension ratio. The table also shows the regular
diminution of the permanent loss,      and increase of intensity as the
                                                   /3,
dimension ratio increases, relations which hold in further experiments
of the same kind to be described later on.
   Several of these wires after being thus tested were dissolved in
nitric acid, and the temperature coefficient determined at successive
stages of the process without any remagnctisation of the wire.      The
results of No. 33 alone are here given, as they sufficiently exemplify
what generally takes place under these circumstances.      The negative
character of the coefficient progt-esively increases  with  increase of
dimension ratio, and at    rather greater rate as in Table III.

layer the intensity rises to 478, which in its tarn       reduced by                                                   is

intensity to 475, and so on. The recovery of magnetic intensity
after dissolving in acid     most likely to be ascribed to diminution of
                                                         is
the self-demagnetising     force resulting from increase of dimension
ratio.    The intensities, however, after each dissolving, namely 478,
475, 486, are sufficiently constant to indicate that the intensity                                                                                   is
nearly uniform throughout the wire, and this confirms an experi
ment of Bouty's.f
   The next two wires have been grouped in a separate table from the
 others, as they came from a different factory, being made in
 Sheffield.  They are thicker than the former wires, and the thicker
of the two, No. 34, has now a positive coefficient.      By continually
reducing the diameter of this wire, the coefficient ultimately changes
sign and becomes negative.

    And it may be calculated that if No. 34 had just been dissolved so
far as to have a dimension ratio of about 110 to 115, it would have
exhibited a zero coefficient.           Since the former series of wires with
dimension ratios of this magnitude would have had large negative
coefficients, there must be some important physical or chemical
differences between these and the former wires influencing the
character of the coefficient.
     To complete the series of experiments on the influence of the di
mension ratio it was desirable to perform the converse operation and
to prove that an originally negative coefficient would become positive
by increase of thickness.
     Three pieces, (a), (6), (c), of No. 33 wire were cut from the same
coil, each 12 cm. long, magnetised and then heated and cooled sepa
rately in the same way. The coefficient was about — O000119 for each,
 (a) and (6) were then bound together with fine copper wire, like poles
being in contiguity ; the coefficient as now determined was almost
zero. The piece (c) was then joined in the same manner to its two
fellows and the coefficient again determined ; it was now + O000105.
The experiment is conclusive, for it is allowable to regard bundles
of wires as rods of equivalent cross section.*
    Wires drawn to different thicknesses are not structurally suffi
ciently identical to allow of strictly comparable magnetic results.
It is therefore more satisfactory to vary the dimension ratio by
altering the length and keeping the diameter constant.                       A series of
tests were conducted in this way.                  Lengths of 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and
18 cm. of No. 30 wire were cut from the same coil, separately
magnetised, and the coefficient of each veiy carefully determined.
Table VI gives a complete view of the results.

     The coefficient  changes from positive to negative between the
  lengths 6 and 9 cm.     And hence if the change between these points
  is nearly linear, a length of abont 8 cm. should have a zero coeffi
 cient, and it might also be calculated that the permanent loss
  would be 0"262.     A fresh length of exactly 8 cm. was cut from the
 same   coil of wire and was found to have a coefficient of — 0'000015,
 and a permanent loss of 0'281.       A piece of this wire, a very little
 less than 8 cm. long, would without doubt, have a strictly zero
 coefficient.
    There are thus two practicable ways of obtaining zero tempera
ture coefficients, either (1) by altering the hardness, or (2) by
altering the dimension ratio ; and the latter may be effected by
varying the diameter for a constant length, or the length for a con
stant diameter as may be the more convenient.            In addition, the
material of which the magnet is made must have certain chemical
and physical properties, not yet determined, of which, as far as some
experiments     I  have made can decide, the physical rather than the
chemical properties are the more important.
    Some of the results in Tables IV, V, and VI are here plotted as
curves and exhibit interesting features.
    The curve of the relation of coefficient to dimension ratio (diameter
constant) from the data of Table VI, Diagram I, curve (1), has a
double inflexion     between which   it crosses the axis of  abscissae  and
at either  end apparently approaches to horizontal asymptotes.         This
curve is probably typical of the behaviour of music wires.

zero coefficients in Jane, 1896, and since then had been lying on a
shelf, and in the vicinity of other magnets, when tested nine months
later, had not altered so much as to have a coefficient of practical

       ber 1, Read December 9, 1897.
                                (Abstract.)
    In this paper an account is given of determinations of the electric
conductivity of nitric acid of percentage concentrations varying
from 1'8 to 99-97, purified, so far as possible, from reduction
products of the acid, as also from sulphuric and the halogen acids,
with which it is likely to be contaminated from its process of manu
facture.    In the preliminary experiments it was observed that the
results might be vitiated by (i) a trace of nitrous acid either directly
added or produced by decomposition due to exposure to sunlight, and
 (ii) imperfect insulation of the electrolytic cell caused by metallic
clamps, a point which seems to have been neglected by previous
observers.
    The methods adopted for the purification of the water and nitric
acid, as also for the detection and estimation of the impurities, are
 described in full. The greatest quantity of nitrous acid, sulphuric
acid, and the halogen acids found in any sample used were 0*75, 4-3,
and 3 8 parts per million respectively.
     The thermometers, resistance coils, and other instruments used
 were compared with certain standards and corrected accordingly ;
 the burettes and electrolytic cells were calibrated by one or more
 methods, and the mean of the values accepted.
     The method adopted for the determinations        was  in outline that
 originally  described by  Kohlrausch,   but modified so   as to overcome
 certain difficulties experienced.     A particular form     of bridge was
 constructed, in which the wire was an air line, and a      special form of
 slider adopted to tap without sagging the wire, so arranged that it
 conld be moved by the observer from the extremity of the bridge,
 and thus all thermo-currents due to his proximity were avoided.

224             The Electric Conductivity  of Nitric Acid.
    A rapidly revolving commutator was substituted for the usual
induction coil, as the latter was found to be unsatisfactory owing to
the susceptibility of nitric acid to polarisation.
    Various forms of electrolytic cells were used according to the con
centration of the acid and the temperature of the observations ; these
were provided with movable electrodes, so as to throw into circuit
different lengths of acid.
    A special form of apparatus was devised to prepare nitric acid of
99'88 per cent., and another form to obtain acid of 99-97 per cent,
from the latter.      As a considerable quantity of this practically
anhydrous acid was obtained, its chemical and certain physical pro
perties were examined.       It has no action on (i) copper, (ii) silver,
 (iii) cadmium, and (iv) mercury, all of high degree of purity, and
(v) commercial magnesinm, at ordinary temperatures ; purified iron
and commercial granulated tin were unaffected by the acid, even
when boiling.      Purified zinc was slightly acted upon, but sodium
immediately caught fire.       The acid has no action whatever on
calcium carbonate      at ordinary temperatures or the boiling point.
Flowers of sulphur and iron pyrites dissolve quickly and completely
in the gently warmed acid. The following results were obtained
for the density of the 99'97 per cent, acid, corrected for weighings in
vacuo   : —
      Density 4/4 = 154212;     14 2/4 = 1-52234; 242/4 = 150394,
the mean values of two concordant      observations.
    As a further check upon the measurements obtained by the
 Kohlrausch method, certain other measurements were made by
Carey Poster's method for the comparison of resistances, and the
results obtained were found to be concordant within the limits of
experimental error. In a series of tables the values are given for
thirty-two samples of acid of the specific resistance in true ohms at
temperatnres of 0C, 15°, and 30°, the temperature coefficients alO4
and /310* deduced from the equation R< = R„(l +at—fi?), as also for
 KoXlO8, KuXlO*, and KjoXIO9 (the conductivity of mercury at 0
 being taken as unity, and its specific resistance as 94'07 microhms
per   1  c.c).
    It  is shown that the specific resistance decreases for percentage
 concentrations   from l-30 to 30, at first more, then less rapidly
 (thus confirming the previous observations of Kohlrausch) ; from
 this point the resistance increases slowly up to 76 per cent., thence
 more rapidly until a maximum is reached at 96°12 per cent., when a
 sudden reversal takes place.
     Further, whereas nitric acid behaves as other electrolytes in pos
 sessing a positive temperature coefficient of conductivity for percent
 age concentrations from 1°3 to 96°12, yet from this point up to

          Refractivities of Air,    Oxygen, Nitrogen, Argon, fyc.         225
9997 per cent, it behaves as a metallic            conductor in possessing a
negative temperature coefficient.
   Similar phenomena have been observed by Arrhenius in the             cases
of moderately dilute solutions of hypophosphorous and phosphoric
acids, and explained by him by means of the ionic dissociation
hypothesis. It is pointed out that nitric acid of 96 — 99'97 per cent,
would ex hypothesi contain few, if any, free ions, and therefore the
theory would lead to a totally opposite conclusion.
   The results of the experiments are also discussed in relation to the
hydrate theory of solution, and the illustrative curves in which the
percentages of acid are taken as abscissae and the resistances or con
ductivities in mercury units show points of discontinuity markedly
at percentages corresponding         approximately to the composition
required for the hydrates HN03,2HaO, HNO„H,0, 2HNO„H,0
(= H4N,07), and less markedly for the hydrate HNO3,10H2O.
Farther, if the values of % x 10* and j3 X 10" are referred to molecular
proportions of water, the minima values of the former and the
maxima of the latter occur in the cases of 3 07, 1'84, 0-99, and 055
molecular proportions or very approximately HN03,3HaO,HN03,2H,0,
HN03,HjO, and 2HNOs,H,0.            Further evidence is thus added by an
independent method to that already accumulated as to the existence
of definite combination of nitric acid with water.             Finally, it is
pointed out that if a curve is plotted out in which the molecular
proportions of water are taken as absciss® and the values for a 10* as
ordinates, there are ascending and descending branches, meeting at
the points corresponding to the formation of the respective hydrates ;
the phenomena are compared with those observed by Bakhuis-
Roozeboom for the solubility curves of hydrates of ferric chloride
and by Le Chatelier, as also by Heycock and Neville for the freezing
point of alloys.

  In the course of a research on the nature of helium many measure
ments of its refractivity referred to that of air as unity were made
by means of an apparatus similar to that described by Lord Bayleigh.*
Inasmuch as the refractivity of helium is very small it was not found
convenient    to measure    its value directly against air ; hence it was
compared     with hydrogen, and hydrogen was compared with air.

And as a check on these measurements, the hydrogen was compared
with oxygen and subsequently with nitrogen free from argon. It
was noticed, after some of these experiments had been made, that the
refractivity of air could not be accurately calculated from the given
data for oxygen, nitrogen, and argon ; and it appeared therefore
worth while to examine more minutely the refractivity of these gases
for white light, and to see whether any error could be detected in
previous measurements.        Moreover, as physicists perhaps do not
always devote sufficient care to the chemical purity of their mate
rials, an additional reason was furnished for the inquiry.
    Apparatus. — It will be seen, on consulting Lord Rayleigh's paper,
that the refractivity is measured in the following manner : — Light
from a paraffin lamp passes through a fine slit, cut with a razor in
tin-foil pasted on glass.     The beam is made parallel by passage
through an achromatic plano-convex lens of about 1 foot focal
length.    It then divides; the upper portion passes through air, and,
after extraneous light is cut off by passage through two wide slits, it
is bronght to a focus by a lens similar to the first, and the bands
produced are viewed by a cylindrical lens of very short focus.      The
lower portion of the beam traverses two tubes, 9 inches long and one-
quarter of an inch in diameter, placed close together, and closed at
each end with plates of optically worked glass.     Each of these tabes
contains one of the gases to be examined ; and each is connected with
 a manometer and a movable reservoir ; so that, on raising or lower
 ing the reservoir, the pressure of the gases can be so adjusted that
 the interference- bauds formed in the lower half of the field can be
 accurately brought into line with the stationary bands in the upper
 half. Readings of pressure are taken on both manometers at pres
 sures not differing greatly from that of the atmosphere ; then, on
 lowering the reservoirs, readings on both manometers are taken at
 lower pressures, the bands being again made to coincide in position
 with the upper fiducial bands. The ratio of the refractivities is
 inversely as the differences of pressure in the two gases.      The in
 fluence of temperature does not appear, for the tubes of the mano
 meter lie side by side, and may be regarded as equally affected by
 variations of temperature.
     The accuracy of this method varies with the value of the refrac
 tivity of the gas. For, if the gas has a low refractivity, then a great
 difference of pressure produces the passage of fewer bands across the
 field than if it has a high one ; and, as the accuracy of reading may
 safely be taken as the twenty-fifth of a band, and as between thirty
 and forty bands passed the field with such gases as oxygen, nitrogen,
 and argon, the error may be taken in such cases as from 1 in 750 to
  1 in 1000.
     The tubes   containing the   gases to be examined were connected

         Refractivities of Air,  Oxygen, Nitrogen, Argon, §c.        227
with a Topler's pump ; and before admission of gas each tube was
pumped     empty, so that in an attached Pliicker's tube there was
brilliant phosphorescence. The tubes were then washed out with
the gases to be admitted, the apparatus again evacuated, and the
final quantity of gas allowed to enter by a contrivance a description
of which is to be found in the ' Trans. Chem. Soc.,' vol. 67, p. 686.
   Purity of the Oases. Hydrogen. — The hydrogen was made by
warming a tube containing palladium-hydrogen which had been pre
pared by admitting hydrogen made from pure zinc and sulphuric
acid into contact with spongy palladium. Tho tube was pumped
empty in the cold, and then gently warmed ; it was again allowed to
cool and again pumped empty.           The hydrogen was then collected,
passing slowly through a tube, filled with phosphoric anhydride, into
the experimental tube.
   Oxygen. — The oxygen was prepared by heating a small tube con
taining potassium permanganate; a large quantity of gas was allowed
to escape, and a portion was collected finally which served for the
experiments.
   Nitrogen. — The nitrogen was prepared from a mixture of am
monium chloride and sodium nitrite, to which a little copper
sulphate had been added.         The apparatus was exhausted before
admission of either of the solutions, and before allowing the soln-      •
tions to enter they were boiled, and the flasks corked while boiling.
The gas was passed over red-hot copper ; the ammonia liberated by
the alkalinity of the nitrite thus reacted with any oxides of nitrogen
possibly present to form water.       The gas was collected, after rejec
tion of a considerable portion, in a tube containing oil of vitriol ; it
was then transferred to a fresh tube, treated with a very strong solu
tion of caustic potash, and finally admitted to the apparatus.
   Air. — The air was left standing for some hours in a tube con
taining sticks of caustic potash, and was then admitted to the appa
ratus through a tube of phosphoric anhydride.
   Experimental Data. — Each gas was compared with air and with
 the other two.   Air is in each case taken as unity.

   To these numbers those for argon must be added. The gas was pre
pared in the nsual manner from air ; and before admitting it into the
experimental tube it was sparked with oxygen in presence of caustic
soda for two days. The oxygen was removed with phosphorus, and the
argon, on its way into the experimental tube, passed over phosphorus
pentoxide ; a Pliicker's tube was sealed to the tube through which it
entered, so that its spectrum might be observed.                 It contained no

    It  will   be seen  on inspecting       the above table that the numbers
obtained indirectly are in close agreement with those obtained by
direct comparison with air.
    Taking the value found directly by Mascart for D*, viz. (n— 1)D =
O0002923, the value found by him for nitrogen (atmospheric) was
O'0O02972, giving for nitrogen, on the basis air equal to unity, the
number T0178. Mascart did not determine the value for oxygen,
but calculated it from the above data and the known composition of
air. Nor did Lorenz determine the value for nitrogen ; but taking
his own value for oxygen, viz. (n— 1)D = 0 000272, and for air (n— 1)D
 = 0 000291, he deduced it, as Mascart had done for oxygen. So
 that we have no determination of the three constants, or their com
parison, by any one observer since Dnlong in 1826. It has been
tacitly assumed that the refractive index for a mixture of gases is
 that of those of their consitaents, taken in the proportion in which
 they occur. We have in our hands a means of verifying this
 assumption, which is well known not to hold for compound gases,
 nor for mixtures of liquids, even though change of density be taken
 into consideration.
     Dulongf gives very careful accounts of the methods he used in
 preparing the samples of gas that he employed. Oxygen, to which
 he ascribed the refractivity 0-924, was obtained by heating potassium
 chlorate.      His result is identical with ours. Nitrogen was prepared
 from air by absorbing the oxygen with phosphorus, first at a high
 temperature and then in the cold.              It was then washed with a solu
  tion of chlorine, and afterwards with potash. It is difficult to sec
  what object was to be gained by washing with chlorine water, unless
  it was the removal of hydrogen.             The number he obtained was 1'02,
  somewhat higher than that which we have found.                         Dulong also
  determined the refractivity of air, and allowing for that of the small
  percentage of carbon dioxide, it is precisely the mean of that of its
  constituents, taken in the proportion in which they are present.
     Returning to the results of Mascart and Lorenz, we have for the
  D lines : —

   From these data of Mascart and Lorenz it is possible to calculate the
  refractivity of air : —
                   (10178 x 791) + (0-9347 x 209) = 10015.
  There is reason to doubt the purity of Lorenz's oxygen.                   Ho heated

mercuric oxide, of which      he does not give the method          of preparation :
it may have contained oxides of nitrogen            ; and for some reason, not
explained, he passed the gas through a vacuous porcelain tube, pre
sumably red-hot, which, as recent experiments of Messrs. Bone and
Jerdan have shown,* is not impervious to furnace gases.                    Dulong,

numbers : —
      (10163 x 7815) + (09243 x 2091) + (09596 x 094) = 99653.
   Observers   sometimes     find the percentage of oxygen in air to be
about 20'98, or even 21-0. This would hardly affect the result ; with
20-96 per cent, of oxygen the calculated refractivity is 99-647, instead
of 99 G53.
   There can be no doubt as to the refractivity of oxygen from our
ratios, as well as from Dulong's determinations.              The question is as
regards nitrogen.     It would require the refractivity of nitrogen to be
1-208, a number     greatly above any of our values, in order that the
sum of the refractivities of oxygen, nitrogen, and argon should equal
100.    The presence of argon would also make an almost inappreciable
difference.    Taking Mascart's determination of the refractivity of
atmospheric nitrogen to be correct, that of pure nitrogen would be
1*0181, instead of 1*0178.        And an error in the refractivity of argon
would also not affect the result, inasmuch as the total amount of
argon is so small.
   We are thus driven to conclude that the refractivity of the
mixture, air, is somewhat less than that of the sum of the refrac
tivities of its constituents, taken in the proportion in which they
occur.
   It  appeared advisable to try other mixtures ; and a mixture of
hydrogen and helium was first selected, because these are both very
" perfect " gases, inasmuch as their critical points lie very low. It
was to be expected that if a difference between calculated and found
values should exist, it should be of the inverse character to that of a

   Here the calculated value of the refractivity of the mixture is
3 per cent, higher than the found value, while with air the calcu
lated value is 0'35 per cent, too low.
   A third experiment was made, in which the " artificial air " was a
mixture of 19'13 c.c. of carbon dioxide with 19-29 c.c. of oxygen,
 both gases supposed to be at 0° and 760 mm. Again, taking the
refractivity of the mixture as unity we found the following ratios : —

   Here, as with air, the total refractivity found is less than that
calculated.    It is true the difference is not great, but we are per
suaded that it is real, for it considerably exceeds the error of our
several determinations.
   The case is not bettered    if Lorentz and Lorenz's formula       be  substi
tuted for Gladstone and Dale's.         Using their formula, ?ia— l/w'+2,
 the calculated result is 9972 per    cent,  of that found for air.
    The coefficient of compressibility of hydrogen is too small, while
 that of other gases, such    as oxygen and nitrogen,       is too great.   The

 232               Mr. E.   J.  Bles.    On tlie Openings in the
effect of mixing equal volnmes of hydrogen and helium, each of
 which has too large a coefficient of elasticity, is to cause each to
occupy twice the volume that they previously occupied, and to halve
 approximately      the pressure for each.          The pressure is therefore
 lower   than   it would     be  for  an   absolutely ideal gas, for each gas,
 hydrogen and helium.           The sum of these pressures will accordingly
 be too low, or transposing, the sum of the volumes will be too great.
 The opposite argument holds for air.
    Now, in considering volumes we deal not merely with the co- volume,
i.e., the space    occupied by the molecules, but also with the inter
stitial space inhabited by the molecules. But the refractive power,
if Clausius's deduction from the formula of Lorenz and Lorentz is
correct, is a function of the dielectric constant, and hence of the
co-volumes of the gases.          And here the discrepancy is more easily
detected than by any determination of density.             It must therefore be
concluded     that  gases  are  not,  as  postulated by   Dalton, indifferent to
one another's presence, but that they modify one another's properties
in the same manner as do liquids, though to a different extent. This
mutual action at high pressures and small volumes modifies even the
volume relations, as recently shown by Dr. Kuenen. And it must
persist at low pressures and large volumes, though it may not always
be possible to make measurements of pressure and volume accurate
enough to lead to its detection.          The refractivity, however, seems to
be a   means   delicate   enough   to  be  used for this purpose.
" On the Openings in the Wall of the Body-cavity of Verte
       brates."      By Edward J. Bles, B.Sc. (Lond.), King's
       College, Cambridge.           Communicated by Dr. HANS Gadow,
       F.R.S. Received June 16, — Read June 17, 1897.
   In  the review of the vertebrates held in the following pages, I have
                                      I
put together as many facts as could ascertain on the distribution of
abdominal pores in the various groups, and side by side with this
evidence   I  have arranged the available facts recorded by others, and
observed by myself, on the distribution of nephrostomes and other
openings on the wall of the abdominal cavity.
   By so doing, the physiological meaning of the abdominal pores has,
I  believe, been elucidated through the evidence of a correlation, speak
ing generally, of an alternative character, between these two sets of
organs.     It will further appear that in most of the higher vertebrates
— where abdominal pores do not occur and nephrostomes disappear
early in development or lose their original connection with the renal
ducts— the body-cavity has taken upon itself a different functional
character.     Instead of acting as auxiliary to the excretory organs, it
takes part in the internal work of the circulatory lymphatic system.

                    Wall of   the   Body-cavity    of   Vertebrates.               233
   The greater part of the information on the openings from the
perivisceral cavity to the exterior in the Elasmobranchii is contained
in two papers ; one by Semper,* on the urogenital system of Plagio-
stomes, the other, by Bridge, on " Pori Abdominales of Vertebrata."f
Semper describes the persistence in certain Elasmobranchs                         of a
number of open segmental funnels on the peritoneal epithelium
leading into the Malpighian bodies of the mesonephros. Such funnels
occur in all Elasmobranch embryos, but usually close during develop
ment.      Semper gives lists of species with and without nephrostomies
when adult, and shows that their presence cannot be correlated with
the presence or absence of other organs, among which he did not,
however, refer to the abdominal pores. Bridge was the first to
examine a number of Elasmobranchs expressly to determine the
distribution of abdominal pores amongst the species of these fishes.
 He states that it was " not clear that the presence or absence of the
pores can be correlated with structural variations in other organs."
 I was led to compare Semper's and Bridge's accounts of the distribu
tion of nephrostomes and abdominal pores, and it at once became
 evident that their presence in Elasmobranchs was, to a certain extent,
reciprocal. A few discrepancies which appeared have been investi
gated, and my results, although they agree in the main with Bridge's,
differ from his in one or two important cases.                A detailed discussion
of these cases will appear elsewhere.

both nephrostomes and abdominal pores. It includes all the species
investigated by Semper, excepting Lamna giauca, M. and H., and
Teniera hardieickii, Gray. In these two species the nephrostomes
close, and it may be expected that they will eventually be found to
possess abdominal pores.

234                Mr.   E.   J. Bles.      On the Openings      in the
placed together under A, and the species without them together
under B. The species under B all possess abdominal pores.                      Under
A, on the other hand, there is no such uniformity as regards the
pores. We have here a fairly complete series of species ; beginning
with forms without abdominal pores like Cestracion, passing to forms
like Scy. stellate, which acquire pores late in life and may occasion
ally fail to do so ; we then come to the Scy. canicula group, where
pores are found at the stage of sexual maturity, but where they may
be acquired still later or sometimes not at all ; and, lastly, there is a
fourth group, that of Acanthias vulgaris, where the pores appear at
an early age, towards the end of embryonic life, and seem to be
invariably present.           These four groups            have one character      in
common : the nephrostomies remain open in the adult.                         In this
they differ from the species under B, which close the nephrostomes
early in development, and then, like Group 4 of Series A, and like
wise at an early age (Carcharias during foetal life), open abdominal
pores.
   To some of the species in Table I no place in Table                    II  can be
assigned until more specimens of different ages have been examined.
   It is sufficiently obvious from the list of species in Series B of
Table   II  that abdominal pores are distributed without reference to
oviparity or viviparity.

   The most obvious of the facts                   brought      into prominence         by the
above tables are the following: —
   1.   The Elasmobranch             fishes when      adult have       a peritoneal cavity
           which in every            known       instance     communicates          with the
           exterior.
   2.   This communication            is established in several ways: —
              (a) Through nephrostomes and urinary canals ;
              (I) More directly, through abdominal pores ; but
              (r) Both communications may exist together in the same
                         individual.
   3.   Disregarding for the moment the eight                      species   which, roughly
           speaking, possess both sets of openings, there remain twenty-
           eight species in which a correlation of an alternative nature

                   Wall of     the  Body-cavity of Vertebrates.                        237
          exists between the         renal communications            on the one hand
          and the      abdominal      pores on the          other.    There are four
          species with persistent        nephrostomes and practically without
          abdominal      pores, and      twenty-four species with abdominal
          pores which lose the nephrostomes very early in develop
          ment.
   4. The Batoidei and the Carchariidse are characterised                           by the
          absence in the adult of open nephrostomes and the presence
          of abdominal      pores.
   In the above statements no account has been taken of the third
channel of communication            present in all female Elasmobranchs, that
practicable through the oviduct after the disappearance of the
hymen.
   The relations thus brought to light afford a fairly complete account
of   the distribution of both nephrostomes and abdominal                              pores
amongst adult Elasmobranchs.               The total number of species             (thirty-
six)  from  which    these  conclusions     have been drawn is somewhat small
when compared with the number of species on record in this group,
viz., more than 300. The families of the group are, however, all repre
sented, with the exception of the Rhinodontidaa, the Pristiophoridse,
and the Pristidse, in which nothing is known of the nephrostomes ;
      I
but found abdominal pores in a species from each of the Selachian
and Batoid families of Sawfishes.              It follows then that with the two
species referred to and six additional species from various families
of Selachians known to possess abdominal pores,* there are forty-four
species in which the abdominal cavity is known to communicate with
the exterior, and not one in which this cavity is shut off from such
communication. So that we may extend the generalisations arrived
at from the discussion of the material here brought together to the
whole of the Elasmobranchii.               It may hence be concluded that the
body cavity of adult Elasmobranchs is never completely enclosed by
the peritoneum ; it always communicates with the exterior, the com
munication being effected in various ways, as shown above.
   The distribution of species with nephrostomes and of species with
out them in the Elasmobranchii is clearly shown in Table I. The
                                                                             '
scheme of classification adopted is from Dr. Giinther's                        Catalogue
                                           '
ot Fishes in the British Museum (published in 1870).
    A glance at Table I shows that the Carchariidse all close the
segmental tubes, three species of Scyliidoo retain them, four, prob
ably five, species of Spinacidee do the same; also two species of
   * These eight species are : — Prisiis zysron, Blkr., Pristiophorus     cirratut, Lath.,
 Eckinorhinut tpinotu*, dm.,     Lcemargus   borealis, Scoresb., CKlamydoselaehta     angui.
 neus, Garm., Zygana    tudet,   Cuv., Carcharias     melanopteru*,  Q. and    Gk, and  Car-

238             Mr. E.  J.  Bles.    On the Openings in the
Notidanidre   do so ; while   all the Batoidei lose the peritoneal nephri-
dial openings.    Thns the classification here employed is in harmony
with the distribution of nephrostomes in adult Elasmobranchs.
   Table III. — In this table I have placed, side by side, the data
respecting the distribution of nephrostomes and of abdominal pores
in all the Vertebrates not yet dealt with, excluding the Cyclostomes.
The latter are omitted on account of the great probability that the
so-called abdominal pores of Cyclostomes are genital ducts, morpho
logically as well as functionally, and hence quite distinct from true
abdominal pores, which are never used as genital ducts.
   The fishes in which the ova when mature fall into the general body
cavity usually have abdominal pores ; this applies to certain Elas
mobranchs, the Holocephala, most Ganoids, some Dipnoi, and to some
Salmonidse.     But there are exceptions, as we have seen, amongst the
Elasmobranchs    ; some    Salmonidas have no pores, and other Teleos-
teans with the primitive form of ovary have none, e.g., Muranidas,
Gralaxidse, &c.   Then, on the other hand, there are fishes with tubu
lar closed ovaries forming a continuous tube with the oviducts and
with a lumen quite distinct from the body-cavity, as it is in the
majority of Teleosteans, yet the body-cavity is, nevertheless, open to
the exterior through abdominal pores.        Lepidosteus osseiis is in this
condition, and, amongst Teleosteans, the Mormyridse.             It follows
that there is no correlation between the condition of the ovary and
the occurrence of abdominal pores.
    It is noteworthy that in the Amphibia alone, amongst the Verte
brates ranking higher than Elasmobranchs,           do the nephrostomes
persist in the adult, and that the abdominal pores are entirely absent.
This is the more striking, since the abdominal pores reappear in
 Reptiles, in the absence of nephrostomes.
    Equally important, from the present point of view, is the change
 of function of the nephrostomes within the group Amphibia.          In the
 Gymnophiona and Urodela the original excretory function is served ;
 but in Anura, where the lymphatic system is more highly developed,
 the body-cavity has become a lymph space, and the nephrostomes
lead from it directly into the renal veins, not into the kidney tubuks
 (Nussbanm). The abdominal cavity of Anura is also, through the
stomata, in close communication with the lymphatic system, and so,
through the lymph-hearts, with the veins. Hence the body-cavity of
the lower Amphibia may be compared, as regards its relations to the
kidneys, with the body-cavity of certain Elasmobranchs (Cestracion),
while the relations of body-cavity and vascular system in the Anura
are parallel to those obtaining in the higher Reptilia and in Mammals.

242              Mr. E.  J. Bles.     On the Openings in the
                                Conclusions.
   The first inference to be drawn from the facts as here presented is
one bearing on the function of the abdominal pores.               When some
conclusion    has  been reached      as    to whether     the pores are mere
vestigial rudiments of no present physiological value, or whether
they are of real functional value to those vertebrates in which they
occur, then an attempt may be made to assign to them their morpho
logical meaning.
    The opinion held by Bridge      as the    result of his investigations on
abdominal pores was, that, excepting in those cases where the genital
products passed out through them, they had no definite function.
It is now known that true abdominal pores do not serve as genital
ducts; the so-called abdominal pores of Cyclostomes, Murreuida?.
&c, are really genital duels, and their homologies do not point to the
abdominal pores of the Elasmobranchs, &c. The pores would, accord
ingly, be left without any particular function.
    This conclusion is, I believe, contradicted by the facts connected
with the relative distribution of nephrostomes on the one hand
and abdominal      pores on the other.          In the Elasmobranchs three
larger groups may be recognised.            In one nephrostomes only occur,
in another abdominal pores only, in the third nephrostomes are
always present, while abdominal pores may or may not be added.
Amongst the Holocephala abdominal pores alone exist in the adult
Chimcera monstrosa.        The Ganoids lose their nephrostomes, but
all have abdominal pores. All that is clear about the Dipnoi points
to the presence of abdominal pores in Ceratodus and in Protopterus
annectens, nephrostomes being absent. The Teleostei with abdominal
pores have no nephrostomes.               The Amphibia Cecilia and the
Amphibia Urodela botli have nephrostomes opening a passage from
 body-cavity to the exterior.        In certain Chelonia and Crocodilia,
which close their nephrostomes during embryonic life, abdominal
pores are present.        All the groups just mentioned have either
nephrostomes or abdominal pores, or in some (intermediate) cases
both together.     In none are both openings absent, and it appears to
be necessary for some passage to be open between the body-cavity
and the exterior.      This consideration gives, I believe, a clue to tlie
function of the abdominal pores.          As they alternate on the whole in
their distribution with the nephrostomes, they undertake in all prob
ability the duties of the absent nephrostomes, or when both are present
 together they act in mutual support of each other.
    In what the function of the pores chiefly consists is demon
 strated by u very interesting experiment              recently performed by
 Guido Schneider.* He injected finely divided Indian ink mixed
                     • ' Anat. Am.,'  vol. 18, No. 15, p. 393.

with  a little carmine into the body-cavity of specimens of Squatina
angelus (Rhino, squatina, L.).    Two days later the animals were
killed. Phagocytes laden with the colouring matter were found
in the nephrostomial funnels and in spaces in the kidney into which
these funnels led. Whether these spaces were continuous with
the lumen of the renal tubules could not be determined. But
in addition to this means of clearing the foreign matter away from
the peritoneal cavity, another method, as I take           appears to   it,
have been resorted to.       have satisfied myself that in the normal
                                I
S.   squatina      there are no abdominal      pores, but there are cloacal
pits with exceedingly           thin walls towards the body-cavity.  From
Schneider's description,       conclude that these walls were broken
                                I
through   in his more or less pathological specimens, forming raptures
on each side of the cloacal slit. They appeared as black pits pig
mented with Indian-ink-laden leucocytes, wandering, as he explains,
into the tissue round the pore. The pigmented leucocytes were found
only in these two places, and the pores had opened, no doubt,                           I
consider, in consequence of pressure from within, for the spaces in
the kidneys are described as being choked with phagocytes.            What
appears   to  have  happened    is, that the  nephrostomes having been
stopped up with an accumulation of phagocytes, the pores broke
open, and the remaining phagocytes were there expelled, some of
them, however, passing into the exposed connective tissue round the
edge of the rupture. Another previous experiment by Schneider
gives further evidence on the subject.* He made           copious injection
                                                                 a
of carmine suspended in sterilised salt solution into the body-cavity
of Salmo fario. HIr specimens may have been immature                 in any      ;
case, unlike some of Weber's, they had no abdominal pores. But
potentially,    am inclined to think, they were present, as the phago
                I
cytes which had engulphed the injected pigment collected at the
posterior end of the body-cavity, where the abdominal wall on each
side of the anus       very thin. Some of the phagocytes wandered
                         is
into this thin wall, and in one case they passed right through it and
formed a mass of pus on the external surface. This gives,           take it,   I
a very plain hint of what would have happened               the  abdominal
                                                                   if
pore had been present. There would have been no obstacle to the
excretion from the peritoneal cavity of the foreign matter and
products of inflammation.
   The abdominal pores are then excretory ducts, and (should occa
sion arise) would, as Giinther suggested, aid in removing stray ova
and semen from the body-cavity as          part of their work, but by no

244               Mr. E.    J.  Bles.    On the Openings in the
development of almost all Vertebrates. This is in agreement with
the result arrived at by van Wijhe in a totally different way, which
states that the abdominal pores were excretory dncts and the body-
cavity the most primitive excretory organ, functioning as such
before the pronephros arose.*           It would follow that the abdominal
pore is phylogenetically       older than pronephric and mesonephric seg
mental tubes and ducts, and Balfour's homology of the abdominal
pores with a posterior pair of segmental tubes would fall to the
ground.     Without committing myself to van Wijhe's way of regard
ing the abdominal pores and pronephros, I must say that there is
very little to be alleged in favour of Balfour's homology.             The argu
ments with      which    Balfourf supports       his  view    are rather   scanty,
amounting to the statement that the pores, for reasons given, are not
Miillerian ducts, and that the blind pockets (cloacal pouches) of
Selachians are very like primitive involutions from the exterior to
form the external openings of a pair of segmental organs.               It is now
known that the peritoneal end of segmental tubules is formed,
especially in Selachians, in a perfectly definite manner from a defi
nite part of the myotome, the dorsal portion of that part which does
 not form the myomere or muscle segment.                      Until it is shown
 that the abdominal pores arise from a corresponding portion of a
 myotome they cannot be horaologised with segmental organs.                  Their
 late appearance in many cases, their ventral position, the fact that
they are formed (in Scyllium for instance) at the extreme tip of the
 peritoneal cavity as a prolongation of that cavity ventrally into the
 cloacal papilla, that they open at or near the tip of the papilla and
 not into the bottom of the cloacal pouch, all these facts make it seem
 unlikely that Balfour's suggested homology will eventually be proved.
    The problem naturally arises, which is the primitive condition in
 Elasmobranchs, that where nephrostomes alone are present, or that
 where abdominal pores alone are present in the adult ? This point
 cannot, I think, be decided without more evidence.
    At first sight it might seem that the persistence of nephrostomial
 tubes in the adult Selachian was primitive, as these organs are
 formed at an early stage, in a primitive manner, and are hence
 phylogenetically    ancient structures.         Cestracion, moreover, which
 has this feature, is one of the most primitive of living Selachians.
 But against all this it may be urged that just as the nephrostomes in
 adult Amphibia are in all probability a neotenic character, in a
 group which shows so strong a proclivity to neotenia, so may the
 retention of open nephrostomes in adult Selachians of the present
 day be a neotenic phenomenon.            This is the more probable, since the
 nephrostomes iii animals which lose them generally disappear at a

                  Wall of  the Body-cavity of Vertebrates.            245
very early age and they are        so lost in the Cyolostomata.     It is,
therefore, not clear whether      that intermediate group of Selachians
which has both nephrostomes and abdominal pores is on the way to
lose the former and depend on the latter or vice versa.
    With regard to the homology of the pores in the different groups
of fishes and in reptiles, the answer will depend on the proof or dis
proof of Balfour's homology.       If the pores are not segmental tubes,
they are simply perforations of the abdominal wall in consequence
of gradual thinning down in the cloacal region.         Should this be so,
 it is evident that this process may have taken place independently
 many times over in the phylogeny of the different groups, and there
 would be great difficulty in establishing the homology between any
 two groups of Vertebrates in respect to the pores.
     Let us glance for a moment at the role played by the body-cavity
 in the series of changes from its original condition (i) as a part of
 the excretory system, (ii) as a part of the reproductive system receiv
 ing the genital products as they are set free, and (iii) as a part of
 the lymphatic system, receiving the transudations of the visceral
 and abdominal walls. From this condition it has been specialised,
 losing first the sexual part of its duties, when the ovaries and testes
 became more or less continuous with their ducts.          It wonld after
 wards, as in the Anura, become less an excretory organ and more a
 lymph reservoir, and similarly in the higher reptiles and mammals
 it becomes more and more specialised as a part of the system of lym
 phatics.
     I must record my gratitude to Mr. Boulenger for facilities granted
 in examining specimens under his charge at the British Museum, to
  Mr. S. F. Harmer, Superintendent of the Museum of Comparative
  Anatomy, Cambridge, for the use of specimens in the collection, and
  lastly, I owe much gratitude to Dr. Hans Gadow, for the encourage
 ment and suggestive assistance he has always been ready to give me.
                                  Summary.
     1. There is a reciprocal and compensating correlation in the adult
  Elasmobranchii, Ganoidei, Dipnoi, some Teleostei, Amphibia, certain
  Chelonia and Crocodilia in the distribution of nephrostomes and of
  abdominal pores. In some Selachians only are both present. In
  the majority of the Elasmobranchii, and in all the other groups, the
  presence of one set of organs excludes the presence of the other.     In
  the higher Teleostei,   in  Hatteria, some  Crocodiles and Chelonians,
 both have been lost. Anura hold an intermediate position in so far
  as the nephrostomes are present, but are no longer connected with
  the renal system, and the body-cavity communicates with the circu
  latory system through two channels, (I) through the nephrostomes,

246        Openings in the Wall         of  the  Body-cacity of Vertebrates.
and (2) through stomata.               The latter alone form a communication
between the body-cavity and the lymphatic system in the Saurii, and
Mammalia which have neither abdominal pores nor nephrostomes .
    2. If stomata should not be present in the Teleostei and certain
Reptilia mentioned            above, they would form the only exception to
the generalisation         that the body-cavity of Vertebrates is never com
pletely closed.
    3.    The function of the abdominal pores is the same as that of the
nephrostomes, viz., the voiding of waste products from the body-
cavity.
    4. The body-cavity in Pisces and the lower Amphibia is to a great
extent an excretory organ.
    5. The bulk of the available evidence does not favour the view
that the abdominal pores represent a pair of segmental tubules.
    6. They seem to be simple perforations of the abdominal wall, and
in this case would not necessarily be homologous in the various
groups of Vertebrates.

being in planes at right angles to the axis) is identically the same as
the   mutual potential energy of the circular current and a coaxial
helical current of the same radial and axial dimensions, beginning
and ending in the ends of the sheet, if the current across a length of
a generating line of the sheet equal to the pitch of the helix is equal
to the helical cnrrent.
    § 7. The mutual potential energy of a helical current and a uniform
coaxial circular cylindrical cnrrent sheet, or of two uniform coaxial
 circular cylindrical current sheets is expressible in terms of elliptic
 integrals.
    § 8. The electromagnetic force between a helical current and a
 uniform coaxial circular cylindrical current sheet is given by the
 formula

250        Coefficient of Mutual Induction of a Circle,  tyc.
and Mj, M2 are the coefficients of mutual induction of the circular
ends of the sheet and the helix.
   Hence the calculation of this force reduces itself to a double
application of the formulas for the coefficient of mutual induction of
a circle and coaxial helix.
  It is hoped that this may form a useful method of calculating the
constant of current weighers designed to measure current in absolute
units.

" A Note on some further Determinations     of the Dielectric
    Constants of Organic Bodies and Electrolytes at very Low
    Temperatures."    By James Dewar, M.A., LL.D., F.R.S.,
    Fulleriau Professor of Chemistry in the Royal Institution,
    and J. A. Fleming, M.A., D.Sc, F.R.S., Professor of Elec
    trical Engineering in University College, London.       Re
         ceived October 23, — Read December                   i),   1897.
   In  several previous communications* we have described the inves
tigations made by us on the dielectric constants of various frozen
organic bodies and electrolytes at very low temperatures.   In these
researches we employed        method for tho measurement of the
                                     a
dielectric constant which consisted in charging and discharging                                 a
condenser, having the given body as dielectric, through     galvano              a
meter 120 times in a second by means  of a  tuning-fork interrupter.
During the past summer we have repeated some of these determina
tions and used     different method of measurement and a rather
                        a
higher frequency. In the experiments here described we have adopted
Nernst's method for the measurement of dielectric constants, using
for this purpose the apparatus as arranged by Dr. Nernst which
belongs to the Davy-Faraday Laboratory. The frequency of alterna
tion employed was 350 or thereabouts, whereas in all our formerly
 described experiments with the galvanometer method         was 120.        it
    The electrical details of the arrangement employed in NernstV
 method are as follows: — A Wheatstone's        bridge        formed (see   is
 diagram), two sides of which consist of variable    resistances,  Bi, Ri,
 which are usually liquid resistances contained in    -tubes.    The other
                                                                    \J
 two sides of the bridge consist of two sliding condensers of variable

the  diagram, so that it can be placed in parallel with cither of the
shunted condensers forming tho third and fourth arms of the bridge.
The process of measurement           is then as follows : — The experi
mental condenser      is placed in parallel, by the switch S, say, -with
the third arm of the bridge,         and the shunt resistances are first
adjusted, so that tho telephone gives a minimum of sound. The capa
city of one sliding condenser, Ci, is then varied until complete silence
in the telephone    in the bridge is obtained.    The experimental con
denser is   next shifted over into parallel with the fourth arm, and the
capacity of the same sliding condenser is again adjusted to produce
silence in the telephone.      The change in capacity thus made in the
sliding condenser corresponding        to the change in position of the
experimental     condenser is denoted by s.      The experimental con
denser then has its air dielectric replaced by a liquid of known
dielectric constant D0) and the same process of change of its position
effected.    Let the variation of the adjustable sliding condenser then

    In order to apply this method we employed absolute ethylic
 alcohol as the standard dielectric substance of known dielectric
 constant, and took as its dielectric constant at 15° C. the value 25'8
 (according to Nernst), a number closely in agreement with all the
 best results by other observers.
    The actual capacity of the experimental condenser with air as
 dielectric was very small, not being more than about O'OOOOl of a
 microfarad.    Hence in the above formula D0 = 25'8.
    The value of s was determined to be 1"33 and T38 in two experi
 ments, and the mean l-36 was taken as the value of s.
    The following liquids were then examined by placing them in the
 experimental condenser and keeping them at ordinary temperatures,
viz., 16° C. to 20° C.
    1. Solution of Potassic Hydrate in water,    5 per cent, solution.
    2. Solution of Rubidic Hydrate in water,    5 per cent, solution.
   3.  Amyl alcohol.
   4.  Ethylic ether.
   5.  Ethylic ether, pure and dry.
   6.  Ethylic alcohol.
   The change in capacity of the sliding condenser when ethylic
alcohol replaced the air in the experimental condenser was 16'7.
Hence S0 = 167 and D0 = 25 8, also s = 136.

   Hence by Nernst's method, assuming the dielectric constant of
ethylic alcohol to be 25-8, we find that of amyl alcohol to be 15-7 and
pare ethylic ether to be 4-78.
   Nernst himself found amyl alcohol to be 16 0 and ethylic ether to
be 4-25 at about this temperature.            Hence our values are in fair
agreement with his.
   In the next place we cooled the experimental condenser down to
the temperature      —185° C. in liquid air, after filling it with one of
the above      six dielectric liquids, and we repeated all the above-
described operations again.         The results arc collected in Table II.

     The resnlts collected in the above Table III, show that the two
 methods give practically identical values for the two alcohols and
 the ether, bnt very different value for the two frozen dilute hydrates
     An examination was then made of several other substances, and
 for this purpose another condenser was constructed, which consisted
 of a platinum crucible about 4 cm. in diameter and 5 cm. high.
 This crucible was fitted with an ebonite lid, through which passed a
 glass test-tube, in the interior of which was placed our platinum
 thermometer.       Round the outside of the test-tube, platinum wire
 was closely wound, so as to form the opposed surface of a condenser
 in relation to the platinum crucible as the other surface. This
 platinum condenser could then be filled with any electrolyte or
 organic liquid and frozen in liquid air.
     Owing to the very small actual capacity of this last experimental
 condenser, and especially that of the variable part of it in comparison
with the capacity of the leads and connections, no very great accuracy
of measurement was looked for or attained.             The results, however,
were sufficient to check the general [accuracy of the experiment with
similar substances by the galvanometer method.                  This platinum
condenser was calibrated and used with the Ncrnst bridge, exactly
as in the previous experiment.
    With the experimental condenser empty the change in capacity of
the variable sliding condenser in the bridge arm was 1*60 on chang
ing over the position of the experimental condenser. Hence s = 1*50.
    When filled with ethylic alcohol (D0 = 25 8) the change of capacity
of the sliding condenser was 6'20.          We have, therefore, S0 = 6'20, D„
= 25-8, s = 150.
Therefore                          =          = 527.
                           S0— s        470
    The experimental condenser was then filled with some liquid,
either at ordinarj- temperature or frozen at a low temperature, and

           of Organic Bodies, §-c, at very Low Temperatures.                                255
the bridge measurement                made, and the reading S or the change of
capacity of the sliding               condenser observed, as before, when the
experimental      condenser had its position changed.

with several substances at various temperatures.

   The valne found for the dielectric constant of wnter at +1° is
rather low, but, as above mentioned, the smallness of the capacity of
the experimental condenser prevented the results from being more
than good      indications of the order of the dielectric constant.
   We have, in addition, repeated and extended experiments made
with the cone condenser on various electrolytes and dielectrics.
   In the first place, we have carefully examined the effect of change
of temperature on the dimensions of the cone condenser per se to
 ascertain if the dimensional change produced by cooling it in Hqnid
 air could sensibly affect the value of the dielectric constant of an
electrolyte forming the dielectric between the cones, apart from the
change which temperature produces in the dielectric quality of the
dielectric itself.
   The gilt cone condenser was accordingly connected with the
tuning-fork interrupter as formerly described,* and the galvano
meter scale deflection when the condenser was charged with 97'2 volts
was found to be 3-85 cm. to the left and 3-88 cm. to the right, hence
the mean galvanometer              deflection was 3"87 cm. of the scale. This
corrected to 100 volts becomes 3-98, and deducting 0-4 cm. for the
capacity    of the leads, gives            3 58 as      the number         representing     the

electrical capacity of the cone condenser as then arranged.                 A
standard condenser belonging to the Davy-Faraday laboratory, and
having a capacity of one-thousandth of a microfarad, was then sub
stituted for the cone condenser, and gave right and left deflections of
19'1 and 19-6 cm. respectively when charged with 97 volts.               This
corrected for capacity of leads (= 0-4 cm.) and reduced to 100 volts
becomes 19"53. Hence, since the electrical capacities are proportional
to the galvanometer deflection, the electrical capacity of our cone
                     3'58
condenser is ioTEq X 0 001 of a microfarad, ' or 000O183 of a micro-
                     19 od
farad.
    The capacity of the gilt cone condenser was then again measured
 with air at 20° C. as dielectric, and the galvanometer deflection
 observed. The outer cone was then cooled to — 185° C. by quickly
applying to it a large quantity of liquid air whilst the inner cone
 remained at about 20° C, and the galvanometer deflection again
observed.        This deflection was taken again when the inner cone had
fallen in temperature to —75°, and finally when both inner and outer
cones were at —185° C. The following numbers giving the galvano
meter deflections are then proportional to the electrical capacity of
the condenser between the cones.

                                         -185° C.
    Hence it is clear that mere change of temperature of the metal
work of the cone condenser does not affect its electrical capacity by
more than 1, or perhaps 2, per cent., and any larger changes in
capacity found on cooling must be due to a real change in the
dielectric constant of any dielectric substituted for the air between
the cones, and not to mero dimensional changes of the condenser
itself produced by the cooling.
    Another matter to which our attention was directed               was  the

             of Organic Bodies, Src, at very Low Temperatures.                     257
question     whether there was any sensible or serious lag in the tem
perature of the resistance thermometer               behind the temperature of the
dielectric.     Our usual custom had been to immerse the condenser
when prepared for use in liquid air, and cool down the whole mass
to —185° 0., and then raising it out of the liquid air to take tem
perature and capacity readings as it warmed up.                        The resistance
thermometer was placed in the inner cone in a thin test-tube, and
fixed in with fusible metal in the inner cone.                    We therefore tried
one experiment           with pure glycerine as           dielectric,   in which the
electrical measurements were made as the condenser was slowly
cooled, instead of being made as it slowly heated up.                      The process
of cooling from          —  38°      to  —  201° pt. was allowed to occupy one
hour and forty minutes.              The values thus found for the dielectric
constant for glycerine for this range of temperature were practically
in agreement with those found when the condenser capacity was
measured as       it warmed up instead of cooled down.

    The above values          of the dielectric constant of glycerine are in
 very fair agreement          with the values obtained by us during rising
 temperature.*

 temperatures.

    It is evident that the action of electrolysis prior to, and during
freezing has no sensible effect on the subsequently measured di
electric constant even though the surfaces of the cone condenser
are strongly polarised in the act of freezing the liquid dielectric.
    We have then paid some attention to the possible cause of the
high dielect ric values of some substances at very low temperatures. It
is clear from the above described experiments with the Nernst bridge
that for organic bodies such            as  ethylic alcohol, amyl alcohol, ethylic
ether, and glycerine we           obtain practically the same dielectric values
at the low temperature, both when they are measured by the galvauo-
metric method with a switch frequency of 120, and when measured
by Nernst's method with a frequency of 350, or about three times as
great.
    On the other hand for certain other bodies such as the frozen dilute
hydrates of potassium              and rubidium, and the oxide of copper
suspended in ice, the dielectric value at the low temperatures is
much diminished by increasing the frequency.
    Subsequently to the completion of the experiments described in this
paper the suggestion has been made by R. Abegg* that the high di
electric values at low temperatures are due to polarization of the

polarisation capacity and not a true dielectric capacity, and he
supports this contention by pointing out that whenever we have
obtained a large dielectric value at the low temperature                           it has
always      been   measured        with   an   electromotive     force   of  l-434   volts,
which is less than the ordinary full reverse electromotive force of
polarization.
    There are, however, reasons for considering that this contention is
not a valid one.           In the first place wo have always in all the
measurements begun operations by testing the dielectric capacity of
otir condenser       with an electromotive force of one Clark cell
(= 1-434 volts) in order to see roughly whether the dielectric value
was    large or small.         If it was a small value we then gradually in
creased the electromotive             force until a good readable galvanometer
deflection was obtained.             We never found that with an electromotive
force of 1"434 volts, the dielectric constant of any substance was
greater than     with a much higher voltage.
    In the next place, in many cases we changed from a working
electromotive force of about 20 volts to one of T434 volts, and we
never found any marked discontinuity in the calculated value of the
dielectric constant at that point. If our previous papers on this
subject are examined the following instances may be found.

    It is  unlikely that polarisation accounts for the differences between
 the dielectric constants of the above substances, taken pair and pair,
 when measured at nearly identical temperatures, and very nearly
 the same voltages. — November 8, 1897.]
    In order to settle the matter finally we propose, however, to re-
 measure a numberof those substances which have shown high dielectric-
 values at the low temperature when measured by the galvanometric
 method at a frequency of 120 but using in all cases an electromotive
 force of 100 volts.
    If  under the larger electromotive force the dielectric values of
some electrolytes        still remain large, it will be difficult to ascribe this
large value to polarization.
    The facts, however, admit of another interpretation.                     It is clear
that the dielectric constants of some substances at low temperatures
 are vastly more susceptible to change of electromotive force fre
quency thr.n is the case with others, and that the electric strain pro
 duced by a given electric stress varies in some cases enormously with
the time of imposition of the stress but very little in others.
    Another argument against the view that these high dielectric-
values are due to polarisation, as ordinarily understood, is as follows :
The results of most numerous experiments on water show that the
dielectric constant at or near 0° C, is a number not far from 80.
This value is obtained whether the electromotive force reversals are
infinitely slow or whether they are very large. The results of the
measurement of the electrical refractive index of water even with
ether waves only 4 mm. in length, and, therefore, having a fre
quency of about 7'5 X 1010, as given recently by Lampa,* indicate
a number not far from 9-5 as the refractive index and hence give
a dielectric value of 90.             There can be no question of polarisa
tion of electrodes in this last case. On the other hand an increase

in frequency which hardly affects the value of the dielectric con-
stant of water is sufficient to greatly decrease          that of ethyl ic
alcohol, and at the same frequency the dielectric constant of
ethylic alcohol was found by Lam pa to have fallen to a value of 5.
Hence ethylic alcohol is more sensitive to change of frequency than
water.      There is, therefore, no a priori reason why we might not
expect     to  find the same thing even in a much greater degree in
certain other bodies at lower temperatares, viz., a true high
dielectric value for a certain frequency, but great sensitiveness to
increase of frequency in such fashion that increase of frequency
greatly reduces the dielectric value.       At the present stage of the
enquiry     it seems  undesirable to endeavour  to regard the facts wholly
from the point of view of one hypothesis as to the nature of elec
trolysis.
    We have again to mention with pleasure the assistance we con
tinue to receive from Mr. J. E. Petavel in the observational        part of
these   investigations.
  Note added December 8, 1897.            Received December      9, 1897.
    Since the above paper was printed we have repeated some of our
former experiments with the 5 per cent, solution of rubidic hydrate
and the 5 per cent, solution of potassic hydrate, using the original
method in which a condenser having the frozen electrolyte as
dielectric is charged and discharged through a galvanometer, but
employing much higher charging voltages.              The object of these
experiments was to apply a further test as to the validity of
 the contention put forward by R. Abegg, that we have obtained high
dielectric values for certain of these frozen electrolytes in con
sequence of having iu variably used an electromotive force of 1'431
 volts in the experiments with these particular substances.       In order
to be able to work with larger electromotive forces we arranged three
.galvanometers      of the Holden d'Arsonyal type otherwise exactl}-
fcimilar, except in having different sensibilities and resistances.    One
 was   the 500-ohni    galvanometer used in all our previous condenser
 experiments,     another was a 100-ohm coil galvanometer, and a third
 was a 4-ohm coil galvanometer.        Theso were used at the same dis
 tance (125 cm.) from the scale as formerly.          An approximate test
 for the relative sensibility of these galvanometers was made by
 placing a Clark standard cell in series with each galvanometer
 through 100,000 ohms and noting the scale deflection produced.          As
 the internal resistance of the galvanometers was at most only h per
 cent,  of the total resistance these scale deflections may be considered
 to he approximately produced by the same current.        The scale deflec
 tions in centimetres were —

 Hence, the sensibilities are in the ratios of these deflections, and the
 deflections of the 100-ohm galvanometer must be multiplied by 5 5,
 and those of the 4-ohm galvanometer by 67'8, to reduce their scale
 readings to equivalent deflections in terms of the 500-ohm galvano
 meter.
     The 500-ohm galvanometer was then used with the condenser and
 vibrator, as described in one of our previous papers.*                      The eon-
 denser having gaseous air as dielectric, the scale deflection for a
 frequency of 120 and an electromotive force of 97 volts was 3'2 cm.
 when corrected for capacity of leads.
     The condenser then had its dielectric space filled with the 5 per
 cent, solution of rubidic hydrate, and was frozen in liquid air. The
 dielectric constant was next measured, using an electromotive force of
 17"8 volts and the 500-ohm galvanometer.                  The value of the dielec
 tric constant found, when corrected for the capacity of the leads, was
 65"6.    The mean corrected scale deflection was 38'5 cm. for 1"'8
 volts.    This, reduced to its equivalent for 97 volts, is 210 cm. and
 210/32 =     65-6.
     In the next place the same experiment was repeated employing
 the 100-ohm galvanometer and an electromotive force of 79 volts.
Applying the necessary corrections to the observed scale deflection
of 23'5 cm., and reducing to the equivalent deflection on the 500-obm
galvanometer, gave 160 cm. as the value of the reduced deflection.
Hence 160/3'2 = 50 is the dielectric constant.                     The rather con
siderable   difference   between    these   values   (65-6    and 50) is not a matter
for surprise, having regard to the extreme steepness of the dielectric
curve of the rubidic hydrate solution at about the temperature of
liquid air. As we were merely desirous of determining whether a
considerable increase of electromotive force would greatly diminish
the large dielectric value, we did not trouble to put in operation the
rather elaborate platinum thermometer arrangements for determining
the exact temperature of the dielectric.             A reference to the dielectric-
temperature     curve  of rubidium     hydra    tcf will  show that even one or two
degrees of temperature change            in the neighbourhood of — 1S5° C, or
—200° pt. makes a very considerable alteration in the dielectric value.
The result, however, ascertained is that changing the electromotive
force from T434 volts to 17-8 or 79 volts does not bring down the
dielectric constant from a large valno to a small one.
    In the Eame way the 5 per cent, solution of potassic hydrate was
tested.

   Using the 500-ohm galvanometer and an electromotive force of
988 volts we found 153 as the dielectric constant of the frozen
electrolyte at the temperature of liquid air. Employing the 4-ohm
galvanometer and 79'5 volts we found 175 as the dielectric constant.
   All the ahove observations were taken at the temperature of
liquid air and with an electromotive force frequency of 120.       It is,
therefore, quite clear that as far as these two frozen electrolytes are
concerned, raising the charging voltage to a value far above that of
the average electromotive force of polarisation does not bring down
these abnormal values of the dielectric    constant.  On the other
hand, a relatively small decrease in the temperature or increase in
the frequency at low temperatures  suffices to reduce the dielectric
value of these frozen hydrates    very considerably.*   We may, there
fore, say  that the contention put forward by R. Abegg that the high
dielectric values we havo found for certain substances at the liquid
air temperature are really polarisation capacities, does not seem to be
borne out by the results of further experiment, and for the following
reasons : —
    (i)    Because a very great increase in the charging electromotive
              force does not in any corresponding     degree reduce the
              abnormally high dielectric values of certain frozen electro
           lytes to much smaller values.
    (ii) Because when in the course of observations to construct                     a
           temperature dielectric curve, the working electromotive
           force has been changed from a value below the counter-
           electromotive force of polarisation to a value far above                  it,
           there    no break or discontinuity in the curve of dielectric
                       is
           valne.
    (iii) Because   the great difference between quite similar electro
           lytes, such as tho 10 per cent, solution of potassic and sodic
           carbonates, in respect of dielectric constant at equally low
           temperatures and under equal charging electromotive forces
             left unexplained.
                 is
    (iv) Because   in the case of many substances, such as frozen
          amnionic hydrate, ice, and oxide of copper in suspension in
          ice, at very low temperatures, we find high dielcctiic values
                 even though     employing alternating currents of fairly high
                 frequency (350 ~»-).
 *
       The effect of increasedfrequency of electromotive force reversals in decreasing
the dielectric constant   evidently dependent upon tho temperature as well as on the
                            is
physical state of the body.    In the case of water an increase in the frequency from
zero to 10* hardly affects the dielectrio constant at all.   In the case of ice at 0°C.
tie same increase in frequency reduces the dielectric constant from 80 to between
2 and      In the case of ice at — 50° C, as we have shown above, an increase in
          3.
frequency from 120 to 350 reduces the dielectric constant from about 60 to about

            the observations are taken with alternating electromotive
            forces of exceedingly high frequency and under conditions
            when there are no electrodes to polarise, as when the
            electric refractive index is measured with electromagnetic
            radiation.
    We consider that the results        of observations so far made are best
 expressed by merely considering the dielectric constant to be a
 function of the frequency and the temperature, and represented
 therefore by a dielectric surface, which surface has for some substances
 a region of abnormal      dielectric ordinate.
    In all cases so far examined by us,      lowering the temperature suffi
 ciently acts in the same      manner in reducing the dielectric constant
 as sufficiently   increasing the frequency, and both actions reduce the
 abnormally large dielectric values of some substances to values more
 approximately equal to the square of the optical refractive index of
the body.
    The question then to be considered is the physical reason for the
 high dielectric values for particular substances for certain ranges of
 electromotive force frequency and temperature.               Whether this
 abnormal electric displacement is considered to be the result of a
 molecular strain superimposed on a true electric strain, or whether
 it is the beginnings of that molecular deformation which finally ends
 in chemical decomposition, remains to be seen.            Having regard to
 the enormously high electrical resistivity which we have shown these
 frozen dielectrics to possess, it does not appear to us likely that
 polarisation in the sense of a deposition of ions on the electrodes can
 be invoked to explain the differences we have shown exist.

    The theory of continuous beams has been the subject of so much
 research in the past that further investigation would seem almost
 superfluous.    In certain cases which occur in practice, however, the
 computations      arising out of the existing methods become com
 plicated   and   laborious,   if not impossible to reduce, so that any
 solution which avoids these difficulties          may be of sufficient value to
 warrant its publication.
     Mr. Heppel, in a paper read before this Society,* has traced the
 developments in the theory, culminating in the discovery of the
 '
   Theorem of Three Moments,' by M. Bertot, in 1856, and independ
 ently by M.M. Clapeyron and Bresse, in 1857.                       Previously to
  Clapeyron, Navier and other authors had sought the solution of the
  problem by obtaining the reactions at the various points of support
  of the beam ; Clapeyron, however, first introduced the innovation of
  considering the bending moments at the points of support as the
  unknown quantities to be determined.
     M. Bresse, in his ' Cours de Mecanique Appliqnee,' has discussed
   very fully the solutions of the various problems by this method, on
  the supposition of a constant moment of inflexibility of the sections
  of the beam both for the case of spans of arbitrary lengths and also
  for cases where the eDd spars are equal but of different length to
  the intermediate spans whose lengths are all supposed to be equal.
     Mr. Heppel, in the above mentioned paper, published solutions in
  which the spans were divided into two, three, four, or five equal
  parts throughout each of which the load and the cross section of the
  beam were supposed to remain constant, although varying from one
  division to another.
     Professors Perry and Ayrtonf have dealt with the question of a
                        • ' Rot. Soc. Proc.,' vol. 18, p. 176.

        Reactions     at the Points        of Support of        Continuous            Beams.   26'J
variable moment of inertia by obtaining the theorem of three
moments in a slightly different form, the necessary summations for
each span being performed graphically, whence on substitution       in
the original equations the bending moments can be obtained.      The
author has reverted to tho problem of finding the reactions at the
points of support and has based his method on a principle, definitely-
stated by Bresse,* and applied by him to the case of a uniform con
tinuous beam of two equal spans.
   The author claims that the method given below affords an easy
and accurate solution for continuous beam problems, and especially
those in which the moment of inertia is variable. It also permits ol
the variations in the stresses due to alterations                      in the levels of the
supports being investigated.
  The principle may be reproduced                          as    far    as     is necessary      as
follows : —
   The displacement of any point by reason                    of the deformation of the
beam is the resultant             of   the displacements     which would be produced if
une supposed    all     the external known forces to         act separately and one after
the other.
  This being        so, the continuous           beam may be considered
                                                      as a simple
beam supported               at each end and
                                         the action of the given
                                                     under
loading acting vertically downwards, and also under the action of
the supporting forces at the intermediate piers acting vertically
upwards.
  If the neutral fibre of the beam in tho unloaded condition is
assumed to be a straight line, then the result of the action of these
two distinct systems of loading is to make the final deflection of the
neutral fibre at each of tho intermediate points of support equal to
zero.
  If  the beam consist of n spans there will be n — 1 intermediate
supports, the upward pressure of each of which acting by itself
would produce a definite deflection of the beam at any point : the
sum of the separate deflections produced by these pressures at any
one point of support must equal the deflection produced there by the
given loading, and as each of the constituent deflections can be
expressed in terms of the unknown concentrated load causing it,
there will, therefore, be (n— 1) equations each containing the reac
tions at each intermediate point of support, and as there are (n — 1)
reactions these equations are sufficient to determine their values.

  Let the diagram APCA (fig. 1), obtained by erecting ordinates
proportional to the values of mjl at every point in the mean fibre
AC, represent the new loading.
   The bending moment at any point      may be found very simply as
                                                          B
follows —     :
  If  PN be any ordinate such that PN'tZz represents the load on any
small element dx at N, then     PN be divided in
                                            if       so that QN/PQ        Q
= NC/NA, then QNc/a; represents that part of the reaction at A
due to this load PNdx at N.
   Hence by taking a sufficient number of points a curve AQC can
be drawn to represent the reaction at A due to the load APC.
Again, the load on AB may be replaced by a load at A having an
equal moment about B, in         similar manner, either graphically as
                                            a
in the figure, which explains itself, or by calculation. Thus a second
curve,        ARB,
               obtained.is
  Then       easily seen that the moment at
              it   is                         the difference of      B   is
the areas of the diagrams AQCA and     ARBA, multiplied by AB,
that   is  —
                                N, = AB(area AQCBRA).
  This area may              be obtained        by a planimeter        or by calculation,   for

        Reactions at the Points of Support                  of    Continuous   Beams.    273
            ordinates to the carves are taken at equal intervals, the
    if all the
 span being divided into an even number        of the latter, the final

   To find the magnitude of the reactions at the points of support of
a continuous girder of three spans (viz., 60 feet, 100 feet, and
40 feet respectively), and loaded with a uniform load of 3 tons per
foot run, the moment of inertia of the cross section being 2100 at the
commencement of the 60-foot span and increasing uniformly to 3300
at the commencement of the 100-foot span, and thence diminishing
uniformly to 3000 at the beginning of the 40-foot span, and further
diminishing uniformly to 2200 at the other end of the girder, the
units taken being feet and tons.
    The variation of the moment of inertia is shown in fig. 2. The
curve A0BCA3 in fig. 3 is the M/I curve for the beam resting on each
end support, and loaded with 3 tons per foot run.
    Treating this as a new load and reducing the ordinates in the
 correct proportion, the curve A0DEA3 shows the amount of this load
 transmitted  to A„ to form the reaction there.

  Again the curves   AoHAi and A0FA, show the loads acting at A„,
which have   their moments about A, and A2 respectively, equal to
the   moments of the loads on A^ and A^A; about Ai and A2 respec

  Hence          N, = area AoDEAjA^A,,           x     60    =   16330.

   Similarly the curve A„BCA3 in fig.           4   is   the     M/I       curves for 100-

   The equations for the supports are
                       16330  =  37-67  Ri+2253 R,,
                       12034  =  22 47  R, + 22 63 R.,
whence                       R«  =   52-0   tons.
                             R, =   281-9     „
                             R2 — 253'5       ,,
                             R, =    12-6      „

                             R0 = 53-2 tons.
                             Rx  =  278-3      „
                             Rs =   259-8     „
                             R3  =     8-7    „
   The above values of the constants were obtained by dividing the
span into twenty equal divisions of 10 feet, and calculating the
value of the ordinates to each curve at these points.        This is clearly
 shown in Tables I, II, III.
    Having obtained the ordinates to the M/I curve, in each case the
 succeeding ordinates conld be written down almost by inspection,
and employed to find the areas by Simpson's rule, the time occnpieil
being very short.
    If the support at A! be supposed to be depressed ^ inch below the
line A0A3 whilst A2 is supposed to be elevated f inch above it, the
alteration in the supporting forces is easily found.
    For assuming E = 24,000,000 lbs.
                               Et! =    —446-4.
                               Ecj =    +669-6.
    Hence the equations become
                    16330 — 446 4  =  37-67   R, + 22-53 R~,
                    12084 + C6G-6  =  22"47   Ri + 22'69 R:,
 whence                        Ro  =       82-06.
                                R, =     210-2.
                                R2 =     354-0.
                               Rj = —4626,
 indicating that under these conditions the end of the girder at As
 would have to be fastened down in some way.
    Further alterations of level may be investigated in a similar
 manner.

          (From the Physiological Laboratory of University College, London.)
      It has been   fairly well established that the paired suprarenal bodies
  in connection with the sympathetic nervons system of Elasmobrancli
 fishes correspond structurally and functionally to the medulla of
 mammalian suprarenal capsules.* There is also considerable evidence
  in favour of the homology of the inter-renal body of Elasmobranchs
  (and of the suprarenal bodies of Teleosts and Ganoids) with the
 cortex of mammalian suprarenals.               This evidence in the case of the
 cortical glands is chiefly morphological and histological, the experi
 mental results being purely negative.*
     The paired suprarenal bodies of Elasmobranchs have been shown
 to produce the characteristic rise of blood-pressure when an extract
  of them is injected intravenously into a living mammal, or persistent
 contraction of arterioles when an extract is perfused through the
 blood-vessels of a pithed f rog.t It has further been demonstrated that
 a subcutaneous injection of an extract from these seme bodies will
 produce fatal results in mice, just in the same way as if prepared from
 the medulla of mammalian supra-renals.              J    The inter-renal of Elasmo
 branchs and the known suprarenals of Teleosts have no physiological
action either administered intravenously or subcutaneously,t£                          thus
rendering it probable that they consist                of  cortical   material    only, as
had appeared from their histology.*
     Up to the present the comparative chemistry of the subject has not
 been investigated.
     It has been shown that the medulla of mammalian suprarenal con
 tains a substance exhibiting well-marked                   colour reactions. § Like
 the physiologically active substance of              the   medulla, this chromogen
 has not yet been isolated, but it always occurs closely associated with

 the active       material.*         When active suprarenal material is subjected
 to the action            of strong alcohol (98 per cent.) for seven to ten days,
 the active material becomes destroyed, as shown by the physiological
 test of intravenous              injection, but the chromogen is unaffected, and
continues to give the usual colour tests in a characteristic fashion.f
 Hence the two substances are not identical, but their close associa
tion    suggests the probability that the active material has a very
complex molecule (for only such a molecule would be destroyed by
prolonged contact with alcohol), and that the group giving tho
colour reactions forms an integral part of this molecule, and is not
broken up         in the decomposition^
    The colour reactions referred to above are common to all ortho-
dihydroxy -benzene derivatives, and are briefly as follows : —
    1. Addition of various oxidising agents causes a rose-red colora
tion.     This can be produced by addition of bromine-, or iodine-water,
or solution of hydrogen peroxide, or alkalis. §
    2. Addition of ferric chloride to a neutral solution causes a deep
green colour.
    3.  Certain metallic salts are precipitated and then reduced, e.g.,
addition of AgN03 causes a white precipitate which rapidly becomes
black from reduction, especially on warming.                     Similarly, phospho-
molybdic acid produces a yellowish precipitate, which, as well as the
yellow solution, rapidly turns green.
    4. Addition of potassium chromate causes a deep brown colour,
probably due to an admixture of the colour of the chromate with the
products of oxidation of the chromogen.
    Although there is no purely chemical test known which indicates
the presence of the physiologically active material, these colour tests
make it easy to demonstrate                    with certainty the presence of the
chromogen.              Now, as the chromogen and the active material are
closely   associated          in the mammalian medulla, and, as it has further
been shown that the paired bodies of Elasmobranchs                          contain the
active material, || it appeared to us of importance                       to determine
whether        the chromogen was also present in these structures.
Accordingly, the following experiment was performed.

282      The Comparative      Chemistry    of the  Suprarenal Capsules.
   Thirteen perfectly      fresh,  medium-sized       specimens of ScyUium
canicula were dissected, and the paired suprarenals and the inter-
renals carefully removed.         The paired bodies were all picked oat
first, and then knife and forceps were changed for the removal of the
inter-renal,   so as to avoid the      possibility of contamination      by their
means.
    The paired suprarenal bodies were found to weigh in a moist state
0'7 gram, while the inter-renals obtained amounted to 0*33 gram.
    Each of these was boiled in water for a short time, and allowed to
stand for about a quarter of an hour to allow time for complete extrac
tion. The decoctions were made up to a strength of 10 per cent, of
the moist glands. After filtering, the extract obtained from the paired
suprarenals was of a pale brownish-pink colour with a distinct fluor
escence, while that from the inter-renals was much paler, being light
yellow and devoid of fluorescence.
    On testing these two solutions, it was found that: —
    1. Ferric chloride gave a deep green coloration with the decoction
from the paired snprarenals, while no change was produced in the
case of the inter-renal    extract.
    2.  Iodine water, when added to the solution obtained from                  the
paired bodies, produced a decided pink colour, while it effected                 do
change in the tint of the inter-renal fluid.
    3. Hydrogen peroxide gave a pink coloration in the case of                  the
paired bodies only.
    4. Caustic potash gave with the paired suprarenal extract an
 immediate dirty brown colour, but if a drop of weak hydrochloric
 acid had been previously added, a pink coloration immediately
ensued.      This reagent gave no effect in the case of the inter-renal.
    5. Potassium chromate produced a deep brown coloration with the
decoction obtained from the paired bodies,* but gave no change in
that from the inter-renal gland.
    (>. Silver  nitrate gave a white precipitate which immediately
 became black with the decoction of the paired bodies, but no effect
 with that of the inter-renals.
    7. Phospho-molybdic acid gave, in the case of the paired bodies, a
 yellow precipitate which, as well as the solution, turned green from
 reduction, gradually in the cold, more rapidly on warming. This
 reaction was not obtained in the case of the inter-renals.
    These reactions prove conclusively that a chromogen having the
 same chemical     nature as that found in mammalian medulla is found
 in the paired segmental suprarenal bodies of Elasmobranch fishes.
   * This deep brown colour with salts of chromic acid has been employed to display
the medullary glands for purposes of dissection.      It is a convenient means of
 picking out medulla from cortex in those animals in which the two are united into
 one organ.

    It lias been concluded from histological and physiological evidence
that    the suprarenal       bodies of Teleostean fishes consist solely of
cortex.*       The physiologically active material is wanting, as in cor
tical substance elsewhere, and it would be interesting to determine
the presence or absence of the chromogen.                Unfortunately we have
been unable so far to obtain sufficient material for chemical examina
tion.     The same remarks apply to the suprarenal bodies of the
Ganoids.
    For the purpose of comparison, we have chemically tested an
extract made from the suprarenal glands of the frog. Six good-
sized animals were killed and the supracenals snipped off from the
kidney with scissors.         Although there was a considerable admixture
of kidney substance with the material thus obtained, the weight in a
 moist state      only amounted to O'lS gram. This was treated in the
 way    described    above for the Elasmobranch material, and gave the
 chromogen reactions in a perfectly definite manner.

     The general      feature of most of the methods of integration of any
 partial    differential equation is the construction of an appropriate
 subsidiary system         and  the establishment      of the proper relations
 between      integrals of this    system   and    the solution of the original
 equation.       Methods, which in this sense may be called complete, are
 possessed for partial differential equations of the first order in one
 dependent       variable   and any number of independent variables; for
 certain classes of equations of the first order in two independent
 variables and a number of dependent variables ; and for equations of
  the second     (and higher) orders in one dependent and two independent
  variables.      The present memoir discusses the theory of partial dif
  ferential equations of the second order in one dependent and three
  independent variables ; and the method adopted is seen, without
  difficulty,   to be applicable to equations which involve more than
  three independent variables and which can be of order higher than
  the second.       The reason why equations of the type considered are
   taken to be such as do not possess an intermediary integral, that is, a
                                  * Vincent, loc. cit.

284      On the Integration      of Partial Differential Equations.
differential equation of lower order in virtue of which the original
equation is satisfied, is that the other equations, which do possess an
intermediary integral, are a class apart and have been considered
elsewhere.*
   In order to solve a given equation, a system of subsidiary equations
is constructed ; and the system is made up of two parts. One of these
parts is a set of simultaneous partial differential equations in two
independent variables and a number of dependent variables, this
number being one more than the number of the equations.                         An
integral equivalent of this part accordingly contains an undetermined
quantity. The other of the parts is a set of equations in a single
independent variable ; it appears that the set of equations in the
second part can be consistently satisfied by a determination of the
unknown quantity emerging from the first part.
   In particular, the equations represented by
                F(o,    6, c, /, g, h,  I, m, n, v, x, y, s)   =  0,
where x, y, z are the independent variables, v is the dependent
variable, I, m, n are its first derivatives, and a, b, c, f, g, h are its
second derivatives, are found to divide themselves into two distinct
classes according as the equation
             ua       co        cc         ok         og         of
is resolvable or is not resolvable into two equations linear in f, y, f.
When this equation, called the characteristic invariant on account of
an invariantive property which it is proved to possess, is resolvable
into two linear equations, the process of integration of the sub
sidiary equations is much simplified.
   The first of the three sections, into which the paper is divided,
deals with the general theory, and indicates a method whereby
subsidiary equations for an equation F = 0 of any degree in the
derivatives of the second order can be constructed.                  If integrable
combinations of the subsidiary system are not obtainable, an exten
sion of the method shows how equations of higher order (when
obtainable) can be deduced and associated with the given equation.
   The second of the three sections deals with those equations of
which the characteristic invariant is resolvable ; and some examples
are given, alike of equations for which the integration of the initial
subsidiary system is possible, and of equations for which the ex
tended method must be used.
   The third of the three sections deals with those equations of which
the characteristic invariant is irresolvable.              Of such equations the

   These experiments were undertaken with a view to determining
the effect of temperature on thermal conductivities, and the relation
between the conductivity of a mixture and the conductivities of its
constituents.     The apparatus consisted of a number of flat circnlar
copper    discs, into each of which a thermo-junction was soldered.
The substances to be experimented on were placed between these
discs, heat was supplied to one of the discs at a measured rate, by
passing an electric current through a coil in contact with it, and
the differences of temperature between the discs were measured by
balancing the thermo-electromotive        forces produced, against the fall
of potential down a wire.         About thirty solids, liquids, substances
near their     melting points, and mixtures of liquids, were          tested
between temperatures of 15° and 50° C, and the following               state
ments embody the results : —
   1. Solids not very good conductors of heat in general decrease in
        conductivity with increase of temperature in the neighbour
        hood of 40° C.    Glass is au exception to this rule.
   2. Liquids follow the same law in the neighbourhood of 30° C.
   3. The conductivity of a substance does not invariably change
        abruptly at the melting point.
   4. The thermal conductivity of a mixture lies between the con
        ductivities of its constituents, but is not a linear function of
        its composition.
   5. Mixtures of liquids decrease in conductivity with increase of
        temperature in the neighbourhood of 30° C, at Sibout the same
        rate as their constituents.

  In a memoir on Skew Variation, contributed some time back to
the 'Philosophical Transactions,'* I pointed out (p. 364) that we
might expect theoretically to occasionally find (J -shaped distribu
tions of frequency.    I was unable at that time to refer to any case
actually known    to me except Mr. Francis Galton's curve of " con-
samptivity." The data in that case did not seem to me sufficiently
definite to base any elaborate calculations upon them. Quite recently,
in studying Hugo Meyer's 'Anleitung zur Bearbeitung meteorolo-
gischer Beobachtungen fur die Klimatologie,' Berlin, 1891, I came
across, on S. 108, the table for the frequency of various degrees of
cloudiness for the decade 1876-85, at Breslau.        Although the
method used for determining the extent of cloudiness is not entirely
satisfactory, and, as Herr Meyer remarks, the observer must have had
some personal bias with regard to the grade 9, still the observations
are so numerous, and so markedly \J -shaped, that I thought it well
worth investigating how far my theory of skew variation would'
suffice  to describe such a novel form of frequency.
     The observations are as follows : —
                 Degrees of Cloudiness at Breslau, 1876— 1885.
     Degree            0             1         2     3        4         5     6          7       8    9      10

 The total number of days of observation is 3,653.
  Clearly no cloudiness and absolute cloudiness are both maxima
while the mean cloudiness will not be very far removed from mini
mum frequency.
  The following data were obtained for the distribution by Miss
Alice Lee, by the methods of the memoir referred to above : —
                   Mean     =        6-8292                                    ftl   =       06112
                      fit   =        18-2999                                   f%    =       1-7414

   The negative values of mi and               show us that the theoretical
curve   has changed   from   its usual    form  to a U"snaPeQ figure. The
range given is b = a, + aa = 9 9814, instead of the actual 10.

   Thus the start of the range is 4'8270 — 4-8109 = 0-016, instead of
0, and it runs to 9-998, instead of 10.              We conclude accordingly
that if the range of possible cloudiness had been quite unknown
apriori, it would have been closely given by theory.
   The modal frequency y0 was found to be 50-7505.
   Thus the theoretical equation to the frequency is —

impossible to compare ordinates as giving the frequencies between 0

 "On the Occlusion of Hydrogen and Oxygen by Palladium.''
       By Lddwig Mond, Ph.D., F.R.S., William Ramsay, Ph.D.,
       LL.D., Sc.D., F.R.S., and John Shields, D.Sc., Ph.D. Re
       ceived December       8, — Read     December 16, 1897.
                                   (Abstract.)
    During their investigations on the nature of the occlusion of gases
 by linely divided metals, and in particular on the occlusion of hydro
 gen and oxygen by platinum black, the authors have had occasion to
 examine the behaviour of palladium to these gases.
     The palladium was employed in three states of aggregation, viz., in
 the form of (a) black, (6) sponge, and (c) foil.              Palladium black,
 prepared in the same way as platinum black, contains l-65 per cent,
 of oxygen, or, taking the density of palladium black as 12"0,
 138 volumes of oxygen.         It differs from platinum black, however,
    * The diagram on which the percentile curves are roughly drawn also indicates
 the amount of agreement by a histogram.

     On the Occlusion     of Hydrogen and Oxygen          by  Palladium.     2';)1
inasmuch     as tlio oxygen     cannot  be removed      in  vacuo at a  dull red
beat,   and consequently had to be determined in the ignited sab-
stance    by passing hydrogen over it and weighing the water pro
duced.     Palladium black dried at 100° contains 0'72 per cent, of
water, and hence, on the assumption            that the oxygen exists    as PdO,
we have    for the analysis of palladium black —
             Pd                86-59 per cent.
             PdO               12 69      „      = 165 per cent.     Oa
             H,0                 072
    On heating in an atmosphere         of oxygon, palladium black goes on
absorbing oxygen      at least  up  to a  red heat, with the formation of a
brownish-black substance, which does not again lose its oxygen at a
dnll red heat in vacuo.          The amount of oxygen absorbed (nearly
1000 volumes) was about one and a half times as much as corre
sponds    with the formula Pd20, and          if the ignition had been suffi
ciently prolonged,     the whole    of the   palladium would probably have
been converted into the oxido PdO.
    Palladium black, when exposed to hydrogen gas, absorbed over
1100 volumes, but of this only 873 volumes were really occluded, the
remainder having formed water with 139 volumes of oxygen origin
ally contained in the black, which is in good agreement with the
direct   gravimetric estimation.
    Of the hydrogen occluded, about 92 per cent, was pumped off
slowly at the ordinary temperature, and almost the whole of tho
 remainder at 444°.      Increase of pressure of the hydrogen from ono
 atmosphere    up to 4'6 atmospheres had no influence on the quantity
 occluded at the ordinary temperature.
    The pure palladium sponge remaining in the experimental tube
 after the above experiment           was over occluded 852 volumes of
 hydrogen, and about 98 per         cent,   of this was extracted in vacuo at
 the ordinary    temperature.
    New palladium foil behaved in a very peculiar fashion.                At first
 it scarcely occluded any hydrogen even after ignition in the gas and
 subsequently cooling down. It was therefore charged and discharged
 several times electrolytically with hydrogen, but still it persistently
 refused    to occludo any appreciable quantity when replaced in an
 atmosphere of hydrogen.
     After powerful ignition in the blowpipe flame, when it was proba
 bly oxidised and then again reduced at a still higher temperature, it
  was introduced     once   more into the experimental tube. It imme
  diately occluded a considerable      quantity of hydrogen, and by main
  taining the temperature      between    100° and 130°, a large additional
  quantity was slowly absorbed.          On cooling down to the ordinary
  temperature, hydrogen      was   again occluded, and it was finally found

292      On the Occlusion  of Hydrogen and    Oxygen by Palladium.
to have taken up 846 volumes, i.e., approximately     the same quantity
as the black or sponge.
   The hydrogen occluded by palladium foil is given off again very
slowly at the ordinary temperature in vacuo, but rapidly and almost
completely at 100°.
   The paper contains some attempts to explain the extraordinary
behaviour of palladium foil.
   The heat evolved on the occlusion of hydrogen by palladium black
was measured in an ice calorimeter (temperature            of the room
20 — 24°) in nearly the same way as the corresponding heat of occlu
sion of hydrogen by platinum black, thereby avoiding errors due to
the pre-oxistence of oxygen in the substance.
   Favre's statement that the heat of occlusion     remains constant for
the different fractions of hydrogen occluded was confirmed, and it
was found that +46'4 K (4640 g. cal.) were evolved per gram of
hydrogen occluded.
   The authors consider that this number may be taken as correct
within 1 per cent., and compare it with the different values found by
Favre and those calculated by Montier and Dewar.
   If the external work done by the atmosphere be eliminated,         the
heat evolved per gram of hydrogen occluded becomes +43'7 K.
   The heat evolved per gram of oxygen absorbed was also deter
mined in an indirect manner, and found to be +11*2 K (1120 g.
cal.).
   This number, referred to      16 grams  of oxygen, lies intermediate
between the values given by Thomson for the heat of formation of
palladious and palladic hydroxides, and may be consistent, consider
ing the accuracy of such measurements, -with the formation of either
of these hydroxides or with a mixture of both.        In any case it is of
the same order of magnitude, and taken in conjunction with the
behaviour of palladium black when heated in an atmosphere of
oxygen, is undoubtedly in harmony with the view that the absorption
of oxygen by palladium black (and probably also by platinum black)
is a true phenomenon of oxidation.
   The authors have also investigated the atomic ratio — palladium :
hydrogen     for fully charged palladium black, sponge, and foil, and
give   in tabular  form the corresponding ratios deduced from experi
ments by Graham and Dewar in which wire and block palladium
were charged with hydrogen electrolytically.       They have arrived at
the conclusion    that no matter  whether the palladium exists as black,
sponge, foil, wire, or compact metal, or whether it is charged by
direct exposure to hydrogon gas (the proper conditions being ob
served), or charged electrolytically, the amount of hydrogen occluded
in each case is approximately the same, the atomic ratio varying
between l-37 and 1'47.

       On the Occlusion  of Hydrogen and Oxygen by Palladium.         293
     Hoitsema has shown that Troost and Hautofeuille's deduction that
a   compound exists having the formula Pd2H is not warranted.         The
 constancy    of the heat of occlusion over the whole range of absorp
 tion is also opposed to the view that such a compound is formed.
    The composition of fully charged palladium hydrogen corresponds
closely with the formula Pd3H2 first suggested by Dewar.              The
principal and almost only evidence, up to the present, in favour of the
formation of such a definite chemical compound is to be found in tho
approximation of the above atomic ratios to the theoretical value 1*5,
required by the formula Pd3H2.          Although Hoitsema's arguments
may be equally well directed against the existence of this compound,
the authors consider      that additional and independent evidence is
desirable, and hope to be able to provide it.
    It is also shown that the heats of occlusion of hydrogen in platinum
and palladium black are not in favour of the view which has some
times been pnt forward that the heat of occlusion         of a gas repre
sents the heat of condensation        or liquefaction of the gas in the
 capillary pores of the absorbing substance, or the heat of solidifica
 tion or fusion.

         Indices  of Refraction of Substances for         the Electric Ray.    293
      Hoifcsema has shown that      Troost and Hantefeuille's deduction that
  a compound exists having the formula Pd8H is not warranted.                  The
  constancy of the heat of occlusion over the whole range of absorp
  tion is also opposed    to the view that such a compound is formed.
     The composition of fully charged palladium hydrogen corresponds
  closely with the formula Pd3H2 first suggested by Dewar.                     The
  principal and almost only evidence, up          to the present,  in favour of the
  formation of such a definite chemical compound is to be found in the
  approximation of the above atomic ratios to the theoretical value 1*5,
  required by the formula Pd3H,.              Although Hoitsema's arguments
  may be equally well directed against the existence of this compound,
  the   authors consider that additional and independent evidence is
  desirable, and hope to be able to provide it.
     It is also shown that the heats of occlusion of hydrogen in platinum
  and palladium black are not in favour of the view which has some
  times been     put forward that the heat of occlusion of a gas repre
 sents     the   heat of condensation or liquefaction of the gas in the
 capillary    pores of the absorbing substance, or the heat of solidifica
 tion or fusion.

    In my previous paper, read before the Royal Society on October              20,
 1895,*    I described a method of determining the indices of refraction
of various substances for electric radiation,             the principle of which
depends      on the determination of the critical angle at which total
reflection     takes place. A semi-cylinder of the given substance was
taken, and the angle of incidence gradually increased till the rays
were totally reflected.       The experiment was repeated with two semi-
cylinders, separated by a parallel air-space.              The advantage of the
latter arrangement was that the image cast by the two semi-cylinders
remained fixed.        The image underwent extinction when the angle of
incidence attained the      critical value.
    The determination       of the indices of refraction for long electric
waves derives additional interest from Maxwell's theoretical              relation
between the dielectric constant and the refractive index for infinitely
long waves.        The relation K=/tJ has, however, been found to be
 fulfilled in only a few instances.          The value u, is usually deduced

294      Dr.  J.    C. Bose.        On the Determination        of  the Indices
from Cauchy's formula, -which is admittedly faulty when applied to
rays below the visible spectrum.                It would therefore be of interest
to be able to measure directly the index for long electric waves, and
compare it with the value of K for rapidly alternating electric fields,
the periodicity of which is preferably of the same order as that of
the electric waves for which the index is determined.
    Among the substances in which great divergence is exhibited
between the values of K find                  glass may be taken as typical.       In
the very carefully conducted series of experiments by Hopkinson
the value of K (later results) was found to be 6'61 for light flint and
9'81 for extra dense flint glass.              He found no variation of K with
the time of charge, which varied from 1/4 to 1/20,000 part of a
 second.* Messrs. Romich and Nowakf found the value to be 7-5 for
alternation of field of about once in a second, while for steady fields
they obtained the abnormally high value of 159.                    Schiller* found K
for plate glass to be 6"34, with a frequency of alternation of 25 in a
second.    With a higher frequency of about 1*2 x 10*, the value
 obtained was lower, i.e., 5"78.           Gordon, with a frequency of l-2 X 10*,
obtained 324 as K for common glass.
    From the experiments of Schiller it would appear that the value
of K for glass diminished with the increase of frequency of alterna
tion of the field.
    Rnbens and Arons§             compared       the velocities of propagation of
 electro-magnetic action through air and glass, and obtained the ratio
of the velocities or n — 2-33.            Tho deduced value of K would there
fore be 5-43.       M. Blond!ot|| found K to be 2-84 when the frequency
of vibration was of the order 2 5 x 10'. Professor J. J. Thomson
found the specific inductive capacity of glass to be smaller under
rapidly changing fields than in steady ones. Ho deduced the valne of
 K by measuring the lengths of wave emitted by a parallel plate con
denser with air and glass as dielectrics.                  The value for glass was
found to be 2-7.flf
    On the other hand, Lecher** found that the dielectric constant rose
with   the frequency of         vibration.      Thus for plate glass —

I   shall here describe some modifications introduced in the appa
ratus, which have been found to be great improvements.     One of the
principal difficulties met with was in connexion with the disturbance
caused  by stray radiation. It    to be remembered that the receiver
                                                is
is extremely sensitive.     Comparatively  long waves are found to
possess very great penetrative   power;   shielding the receiver then
becomes very difficult.   Even after tho receiver, the galvanometer,
and the leading wires had been screened, disturbances were met with
which    was difficult to localise.
           it                       Part of the disturbance may have
been due to that set up by the generating coil.      A double box mae'e
of soft iron and thick copper removed this difficulty. But the
greatest immunity from disturbance       was secured by using shoi                                     fc
waves. In this case    was not at all necessary to take very special prer
                             it
cautions to shield either the galvanometer    or the leading wires, tho
sensitive layer in the receiver alone being affected by the radiation.
I exposed the bare leading wires to the strong action of the radiator
by putting them in close proximity to the source of radiation, and
yet no response was observed in the galvanometer.       This freedom
from disturbance   not due to tho opposite action on tho two wires,
                         is
for  asingle wire may be exposed to the radiation without any action
on the receiver.

296      Dr.  J. C. Bose.    On the Determination   of the Indices
   With small radiators the intensity of radiation is not very great.
This is a positive advantage in many experiments.           It sometimes
becomes necessary to have greater intensity without the attendant
trouble inseparable from too long waves.    I have made a new radiator,
where the oscillatory discharge takes place between two small circnlar
plates 12 mm. in diameter and an interposed ball of platinum 9-7 mm.
in diameter. The sparking takes place at right angles to the circular
plates.    The intensity of radiation is by this expedient very greatly
increased.
   In  my previous experiments to determine the index of refraction,
I used   tubes to surround the radiator.     This I was obliged to do to
protect the receiver as much as possible from external disturbances.
But this procedure may bo open to the objection that the sides of the
tube may send reflected waves. It is preferable to have a divergent
beam from a single source form a well-defined image after refraction.
Owing to    the  successful removal of the disturbing causes it is now
possible   to allow the radiator to be placed in open space, a plate
with   a  rectangular aperture allowing the radiation to fall on the
refracting cylinder along a given direction. The size of the plate is
26 x 15 cm., and the aperture is 7 x 6 cm. (see fig. 1).     The radiator
and the receiver are placed on opposite sides of the plate.       Absence
of disturbance     due to lateral waves was tested by closing the
aperture and observing whether the waves still affected the receiver
by going round the plate. The plate was found to act as an effective
screen.
   I have  hitherto preferred the null method in my experiments,      as it
possesses   many advantages.     The sensitiveness of the receiver      can
be pushed to the utmost extent, and observations taken when no
effect is produced on the receiver.    The total reflection method also
dispenses with the difficulty of making accurate measurement of the
deviation produced.      After obtaining the value of the index by the
method described above,      I was desirous to see whether it was not
possible to obtain fairly good results by measuring the angle of
refraction   corresponding to a given angle of incidence.     I shall pre-
Bently describe the difficulties met with in these experiments, and
the manner in which they were to a great extent removed.
   The preliminary experiment was carried out with a single semi-
cylinder. The angle of incidence was gradually increased by rotating
the cylinder, and the refracted beam was followed with the receiver.
In this way it was found that the rays ceased to be refracted when
the angle of incidence was about 28° 30'.         The critical angle is
therefore 28° 30' and
                                ^ =  2-08                              (1).
   T next used two semi-cylinders.       The plane vertical face of the

      of Refraction of various        Substances        for   the   Electric Ray.   297
semi-cylinder near the radiator, was placed along a diameter of the
spectrometer circle.    The second semi-cylinder was separated from
the first by an air-space 2 cm. in breadth.  The plane surfaces of the
two  semi-cylinders were thus separated by a parallel air-space ; the
first semi-cylinder rendered the beam parallel, and the second
focussed  the rays on the receiver placed opposite the radiator.
With the radiator used,     I
                           found a thickness of 2 cm. of air-space to
be more than sufficient for total reflection of the incideut ray.*
   On rotating the cylinders to the right and to the left, two posi
tions for total reflection were obtained.    The difference of circle
readings for these positions, equal to twice the critical angle, was
found to be 58°.  The critical angle for glass is therefore 29°.

    Having thus obtained the value of the index, I tried to find
 whether it would be possible to obtain approximately good results by
 measuring the deviation of the refracted ray.          In the first series of
 experiments, I used for this purpose a semi-cylinder,              with the
 radiator at its principal focus (the cylindrical surface being next to
 the radiator), so that the emergent rays were parallel.        On trying to
 find the angle of refraction corresponding to a given angle of inci
 dence, I could obtain no definite reading, as the receiver continued
 to respond, when moved through five or six degrees on either side of
 the mean position where the response was strongest.             It must be
 remembered that owing to the finite length of the waves, there is no
 well-defined geometrical limit to either the ray or the shadow.
 There is,   however, a position for maximum effect, and             possible
                                                                         it   is
with some difficulty so to adjust the sensitiveness of the receiver that
it  shall only respond to the maximum intensity.

a  piece of thick blotting paper or cloth soaked in an electrolyte.        A

  however, be placed on this expedient, when a very sensitive receiver
  is used.
      After repeated trials with different forms of receiving tubes, I
  found a form, to be described below, to obviate many of the diffi
  culties.    Instead of a continuous receiving tube, I made two doubly
  inclined shields, and placed them one behiud the other, on the radial
  aim which carries the receiver.              The first shield has a tolerably
  large aperture, the aperture of the second being somewhat smaller.
  The size of the aperture is determined by the wave-length of radia
  tion used for the experiment.           It will be seen from this arrangement,
  that? the rays which are in the direction of the radial arm, can
  effectively reach the receiver, the slanting rays being successively
  reflected by the two shields.          With this expedient, a great improve
  ment was effected in obtaining a definite reading.
     When the deviated rays are convergent, the receiver is simply
 placed behind the shields, at the focus of the rays.               But when the
 rays are parallel,      the   use   of  an  objective (placed behind the first
 shield)   gives   very  satisfactory    results.   As objectives I used ordinary
 glass   lenses;    knowing    the  index   from   my  experiments, I was able to
 calculate the focal distance for the electric ray.             This is of course
 very different from the focal distance for the luminous rays. I at
 first used a lens of G cm. electric focal distance, but this did not
 improve matters sufficiently.            I then used one with a longer focus,
 i.e., 13 cm., and this gave satisfactory results.
     The receiver used to be enclosed in a metallic case,                2  cm. in
breadth, with an open front for the reception of radiation.               The case
 was used to protect the receiver from stray radiations.               But by the
 new     arrangement and improved construction, these disturbances
 were effectively removed.              I .therefore discarded the use of the
 metallic enclosing cell, as it seemed to me that the rays which did
not actually fall on the sensitive surface might be reflected from the
back of the metallic cell and thrown on to the sensitive layer.               The
layer of spirals, only 1"5 mm. in breadth, is laid on a groove in
ebouite     (which is transparent).           This linear receiver without any
metallic     case was placed at the focus of the lens.
     1 now proceeded to measure the angle of refraction corresponding
to a given angle of incidence.                In the first series observed, the
refraction was from glass to air ; the cylindrical surface of the semi-
cylinder was turned to the radiator, which was placed at its principal
focus.      The receiver was mounted on the radial arm with the double
tthields, and the objective in the manner already described.                  The
reading for refracted rays was taken in the following manner.
Having adjusted the semi-cylinder for a given angle of incidence,
the receiver was moved round till it responded to the refracted ray.
Readings were taken first by placing the receiver at                 au angle less

     of Refraction of various Substances for              the Electric Ray.    299

than the true     reading and gradually increasing the angle till there
was   a   response. The receiver was then placed at a greater angle,
and the angle gradually reduced till the receiver again responded.
In this way a series of readings for a particular angle of incidence
was   obtained.       These readings were found fairly concordant, the
maximum variation from the mean being not so great as 1°.                      One
set of readings being taken on one half of the spectrometer circle, the
cylinder was rotated in the opposite direction, and readings taken on
the other side.

   In my preliminary experiments on the determination of the indei
of refraction of various substances for electric radiation, I used a

          Air-space     on   Total Reflection    of Electric Radiation.         301
single   semi-cylinder      of the given snbstance ; the electric ray was
refracted from the denser medinm into air, and at the critical angle
of incidence     it underwent total reflection.            The experiment was
repeated with two semi- cylinders separated by a parallel air-space.
With light wares an extremely thin air-film is effective in producing
total reflection.     But a question might arise whether waves a hundred
thousand times as long would be totally reflected by films of air, and,
if so, it would be interesting to find out the minimum thickness of
air-space which wonld be effective in producing this result.                   This
point was raised by Professor Lodge, at the discussion on my paper
"
  On a Complete Apparatus for the Study of the Properties of Electric
Waves," read before the Liverpool meeting of the British Associa
tion last year.     I have for some time past been engaged in an investi
gation on this subject.         The factors which are likely to determine
the effective thickness of air-space for total reflection are: (1) the
index of refraction of the refracting substance ; (2) the angle of
incidence ; (3) the wave-length of the incident electric radiation.
In the following investigation, I have studied the influence of the
angle of incidence and of the wave-length in modifying the thickness
of the effective air-space.          The refracting substance used was glass.
                     I.  Influence of the Angle of Incidence.
   The great experimental          difficulty in these investigations lies in the
fact, that there is at present no receiver         for electric radiation which is
very sensitive,    and   at  the  same   time strictly metrical in its indications.
This difficulty is further complicated by the fact that the intensity
of the electric radiation cannot be maintained absolutely constant.
For these reasons, it is extremely difficult to compare the results
obtained from different sets of observations.                Attempts have been
made in the following experiments to remove, to a certain extent,
some of these difficulties.
   Two semi-cylinders         of glass, with a radius of 12'5 cm., were placed
on the spectrometer          circle.    The plane faces were separated by a
parallel air-space.       The radiator was placed at the principal focus of
one of the semi-cylinders ; the rays emerged into the air-space as a
parallel beam, and were focussed by the second semi-cylinder on the
receiver   placed opposite the radiator.            Electric radiation was pro
duced by oscillatory discharge between two small circular plates
1'2 cm. in diameter and an interposed                platinum ball 0'97 cm. in
diameter.
   The two semi-cylinders were separated by an air-space 2 cm. in
thickness ; this thickness was found to be more than sufficient for
total reflection.                                          I
                      The critical angle for glass found to be 2y°. 1

302      Dr. J.  C. Bose.      On the Influence     of the   Thickness  of
(slightly greater than the critical angle).           The receiver, which     was
placed opposite the radiator, remained unaffected as long as the rays
•were totally reflected.     But on gradually diminishing the thickness
of air space by bringing the second semi-cylinder nearer the first
(always maintaining the plane surfaces of the semi-cylinders parallel),
a critical thickness was reached when a small portion of the radia
tion began to be transmitted, the air-space jnst failing to produce
total reflection.      The beginning of transmission could easily be
detected and the critical thickness of air determined with tolerable
accuracy.     The slight discrepancy iu the different determinations
 was due to the unavoidable variation of the sensitiveness of the
 receiver.   When the thickness of air was reduced to 14 mm., the
 receiver began occasionally to be affected, though rather feebly.
 But when the thickness was reduced to 13 mm. there was no uncer
 tainty ; a measurable, though small, portion of the radiation was
 now found to be always transmitted.
    I now increased the angle of incidence to 45°, and observed that
 the minimum thickness, which at 30° just allowed a small portion
 of radiation to be transmitted, was not sufficiently small to allow
 transmission at the increased angle of incidence.              The thickness had
 to be reduced to something between 10'3 mm. and 9'9 mm. for the
 beginning of transmission.
    With an angle of incidence of 60°, the minimum thickness for total
 reflection was found to be between 7'6 mm. and 7'2 mm.

     TLe minimum effective thickness is thus seen to undergo                      a
  diminution with the increase of the angle of incidence.
                     II.  The influence of the Wave-length.
     In  the following experiments I kept the angle of incidence con
  stant, ami varied the wave-length.         I used three different radiators,
  A, B, and C ; of these A emitted the longest, and C the shortest
  waves.
     The following method of experimenting was adopted as offering'
  some special advantages.        If a cube of glass be interposed between
  the radiator and the receiver placed opposite to each other, the

          Air-space   on Total Reflection      of Electric Radiation.    303
radiation striking one face perpendicularly would be transmitted
across the opposite face without deviation and cause a response in
the receiver.     If the cube be now cut across a diagonal, two right-
angled isosceles prisms will be obtained.           If these two prisms were
now separated slightly, keeping the two hypotenuses parallel, the
incident radiation would be divided into two portions, of which one
portion is transmitted,     while the other portion is reflected by the
air film in a direction     (see fig. 1) at right angles to that of tho
                       Fig. 1. — Section of the two prisms.
incident ray, the angle of incidence at the air-space being always
45°. The transmitted and the reflected portions would be comple
mentary to each other.        When the receiver is placed opposite to the
radiator, in the A position, the action on the receiver will be due to
the transmitted portion ; but when the receiver is placed at 90°, or
in the B position, the action on the receiver will be due to the
reflected portion.     The advantage of this method is that the two
observations for transmission and reflection can be successively taken
in a very short time, during which the sensitiveness of the receiver
is not  likely to undergo any great change. In practice three readings
are taken    in succession, the first and the third being taken, say,
for transmission and the second for reflection.
   I shall now give a general account of the results of the experi
ments.     When the prisms are separated by a thickness of air-space
greater than the minimum thickness for total reflection, the rays are
wholly reflected, there being no response of the receiver in position A,
but strong action in position B. As the thickness is gradually
decreased below the critical thickness, the rays begin to be trans
mitted.     The transmitted portion goes on increasing with the dimi
 nution of the thickness of air-space, there being a corresponding
diminution of the reflected component of the radiation.             When the
 thickness   of the air-space is reduced to about 0'3 mm., no reflected
 portion can be detected even whon the receiver is made extremely
 sensitive.   The reflected component is thus practically reduced to
 zero, the radiation being now entirely transmitted ; the two prisms,
 in spite of the breach due to the air-space, are electro-opticaliy con-

 tion.     But if a thin piece of cardboard or any other refracting sub
 stance be now interposed in the air-space, a portion of the radiation
 will be found to be transmitted, and it will be fonnd necessary to
separate tho prisms further to reduce the transmitted portion to
zero.
    Having given          a general   account of the experiments,        I shall now
describe the method of procedure.                The radiator tube was provided
with an ordinary lens whose focal distance for electric radiation is
about 4 cm.           The beam thus rendered approximately parallel fell
perpendicularly on the face of the glass prism.                   The two prisms
were made by cutting a cube              of glass —  an  ordinary paper weight —
across a diagonal.           The size of the cube was 4'5 cm. on each side.*
One prism was fixed on the spectrometer circle ; the other could be
moved so as to vary the thickness of the interposed                         air-space
between the two sections very gradually. The separation was simply
effected by means of ordinary cards. The cards used were of uniform
thickness, each card being 0'45 mm. in thickness.                          A certain
number of cards were taken and placed between the prisms with
their surfaces in contact with the hypotenuses.                    The cards were
then carefully withdrawn, leaving the prisms separated by a thick
ness of air equal to the thickness of the given number of cards.                     It
would, of course, be an improvement to have a micrometer screw by
which the thickness may be gradually increased.
   • Larger prisms would have been preferred, had they been available. The
prisms after cutting were found to be approximately isosceles, the angles being
90°, 46°, and 44°.

            Airspace on Total Reflection of Electric Radiation.                      305
    Observations were now taken to determine the minimum thickness
of air for total reflection for different wave-lengths, the angle of inci
dence being in all cases kept at 45°.                Three radiators, Bj, Bj, R-,,
were used.       I  have not yet made determinations of the lengths of
wave emitted by these radiators,            but it will be seen from the dimen
sions of the radiators        that the waves emitted by Ri are the longest
and those emitted by R3 the shortest.                The oscillatory discharge in
Ri   took   place  between     two  circnlar   plates  1*2 cm. in diameter and an
interposed ball of platinum 0'97 cm. in diameter.                        The radiators
were enclosed in a tube 3*8 cm. in diameter.
    In the radiator Rj, the discharge took place between two heads of
platinum and an interposed sphere the same as in R,. The distance
between the      sparking surfaces was l'Ol cm.
    In the radiator      R3, sparking took place between two beads and an
interposed sphere 0-61 cm. in diameter.                The distance between the
sparking sui-faces was 0 76 cm.
    One prism was fixed on the spectrometer circle, and the other was
at first placed         somewhat apart from it; the distance was now
gradually reduced till the air-space just ceased to reflect totally)
when a small portion of radiation began to be transmitted.                           The
beginning of transmission was detected by the receiver, which was
placed in the A position.           The detection of the beginning of trans
mission is, as has been said              before, somewhat        dependent on the
sensitiveness of the receiver.

    From the above results it is seen that the effective thickness of the
totally reflecting air-space increases with the wave-length.                       If the
 wave-lengths are proportional to the distance hetween the sparking
 surfaces which give rise to the oscillatory discharge, the wave-lengths
 in (b) and (c) are in the ratio of 101 : 76. This is not very different
 from the ratio of the corresponding minimum thicknesses of the totally
 reflecting air-space.
 III.   On  the Relation     hettoeen  the Reflected and the Transmitted Compo
      nents   of Radiation       when the Thickness of Air-space               undergoes
      Variation.
     In the general account of the experiments,            I have said that as the
  thickness of air-space is gradually reduced the intensity of the

306      Dr. J.  C. Boso.     On the Influence   of the   Tliichness oj
transmitted portion cf radiation is increased, while there is a corre
sponding diminnt ion of the intensity of the reflected portion . This
I  have been able to verify qualitatively from numerous observations.
But in making quantitative measurements many serious difficulties
are encountered, owing to the difficulty of maintaining the intensity
of radiation, as well as the sensitiveness of the receiver, absolutely
constant.
    As regards the first, the intensity of tho emitted radiation depends
on the efficiency of the secondary spark, and the nature of the spark
ing surface. Keeping the primary current that flows through the
Ruhmkorff coil constant, the efficacy of the secondary spark is very
much affected by the manner in which the contact is broken in the
primary circuit.      If a vibrating interrupter is used, the break is apt
to become irregular ; the torrent of the secondary sparks also spoils
the sparking surface of the radiator.        For merely qualitative experi
ments the use of a vibrating interrupter is not so very prejudicial, as
along with the ineffective discharges there are present some which
 are oscillatory.    Bnt where successive discharges are to give rise to
 radiation of equal intensity, it becomes necessary to avoid all sources
of uncertainty.      For these reasons I prefer a single break for the
production of a flash of radiation.       With some practice it is possible
 to produce a number of breaks, each of which is effective.                If the
surface at the break is kept clean, and the       break    is properly effected,
 successive flashes of radiation up to a certain number are about
 equally intense.     When the sparking has been taking place for too
 long a time, the surface no doubt undergoes a deterioration.                Bat
 twenty or thirty   successive sparks  are  equally   efficacious  when   spark
 ing takes place between platinum surfaces.         The use of a single flash
 of radiation is preferable on another account.          The receiver at each
 adjustment responds to the very        first flash,  but   becomes less sensi
 tive to the subsequent flashes. The conditions of the different experi
 ments are maintained similar, when the action on the receiver is due
 to a single flash of radiation, instead of the accumulated effect of an
 unknown number of flashes.
    I give below the deflections of the galvanometer          produced by four
 successive flashes of radiation.

    When very careful adjustments are made, the successive deflec
 tions are approximately equal.          There are, however, occasional
 failures, owing either to the fault    of  the break, or loss of sensitive
  ness of the receiver.

             Air-space on Total Reflection of Electric Radiation.           307
    More serious is the difficulty in connection with the receiver.'
With the improvements adopted there is no difficulty, under any
circumstances, to make the receiver very highly sensitive ; but it is
extremely difficult to maintain the sensitiveness absolutely uniform.
T   have   in my previous papers explained how the sensitiveness of the
receiver depended on the pressnre to which the spirals were subjected,
and on the E.M.F. acting on the circuit ; and how the loss of sensitive
ness due to fatigue was counteracted by slightly increasing the E.M.F.
For each receiver         there is a certain pressure, and a corresponding
E.M.F., at which          for  a given radiation the receiver is sensitive.
Having obtained these conditions, the sensitiveness can be in-
ereised or decreased to almost any extent by a slight variation
of either the pressure or the E.M.F.           An increase of pressure pro
duced       by the advance of the micrometer press screw through a
fraction of a millimetre would sometimes double the sensitiveness ;
similarly an increase of E.M.F. of even           TJ-0- volt increases the  sen*
 sitiveness to a considerable extent.
     The nature of the difficulties      in maintaining the sensitiveness of
 the receiver      uniform will be understood from what has been said
 above.       These difficulties are indeed great, and appear at first to be
 insuperable.        But by very careful and tedious adjustments I
 was able on several occasions to obtain fairly satisfactory results,
 and was in hopes of ultimately obtaining symmetrical values from the
 galvanometer deflections.          The setting-in of the rainy weather has
 unfortunately introduced other conditions unfavourable to the main
 tenance of uniformity of tho sensitiveness of the receiver.              Owing
 to the excessive damp and heat tho spirals get rusty in a short
 time, and variation in the sensibility is produced by tho altered
  condition of the surface of the sensitive layer.                The results of
  certain experiments        I  have carried out lead me to hope that this
  difficulty will, to a certain extent, be removed by covering the sensi
  tive   surface with a less oxidisable coating.
      The deflections produced in the galvanometer            can only be taken
  approximately       proportional   to the intensity   of  the  absorbed radia
  tion.     It would be better to observe the diminution of the resistance
  produced by the incident radiation.         This may be done with the help
  of   a  differential  galvanometer and a balancing resistance.
      G is a high resistance differential galvanometer, with two sets of
   electrodes, A, B ; C, D ; one pair of electrodes is in series with the
   receiver, and the other with a resistance box.          When the receiver is
   adjusted     to respond to the electric radiation, a weak current flows
   tlirongh    it.  The same E.M.F. acts on both the circuits. The com
   pensating current, produced by a proper adjustment of the resistance
    of the box, brings the spot of light back to zero.          The resistance of
    the box is equal or proportional to the resistance of the receiver,.

When radiation is absorbed by the receiver the resistance is decreased
and this diminution of the resistance is found from the new balancing
resistance.

   All   observations       agreed in showing that as the thickness of
air-space     was gradually decreased, the transmitted component was
increased, with a corresponding                decrease of the reflected portion.
I  give below two sets of observations, in which the receiver acted
better than usual.        The results are to be taken more as qualitative,
as no reliance can be placed on the sensibility of the receiver being
absolutely     uniform.

            A ir-space    on lotal Reflection of Electric Radiation.          309
   It   is seen from the above, that as the thickness of the air-space
was     gradually increased, the reflected component increased, while
the    transmitted portion decreased.            The minimum thickness for
total reflection     was found to be about 8 mm.         When the thickness of
air-space was reduced to about half this thickness (slightly less than
half) the reflected and the transmitted           portiDns seemed     to bo about
equal.
   With the radiator            the minimum thickness for total reflection
was   found to be about equal to the thickness of 22 cards (9'9 mm.).
When the thickness of air-space was reduced to the thickness of 10
cards (4'5 mm.) the reflected and the transmitted portions seemed to be
about equal. As two experiments immediately following each other are
more likely to be comparable, the experiments were so arranged that
the observation of deflection for transmission with a certain thickness
of air followed the observation for reflection with a different thickness,
the corresponding deflections being about equal.                 As stated above,
the   reflected and the transmitted portions were approximately equal
when the thickness of air was equal to the thickness of 10 cards.
Keeping 10 as the mean, pairs of readings were taken with different
thicknesses.        For example, the reflection reading with a thickness of
air equal to the thickness of 4 cards was followed by taking a reading
for transmission, with a thickness of air equal to the thickness of
16 cards; the deflections produced in the two cases were about equal,
i.e , sixty-six divisions of the scale.
   I append below a table showing the corresponding thicknesses of
air (in terms of number of cards) which gave approximately equal
deflections, the deflection in one case being due to the reflected com
ponent, and in the other case to the transmitted component.                   The
receiver was made moderately sensitive, so that the deflections lay
within the scale.

       Trotting Horses, with Remarks on their value as Hereditary

    It is strange that the huge sums spent on the breeding of pedigree
stock, whether of horses, cattle, or other animals, should not give
rise to systematic publications of authentic records in a form suitable
for scientific inquiry into the laws of heredity. An almost solitary
exception to the disregard, shown by breeders and owners, of exact
measurements       for publication in stud books, exists in the United
                                                            "
 States with respect to the measured speed of "trotters       and " pacers"
 under defined conditions.      The performance of 1 mile by a trotter,
harnessed to a two-wheeled vehicle, carrying a weight of not less than
 150 lbs. inclusive of the driver, in 2 minutes 30 seconds qualifies
 him for entry in the Trotting Register, giving him, as it were, a
 pass-degree    into a class of horses whose several      utmost   speeds   or
 "records" are there published.       To avoid prolixity   I  will not  speak
 particularly of pacers (pace = amble), since what will be said of the
 trotters applies in general principle to tliem also.
     The great importance attached to high speed, and the watch
 fulness of competitors, have resulted in evolving a method of timing
 trottVrs which is generally accepted as authoritative.          The length
 of the track is scrupulously measured, and numerous other con
 ditions are attended to, that shall ensure the record being correct,
 with: an attempted exactitude to the nearest quarter of a second.
 A race against time, even if exact to the nearest quarter of a
 second, is by no means so close a measure of the speed of a horse
  relatively to his competitors, as the differential method of ordinary
 races.     The speed of 1 mile in 2' 30", or of 1760 yards in
  150 s<conds, is equivalent to about 12 yards in 1 second.         Now, the
  length of a horse when extended at full trot is half as long again as
                                  I
  his height at the withers — as gather from the instantaneous photo
  graphs of Muybridge — and consequently is hardly ever as much as

              registered Speeds   of American Trotting Horses.            311
3 yarcU.      Therefore at a 2' 30" speed a horse travels through his
whole length in a quarter of a second. In an ordinary English race
a winner hy half a length gains a notable victory, while a neck or
even a head in advance is sufficient to establish his priority.         There
fore the record of the speed of a horse to the nearest quarter of a
second is hy no means an absurd refinement.            It is, of course, very
difficult under the exciting circumstances of a race to measure time
with such precision as that. I tested the value of these entries as
follows : — If quarter seconds were noted with exactness the entries
of 0, ^,         and  J would be approximately equal in number ; they
 would also be equal if they were set down at random without bias,
but if there be a bias towards favourite numbers its effects would be
apparent.       I extracted a few hundred entries, and found the rela
 tive frequency of the 0, \, \, and f to be almost exactly as 1, 3, 2,
and 1.       Consequently the   \ is on the average three times as great a
 favourite as either the 0 or the J, and the          \  is twice as much a
 favourite as they are.        It  is evident that the \ seconds are not
 strictly trustworthy, but it may well be urged that their entry is
 preferable to their total disregard.
     I was informed that a trifling laxity was tolerated when a horse
 had just but only just failed to qualify, an allowance of \ of a second
 in his favour being commonly made. So that a speed of 2' 30j"
 would usually be reckoned as 2' 30". I shall return to this point
 further on.
      The system of timing and of registering records began more than
  fifty years ago, and was developed and improved by degrees.          In 1892
  a considerable change was made       in the conditions by the introduction
  of bicycle wheels with pneumatic tyres, which produced a gain of
  speed, the amount of which is much discussed, but which a prevalent
  opinion rates at 5 seconds in the mile.       Thenceforward the records
  are comparable on nearly equal terms.          All trotting performances
  up to the 2' 30" standard are registered in the large and closely
  printed volumes of

  authority of the    American    Trotting Association.     Vols. 8 — 12 refer
  to the years 1892-6, and it is from_the entries in these that the
  following remarks are based.
       The object of my inquiry was to test the suitability of these
   trotting (and pacing) records for investigations into the laws of
   heredity.    Their trustworthiness was of course one point to be ascer
   tained, another was to obtain a just notion of the proper principle
   on which marks for speed should be awarded, as, for instance, in the
   following example : — Suppose a particular ancestor, whom we will
   call A, of a certain horse has a record of 2' 30", and that another
   ancestor in the same degree, whom we will call B, has a record of

 312            Dr. F. Galton.     An Examination into    the
 same    on the average as that of two horses each having the speed of
  2' 20", or will it be something altogether different? In short, is the
 arithmetical the most appropriate mean or not ? It would be a
 strong presumption in the affirmative, if the relative frequency of
 the   various speeds should correspond approximately with those
 determined by the normal law of frequency, because if they do so
 they would fall into line with numerous anthropometric and other
 measures which have been often discussed, and which, when treated
 by methods in which the arithmetic mean was employed, have
 yielded results that accord with observed facts.           Whether the
 speeds do or do not occur with the normal frequency had therefore
 to bo ascertained.      So my inquiry had two objects : first, did the
 run of the observations suggest a tolerably smooth curve ? Secondly,
 was that curve a tolerable approach to the curve of normal fre
 quency ?
    The investigation was troublesome and tedious. It was necessary
 to pick out from a large collection the names of those stallions,
geldings, and mares (all three being equally efficient trotters), whose
 records had been made in the year under consideration, and who also
had arrived at maturity, that is, who were not less than five years
old, and therefore     had had time to show their     full powers. Had
younger horses      been  included, the frequency  of  the slower records
would have been much increased.              Assisted by a friend, the
appropriate entries were underlined in the printed volumes, then
one of us read them out, and the other ticked them down in the
appropriate column of a page ruled for the purpose.           Finally the
marks in each column were counted.           In this way 5705 extracts
were made from the entries for the years 1892-96 ; they were not
subsequently verified, so some few omissions are probable.       Anyhow
they form a fair and large sample, and are quite sufficient for the
present purpose.
    The discussion    of this material resulted in rather bulky tables,
which it is needless to reproduce here, because their contents are
given in an adequate and much simpler manner by the accompanying
diagrams.      The successive columns in the table are represented in
the diagrams by imaginary columns that stand on corresponding
bases. They run as follows :— The first column, counting from the left,
contains the percentage value of all observations recorded as 2'29-0",
29£", 29£", or 29|"; that is of all under 30 down to 29 inclusive
(the minutes being here omitted for brevity).         The second column
referred to 28 0", 28£", 28£", and 28J", and so on with the rest. Con
sequently the dot in the diagram which indicates the percentage
number of observations, according to the side scale, stands in the
middle of its own imaginary column.          For example, that of the
2' 28" set stands vertically above the point that lies half way

between   28 and 29 on the scale along the base.    The dots are con
nected by thin lines to show the trace or curve of the observations.
The smooth curves are those of normal frequency, calculated from
the  values of the mean  (M) and of the probable error (P.E.), which
are  given in the diagrams.

    Leaving   aside for the moment the strange pinnacle that rises on
 the extreme left of every diagram, we see that the traces of the
 observations   run very roughly, but not intolerably so.      In each
 diagram they seem to be disposed about a fundamentally smooth
 curve.    Considering the smallness of the interval, namely, only
 1 second, that separates the observations assigned to each pair of suc
 cessive columns, together with the experience derived from other
 kinds of statistical curves, it seems to me that the run of tho obser

 vations is good        enough     to certify    their general trustworthiness.
 As regards the pinnacle it is            a different matter, and is one which
 when beginning work, as            I  did, on the 1892 entries only, was very
 perplexing. However, by persevering with the other years it became
 increasingly plain that the pinnacle was a false maximum ; in 1896
 it was certain that the true maximum la}' well within the portion of
 the curve included in the diagram.             The explanation of thft pinnacle
 then became obvious ; it was that the tolerance granted to those
horses who failed by only a little to qualify themselves, was extended
considerably beyond the quarter second for which I was prepared.*
 The cases of 2' 30'0" were few ; they do not appear in the diagram,
but their addition would be quite insufficient to remove the difficulty.
 If the pinnacle were distributed among two adjacent columns outside
and to the left of the diagram it would smooth away the incongruity,
 so I suspect that cases of
                                     " under 2' 32" and down to 2' 30" " are
habitually rated at a trifle less than 2' 30". Consequently I had no
hesitation in wholly disregarding the entries that helped to make the
pinnacle, namely, the whole of those contained in the first column to
the left in every one of the diagrams.            The course thereupon became
clear and straightforward.           When fixing upon the mean for each year,
 I was somewhat biassed by the entries in the adjacent years ; simi
 larly as to the probable error. Now that the curves are drawn I see
that somewhat better fits might have been made, but they are close
enough to show the existence of a fair amount of correspondence
between the observed values and those calculated according to the
law of normal frequency.            It is near enough to remove hesitation in
working with the arithmetic mean.

   I   now come to the fundamental purpose of this memoir, which is
to point out the existence in the registers of the American Trotting
Association, of a store of material most valuable to inquirers into
the    laws    of heredity,  which accumulates and increases in value
year by year. Unfortnnately it lies buried to a hopeless depth,
partly becauso the published part of the registers refers only to
standard trotters.      It appears to be buried simply through the omis
sion of having its importance insisted on. The published volumes
                                '
of the ' Trotting Register contain numerous elaborate tables, but
lacks one that should include the names and pedigrees of those
horaes concerning whose antecedents enough is known to make their
pedigrees serviceable to investigators.
   It  is hardly worth while to discuss hereditary influence on speed,
in the case of any horses, unless the records of at least their sires and
of their dams, and those of each of their four grandparents, as well as
their own record, are all known. Even in this case (according, at
least, to my own theory) one quarter of the hereditary influences are
unknown and have to be inferred. It is practically impossible to
make an adequate collection of the names of horses who fulfil the above

conditions out of the entries in the Trotting Register,' each search
requiring many cross references and occupying a long time, while
the number of futile searches before attaining a success is great.       On
the other hand, the breeders and possessors of these notably bred
horses must be familiar with the required facts, and would assuredly
be delighted to have them known.            There need, therefore, be little
difficulty  in  obtaining  materials for the  much desired table.    In the
meantime I am sending circulars to the chief breeders in America
in hopes of making a start.
   The great need for genealogical data of an exact numerical kind,
 by those who prosecute inquiries into the laws of heredity, is the
justification that I offer for submitting these remarks to the Royal
 Society.

     About a year ago, a paper by Dr. Norman Collie and one of the
authors (W. R.) was published, bearing the title
                                                               " The

of Helium and of Argon."               In that paper* various reasons were
adduced to show why an attempt to determine whether or no argon
and helium are homogeneous was worth making. The results of the
experiments at that time indicated that while it did not appear
possible to separate argon into two portions of different densities,
the ca^e was different with helium.                Samples were obtained after

 repeated    diffusion which possessed respectively diffusion rates corre
sponding to the densities 2-133 and T874.                It was there pointed out
that these densities are not correct (although their ratio is probably
not wrong), owing to the curious fact that the rate of diffusion of
helium is too rapid for its density, i.e., it does not follow Graham's
 law of the inverse square root of the densities.                These samples of
 gas   also   differed   in   refractivity,  and    the  difference   was approxi
mately proportional to the difference in density.
    Towards the end of the paper, the conjecture was hazarded that
it was not beyond the bounds of possibility that the systematic dif
fusion,   of what we are accustomed to regard as a homogeneous gas,
for example, nitrogen, might conceivably sift light molecules from
heavy molecules.          It is true that the fineness of the lines of the
spectrum would offer an argument in favour of the uniformity of
molecular      weight; but still it is never advisable to assume any
physical theory without submitting it to rigorous proof.                And it was
 thought possible      that   the  fractional   diffusion    to which   helium had
been subjected might have had the result of effecting such a separa
tion ; a separation, not of chemical species, but of molecular magni
tude.     The other and more ordinary explanation of the splitting of
helium into fractions of different density is that helium must be
regarded as a mixture of two gases, one lighter than the other.
    Since the publication of the paper mentioned, Dr. A. Hagenbach
has confirmed the possibility of separating               helium into portions of
two densities by diffusion ; and the differences in density were
 practically the same as those observed in the laboratory of Univer
sity College.*
    These experiments        were made with somewhat over 200 c.c. of gas ;
 but it was decided to make experiments of a similar kind, on a much
 larger quantity of helium.
    An apparatus was therefore constructed, similar in principle to the
 one   previously employed, but on a much larger scale.                  The main
 features are shown in the illustration on p. 208 of the paper
 previously alluded to ; but on account of the large amount of gas
 diffused, it was not practicable to collect it in tubes.           Instead, there
 fore, of the bent tube EN of the former apparatus, the tube con
 nected with the stopcock E was continued horizontally, and by
 means of six vertical branches it communicated with six gas reser
 voirs, each furnished with a two-way stopcock.                   It was possible
 with this means to cause gas from any one of the reservoirs to enter
 the diffusion apparatus A.          In order to be able to collect the gas in
 any desired reservoir, the delivery tube of the Topler pump P
  delivered gas into a jar somewhat similar to that shown at J, but
  provided with a vertical branch, which was bent horizontally some

distance up, and lay parallel to th-5 previously mentioned horiEontal
tnbe.   It, too, had six vertical branches, each of which communi
cated with the other limb of the two-way stopcock of each reservoir.
By raising the reservoir of the Topler pnmp and expelling gas into
the collecting tnbe J, the gas could be transferred to any one of the
reservoirs.    The accompanying diagram makes it clear how the
apparatus was set up.
   The actual method of conducting a diffusion was as follows : —
   Reservoir I was raised until the mercury in the diffusion jar A
stood at the level of the dotted line. The clip L was then closed,
and the stopcocks C and D opened.         The TiJpler pump was then
worked until all gas was removed from A ; the gas, if air (as at
the commencement of the whole series of operations), being allowed
to escape by moving the collecting jar J, so that it no longer covered
the end of the exit tube of the Topler pump.        Stopcocks C and D
were next closed, and stopcocks E and 6a opened, so that the gas
from 6 entered the diffusion vessel A. By raising the reservoir belong
ing to 6, all gas was expelled through E into A, clip L being opened
meanwhile.     Reservoir 6 was now full of mercury, and all gas was
in A.     Stopcock C was then opened, and the gas in A diffused
through the pipe stem B (closed at one end by means of an oxy-
hydrogen blowpipe) into the pump.       This diffusion proceeded until
half the gas in A had passed into the pnmp reservoir F. Stopcock C
was then closed, and the Topler was worked, the diffused gas being
delivered into J. Stopcock 6a was then opened, and the reservoir of

                        The Homogeneity of Helium.                         319
 6  lowered, so that the gas in     J  passed into 6. This stopcock was
 then shut.     The contents of 5 were then transferred in a similar
 manner into A, and one-third of the gas was diffused into the pump.
It was collected as before in 6. The diffusion jar A now contained
as mnch gas as had been present in 5.         The contents of 4 were next
added ; half of this was removed by diffusion and transferred to 5.
The contents of 3 were added ; half was diffused and transferred
to 4.    The contents of 2 were added ; half was diffused and collected
in 3.    And, lastly, the contents of 1 were added, and the half dif
fused collected in 2.      Stopcock D was then opened, and the mercury
in the diffusion jar A allowed to run up to the dotted line ; the clip
L was closed. All gas was pumped out of A and collected in 1 ;
this constituted one complete round.
    As it was not possible to empty the tube issuing from               J com
pletely of gas by lowering      the reservoir of  1,  and as,  if not emptied,
the heavy gas would have contaminated the light gas from 6 during
the next round, the following method was made use of.                 The gas
from 6 was transferred to tho empty reservoir A ; and then, by
lowering the reservoir of 6, mercury rose in the tube issuing from J,
and expelled all the heavy gas in the connecting tubes into 6.             The
clip K was then closed, and by opening the stopcocks la and 6a, so
that communication took place between jars 1 and 6, the small quan
tity of gas in 6 was transferred to 1.      Tho apparatus was now ready
for a second round.
                      The Fractional Diffusion of    Air.
     In order to test the working of the apparatus, a set of diffusions
was carried out with air.      After four rounds, comprising twenty-four
diffusions, the light portion contained 17'37 per cent, of oxygen and
the heavy     portion 2'2'03. A fairly rapid separation was thus being
effected, considering the closeness of the densities of nitrogen and
oxygen.
                    The Fractional Diffusion of Nitrogen.    •
     A similar set of experiments was carried out with nitrogen, pre
pared    by the action of solutions of ammonium chloride on sodium
nitrite, in presence of copper sulphate.         The gas was dried and
passed over red-hot iron prepared by reduction of ferric oxide in
order to remove any oxygen or to decompose any oxides of nitrogen
which might be present.         After thirty rounds, involving 180 opera
              " light " portion of the nitrogen, after
 tions, the                                                   purification by
 circulation over copper oxide, had not altered in density.            It must
 therefore be concluded that nitrogen is homogeneous as regards the
 relative density of its individual molecules.

320          Prof. W. Ramsay and Mr. M. \V. Travers.
                   The Fractional Diffusion of Helium.
   The first sample of helium employed was prepared from samar-
skite and cleveite. After seventeen rounds, involving 102 operations,
the diffusion rates of the lighter and heavier portions were measured.
The first gave a density, calculated from this rate, of 1'807, and the
second of 2*128.     The same gas was re-diffused until in all thirty
rounds had been carried through, involving 180 operations.           The
light fraction now showed the density (measured diffusion rate
against hydrogen) 1*816, and the heavy fraction 2*124.       These gases
were then circulated ; the diffusion rate of the lighter portion pointed
to a density of 1*811; the heavier gas was diffused into three por
tions, of which the more rapidly diffusing had a "diffusion density"
of T90G, and the less rapidly diffusing of 2 032. The lightest gas of
all (diffusion density = 1*811) was weighed, and had a "real"
density (O •= 16) of 2 021 ; the mixture of the heavy products gave
the real density, 2*153.       The refractivity of the heavy portion,
measured against helium from cleveite, undiffused, yet purified from
all removable gases, which had the density (weighed) 2*076, was
1*078, the refractivity of the undiffused gas being taken as unity.
   A fresh quantity of helium was next prepared from cleveite, and
the former diffused samples were stored in tube-reservoirs for future
use.   The new helium was washed with caustic soda, but not other
wise purified.   This gas was now put through fifteen rounds, com
prising ninety operations, and the light portion in jar 6 was purified
by circulation over magnesium and copper oxide.          Its refractivity
was 0*9752 of that of the uncirculated helium. Its density by
weighing was 1*979. Owing to the cracking of the glass apparatus
the main bulk of the specimen was lost.       It may be here interesting
to chronicle that the remaining portion was inhaled through the nose
and mouth ; it possessed neither smell nor taste.
   The contents of No. 5 were therefore purified and weighed; its
density was 2 049.
   The contents of No.    1 were also purified by circulation, and had a
gravimetric density    of 2*245.  It lost on circulation a considerable
amount of nitrogen which was estimated as ammonia by treat
ment of the magnesium containing nitride with water.           As we are
certain that there was no entry of air in preparing the gas, the 34c.c.
of nitrogen must have been evolved from the mineral.         It may have
been occluded on the surface of the powdered mineral ; it need not
be remarked that before heating the mineral a nearly perfect vacuum
was made in the tube, and that there was no leakage during the
operations.    We have previously found traces of nitrogen in gas
prepared from cleveite; but not all specimens give off that gas.
Supposing, however, to take tho worst view, the nitrogen had been

derived from leakage of air,           it would correspond to only 0'3     c.c. of
argon.
    The contents of jar No. 2 wero also pnrified and weighed. During
the   purification hardly a trace of nitrogen was removed.                    The
density    was    2-209.    We  have  tlms  : —
               Jar No.    1  contains gas of density             2'245
                    „      2       „            ,                2209

   The light gas which had previously been stored in tubes was now
mixed with the light gas from the second set of diffusions, and the
mixture was re-diffused fifteen times, involving ninety operations.
The density of the lightest portion of this helium was determined by
weighing and found to be I '988. The helium had, therefore, not.
been made sensibly lighter by re-diffusion.                The mean of the two
determinations may be taken as the true density of pure helium; it
i8 l-98.     The refractivity of this sample measured against hydrogen
and multiplied by the ratio between hydrogen and air, viz., 0-4564,
gives 0'1238.         This specimen of light helium of density 1-988 was
placed   in  one    of the refractivity tubes, and the lightest helium of the
former preparation (density = 1'979) in the other.                  They had the
same refractivity (1000 to 1004).              The contents of No. 1, obtained
from the mixture of light gases had the density 2'030, showing that
only a little heavier material had been withdrawn.
    The lighter fractions of helium were then sealed up in glass reser
 voirs and stored.        The heavier portions were placed in the diffusion
 apparatus    and submitted to methodical diffusion.
    After fifteen rounds (ninety operations) the heaviest fraction had
 density 2 275, the lightest 2-08.             The refractivity of the heaviest
 gas  was   next    determined    and found    to be 0'1327. This gas examined
in a   Pliicker's tube showed brilliantly pure helium lines, but along
with these the reds and green groups of argon.                  Calculating from
the density of this gas it           should    contain   l-63 per cent, of argon
according to the equation ] 96lx-(-20y = 2'275. Calculating from
the refractivity the percentage of argon should be 1*05, from the
 equation l-245a; + 0-9596;/ = 13-33.             A mixture of 99 per cent, of
the purest helium and 1 per cent, of argon was made, and it showed
the   argon spectrum with about the same or with somewhat less
intensity than the heaviest gas.              Finally, the heavy gas was dif
fused to the last dregs, so that only about O'o c.c. remained undif-
fnsed ; and this small residue, transferred to a Plucker tube, showed
 the  argon spectrum with only a trace of the spectrum of helium.
 The yellow     line and the bright green line were visible, but feeble.
 This spectrum -was compared with that of a mixture of argon with a
 trace of helium, and nearly the same appearance was to bo seen.            With

322           Prof. W. Ramsay and Mr. M.         VV. Travers.
 the jar in parallel and a spark gap interposed the bine spectrum of
argon was equally distinct in both tubes ; and, more important still,
there was no trace of any unknown line.        It appears, therefore, that
helium contains no unknown gas, nor is it possible to separate it by
diffusion into any two kinds of gas ; all that can be said is that
most minerals which evolve helium on heating also evolve argon in
 small quantity. This accounts for the difference in density observed
 in different samples of helium ; and in one instance, viz., malacone,
 the amount of argon evolved on heating the mineral, though small,
 was much in excess of the helium, so far as could be judged by the
spectrum.
   In the light of the experiments of which an account has here been
given, it is necessary to reconsider the deduction drawn by Professors
ilunge and Paschen      from the complex natnre of the spectrum of
helium    as regards  its complex nature.     Sir Norman Lockyer has
already pronounced in favour of the supposition that helium is a
mixture, chiefly on the ground that in the spectra of certain stars
some, but not all, of the helium lines are observable.       It appears to
us that this may well be accounted for by the hypothesis that the
differences of temperature and pressure in the stars might produce
variations in the spectrum of helium. If a jar and spark gap be
interposed while observing the visible spectrum of helium, a pro
found alteration is to be noticed.        The yellow line D3 is to be seen
near the electrodes, and is faint in the capillary portion of the tube,
and one of the red lines disappears.        The change is not as remark
able as in the case of argon, but is quite distinct and characteristic.
Then, as before remarked, the green line becomes relatively stronger
at low pressures, so that the light evolved in the tube is no longer
the usual brilliant yellow, but dull greenish-purple. Is it not likely
that the conditions obtaining in the stars may account for the absence
of some of the lines ordinarily visible ?
   If the hypothesis of Runge and Paschen is correct, then the two
gases to which they attribute the complex spectrum of helium must
have nearly the same density.       It has already been shown that by
means of the apparatus used for the fractional diffusion of gases it is
possible to effect a fair separation of the constituents of air after a
few rounds.     If the supposed constituents of helium differ in den
sity in as high a proportion as 14 to 16, it is certain that some separa
tion would have been effected. As there has been no such separation,
the legitimate inference is that the density of the two supposed con
stituents does not differ by so great an amount, or that their exist
ence is imaginary. It appears to us that too little is known regarding
the nature of the vibrations which cause spectra to make it legitimate
to theorise on the subject.    It is surely conceivable that an atom may
possess such a structure as to render it capable of propagating two

different sets of vibrations, each complete in itself, and each resem
bling the other in general form.        Yet it mnst be acknowledged that
our experiments have not disproved the existence of two gases in
helium of approximately the same density ; in fact it may be contended
that helium is a pair of elements like nickel and cobalt.
   We are disappointed in the result of this long research, because we
had   thought it not improbable that an element of density 10 and
atomic weight 20 might prove to be the cause of the fact that different
samples of helium possess different densities, according to the mineral
from which they are extracted, and also of the separation of helium
into portions of different densities by diffusion.     We still regard it
as by no means improbable that further research will lead to the dis
                 " missing " element, and this appears to be a fitting
covery of the
opportunity of stating our reasons for the belief.
   The difference between the atomic weights of helium and argon is
40 — 4 = 36.     Now, there are several cases of such a difference.       If
we compare the groups of which the first members are fluorine,

    The elements     helium and argon have been given        a provisional
 place.
    The differences between the extreme members of these small groups
 are given   in the short table which follows : —
 Manganese — Fluorine      ....    36"0   Chromium — Oxygen    ....     36 3

324                     The Homogeneity    of Ifeliwn.
will   be   seen, is not  far removed   from those of the other    pairs of
elements.      It appears, therefore, not improbable that     there should
be   an element with atomic weight 20, resembling both argon and
helium in its properties.       Yet it is not so certain that the middle
element should resemble argon and heliam, for in the table given it
 is seen that there are several examples of elements with a middle
 place which do not resemble those at the extremes.        The question is
perhaps best left open.
    It will be remembered that      the gases evolved from a great many
minerals and mineral waters have been examined, and that in many
cases they have been found to contr.iu helium and argon.             In no
instance up to (ho present has any sample of the gases evolved on
heating in vacnum been found to show unknown spectrum lines.
The amount of argon, as proved by the account which we have jnst
given of our experiments, is very small, and in the case of the gas
from cleveite investigated by Langlet it is probable that argon was
almost completely absent, for it possessed the density 2. In mala-
cone, on the contrary, argon is present in larger amount than heliam,
although neither gas is obtainable from it in large qnantity.            It
appears    to us  not beyond  the limit of probability that in some  as yet
uninvestigated mineral the middle member of the helium group may
be discovered.       When it is considered that germanium, au element
which has been recognised only in one of the rarest of minerals,
argyrodite, is the middle element of the trio, silicon, germanium, and
tin, of which the first and last members are common, it is surely not
unreasonable to hope that the middle member of the helium trio may
ultimately be found.       The amount of helium in forgusonite, one of
the minerals which yields it in fair quantity, is only 33 parts by
weight in 100.000 of the mineral, and it is not improbable that some
other mineral may contain the missing gas in still more minute pro
portion. If, however, it is accompanied in its sti i 1 undiscovered
sources by argon and helium, it will probably be a work of extreme
difficulty to effect its separation from these gases.
    Addendum. — Since this paper was written, Professors Runge and
Paschen, in a communication to the British Association in August of
this year, have withdrawn their contention that helium is a mixture,
or, perhaps more correctly stated, they now ascribe to helium the
same   complexity as that of oxygen, the spectrum of which may also
be arranged in two series, each consisting of three sets of lines.       As
                                                                          is
oxygen has not yet proved to bo complex, the surmise that helium
complex therefore falls to the ground.

"
  Fergusonite, an Endotliermic Mineral." By William Ramsay,
      Ph.D., L.L.D., Sc.D., F.R.S., and Morris W. Travers, B.Sc.
      Received December 15, 1897,— Read January 20, 1898.
   The-  mineral fergusonite, discovered by Hartwall, occurs in felspar
and  mica deposits, in the same manner as most of the rare Norwegian
minerals, such as euxenite, orthite, samarskite, &c. The position in
which such minerals are found, embedded in masses of felspar, or
encrnsted   with mica, leaves the question of their origin an open one.
Whether they are deposited in the felspar by water, or whether they
are contemporaneous      with the felspar, is a matter of speculation.
Fergusonite is a black lustrous mineral, not unlike obsidian in out
ward appearance, but of considerably higher density.               Seen under
the microscope, even with the highest power, there is absolutely no
sign of crystalline structure, though iu thin slices the substance
is translucent,   and transmits yellow-brown light.            It is, however,
macrocrystalline,    occnrring in quadratic sphenoids.             It is quite
homogeneous,    and displays no sign of cavities.         Like similar mine
rals, it contains helium, which is expelled on the application of heat.
   But this mineral presents a peculiarity, which has led us to publish
this note. When heated to a temperature not exceeding 500° or
600°, it suddenly becomes incandescent,           and evolves much of its
helium ; while its density decreases.
   The analysis of the mineral was kindly undertaken by Miss Emily
Aston, to whom we desire to express our indebtedness. The mineral has
been previously analysed by Hartwall, its discoverer, and by Weber,
and, for the sake of comparison, we quote the earlier analyses*: —

   The oxides of niobium and tantalum were converted into double
fluorides of these metals with potassium fluoride ; and on examination
of the crystals under the microscope, they were seen to be almost
entirely of one form. They were easily soluble in water, and, from
previous experience with these compounds, we were able to recognise
them as potassium niobium oxy-fluoride.                   There appears to be
hardly any tantalo-fluoride present in the possible mixture. The
uranium dioxide was estimated by heating the mineral with dilute
sulphuric acid in a sealed tube, and titrating the dioxide with potas
sium permanganate.         The trioxide was calculated by difference from
the total uranium.       The cerium metals were separated, as usual, by
means of a saturated solution of potassium sulphate.
   It is thus seen that fergusonite is mainly a niobate of yttrium,
containing oxides of uranium, but in no great quantity.

   The remaining        mineral was       mixed  with hydrogen potassium
sulphate,    and heated to redness.        More   gas was evolved ; oxygen,
resulting from the decomposition of the sulphuric anhydride, was

its helium was determined.  The plan of operation was to burn in
oxygen a known weight of hydrogen, ascertained by measuring                                          it,
ander a small platinum crucible, in  calorimeter. The rise of tem
                                                      a
perature was noted.   This operation was repeated several times, so
as   to standardise          the calorimeter.             Some grams          of mineral          were
then placed     in the crucible, and the operation was repeated                         ;    the heat
evolved by the incandescing mineral added itself to that from the
horning  hydrogen, and the rise of temperature was greater.
Knowing the heat of combustion of hydrogen, a simple calculation
gave    the heat evolved             by the exothermic change                     in the mineral.

 328             Fergusonite, an Endothermic Mineral.
   Various questions are raised by the behaviour of this interesting
 mineral.    Its evolution of heat, accompanying its parting with
 helium, suggest the idea that it is a true endothermic compound of
helium. Had its density, as is the case with alumina, and with other
oxides which rise spontaneously in temperature when heated, in
creased instead of decreasing, the evolution of heat might justly have
been ascribed to polymerisation.    But an evolution of heat, accom
panied by a jail in density, leads to the conjecture that the loss of
energy is the result of the loss of helium ; and that, conversely, the
formation of the compound must have been concurrent with a gain
of energy.     That the helium is actually in combination, and not
retained in pores in the mineral, is evinced by there being no pores
in which the helium might be imprisoned. Surface-absorption is
equally out of the question, for the mineral is compact. The only
remaining possibility is that the helium is in chemical combination.
And if this is true, then the compound must be an endothermic one.
   The question next arises, with what constituent of the mineral is
the helium in combination ? This question cannot at present be
answered.     All that can be said is that the amount of helium does
not appear to depend on the total percentage of uranium, although
minerals containing uranium usually (probably always) contain this
element.     Even in English pitchblende there was found a trace of
helium. And in malacone, a mineral containing no uranium, a trace
of helium was found ; also in a specimen of meteoric iron. The
presence of niobic and tantalic anhydrides, and of the yttrium group
of elements, is also favourable to its presence. But the proportion
between the weight of the helium and that of the other elements
present makes any calculation of the atomic relations between the
helium and the other elements out of the question.
   There is one other substance at least which decreases in density
while it evolves heat ; that substance is water, in changing into ice.
The effect of compressing ice is to lower its melting point, and at the
same time to reduce its heat of fusion. At a sufficiently high pressure
there would be a continuous transition from ice to water, no heat
change taking place during the transition.     Matters would be in a
similar condition to those which accompany the change of a liquid
into gas at the critical temperature ; the smallest alteration of tem
perature would be enough to bring about the change. In speculating
on the origin of such a remarkable compound, is it not allowable to
guess that it represents a condition of our earth realised only before
solidification had set in ? That these minerals, containing the rare
elements, represent a portion of the interior of our planet ; and that
under the enormous pressure obtaining at the centre, combination
with helium was an exothermic event ; and that such compounds,
having by some unexplained accident come to the surface of the

globe, where they are no longer exposed to such pressure, they have,
in consequence of the change, become endothermic ? The frequency
of the helium spectrum in the stars, and its presence in the sun,
makes it less improbable that some such explanation may lie not far
from the truth.
   There are at least two other minerals, gadolinite and ceschmite,
which exhibit endothermic properties.              Bnt these minerals, instead
of decreasing in density on ignition, increase.              The following table
shows the gases evolved when they are heated, their densities before
and   after heating, and the loss of weight which they suffer : —

It is to be noticed that only the reschinite contains helium, and that
in very small quantity.
   The fact that these minerals increase in density, and that only one
yields helium, places them in a different class from fergnsonite.
Moreover, the rise of temperature is not to be compared to that seen
with fergusonite, for the glow is barely visible.

   Two experiments were made on cats. The central end of the
vagus, cut a little below the larynx, was turned forward and joined
to the peripheral end of the cervical sympathetic.        The object of the
experiments was to see whether the vagus nerve fibres are capable of
forming connexions          with any of the structures with which the
spinal   nerve fibres of the cervical sympathetic are normally con
nected.      The results seem to me to be conclusive as regards this
point.
   The time allowed       for regeneration was in one case 73 days, and in
the   other 123 days.       At the end of these periods anaesthetics were
again given, and the nerves stimulated.
   Stimulation of the sympathetic in the lower region of the neck,
i.e., of   its central end, gave no effect of any kind. Hence the
central end of the sympathetic had formed no functional connexions
with the peripheral end.
    Stimulation of the sympathetic a little below the superior cervical
ganglion caused reflex effects of the kiud caused by vagus stimula
tion.    These reflexes were obvious in the case in which 123 days
had been allowed for regeneration, less clear in that in which seventy-
 three days only had been allowed.          They ceased on section of the
 vagus close to   the  ganglion of  the  trunk.  Thus afferent fibres of the
 vagus had grown outwards amongst, or joined with, the fibres of the
 peripheral end of the sympathetic.
   The stimulation also caused all the effects normally produced by
 stimulation of the cervical sympathetic, so that, although the central
 end of the sympathetic had not joined the peripheral              end, the
 peripheral end bad acquired more or less completely its normal
 function.
    Stimulation of the vagus a little below the ganglion of the trunk
 — the nerve being cut centrally of the point stimulated — caused
 dilation of the pupil, retraction of the nictitating membrane, con
 traction   of the arteries of the ear, erection of the hairs of the face,
 secretion of the sub-maxillary gland, and the other effects normally
 caused by stimulating the cervical sympathetic.
    After injection of nicotine no effect was obtained by stimulating
 the nerves centrally of the superior cervical ganglion ; the usual
 effects following when the ganglion itself was stimulated.
     Hence, efferent fibres of the vagus had either grown along the

                               Prof. W. M. Hicks.
peripheral      end of     the cervical sympathetic, and formed nerve-
endings aronnd the cells of the superior cervical ganglion, or they
had united directly with the sympathetic fibres. That the former
had taken place        I  infer from the fact that the regenerated nerve
contained medullated fibres larger than those proper to the sympa
thetic.
   T  conclude     from the experiments that there is no essential differ
ence between the efferent        " visceral " or " involuntary " nerve fibres,
whether they leave the central nervous system by way of the
cranial nerves, by way of the sacral nerves, or by way of the
spinal nerves to the sympathetic system. All of these fibres I take
to be pre-ganglionic fibres.           And   I  think that any prc-ganglionic
fibre is capable, in proper conditions, of becoming connected with
any nerve cell with which a pre-ganglionic fibre is normally con
nected ; although apparently this connexion does not take place
with equal readiness in all cases.             On the whole it appears to me
that the functions exercised both by pre-ganglionic and by post
ganglionic fibres depend less upon physiological differences than
upon the connexions which they have an opportunity of making
during the development of the nervous system and of the other
tissues of the body.
   A fuller account         of the observations will be published in the
'Journal of Physiology,' after some further experiments have been
made.

       static Vortex Aggregates."                By W. M. HlCKS, F.R.S.
       Received January 12, — Read February 3, 1898.
                                     (Abstract.)
   A  portion of the communication           (Sect.  II)  extends the theory of
the simple spherical vortex discovered by                Hill.   The chief part
(Sects.   I and   III)  refers, however, to a kind of gyrostatic aggregate.
The investigation has brought to light an entirely new system of
spiral vortices.      To give an idea of the species of motion considered,
take    the case of motion       of an infinitely long cylindrical vortex of
sectional radius a.        The velocity perpendicular to the axis inside the
vortex    will be   of the form v = /(r) where /(o) = 0. Outside it will
be given by     v =   V«/r where V = f(a).
   We may, however, have a motion in which the fluid moves parallel
to the axis inside the cylinder with rest outside.              The velocity will
be of the form u       =   F(r) inside, where F(a)       =  0, and zero outside.
Both/(r)      and   F(r)  are  arbitrary  functions   subject  only to the condi
tions /(0) = 0 and F(o) = 0.              Putting   aside   for  the present the

question of the stability of these simple motions or of their resultant,
it is clear that if we superpose the two we get another state of
steady motion in which we have vortex filaments in tbe shape of
helices lying on concentric cylindric surfaces. The problem to be
considered is whether it is possible to conceive a similar superposi
tion of two motions in the case of any vortex aggregate whose
motions are symmetric about an axis.
   The general conditions for the existence of such systems are
determined    in Sect. I, and are worked out in more detail for. a
particular case of spherical aggregate in Sect. III. It is found that
the motion in meridian planes is determined from a certain function
   in the usual manner. The velocity along a parallel of latitude is
given by t; = /(^)/> where p is the distance of the point from the
straight or polar axis. The function     satisfies an equation of the
                                                     y{r

    The most striking and remarkable fact brought out           that as   is            X
increases we get a periodic system of families of aggregates.         The
members of each family differ from one another in the number of
layers and equatorial axes they possess.     According to the number of
independent axes they are called singlets, doublets, triplets, Ac, in
contradistinction to more or less fortuitous or arbitrary compounds
of the former, which are considered later and called monads, dyads,
triads, &c.    Of these families two are investigated more in detail
than the others, both because they are specially interesting in their
properties and because they serve as limiting cases between the
different series.    In one family (the Xa family) all the members
 remain at rest in the surrounding fluid. In the other (the        family)     X,
 a distinguishing feature, common to all the members,            that the is
stream lines and the vortex lines are coincident.
     Tbe parameter     gives tbe total angular pitch of the stream lines

 on the outer current sheet, although in aggregates with more than
 one equatorial axis these lines are not one continuous line. The first
 aggregates — with X<5-7637 (the first X2 value) — behave abnormally.
 Beyond these we get successive series, in one set of which the
  velocity of translation    in the same direction as the polar motion of
                                      is

the aggregate      regredes in the fluid   as compared     with its central
aggregate.
    Snppose the attempt made to obtain sets of aggregate? with greater
and greater angular pitch. It will be found that as the external
pitch of the stream lines increases the equatorial axis contracts and
the    surface velocity diminishes.     On the outer layers (ring-shaped)
the spiral pitch is chiefly produced on the inner side facing the polar
axis until on the boundary itself the stream lines lie along meridians
and the twist is altogether on the polar axis.           The pitch can be
increased up to a certain limit. As this is done the stream lines and
the vortex lines fold up towards one another, coincide at a certain
pitch, and exchange sides.
    When an external angular pitch         of about 330° is attained     it is
impossible to   go further if  a simple aggregate is desired.     If a higher
pitch is desired the aggregate splits into two concentric portions — an
inner spherical portion and an outer shell. The central nucleus is
similar    to those just described — it produces a part of the required
pitch.
    The outer layer has spirals with the same direction of twist which
complete the balance of the pitch. In these, however, the motion is
in the opposite direction. With increasing pitch this layer becomes
thicker and its equatorial axis contracts relatively to the mid point
nf the shell until another limit is reached ; tho stream and vortex lines
:igain fold together, cross, and expand as this second limit is reached.
 If  a  larger pitch still is desired there must be a third layer, and so
on. The first coincidence of Btream and vortex lines takes place for
an aggregate whose pitch is 257° 27'.         Whenever a maximum pitch
is attained the aggregate is at rest in the fluid.     This is first attained
when the pitch is 330° 14'.         Beyond this there are two equatorial
axes.     For a pitch 442° 37' the stream and vortex lines again coin
cide, the internal nucleus gives 257° 27' of the pitch, and the outer
shell the remainder, and so on.
    At the end of the paper a theory of compound aggregates is
developed. It is not worked oat in detail in the present communica
tion, but the conditions are determined for dyad compounds, whilst
a   similar theory holds for triad and higher    ones.   Each element of a
 poly-ad may consist of singlets, doublets, &c. The equations of
 condition allow three quantities arbitrary — as for instance ratio of
 yolumes, rat o of primary cyclic constants, and ratio of secondary
 cyclic constats.      The full development of this theory is, however,
 left for a future communication.
     If we take any particular spherical aggregate with given \ and
 primary cyclic constant fi, the energy is determinate.             We may,
 however, alter the energy.        If it be increased the spherical form
 begins to open out into a ring form whose shape and properties hare

 not yet been investigated.        If  the energy be increased sufficiently
 the aperture becomes large       compared with the thickness of the core
and approximate        calculation is applicable.    The differential equa
 tion for y in terms of toroidal co-ordinates is given, but the full
 development is left for a future occasion.                              . ;
     In the paper itself the problem is treated purely as a question of
 hydrodynamics, and the results simply as the properties of certain
possible fluid motions.       It may not, however, be out of place here to
offer a few remarks, of a more speculative kind, on the bearing of the
results on physical theories.
    In the first place, gyrostatic motion of the kind here considered is
not confined to aggregates, which are symmetrical about an axis.
Although the theory is very complicated, it is easy to see that they
must exist.      In the address to Section A, at the Ipswich meeting of
the British Association, a vortex cell theory of the ether was indi
cated. The ether consisted of closely packed elements, each element
being a vortex aggregate.        To fix ideas, the case of elements of the
shape of a rectangular box was taken, although this particular shape
is not essential.        The vortical motion there considered was tot
gyrostatic, but it is clear that a gyrostatic modification is possible.
The primary rotations must be arranged in opposite directions in
alternate cells.     This is, bowever, not necessarily the case with the
secondary gyrostatic motion.         They may either be or not be in the
same direction, although conditions of stability might decide thie
question.     If the common direction is not a necessity, it is easy to
conceive that certain operations on boundaries immersed in the ether
 might make them so, and in this way produce the same effect as
 vortex filaments stretching between them. Such a theory would not
necessitate return vortex filaments such as are required in any
 theory which attempts to explain electrical actions by such filaments.
 It is very conceivable that they would produce the stresses along and
perpendicular to tubes of force which are required in an electric
field. If a cell, such as that of the \t aggregates in this paper, were
 possible, the necessity that the primary rotations should be alter
 nately directed would not exist, at least so far as continuity of motion
 had to decide.
     In the second place, does the new theory throw any light on a
 vortex atom theory of matter ? In this respect two remarks should
 be made.     The first is, that if vortex atoms are realities the exact
 quantitative theory developed in this paper cannot accord with actual
 facts, because   it is developed with reference to   a surrounding irrota-
  tional ether, which cannot be the case in nature. Nevertheless, many
 of the general properties would doubtless be similar, and possibly
  the same for aggregates of the Xj family.                  . ,
      The second remark is, that the results of the paper refer only to

                               Prof. W. M. Hicks.
spherical aggregates, that is, all the various elements are compared,
not when iheir energies are in thermal equilibrium, but in the arti
ficial association such that the energy of each particular element is
that which is necessary to give it a spherical shape. Nevertheless,
it is possible to get general ideas. The most striking one is the fact
of the periodic property of the atoms.         The J3 curve, for instance, or
the curve in the figure which shows how the translation velocity
alters with increasing pitch of spiral, irresistibly suggests curves con
nected with the physical properties of the elements.            The abnormal
commencement, the regular ascending and descending series suggest
the connection at once, and open a vista of possibilities before
unsuspected. For the reasons mentioned above, it would be waste of
 time to look as yet for any definite information.        Before that can be
done we must know more about the conditions of stability, and the
 behaviour of such aggregates when their energy changes.                  It is
 hardly fitting perhaps to indulge in wild speculations in these pages.
 In doing so, however,       I  hope they will be taken for what they are
 intended, merely as vague intimations of possibilities.
    Let us then take the well known curve showing how the fusibili
 ties of the elements alter periodically with the atomic weights.
    In a solid body the atoms or molecules can have very little tranf-
latory motion.        They will therefore take such forms, or their energy
 will be such as to make this translation small. Now take a spherical
aggregate.       If it has a large translation velocity its energy must be
 diminished to render this less — it will take a more elongated form
with a small velocity of translation.        In order, therefore, to fuse the
snbstance more energy must be put into it. Its temperature of fusion
is higher. In other words, it is natural to suppose that those atoms,
 which when in the spherical form have a high velocity, will possess
 high fusing points, and so on. Without criticising this argument
 too closely, let us make the assumption that it is so, and see what it
leads to.
    Now look at the figure which gives the relation between the
 velocity of translation (ordinates) to the spiral pitch (abscissae). We
 are at once struck with the fact that we have aggregates with large
 maximum velocity followed with sets of small maximum velocity (in
the opposite direction).        This is one of the most remarkable features
of the fusibility curve. Suppose that the curves march together :
 this supposition enables us to locate roughly the regions in which
the elements lie, omitting the early ones as abnormal.              If this be
done we find the metals lie on the lower peaked parts and the non-
metals on the small flat portions above the line of abscissa).              The
 following results follow :    —
    The metals belong to aggregates having an even number of layers           or
 axes, i.e., the outer rotational motion is opposite to that at the centre.

 Tlte non-metals belong to aggregates having an odd number of the
mme, i.e., the outer rotational motion is in the same direction as that at
(he centre.
   In     the even series         of   elements      {Series 4, 6, 8) the vortex lines lie
between the stream lines and the meridians or, as we may express                          it,   the
stream lines lie farthest out.
   In the metals    the odd series the stream lines lie between the vorte.v
                          of
lines and meridians, or the vortex lines are the outermost.
   In the non-metals     the odd series the vortex lines lie between the
                                  of
stream lines and the meridians, or the stream lines outermost.
   The metals   high fusibility hare their stream and vortex lines nearly
                     of
<o-incident.  The alkalis have their outer layer thin, the calcium group
thicker, and so on.
   Having fixed their general position, we may now compare witl
the curve giving the atomic volnmes.       When this     done      foundis       it is
that the atomic volume marches                         with the moment of angular mo
mentum of the aggregates.                        In other words —
 The moment     momentum
                      of                     due to the gyrostatic     effect rises and   falls
with the volume           of   the atom.
  All that     yet known respecting the stability of vortex rings leads
                is
to the   conviction that      not open to us to explain the various
                                       it   is
densities of matter as we know         by different densities in the
                                                      it
material composing the vortex atoms themselves.   We must suppose
the matter of all atoms to be the same material as the ether itself.
The masses must therefore be proportional to the volumes. It follows
that atomic volnmes, as ordinarily understood, must depend on the
spaces  occupied in solid bodies by their atoms.    Now    ring will            a
clearly take up more space than a sphere of the same volume, and we
ought to expect high atomic volumes to go with large aperture rings.
Combining this with the last result,   would follow that —

    The investigation which is described in the present paper has been
carried out with pure specimens of the alkaloids aconitine, aconine,
and benzaconine, the chemistry of which has been fully studied since
 1891, by one of us in conjunction with his assistants and pupils, and
forms the subject of numerous papers which have been communicated
to the Chemical Society, and printed in the 'Journal of the Chemical
 Society.'* As these papers contain a full account of the chemical
composition and properties of the various aconite alkaloids, it will not
be necessary to do more now than summarise for reference the chief
properties of the substances employed iu this enquiry.
    Aconitine is the poisonous alkaloid contained in Aconitum napellus.f
Commercial specimens of aconitine vary considerably, many of them
being mixtures.     J   Until quite recently the pure alkaloid was not an
article of commerce. It is a crystalline base, very sparingly soluble
in water, but readily dissolved by alcohol.             Its alcoholic solution is
dextro-rotatory, whilst solutions of its salts are l»vo-rotatory.§
Even very dilute solutions produce a characteristic                    tingling and
numbness on the tongue and lips.               The alkaloid suffers decomposi
tion when heated to its melting point; a molecular proportion of
acetic acid is lost, and an alkaloid pyraconitine remains. ||                   The
hydrolysis of the alkaloid occurs in two stages.                In the first, which
is best effected by heating a salt of aconitine in a closed tube with
water,T a molecular proportion of acetic acid is formed, and an

alkaloid produced which is named                  henzaconine, the chief constituent
of the picraconitine           and napelline of previous observers.*              Fnrther
hydrolysis, by         alkalis  or  acids, resolves    benzaconine     into  aconino   and
a molecular proportion of benzoic                    acid, and these are the final
products of hydrolysis.
    A characteristic qualitative reaction of aconitine is the formation
of a crystalline purple precipitate of aconitine permanganate when
a faintly acidified solution of an aconitine salt is mixed with a solu
tion of potassium permanganate.f                    Most aconitine salts crystallise
well from a solution in water, and in experiments on the physiological
action of this alkaloid an aqueous solution of the hydrobromide has
been employed.
   Neither the composition nor constitution of aconitine can be re
garded as settled.            In determining the exact formula by which the
composition         is  best   expressed, there is the difficulty of deciding
between several           formulas which, represent           the   composition     of the
alkaloid within the limits of experimental error.                        Alder Wright}:
adopted the formula C^H^NOh as best expressing the composition.
Later observers, Jurgens,J Liibbe,J and ourselves have so far
accepted a formula identical with or differing but slightly from
that of Wright, as indicating the composition of aconitine and its
derivatives.            Recently Freund and Beck§ have proposed for
aconitine the formula CMH«NO„ instead of that employed by us
CajH^NOji, since they have obtained from the ultimate analysis of
the pure alkaloid nearly 2 per cent, more carbon than was found by
Alder Wright and his colleagues, by Jiirgens, by Liibbe, or by our
selves.      The question of composition is, therefore, still unsettled
and can probably only be finally decided by the analysis of simpler
derivatives of aconitine than have been hitherto dealt with. The
constitution of aconitine cannot be considered until more is known
of the simpler derivatives               and decomposition products.             For the
purposes of the present               discussion    it may      be  regarded as acetyl-
benzaconine,      but nothing is at present             known of the constitution of
aconine.
    Diacetyl- aconitine is an alkaloid obtained from aconitine by acting
upon it with acetyl chloride,|| and differing from it in containing
two acetyl groups in the place of two atoms of hydrogen.                           It is a

i'>iO         Dr. Cash and Prof. Dunstan.            Pharmacology of
Lol.      A solution of its hydrobromide in water was used for the
determination of its physiological action.            This solution, like that of
an aconitine salt, produces a persistent tingling and nnmbness of the
tongue and lips.
    Benzaconine, the product of the partial hydrolysis of aconitine,
occurs with aconitine in Aconitum napellus* and is the principal con
stituent of the substances named napelline and picraconitine by pre.
vious observers. It was first named by us itaconitine, as its percentage
composition was found to agree within the limits of experimental
error with that of aconitine.t The base is amorphous and separates
from a solution in alcohol and ether as a varnish ; it dissolves
sparingly in water.            Solutions of the alkaloid and of its salts arc
very bitter, but do not produce the tingling of the tongue and lips
 which is so characteristic of aconitine.           Like aconitine, solutions of
 benzaconine are dextro-rotatory, whilst those of its salts are laevo-
 rotatory.        When liydrolysed benzaconine furnished aconine and
benzoic acid. Although the base has not boen crystallised, the salts
 of benzaconine crystallise easily.             For the experiments on the
 physiological       action   an   aqueous  solution  of the hydrobromide has
 becii employed.          Since benzaconine differs from aconitine only in
 the absence of an acetyl group, attempts have been made to re-form
aconitine from benzaconine by replacing this group. These attempts
have, however, failed.             Benzaconine doss not furnish, under the
several conditions tried, a monacetyl derivative, and the compounds
which have been prepared containing more than one of these groups
do not exhibit any of the characteristic properties of aconitine, and
would seem to be isomeric, not identical ; thus the triacetyl benz
aconine is isomeric with diacetylaconitine, and tetracctylbenzaconinc
isomeric not identical with triacetylaconitine.J
    Aconine is the final basic product of the hydrolysis of aconitine,
 with which it occurs in Aconitum napsllus.§                It is an amorphous
 alkaloid readily soluble in water and in alcohol, though not in ether.
Its solutions are sweet in taste, alkaline in reaction, and dextro
 rotatory — like aconitine and benzaconine, aconine salts being also
 ItBvo-rotatory.        The salts are crystalline; a solution of the hydro
bromide has       been   used for the experiments described iu this paper.

     As aconitine has been so largely used by previous workers, its
action will be treated of in greater detail than will be necessary
when considering its derivatives or its allies obtained from other
varieties of aconite.
     The modes of action of aconitine, diacetylaconitine, benzaconine,
and aconine, respectively,         have been tested with regard to the
following points : —
     1. Their effect upon the blood pressure, pulse, and respiration of
:inae8thetised   cats.
     2.  Their general effect, and especially their action upon temperature
and respiration of rabbits, and (occasionally) of guinea-pigs.
     3. Their general toxic action towards frogs with their effect in
detail upon circulation, respiration, cord reflex, motility, and cutane
ous sensation of these animals.
    4.  Their lethal    dose  towards    some or all of the various    animals
employed.
     Whilst the scope of this paper will        be  limited to these alkaloids,
 there are many other alkaloids and derivatives closely allied to
 aconitine which have been under examination, and it is intended to
present a farther communication             concerning them with as little
 delay as possible.       Among them may be named pseudaconitine, the
 alkaloid of A. ferox; japaconitine, the alkaloid of A. japonicum. or
 Fischeri, as well as several derivatives of aconitine.
     The following is a summary of the pharmacological action of the
alkaloids.
                            Action on the Circulation.
     Aconitine at first stimulates medullary centres slowing the heart,
 acceleration follows, auricles and ventricles taking up an irregular and
 (at one stage of toxic action) independent rhythm. Imperfect systole
  (especially in the ventricles) develops.          Irritability of ventricular
 wall is much increased. Extensive variations of blood pressure accom
 pany the preceding phenomena.            After great ventricular acceleration
  with very imperfect systole,      delirium    of the ventricles supervenes.
  The vagus (stimulated) continues to restrain speed of contraction
 (especially acting upon the auricle), and may favour closer sequence
 of ventricular upon auricular systole, so as to cause a rise in blood
  pressure. For the same reason during a stage of sequence, it may
 cause the      usual effect (fall of pressure).        In slow poisoning the
 cardiac vagus on stimulation ceases to produce any effect. Atropine
   is unfavourable to the independent rhythm of auricles and ventricles

342        Dr. Cash and Prof. Dunstan.            Pharmacology    of
and also to the ultimate redaction of ventricular action to incoordi
nate contraction   (delirium).
   The vaso-motor centre is at first stimulated, bat later depressed
in function, but peripheral splanchnic stimulation is active to some
degree throughout poisoning.
   Diacetylaconitme, whilst producing effects in the main resembling
those of aconitine, shows less tendency to cause independent rhythm
of ventricles upon auricles.     In half the experiments made a failure
of systole occurred without asequence, in the remaining half an
aconitine-like effect was witnessed.
   The cardiac vagus is less affected than by aconitine, but the result
of its stimulation depends much upon the sequence or non-sequence
of ventricular upon auricular action present at the time.
   The vaso-motor centre and peripheral vaso-constrictors respond
to this alkaloid much as they do towards aconitine, but stimulation
in the early stage of action is less marked.
   Benzaconine. — After very brief pulse acceleration, slowing with
reduction of blood pressure occurs, the latter being 4ne mainly to
the depression of the motor mpchanism within the heart.               After a
stage of irregularity, during which full diastole of both auricles
and ventricles is exceptional, a blocking of auricular impulses to
the ventricle succeeds, so that a rhythm of 2 to 1 is produced.
 (After aconitine this state of affairs is largely reversed.) Complete
though transitory failure in the production of a spontaneous beat
(the ventricles being first involved, then the auricles) is seen in a
large proportion of experiments.        This is not due to stimulation of
inhibitory apparatus, which is put out of action by atropine, for the
phenomenon occurs after atropine.        It is referable rather to depression
of the motor apparatus.       Contraction returns spontaneously, either
from spontaneous revival in excitability of this apparatus, or from
stimulation of the highly venous blood.
   The vaso-motor centre, though depressed in function, retains some
action, until the very low pressure is reached which invariably
precedes death.
   Vagus stimulation    causes slowing,   until in  a late stage of poisoning,
the   blood  pressure   remaining very       low,   its action fails.    After
effective stimulation, pressure rises beyond the original level from
acceleration of the heart and strengthening of the systole.
   Digitaline is the most effective antagonist towards benzaconine.
   Aconine is, relatively to the three compounds just considered,
harmless towards the heart.       At first it stimulates the vagal roots
slightly, causing a slower beat. As, however, it strengthens the
syBtole of the ventricle the blood-pressure rises, and is maintained at
a high level throughout a long experiment.             Asequence or disorder
of rhythm is not produced, but an antagonistic effect is shown

      Aconitine,   Sfc.,  in relation  to their Chemical Constitution.     343
towards aconitine        and diacetylacomtine.       In this action, aconine
opposes independent         rhythm of auricles     and ventricles facilitating
the transmission of the normal impulse, and it reduces the tendency
to delirium of the ventricle.        Only lethal doses reduce the activity
of  cardiac vagus terminations.          The vaso-motor centre is practically
unaffected.
   The circulation remains active in frogs for days, in entire absence
of reflex and respiratory movements.
                              Action on Respiration.
   Acor.itine at first stimulates the respiratory centre and the sensory
vagal   fibres in the lung.          Depression    rapidly follows, death in
mammals being due to central respiratory failure.              The peripheral
innervation of respiratory muscles is not interfered with.
   Dtacetylaconitine produces a slighter initial stimulation than aconi
tine.   Death results from central failure. Pulmonary oedema is
commonly observed in rabbits.            Respiratory spasm occurs at death.
   Benzaconine does not appear to stimulate either respiratory centres
or pulmonary vagus as do the two former.             The centres are depressed
from the    first; respiratory failure induces death without spasm ; to
this the reduced action of motor nerve endings in respiratory muscles
con tributes.
   Aconine, whilst slowing the respiration from its action upon the
centres, possesses a pronounced curare-like action upon motor nerve
endings in respiratory muscles.           No spasm attends death.
                          Action  on the  Nervous System.
   Aconitine in large doses causes occasional loss of consciousness,
with failure of conjunctival reflex and dilated pupil. This is not a
directly narcotic effect, but is secondary to reduced oxidising power of
the blood from circulatory and respiratory impairment.             For a time
there is evidence of       stimulation of motor areas, and especially of the
medulla with its contained centres ; to this depression succeeds ; reflex
centres in the cord are stimulated, and then depressed by large doses.
In frogs, voluntary movement outlasts reflex. Sensory nerves at the
periphery are depressed in function after very transitory stimulation,
whilst motor nerves are practically unaffected.
   Diacetylaconitine produces a stimulation of the medulla, but less
in degree than that caused by aconitine.          The subsequent depression,
especially of the respiratory centre, is well marked, the respiration
 being relatively more affected than the circulation. The general
reflex function of the cord is depressed after preliminary excitement.
 The action with reference to sensory nerves is the same as that of

314          Dr. Cash and Prof. Dunstau.         Pharmacology of
aconitine, bnt motor nerve terminations,       thongh they aro not power
fully affected, are reduced    in activity by diacetylaconitine.
    Benzaconine causes a lethargic and ultimately semi-narcotised con
dition, which is referable to low intracranial blood-pressure as well
as to a direct action upon the cortex.              Whilst the medullar}
centres are early depressed, both direct and cross cord reflexes an-
elicited in a limb excluded by vascular ligature from access of the
alkaloid. Sensory nerves are unaffected except in deep poisoning.
On the other hand, motor nerves and their terminations are reduced
in function, a peculiar intermittency of response following stimula
tion.
     Aconine produces in mammals loss of volition and impairment of
 conjunctival reflex only shortly before a large dose proves fatal.
 Motility is interfered with, but this is mainly due to a curare-like
 effect upon motor nerve endings.       The respiratory centre is depressed,
 respiration failing   when  the  heart still beats vigorously.
                        Action on Oxidation^ Processes.
     All  the four alkaloids here considered reduce the oxidisiug power
 of    vegetable protoplasm ; aconitine being most and aconine least
 active.     Diacetylaconitine is more energetic than benzaconine.
                       Action on Internal Temperature.
     Aconitine produces a fall (exceptionally preceded by a slight rise),
 ¦which increases as respiratory slowing develops, but the minimum
 is reached (50 — 70' in rabbits) after a partial recovery of respira
 tion.     Exposure to a cold atmosphere increases the fall and delays
  the recovery.     Diminished oxidation produced directly and through
  impairment of circulation and respiration indirectly are causal to the
 fall.
     A dose of aconitine less than half the lethal proportion will cause
  a fall of nearly 2° C. below the normal.
     Diacetylaconitine occasions less effect than aconitine on the tem
  perature when the dose bears an equal relationship to the respective
  lethal doses. This is due to a less vigorous action on heart and
  respiration. Like aconitine, it interferes both indirectly and directly
  ¦with  oxidation.
      Benzaconine produces a trifling reduction of temperature until a
  dose is reached which greatly reduces the pulse and speed of respira
  tion when a proportionate fall occurs. The reduction of muscular
  movement tends still further to limit heat production. Propor
  tionately to its toxic dose the effect is not so active as in the case of
   diacetylaconitine.

    Aconitine,                in relation to their C/iemical         Constitution.       345
  Aconine   is inoperative towards body temperature, except in very
large doses, which enfeeble respiration and cause a curare-like action
on motor nerve terminations.        Even then the effect is relatively
slight, as the  heart remains active and the vaso-constrictor system is
still in play (lethal dose causing                 death (guinea-pig) in 60' reduced
the temperature by l-7° C).
                                Action on Skeletal Muscle.
  Aconitine does not in ordinary lethal doses materially affect irrit
ability, capacity for work, or form of contraction of frog's muscle.
Exposure to the direct action of aconitine solutions canscs fibrillation
and lengthening of the muscle curve (an effect resembling slight vera-
trine action has been described). Fibrillation is abolished by aconine
and curare, and is therefore not attributable to the action of aconi
tine directly on muscular tissue, but to a stimulation of motor nerve
endings.
  Diacetylaconitine  reduces the irritability of muscular tissue, the
muscle (after poisoning in situ) is more readily fatigued, the curve of
contraction therefore losing in altitude whilst increasing in length.
  Benzaconine in large doses produces rapid fatigue with failure of
contractility which    however, restored by rest. Contact of strong
                              is,
solutions reduces excitability and capacity for work.

    Itwould therefore appear from our study of the pharmacology of
 these alkaloids, that the introduction of two additional acetyl groups
 into the molecule of aconitine docs not create any pronounced varia

846         Dr. Cash aDd Prof. Dunstan.        Pharmacology of
tion in the pharmacological      action, but results merely in a general
weakening of the characteristic action of the parent alkaloid.
    Considering next the effect of removing the acetyl group from
aconitine, which is seen in the behaviour of benzaconine, we find that
the characteristic    features of aconitine action are almost entirely
annulled.     The great toxic power of aconitine has been greatly
reduced, so that the lethal dose of benzaconine for both cold- and
warm-blooded animals is relatively so considerable as to remove it
from the class of poisons in the ordinary acceptation of the term.
    In the action of benzaconine on the heart and circulation very
little trace of the effects of aconitine can be observed ; whilst after
the administration of aconitine the ventricles ultimately beat more
rapidly than, and often independently of, the aurichs, the opposite
is the case in the action of benzaconine.        On the heart, indeed, it
acts   to some  extent  as the antagonist of  aconitine,  causing slowing,
especially of the ventricles, in opposition to the great acceleration
produced by aconitine, so that in a certain measure it is observed
that benzaconine behaves as an antidote to aconitine poisoning,
though not so effectively as atropine. This is a point of considerable
practical importance when it is remembered that benzaconine occurs
to a variable extent with aconino in A. napMus, from which plant
the ordinary medicinal preparations are made.
    The removal of the acetyl group has also abolished the stimulat
ing effect of aconitine on the respiratory centres and the pulmonary
 vagus.    On the other hand, in its general action on the respiration
and on temperature a certain resemblance is traceable between the
depressant action of benzaconine and aconitine.         Peripherally benz
aconine depresses the activity   of  motor nerve endings and, in a lesser
 degree, of skeletal muscular tissue, w hilst aconitine acts principally
upon sensory nerve terminations.
    In contrasting the action of aconine with that of benzaconine we
are studying the effect      of withdrawing a benzoyl group.        It has
been seen that in removing the acetyl group from aconitine we
produce an alkaloid which is no longer a virulent heart poison ; the
removal of the benzoyl or benzoic gronp from benzaconine furnishes
aconine which is so far from being a heart poison that it may be
ranked as a general cardiac tonic, and        in virtue of this action  as
the antagonist of aconitine.     In a much    greater degree than benz
aconine it is an antidote to aconitine,      so  much so that we have
 found that the administration of aconine     is successful in averting in
small animals the effect of a lethal dose of aconitine.      Amongst the
distinctive features in the pharmacological action of aconine is to be
noticed a curare-like effect on the motor nerve endings of the muscles
 which is not observed with either aconitine or diacttyl-aconitine.
 No fault of sequence between ventricles and auricles, such as is

      Aconitine,       in relation to their Chemical Constitution.    347
observed   (though in an opposite direction), after the administration
of aconitine and benzaconine can be observed in the action of aconine.
Aconine cannot be classed as a poisonous alkaloid, very large
doses being necessary to produce death even in frogs.
   The resnlts of this inquiry, which has occupied the authors for
tbe greater part of four years, brings out in a most striking manner
the almost complete dependence of the extraordinary toxic power
and pharmacological action of the aconitine molecule on the presence
of the radical (acetyl) of acetic acid, whilst, in a lesser degree, the
action of benzaconine is seen to depend on the existence in the
molecule of this alkaloid of the radical (benzoyl) of benzoic acid.
The inertness of the alkaloid, aconine, denuded of both the acetyl
and benzoyl groups of aconitine seems to the authors to be one of
the most interesting facts in chemical pharmacology.           From the
practical point  of view  the authors regard the demonstration of the
antagonism of aconine and benzaconine towards aconitine as an
important result of this investigation, which, taken as a whole, it is
believed will throw into clearer light the mode of action of the
alkaloids of Aconitum napellus.
   The chemical part of this inquiry, for which ono of us (D.) is
responsible, has been conducted at first in the Research Laboratories
of the Pharmaceutical Society, and afterwards           in the Scientific
Department of the Imperial Institute.        The pharmacological experi
ments have been made in the Department of Pharmacology, in the
University of Aberdeen.
   In conclusion, we desire to acknowledge the assistance which has
been rendered     to our work by the Royal Society, which has made
several grants from the Government Fund, and we wish to express
oar indebtedness    on the chemical     side to those whose names have

     This paper is divided into two parts.     Part 1 deals with a method
  of finding the steady values of alternating currents in any circuits or
  systems of circuits, without having to perform integrations of differ
  ential equations which may be somewhat complicated.
     It is assumed, however, that the electromotive forces and electric

           Contributions    to the Theory     of Alternating Currents.         349
 currents can be represented         as simple     sine (or cosine) functions   of
the time.
   The method consists in applying the fact that if a simple harmonic
function is differentiated twice in succession the result is propor
tional to the original function. By the application of this principle
the determination of the steady values of the currents is reduced to
solving a set of simultaneous simple equations.
   After introducing the method by solving some simple problems, it
is applied to the following : —
   (a) The determination of the equivalent resistance R, reactance
and impedance I, of a parallel circuit of n branches, taking into
account mutual induction, when each branch may contain resistance,
capacity, and self-induction.

functions of the resistances, self-inductions, capacities, and mutual
inductions of the several circuits.
   (6) The determination of the currents in the n circuits of an air
core transformer having one primary coil and n — 1 secondary coils.
   In addition to solving the problem, the conditions for resonance in
the primary circuit are obtained and discussed, and special attention
is given to the case of a transformer having only one secondary coil.
   (c) The determination of the outputs of n alternators working in
parallel on a non-inductive external circuit.
                                      Part II.
   This part is devoted to the consideration of the effects of higher
harmonics in E.M.F.s and currents on the values of the impedances
and reactances of circuits.
   The problems considered in Part I are again discussed on the
assumption that the impressed potential difference is of the form
     E = Eisin(j?<—      0!) +  E,8in  (2p<—   £>,)-(- ... +EMsin (mpt—   9m).
   It is  also shown that periodic E.M.F.s and corresponding currents
can in all cases be represented by simple sine curves having the same
root mean square values, and suitable phase positions depending on
the time constants of the circuits and on the periodicities of the
harmonics present.

    Though, numerous observations have been made on the develop
ment of the systemic aorta and on the aortic arches, including
their modifications and transformations at the head end of the embryo,
but little attention has been given to the development and modifica
tions of the primitive vessels and the aortic arches at the caudal end.
    The statement that the primitive aortae are prolonged backwards
from the dorsal region into the tail, and that, fusing there, they form
a caudal aorta — the middle sacral artery — seems to be generally
accepted by embryologists.       Obviously, if this view is correct, the
iliac arteries are not formed from, and do not represent any part of,
the primitive aortic, and they are generally regarded as being seg
mental in character.
    Previous observations on the comparative anatomy of the mam
malian aorta and its terminal branches made by one of ourselves in
1891, seemed to show that the true posterior continuation of each
primitive dorsal aorta was to be found, not in the middle sacral
artery, but in the iliac and hypogastric trunks. It was impossible,
however, to arrive at any satisfactory conclusion on the question in
the absence of definite and precise information regarding the develop
ment of the caudal end of the aorta and its branches.
    We therefore commenced a series of observations on the develop
ment of the posterior parts of the main systemic vessels in the
rat, monse, ferret, eat, and sheep.       In the first three of these the
sections examined represent a fairly complete series of the early
stages of development.      In the cat several embryos of two different
stages were referred to, whilst our eestions of sheep embryos repre
sented only one stage of development.
    In our description of these the embryos of each class are arranged
in groups according to the stage of development of their arterial
systems, and in each group the general stage of development is indi
cated by a short statement of the condition of some of the main
 organs.
    On developmental     grounds alone the following conclusions, which
form     a brief summary of the results of our observations, have been
 arrived at : —
    1. The primitive ao.tie are paired trunks which pass at either

           Development and Morphology    of the Vascular  System.     351
 end   of the embryonic area into the vascular network on the wall of
the    yolk-sac.
    2. With the formation of the cephalic        and caudal folds each
 primitive trunk, at first almost straight, is so folded in front and
behind that a dorsal and two ventral portions with uniting caudal
 and cephalic arches are differentiated.
    3. The dorsal part of each trunk is modified in the cephalic region
 into vessels of the head and neck ; the remainder of each dorsal
portion fuses with its fellow of the opposite side to form the greater
part of the systemic aorta.
    4. The cephalic or anterior ventral portions are converted into the
heart, the ventral part of the arch of the adult aorta, and vessels of
the head and neck.
    5.  The caudal or posterior ventral portions either fuse together to
form a common vitello-allantoic stem, as in rodents, or they remain
separate and form the ventral parts of the allantoic arteries as in
carnivores, ruminants,    and man.
   6.   The ventral and dorsal sections at first are united anteriorly by
a  cephalic arch and posteriorly by a primary caudal arch. Additional
cephalic arches are developed subsequently, to be afterwards utilised
in the formation of vessels of the head, neck, and upper extremity
and of part of the arch of the aorta of the adult, whilst additional
arches in the caudal region may also be formed to be utilised as
visceral arteries.
    7. The dorsal and ventral extremities of the primary caudal arches
remain ; the dorsal extremities take part in the formation of the
posterior end of the aorta of the adult; the ventral extremities are
utilised in the formation of the ventral portions of the allantoic or
hypogastric arteries.
   8. The middle parts of the primary caudal arches disappear and
are replaced     by
                    " secondary " caudal arches which lie to the outer
 sides of the Wolffian ducts. In rodents and man the secondary arches
are   transformed into the common and internal iliac arteries aud the
dorsal parts of the hypogastric arteries, whilst in carnivores they are
 probably transformed into the posterior part of the adult aorta and
 into the internal iliacs and dorsal parts of the hypogastric arteries.
    9. Tbe vessels which are to be looked upon as the posterior con
 tinuations of the primitive aorta in the adult in man, rodents, &c,
 are the common iliac, internal iliac, and hypogastric arteries, and in
 the carnivores, &c, the internal iliac and hypogastric arterie3.
    10. The common and internal iliac arteries are not segmental
 vessels, their branches may be.
    11. The middle sacral artery is a secondary branch,         probably
 representing fused segmental vessels.
    12. The systemic aorta is formed from the following parts of the

 352                   Messrs. B. Moore and S. Vincent.
 primitive vessels : the anterior ventral aorta, the fourth left cephalic
'aortic arch, the fused portions of the primitive dorsal aortas, and in
 some mammals the fused dorsal ends of the caudal arches.
     The permanent        adult aorta, in -so far as it is formed by the primi
 tive dorsal aortsa, ends posteriorly either at the bifurcation into the
 two common iliac arteries or at a point corresponding to this bifurca
 tion, when by more extensive fusion involving the dorsal parts of the
 secondary arches        there   are no common iliacs, and the external and
 internal iliac arteries appear to arise directly and separately from the
 aorta?.     In each case the continuity of the primitive aorta is inter
 rupted, and the primary caudal arches are replaced by secondary
 caudal arches, after which the continuations of the aorta are repre
 sented by the vessels into which the secondary caudal arches are
 ultimately transformed.
     Our conclusions are further snpported by more extended observa
 tions on the      anatomy of the posterior end of the aorta, and its
 terminal branches in mammals, and on the abnormalities they present
 in man, a general account of which is included in the memoir.

     In   a previous     communication*        we have shown that the paired
 segmental suprarenals         of  Elasmobranchs contain a chromogen which
 gives the same reactions as that of the medullary portion of the supra
 renal capsnle of higher vertebrates, while the inter-renal body in the
 same order of fishes contains no such chromogen.                    These facts were
 put forward in support of views previously expressed,t that the
 segmental bodies corresponded physiologically, as well as morpho
 logically and histologically, to the medulla of mammalian suprarenal,
 while the inter-renal corresponded to the cortex.

             Comparative   Chemistry    of the Suprarenal    Capsules, fyc.       353
bodies ("corpuscles of Stannius") of Teleosts do not contain the
physiologically active principle which is characteristic of suprarenal
medulla.   This is shown both by testing the action of an extract
made from them upon the blood-pressure of a living mammal, and
also by the effects of subcutaneous injection of an extract.* In both
cases negative results are obtained.
   The natural conclusion to      drawn from these observations would
                                       be
seem to be that the representative   of the suprarenal medulla is absent
in Teleostean fishes. But that an organ of such manifest and vital
importance in mammalsf should be totally unrepresented in by fur
the majority of living fishes, seemed to us so remarkable that we con
sidered it necessary to furnish some further evidence upon this point.
    In our previous paper upon the comparative chemistry of the
suprarenal capsules,J we had to regret that material for investigation
of the chemistry in Teleosts had been wanting. Since then, how
ever, we have obtained six large specimens of Gadus morrhua.          The
suprarenal bodies obtained from these weighed in a moist state
0"42 gram.     These were boiled with normal saline so as to make a
10 per  cent, decoction ; this was carefully filtered and the pale yellow
filtrate tested for the chromogen with chromic acid, ferric chloride,
Ac., as described in our previous paper, but no colour reactions what
ever were obtained.    The same experiment was tried with material
from Anquilla anguilla.        As some observers§ have believed the
lymphoid "head-kidney" to have something to do with the supra
renal bodies, we have tested this also for the chromogen, with entirely
negative results. ||
   Again, we have examined other portions of the kidney with the
greatest minuteness, but have failed to find any thing which resembled
the suprarenal medulla, either in its histological, physiological, or
chemical features.
   The chief facts in our possession are, then, as follows : —
   1. The known suprarenal bodies of Teleosts resemble anatomically
and histologically the inter-renal body of Elasmobranchs and tlie
cortical portion of the suprarenal capsules of higher vertebrates.
      An extract made from them, when injected into the blood-vessels
       SJ.
3f a living mammal, does not raise the blood-pressure.
   3. The extract does not produce physiological effects When injected
subcutaneously.

   Since an extract obtained from the suprarenal bodies of Tele
ostean fishes produces no rise of blood-pressure      when injected
into the blood-vessels of a living mammal,f and since the extract
produces no physiological effects when injected subcutaneously,J and,

contain nothing corresponding     to the medulla of the suprarenal

  ance of being an       actively secreting gland, one can at present offer no
  satisfactory suggestion as to the nature of its activity.                It is even a
  matter of surmise whether it has any functional relationship to the
 medulla, considering its distinct origin and location in Elasmobranch
 fishes.*
       It   is almost nniversally acknowledged that removal of the supra
 renal gland in mammals (Brown-Sequard,f Tizzoni,J and Oliver
 and Schafer§), and in frogs (Abelous and Langlois||), is invariably
 followed, sooner or later, by death, and that the symptoms during
 life are those of extreme muscular prostration. Of course in all
  these cases both cortex and medulla have been removed together,                    anl
it wonld be impossible to state how far the fatal effects were due to
 loss of the medullary substance, and how far to the loss of the
 cortical. But Teleostean fishes, having only cortex, seemed to offer
 an admirable opportunity of testing how far the cortical suprarenal
glands were essential to the life of the animal.
      Among Teleosts the eel is practically the only fish available for
 this purpose ; since in most species the suprarenal bodies lie on the
 dorsal surface of the kidney, and wonld be practically inaccessible
 during life. Again, the length of time an eel will live out of water,
and its power of resistance to the shock of operation, render it pecu
liarly suitable for extirpation experiments.
     The eels were antesthetised by being placed for a short time in
chloroform water. The operations were performed as aseptically as
possible, but without the use of chemical antiseptics.                  An incision an
inch or so in length was made to one side of the anus, reaching the
middle line in front of this aperture.               The abdominal cavity being
opened, the edges of the wound were held apart by means of retrac
tors.         The gut was pushed over to one side, and the ventral surface
of the kidney laid bare.            The suprarenal bodies wero then picked
out with a pair of fine curved forceps. After any bleeding had been
checked, the wound was sewn up and dressed with a layer of flexible
collodion.
     In three cases in which the animals survived the operation, they
have appeared quite lively soon after being put back in the tank.
One survived twenty-eight days, another sixty-four days, and a third
was killed on the 119th day. These experiments show that an eel
will survive the operation of extirpation for a very much longer

one mast attribute it to the absence of medulla in Teleosts, and must
assume that the cortical gland is not absolutely essential to the life of
the animal.  The longest time that a frog will survive removal of its
capsules     is,

days, and this period        isshortened in the summer to forty-eight hours.
Mammals    usually die in a day or two.
   The validity of these experiments depends obviously upon the
fact that all suprarenal material has been actually removed at the
operation.   ThiR has been verified in two ways.  In the first place,
previous study of the anatomy of the organs in many individuals has
shown that the suprarenals are never more than two in number.

 recent construction, and differs from the other principally in the
 omission of the guard tube in the immediate vicinity of the needle
surrounding a portion of the needle axis, and the wire connecting
the needle to the acid inside the jar.            The induction plate employed
in the old form is done away with, and the terminals are perma
nently fixed to the quadrants in this new instrument, otherwise, so
far as the author can see, they are identical. These instruments
belong to Dr. J. Hopkinson, F.R.S., the old form being the same
that he has used for many years, and in connexion with which he
read a paper before the Physical Society on March 14, 1885.*
                    Verification of Clerk Maxwell's Formula.
   In  the paper just alluded to, it is shown that the sensibility of the
instrument (No. 71) increased with the charge on the needle up to a
certain point, and that for further increase of the charge on the
needle the sensibility diminished.            The complete explanation of this
is not given, and the author believes Professors Ayrton and Perry
were the first to point out that this effect is due to the portion of the
guard tube in the immediate neighbourhood of the needle.
   To test this point in the new instrument a Kelvin vertical electro
static voltmeter was placed across the needle and case, and a con
stant electromotive force applied to the quadrants, one pair being put
to the case.      The jar was then charged by sparks from an electro-
phorus, and readings taken on the voltmeter and electrometer
scale.      The charge was continually increased until disruption
occurred between the needle and the lantern which supports the
idiostatic gauge.       Up to about 2,450 volts on the needle the sensi
bility  increased,    and   so far as the author could see the needle was
further deflected as the charge was increased up to the point of dis
ruption, the spot of light being then off the scale.                No great care
was taken     with   this  experiment,    since  it was  only  carried out for the
purpose of ascertaining if diminished sensibility could be obtained
with further increased charge. The results are given in fig. 1. In
Clerk Maxwell's ' Electricity and Magnetism,' vol. 1, p. 273, edition
1873, it is shown that the deflection of the needle of a quadrant
electrometer      should            as                     — Y where    C   is the

potential of the needle, and A and B the potentials of the two pairs
of quadrants.        In fig. 1 the E.M.F. between the quadrants was less
than 1 volt, and was constant.               By the formula the quotient C/0
should    in this  case   be  constant    where   6 is the observed deflection.
 It varies in arbitrary units from        0'55 to  0-ll as the value of C varies
from about 550 to 2,450 volts.              This is working the instrument far

the author in a certain series of experiments upon alternate current
Watt-hour meters, it was necessary to see that within this range of
potential the formula above given is verified.     The instrument was
connected as before with one pair of quadrants to the case, the other
pair being insulated and the electromotive forces applied to the
quadrants, as also to the needle, were supplied by storage cells, and
accurately measured by Poggendorff's method, the standard of com
parison being Clark's cell.   The results are given in Table I.
   The instrument in the above experiment was mounted on a slate
base in the upstairs room of the Siemens Laboratory.       The spot of
light when working on this base with this instrument is never per
fectly steady, and this may account for the errors observed in
Table  I.

     In the Siemens Laboratory there are two alternate current machines*
 coupled together in such manner that any desired phase difference
 between their armatures can be obtained.                     In fig. 2, M\ and Ma
 represent the armatures of         these   machines.        On the shaft of one of
 these alternators is fixed a revolving contact maker, M, which makes
 contact between two brushes once in a period, that is six times in a
 revolution of the alternator, since there are twelve poles. It consists
 of a gunmetal disk keyed to the shaft of the alternator, and carrying
 two rings, one of ebonite and the other of gunmetal insulated from
 the disk by means of the ebonite ring. Into the ebonite ring are in
 serted six contact-making strips of gunmetal one-sixteenth of an inch
 thick, equally spaced out on the circumference and soldered into the
 gunmetal ring.         An insulated copper brush bears on the gunmetal
 ring, and an insulated steel brush bears on the surface of the ebonite
 ring, touching each of the contact-making strips as the contact
 maker revolves.         The epoch at which such contact is made by the
 small steel brush can be varied and observed by means of a pointer
 moving over a fixed circle divided into 360 equal parts.                             The
 diameter of this revolving contact maker is 13 inches.
     Qi is the No. 184 electrometer used as a Wattmeter.
     Qa is the No. 71 electrometer used in connection with the revolving
 contact maker M for the purpose of determining the instantaneous
 values of the current and potential difference.
     D is a Kelvin balance or Siemens electro-dynamometer for the
 measurement of current ; E is the thick wire circuit or circuits of
 the Watt-hour meters being tested ; F is a Kelvin multicellular
 voltmeter ; f|, r2 are non-inductive resistances of comparatively large
 value for the purpose of reducing the potential difference applied to
the electrometer Qa, when measuring potential difference C ; the
pressure circuits, P, of the Watt-hour meters are placed across

non-inductive resistances of considerable magnitude for reducing
the potential difference applied to Q3 when necessary.                   The junction
between r3 and r4 is connected to the case of Qi ; the quadrants of
this instrument are connected respectively to the extreme ends of
**, U ; whilst the needle of the electrometer is connected to the other
pole of M[.        In connection with Qa, Si is a two-way switch for
observing potentials across rt or rb ; Sa is the ordinary switch sup
plied with the electrometer which short-circuits the quadrants when
moved to its central position, and in its two other positions reverses
the charge on the quadrants         ;  Gr is a condenser, which can be varied

                  Electrometer    as a Wattmeter and Voltmeter.               361
  from O'OOl to      1  microfarad,    its capacity being 1 microfarad during
  the experiments, the       results of   which are given in Table II.
      Before giving the results of the experiments it is well to explain
  the method adopted of treating the curves for the purpose of arriving
  at the average Watts due to the alternate current, the relation be
  tween which and the deflection of the electrometer used as a Watt
  meter    it is desired to find.    It  is also necessary to examine the limits
  of accuracy obtainable by this method.             In any one experiment the
  frequency employed        is kept  constant    as nearly as possible : the phase
  difference between current and potential is adjusted to any desired
  value and the amplitude of these quantities is kept constant by ob
  serving their square root of mean square values on the instruments
  D and F. The revolving contact maker M is then set to different
  positions of the phase, the number employed being at least ten equal
  divisions to the half period, and for each position, readings taken on
  the electrometer Qa when the switch Si is in each of its two positions.
  If the deflections so obtained be plotted in terms of the position of
  the revolving contact maker M, the forms of the two curves are
  those due to the instantaneous values of the potential difference
  applied to the needle of the electrometer Q„ and the current which
  gives the form of potential difference applied to the quadrants of Qi.
  By multiplying each of these deflections together, and by a suitable
  constant involving the square of the sensibility of Qa and the resist
  ances ri, ra ; r3, or rs ; r5, r6, the instantaneous rate at which work is
   being done by the alternate current can be inferred in Watts. The
   average of these over a half period gives the average rate, and this
   can be obtained by plotting the instantaneous product and taking
  the area with a planimeter, or the average of the algebraic sum
   during a half period can be taken.               The author found the latter
   method agreed so well with the former when the number of inter
   vals at which observations are taken is ten, that he has adopted it
   in this paper, that is to say, the two electrometer deflections for a
'
   given position of M are multiplied together, the average of these
   taken over half a period, and such average multiplied by a constant
    to reduce to Watts.
       The best way, perhaps, to test the limits of accuracy is to adjust
    current and potential until they are exactly iu phase.                The volt
    meter F and amperemeter D give the square root of mean square
    values, and the product of these should agree with the average
    results obtained from the curves.             The time required to take one
    set of observations is generally about twenty minutes, during this
    time an average for volts, amperes, and frequency is taken.                The
    author finds from experience that if care be taken an agreement
    between the results got from the curves, and from the product of volts
     and amperes, can be obtained to within one or two per cent.                 It

 362               Mr. E. Wilson.     The Kelvin Quadrant
 must be remembered        that for each, position of the contact maker,
four    observations on  the electrometer (Qj) scale have to be obtained ;
 that is, two for potential and two for current corresponding to the
 two positions of Sa for each position of Sb the difference in each
 case giving the net double deflection.        This method is best, as it
 eliminates any zero error there may be. In working the electrometer
 Q„ a wooden tapper or mallet is employed, since in every electro
 meter there must be viscosity due to the fluid, and by gently tapping
 the slate base for each deflection very consistent results can be ob
 tained.    This viscosity is greater in winter, and it is advisable to
 keep the instrument in a warm room, although with this method of
 tapping the author does not find this necessary.            The greatest
 trouble in the use of the electrometer undoubtedly arises from dust
 settling on the surface of the acid in the jar, thereby making the
 angular movement of the wire hanging from the needle smaller than
 it would be if such brake action did not exist. This takes place
 when the acid in the jar is old, and if the surface be agitated by
 blowing through a glass tube near where the wire dips into the acid
 it can be to a great extent remedied. Whatever the state of the
 acid the author finds he gets the most consistent results by gentle
 tapping.     The electrometer Qi is not so sensitive as the old form Qj,
 and the effect due to the acid in it has not given so much trouble.
  The sensibility of Qa when the idiostatic gauge is adjusted is such
 that one Clark cell gives a deflection from zero of 10^ inches on a
 scale 12 feet from the mirror.      The potential of the needle is in this
 case about 350 volts.
                             Experimental Results.
     In making     a thorough test of the electrometer as an alternate
 current Wattmeter we have the following variables to deal with : —
     1. The frequency   of the alternate current.
     2.  The phase difference between current and potential, that is'
          between C and A or B.
     3.  The amplitude of C and A or B.
     4.  The shape or wave form of the curve of potential and current.
     The results obtained are tabulated in Table   II and are divided into
 three groups (a) (6) (c). In group (a) two frequencies are given,
  namely 41 '6 and 83 complete periods per second. The potential on
  tho needle is constant at about 100 volts (.v/mean*).        The phase
 difference between potential and current and tho current itself are
 each varied.      When the phase difference is zero, it is only necessary
 to take the product of the -/mean' values to deduce the Watts,
  although in section (6) threo instances are given in which for
  phase difference zero, the Watts are deduced by both methods.        The

              Electrometer  as a Wattmeter       and Voltmeter.               363
average Watts per divipion given by section (a) are 17 00 for all
angles of phase leaving ont the two valnes deduced by aid of the cosine
law for angles of 30° and 60°. It will be seen that under the con
ditions of section (a) the Wattmeter may be said to be verified within
the limits of accuracy attainable by the method of test. The wave
form of the unloaded alternator is given in fig. 3 and marked C ;
this is the wave form of potential applied to the needle in all experi
ments in sections (a) and (6). A sine enrve having the same maxi
mum ordinate is superposed for the purpose of comparison.                     The
current curve has different wave form according to the load on the
alternator. For small currents it approximates to C in fig. 3.                The
curve A, fig. 3, is the wave form for current 74 amperes, which is the
maximum we have employed.

    The experiments in section (h), Table IT, are intended to demon
 strate the reliability of the instrument when the potential of the
 needle C is varied through wide limits.          One would expect from the
 curve in fig. 1, that for high potentials on the needle the Watts, per
division of the scale, would diminish.          This is found to be the case
 when the potential C is raised to 1,860 volts (y/mean') for frc-

The distortion of the potential curve C was brought about by
placing a considerable non-inductive resistance in series with a
choking coil, nnd taking potentials across the choking coil. The
instrument under these conditions gives trustworthy results. The
phase difference on one or two occasions was such that the cnrve>
indicated no work, the deflection under these conditions was zero
The mnxinaum angle of deflection of the needle from its normal
position was 7"8°, and tests were made from time to time, especially
with the large potentials on the needle, to see if the instrument was
in proper adjustment, by placing both pairs of quadrants in con
nection with the case, and noting the agreement between its then
zero and the zero when quadrants and needle were put to the case,
that is when the instrument was totally discharged.                    To test the
effect  of dismounting the instrument the needle was taken off the
suspension and the instrument moved to another room and used for
another purpose, on December 10, 1897.                  On continuing the experi
ments it   was    spt up by  the level     only,    and      found to be in proper
adjustment.        The results of experiment before and after this
removal are given in Table II.

   Seeing from fig. 3 how great was the deviation from the sine law,
it would hare been necessary to analyse each curve by Fourier's
theorem, if the subject was to have baeu treated mathematically,
the phase difference being given.               The current curve was continually
changing its form with different loads, and this would have neces
sitated observing the curve in each case, so that nothing was to be
gained by this method of treatment.                   The potential curve C, fig. 3,
has, however,       been     analysed,*      and can be expressed by the equa

   We    see   that B, is important,         being about 6 per cent, of Bi ; so that
from the analysis the cosine law could not be expected to hold.                       In
section (a), Table II, the cosine law is applied in two instances for
the purpose       of illustration.        It gives 18'54 as against 17-0 for the
Watts, per division of scale, for 60° ; and 17 2 as against 17 for 30°.
For small angles the error does not appear to be so great.
   The conclusions arrived at from these experiments are that the
Kelvin Quadrant Electrometer can be used with accuracy as a
Wattmeter in the case of alternate currents having any phase rela
tion, and that, as pointed out by Dr. J. Hopkinson.f it is necessary
to see  that within the range of potentials applied, Maxwell's formula
is verified.      This is, perhaps, best done by applying steady potential
differences      to tho     needle    and quadrants, and measuring these by
Poggendorff's       method, employing Clark's standard cell as the unit of
comparison.        It could also be tested by applying known alternating
potentials to the needle and quadrants, the curves being in phase. If
it is required to use alternating potentials of high value, such, for
instance, as 2000 volts or more, a suitable                       transformer could   be
employed to reduce the potential on the needle.                           Such unloaded
transformer could have the primary and secondary electromotive
forces in phase, and of the same wave form,                   J   so that no error would
be thereby introduced.

3t58        Kelvin Quadrant Electrometer as Wattmeter and Voltmeter.
                          The Revolving Contact Maker.
  The revolving contact maker M, fig. 2, exhibits a peculiarity
worth noting.    It is in itself the seat of an electromotive force, as U
demonstrated by placing it across the electrometer Qj, and running
the machines without excitation.       A deflection of 68 scale divisions,
corresponding   to 0-45 volt, is given if the electrometer has do
capacity across its terminals, that            is, zero. A copper brush
                                                     if   G    is
gives the same effect as a steel one. As soon as       given a sub         G    is
stantial value as compared with the electrometer itself, this deflec
tion disappears.
   When actually observing potentials in the usual way, let the value                              of
G  hi varied. For a given position of the contact maker the deflec
tion varied, as shown in fig.   in which the ordinates are observed

   The strip was mounted on November 1, 1897, and submitted to
currents varying from 100 amperes downwards.                         On November 20,
1897, it was adjusted for r3l r«.            The results show that there is an
initial diminution of resistance, and that then the resistance remains
practically constant.        This is worth noting, as this material is
largely used at the present time, on account of its low temperature
coefficient.   The manganin strip is unvarnished and exposed to the
atmosphere of the engine room.                  The conditions are therefore not
the best to secure constancy         of resistance, but in all probability the
initial diminution is due to the brazing.
   Messrs. C. J. Evans and H. H. Hodd have given me valuable
assistance, not only in the experimental part of this paper, but also
in the working out of the results. Messrs. Simpson, Greenbank,
and Davey, the present Student Demonstrators                          in the Siemens
Laboratory, have also helped me. I wish to acknowledge this, and
to tender my thanks to these gentlemen.

 This ring has an internal diameter of 3'2 cm., an external diameter

 the secondary coil next the iron, and forty-nine tarns for the primary

 nometer, and is that in use in the Siemens Laboratory, King's
 College, London, where the present experiments were carried ont.
 The currents in the primary circuit were supplied by storage cells
and measured by balancing the potential difference due to such
currents in a standard resistance against a Clark's cell.                               The
current meter in the circuit was only used for convenience of

   Pure Iron       II  has been tested under two conditions : (a) as received
and   (i>) after    careful     annealing.      The results are given in Table I,
which also contains the results obtained by Professor Ewing from a
sample of transformer plate rolled from Swedish iron.f The figures
of Professor Ewing relating to magnetic hysteresis are exceptionally
low, and although annealing has considerably improved the Pure
Iron II, it is still slightly inferior to the transformer plate. On the
other hand, the permeability fi of this pure iron after annealing is
exceptionally high, having a value 5490 for B = 9000. The coercive
force for maximum B = 15,270 is T13 C.G.S. units.
   The figures in Table I relating to Pure Iron                     II  after annealing
hiive been obtained by interpolation from the actual observed data
given in Table II. An induction density of 15,270 for H = 9'24 is
higher than the author remembers having seen.                       In fact, for values
of H bel'-w about 10 or 12 this specimen is exceptionally good, as is
shown by the very high permeability.

                         Apparent Magnetic Instability.
   Whilst making the foregoing experiments, the author noticed                        how-
great was the apparent          magnetic instability in this specimen, an. I
thought it worth while to investigate this more closely.
   It has already been noticed, and is well known, that if the mag
netising force be varied from one maximum value through zero to a
value equal, say, to the then coercive force of the material, that
tapping the specimen will produce a considerable change of induc
tion ; or, if the observed kick on a ballistic galvanometer (in circuit
with a secondary coil wound on the specimen) due to such change be
added to the observed kick when the magnetising                    force is raised to

372                          Mr. E. Wilson.
the opposite maximum, the sum does not equal tbe whole kick which
would be observed if the force were at once varied from the one
maximum to the other.      During the interval the magnetism appears
to continue to settle down, so that the change which lastly takes
place is not so great as it would be if such apparent settling down
did not occur.
   Experiments were made to investigate the effect when the limits
of B were (a) large and (6) small. It is assumed that the instru
ment gives the true time integral of current.
    (a) Maximum B = 15,270, coercive force 113 C.G.S. units. The
maximum force H of 9'24 C.G.S. units was suddenly varied through
zero to 1*13, and the secondary circuit kept closed until deflections
to the left and right were observed, the periodic time of the galvano
meter needle being 106 seconds. The scale is graduated from 0 on
the left to 1000 on the right, and the readings taken were 351, 623,
giving a difference of 272, corresponding to a change of induction
per square centimetre of 12,630 C.G.S. units. When the magnetism
had settled down, as was shown by closing the secondary key with no
extra resistance in . its circuit, and observing no deflection on the
ballistic galvanometer, a suitable extra resistance was inserted, and
the force suddenly raised to its maximum value, the observed deflec
tions were 362, 627, the difference 265 corresponding   to B = 12,350.
These results were many times repeated.
    The total change of induction produced a deflection 662, 330, the
difference 332 corresponding to B = 15,270.        We have therefore to
account for a difference of 5560, or 18 per cent, of the total change
from one maximum to the ether. The zero, when the spot of light
is perfectly steady, is 495, and we can see that when making the
first change from one maximum through zero to force 113 the
deflection to the left is 143 as against 128 to the right; whereas
when making the second change the deflections are 133 to the left
and 132 to right.     There is evidence here of a change continuing in
the same direction, since the first elongation is greater than the
second, and the decrement would only account for about 1 per cent.
   This effect was next observed in a slightly different manner.    The
change of force from one maximum            through zero to the then
coercive force was effected, and the secondary circuit closed at
known intervals of time after such change. The results are given
in Table III.
   It will be seen from the figures that about 30 per cent, comes out
after the first second has elapsed, and that the result is practically
the same, whether the charging potential difference be that due to
ten or fifty-six cells.  With a total reversal from one maximum to
the other no such effect was observed, the change taking place
immediately.     Having taken the force from one maximum through

the deflections for the carve in fig. 1, the five cells used for exciting
had placed across their terminals a condenser of 4 microfarads
capacity.
    We are dealing with a very steep curve in these experiments, that
is to say, the rising portion for the large forces is very nearly per
pendicular.    We observe that it is on the steep portions that these
effects have been noticed, and such effects could very easily be pro
duced by a slow chango in the magnetising force. Such slow change
might arise from the heating of resistances in the circuit if these be
of carbon ; this was looked into and only metal resistances used.
The self-induction of the circuit might, if large enough, delay the
maguetising current and produce the effect. We have seen that it
is practically the same whether the applied potential be that due to
ten or fifty-six cells.  In any case the self-induction can be approxi

mately calculated in our ease. Take the curve in fig. 1 — we see B
increases 5750, whilst H increases 0 6.      The total change is 9860,
since the cross sectional area of the specimen is 1*715 eq. cm. H = 0'6
corresponds to a change of 0-117 ampere, and taking the volt as our
unit and the primary turns at 50, we find L = 4-21 x 10-2, where L
is the coefficient of self-induction. If E be the applied potential and
R the resistance of the circuit, the current at any time t after closing

the circuit can be expressed by — (1 — e~                    j/).     For    t          ^   second the
current has its maximum value within an exceedingly small quantity.
But the method of experiment enabled one to test the rapidity with
which the current rises to its maximum value. Let a balance be
made, say when the current is such that the force is equal to the
coercive force of the material.    Now suddenly reverse the force from
its maximum through zero to this value. The immediate depression
of a key tells at once if the current is still balanced. The current
immediately after reversal, that is to say within \ second, had cer
tainly attained its normal value to within 0"3 or 0"4 per cent.
    The condenser had no material effect upon the rapidity with which
the current attained its maximum value.         We can only conclude
that the effect is peculiar to the iron itself, and might be influenced
by induced currents, since the ring is not subdivided.      The subject
of propagation of magnetism as affected by induced currents has
 been dealt with in the case of a magnet having a core 12 inches
 diameter,* and a magnet having a diameter of 4 inches. f Imagine
 that the cross-section of our pure iron specimen is circular instead of
 rectangular— it would have a diameter of 14"8 mm. If we assume
 equal conductivities and magnetic properties, we can infer roughly
from the 12- and 4-inch magnets what the effect of induced currents
 in our specimen would be.
    Take the 12-inch magnet. For reversal of maximum H = 2'4 the
effects had died away in about 400 seconds.         Similar events will
happen in the pure iron core, but at times varying as                                              :    that

  Take the 4-inch magnet.     For reversal of magnetism H = 1*7 the

  It is, therefore, probable that the induced currents in the pure
Iron      II
         may have something to do with the effects observed in this
paper, although         difficult to account for such times as

10 seconds, unless the molecule           itself is considered.     This effect has
been observed   in laminated specimens.
   The difficulty of working -with alternate currents, if the core be
subdivided, in order to investigate the effects observed, using the
method in the 1 Proceedings of the Royal Society,' vol. 53, p. 352, is
the necessity for the very accurate control and measurement of the
magnetising force. Small variations of this force would at once mask
the effects observed.        In   the paper just mentioned a considerable
difference was observed         between cyclic curves obtained with the
ballistic galvanometer        and by means of alternate currents having
frequencies of 72 and 1 25 per second in the case of a laminated hard
steel ring for maximum B = 10,000. On the other hand, no such
difference was observed in the case of a laminated soft iron ring when
maximum     B was 4000.*           It   would   seem    from the experiments in
this paper that the amplitude of induction would not be so great for
high frequency and small induction density B, and this is of import
ance in the case of iron cores for transformers.               It is worth noting
that when working on solid rings with the ballistic galvanometer
induced currents may account for apparent magnetic instability.

paper, and  I here wish to tender him my thanks.

   On a previous occasionf            I  gave some boiling points of salt solu
tions under atmospheric pressure. As the dimensions of that abstract
made a full account of the experimental method impossible,                  I  have
been given this opportunity, by the courtesy of the Council of the
Royal Society, of describing           the apparatus     and procedure by which
those results were obtained.
                       §   I. Difficulties   to be overcome.
   The exact determination of boiling points of solutions has been
attended hitherto with a good deal of difficulty.               The boiling point
of the pure solvent is first determined.             Salt is then added, and the
boiling point is redetermined.             The experiment consists, in fact, of
two parts, and the difficulty lies in making the circumstances in
which the first part of the experiment was carried out identical with
                  * See  '

those in the second. Examples of such circumstances are, barometric
pressure, rate of ebullition, height of flame employed, depth of ex
perimental liquid, and many others, and there is no doubt that the
chief reason why the boiling-point method has been so little utilised,
is the inability to reproduce these conditions. In particular, if the
pressure under which the boiling point is to be measured is much
less than 760 mm., the difficulties are so much increased that no
one 6eems even to have attempted to make observations under such
conditions.
  § 2. "Principle on which success depends    in measuring by the Boiling-
          Point   Method   the Vapour Pressure   of Salt Solutions.
   The difficulty in applying and extending the boiling-point method
disappears in a great measure if not entirely, if the apparatus is
duplicated, and    the differencealone is measured of pure water and
solution boiling under similar conditions and under the same pressure,
the magnitude of tchich need not then be known to within a millimetre.
   The difference of temperature referred to may very profitably be
measured by the platinum resistance method.      A decided advantage
of methods which obey tho principle above stated, lies in the fact
that, whereas the differences of vapour pressure, measured at a
common temperature, diminish very rapidly as the temperature is
lowered, the difference of temperatures, measured under a common
pressure, varies much less rapidly.      As an example, suppose that a
certain  solution under a pressure of  760  mm. has a boiling point 0"52°
higher than pure water, then under 360 mm. it will be found to have
a boiling point 0-45° higher than that of pure water, a diminution of
only 14 per cent. Tho corresponding diminution in the difference
of tension would be 53 per cent.
   The first apparatus employed by me to take the difference of
boiling points of pure and salt water was in form very simple, and
constructed from ordinary laboratory apparatus.        A description of it
is here  introduced, mainly  because  it illustrates the principle of the
more complex apparatus shortly to be described.
   A current of steam from a boiler divides itself at A, fig. 1, and
passes through two precisely similar pieces of apparatus, one con
taining pure, the other containing salt, water. The contents are
agitated by the steam, and so raised to their boiling points, and the
difference alone of the temperatures in the liquids was found by the

well, but the condensation        was so rapid that the contents of ihe
U-tubes accumulating         became unmanageable.            The difficulty was
only partially overcome by jacketing with flannel.              The trouble was
all the greater, inasmuch as the estimation of temperature by the
platinum method requires some little time. The only possible way
of obviating this condensation was to employ a steam-jacket, and in
order to do so the apparatus was completely reconstructed, so that it
assumed the form described in the next section.
                       § 3.   The Apparatus employed.
   The apparatus which is about to be described is that which yielded
the experimental numbers.*        Although its principle is fully contained
in the very simple model of the l.ast section, yet its form is somewhat
complicated.

    Improvements. — When the apparatus came to be used, some im
 provements were made as the result of experience.                It was found,
 for instance,   that  the  drum    was  not  able  completely   to  prevent the
 condensation in the G-tubes, so that the depth of liquid in them
 tended to increase.      As such changes of depth were found to be                   a
 source of error, at any rate when they proceeded unequally in the
 two G-tubes,        was necessary either to equalise or prevent them.

 Though this could easily be done by running off liquid from time to
 time through the three-way taps             such

 shaped double ring-burner was placed with one half under each
 G-tube, and condensation was thus exactly balanced. As this burner
 was not used in the experiments already published (loc. cit.)                   it   is

 Plate 2) are closed, any liquid in the G-tubes " finds its own level
 on the burettes, and then by means of the same three-way taps the
 level in question maybe adjusted to any desired mark on the burette.
    If a current of steam from the boiler is now caused to pass
 through the G-tubes, the liquid is dragged out of the burette into
 the G-tubes.* The current of steam used in practice was never
sufficiently rapid to empty tho burettes.     Suppose, now, that conden
sation proceeds more rapidly in one G-tube- than in the other.
 Owing to the increased hydrostatic pressures, the velocity of steam
on that side automatically diminishes, and in consequence some liquid
slips out of the G-tube and back into the burette, till the former
velocity is reproduced.      It is not claimed that this device entirely
equalized the levels of the liquids, but it certainly tended in a very
marked way to do so. This is best demonstrated by closing the
burette taps. On doing this the readings become unsteady at once.
    One more appliance has to be described affecting the adjustment
of the pressure in the drum.       It was necessary that any fluctuations
in pressure (not necessarily the result of leaks) should at once be
detected and smoothed down.         Neither mercurial thermometers nor
manometers are sufficiently rapid in their indications for this purpose,
and manometers consisting entirely of light liquids are very cum
brous.    The following combination proved to be what was wanted
(Plate 1). The bottle M is more than half full of mercury, the
remainder being occupied by water coloured red by fuchsin. A
rubber cork, having two holes, fills the mouth of the bottle, leaving
no air-space between itself and the surfaco of the red water. The tall
tube T passes throngh one hole of the cork and below the level of
the mercury.      T is connected by a rubber tube to the Woulfe's bottle
V, so that when the latter is exhausted the mercury rises in T.
   Through the other hole in the cork passes a capillary tube whose
lower end terminates in the coloured liquid without reaching down
so far as the surface of the mercury.       The upper end of this capil
lary  tube,  is open to the air. About midway up it communicates
through a side tube with the funnel F, which is also open to the air.
The coloured liquid in the bottle M extends up the capillary tube
and half way up F. The usefulness of the apparatus turns on the
fact that if U is open any fall in pressure in the Woulfe's bottle will
show itself mainly by a small rise of the mercury surface in T, but if
t-,   closed, by a fall, about tenfold greater, of the light liquid in the
      is
capillary. This       due to the fact that the cross-section of
                         is                                           great  T   is
compared     to that of  the capillary.  The  apparatus   can therefore  be

                     §   4.   The Electrical Instruments.
   So much for the mechanical             portion of the apparatus     :   it   remains
to describe the electrical part.
    The outfit consists of two Callendar-Griffiths platinum thermome
ters,   a battery acting through a resistance of 50 ohms, a pair of
"equal arm" coils,    a galvanometer, and       bridge whose 80 cm. of
                                                       a
wire balance the difference of resistance of tho two thermometers,
thus indicating the difference of their temperatures.
    The method of compensating and connecting these thermometers
is  fully described by Griffiths   the bridge, however, will reqnire
                                        ;*                                             a
little comment.     The wire was ordered to be 0'5 ohm to the metre,
to which value it approached very nearly.        It was furnished with
the same platinum-silver wire as the standard instruments recently
supplied to Kew Observatory. The scale unit was approximately
2  cm.    The bridge itself was furnished with Professor Calendar's
device for obviating the greater part of the thermo-electric effects by
connecting (he galvanometer to wire running parallel to the bridge
                                          a
wire, and in all respects similar to it.     These effects are further
removed by a Griffiths's thermo-electric key.
   All contacts were so designed as to fall within a very narrow
compass, where they can if necessary be enclosed in a box to prevent
injury.    The equal arm coil was made of two pieces of wire having
(when wound) precisely the same resistance and temperature coeffi
cient.    They are intertwined in     core of paraffin so as to be at
                                             a
equal temperatures.      The actual temperatnre       then    matter of
                                                                  is   a
indifference.
   The battery employed was a single dry cell. The galvanometer,
after repeated attempts, was made very sensitive.     The manner of
reading its deflection differed somewhat from the ordinary one. The
method   is similar to that of Poggendorff, except that the scale         in      is
the eye-piece of the telescope, which            focussed (by reflection
                                                       is
from the galvanometer mirror) on a signal.          Instead, therefore, of
observing   the  movements    of a scale relative  to    fixed line in the
                                                                  a
focal plane of the telescope, one observes the movements of a line
relative to   fixed scale in the focus of the telescope.

384           Mr. E. B. H. Wade.             On a new Method     of
inquired what is the beet relation of tlie distances between the
observer atid galvanometer on the one hand, and the signal and gal
vanometer on the other.         Usually they are made equal, but a simple
calculation shows that for a given angular displacement of the
mirror the reading may       be increased      by bringing the observer near
to the galvanometer and removing the signal to as great a distance
as possible.    Using this disposition of the galvanometer, very minute
deflections of the mirror were plainly visible.
    § 5.  The employment     of the Apparatus to measure the difference of
              the Boiling Points of Pure Water and Solution.
    The mode of employing the apparatus varies somewhat, according
as  it is required to work with weak or strong solutions, and at high
or low pressures. The procedure with the weak solutions at 760 mm.*
is as follows : — Steam from The generator is caused to circulate
through the empty G-tubes and drum, and a position is found on the
bridge, such that on making contact the galvanometer is undeflected.
A reading of the bridge scale is taken and entered as " hypsometer
null point." Water is now added to each G-tube, and caused to boil
by the passage of steam. A similar null point is found and entered
     " water null                If the burettes (Plate 2) are properly
as                 point."
adjusted the two null points are identical.            In order now to measure
the change in the boiling point due to the presence of a small quantity
of salt, some water is removed from one G-tube, and replaced by a
few c.c. of stock salt solution. The bridge is again balanced. It was
found desirable that this balance should be obtained at the fifteenth
 minute of ebullition, and therefore at this moment the bridge
 must be correctly set, the levels duly adjusted, and the galvanometer
 observed to be undeflected.        This is a work of considerable difficulty,
 but it may be accurately performed if all one's movements are regu
lated by the indications of a clock, so that each takes place at its
 appointed time.      Tho observer ascertains, for instance, in a number
of preliminary experiments, what gain takes place in the reading
 of the burettes during fifteen minutes, and in an actual experiment
 the levels are previously so adjusted that they shall be as nearly as
 possible correct at the end of such a period.              The fifteen minutes
 may now be allotted to observations at the bridge and galvanometer,
 and then one may be sure of a close balance at the last minute.              The
 levels of the burettes are finally recorded, and         a sample  of solution is
 withdrawn from tho G-tubes for analysis.               As a result of the pre
 cautions described, the burette reading was almost invariably found
 to be within 1^ mm. of the desired height.             In any case a correction
  (L)  can always be made at the rate of 0"00l° per           1^ mm. inequality

                           — In Mr. Galton's ' Natural Inheritance we find a
    (1) Introductory.
                                              " mid-parent." This formed the
theory of regression based upon the
starting point of my own thoory of biparental inheritance.* At
the time Mr. Galton published his theory I venture to think that he
had not clearly in view some of the laws of multiple correlation with
which we are now more familiar. This certainly was my own con
dition when writing my memoir on heredity in 1895, and although
in that memoir I pretty fully developed the theory of multiple
correlation as applied to heredity, it had not then become such a
familiar tool as two years' pretty constant occupation with it has since
made it. Accordingly I misinterpreted a second principle of heredity
propounded by Mr. Galton, and reached the paradoxical conclusion!
that "a knowledge of the ancestry beyond the parents in no way
alters our judgment as to the size of organ or degree of characteristic
probable in the offspring."            I assumed Mr. Galton to meanj that
 the coefficients of correlation between offspring and parent, grand
 parent, great-grandparent, 4c, were to be taken r, r2, r", &c.                 The
conclusions I drew from this result were, had the result been                 true,
 perfectly sound.          The recent publication of Mr. Galton's paper on
 Basset hounds has led me back to the subject, because that paper
 contains facts in obvious contradiction with the principle above
 cited from my memoir of 1895. At first, I must confess, I was
 inclined to lay less stress on Mr. Galton's general law than it
 deserved, and attributed our divergence to the admitted roughness
 of colour data. After some correspondence with Mr. Galton and an
 endeavour on my part to represent his views in my own language, 1
 have come to the conclusion that what I shall in future term Galton's
 Law of Ancestral Heredity, if properly interpreted, reconciles the
                         '                      '
 discrepancies in Natural Inheritance and between it and my memoir
 of 1895.       It indeed enables us to predict d priori the values of all the
 correlation coefficients of heredity, and forms, I venture to think,
 the fundamental principle of heredity from which all the numerical
 data of inheritance can in future be deduced, at any rate, to a first
 approximation.

         Mathematical Contributions          to the   Theory  of Evolution.       387
    The confidence       I   put in the truth of the law is not measured by-
Mr. Galton's researches on stature or on colour in Basset hounds,
however strong evidence these may provide, but rather on the fact
that the theory gives a priori the correlation between parents and
offspring, and that this correlation is practically identical with the
        I
value have myself determined from these and other observations.
    With reservations as to how " mid-parent " shall be defined, I
¦would state the law of ancestral heredity as follows : —
    If k, be the deviation of the sth mid-parent* from the mean of
the sth ancestral generation, and k0 bo the probable deviation from
the mean of the offspring of any individual, a, the standard deviation
of the sth mid-parental generation, a0 of the generation of the off
spring, then
                   &0  =   2
                             —
                                &i + x— ^J+s"-        Te_k4+
                             0\       0%      a%        &i
    This is the somewhat generalised form of the law, which Mr.
Galton sums up as " each parent contributes on an average one-
quarter, or (0"5)3, each grandparent one-sixteenth, or (0-5)', and so
on, and that generally the occupier of each ancestral place in the nth
degree, whatever be the value of n, contributes (0'5)2* of the
heritage. "f
    The generalised form above allows for a secular modification of
the means and variabilities of the successive generations.
    (2) Let rh ra, ra, rt, . . • . , be the coefficients of correlation between
offspring and parent, grandparent, great-grandparent, <fec, respec
tively.    Then, if correlation remains constant during the successive
generations, rn„, would be the correlation between tho parent of the
nth generation and the parent of the sth generation if they be in the
direct line of ascent, for one of these is the (?(^-s)th parent of the
other. It must be remembered that if rt be the correlation between
an individual gth parent and his offspring, rt may theoretically
have a great variety of values according to the proportion and order
of the sexes in the line of descent. If all these r?'s be unequal, then
r4 shall be taken to represent their mean value.              It will be necessary
for our investigations to find the correlation between the nth and sth
mid-parents in terms of these r's, which give the correlation between
individuals.      Let /j« be the correlation between the nth and sth mid-
parents.     Let qh, be the deviation of any organ of the gth male sth
parent from the mean of that organ for the sth generation of male
parents,   gh's that of his female mate         ; let m be any constant      not yet

determined.         Then there -will         be  21-1  male   and     2*-1    female       sth
parents, and the          "mid-parent" will       be defined to be an           individual
having     a  deviation from the mean of the sth parental generation

This is a somewhat more general definition than Mr. Galton's.
    Since S(h) = 0,.S(/i') = 0, when the summation extends over all
individuals of the sth generation who are parents, it follows that the
mean deviation of all possible sth mid-parents is zero.*
    Next let us find the standard deviation 2, of the sth mid-pareuts.
If their number for the population be N, then
    Nx2Js = ^S{,A,+J7l,-|-A+                 ....  +m (xh',+,h',+Ji.+            •...)}*.
    Now,   if  there be assortative mating, S{th, . th',) will equal N<vr',*>,
where e, is the correlation coefficient for assortative mating in the
sth generation and a„ a, the standard deviations of male and female
mates in that generation.              Further, S(th, . g'h,) and S(th', . q'h',) will
not be absolutely zero, because assortative mating would mean a class
mating into a like class leading to a correlation between relations
in law ; but these sums would be of the order e,2, and since, at any
rate for man, e, appears to be very small, we may neglect them to a
first approximation.! Hence
       Nx    2,' =  ~ {2- SCM'+m'a-1              S(th;y+2m2^S<i,h,             . ,&',)},
or           2/   = —       (ff.!+mV1!+2»i(r((rl,eI)                                       (i).
   Now let us take          m,   which is at our choice, equal to       <r,jo',,   then

may be written rn„s, as it depends only on the difference of the gene
 rations.      Hence supposing sexual selection to remain constant, if it
exists, for all generations, we see that p,„ depends only on the differ
ence   of generations, and may            be   written pn-s, or:

    Now     if  there be no selectivo breeding, e appears, at any rate for
 man, to be small.         Hence we have the important proposition :
    The correlation        between two mid-parents, p generations apart, is
          equal to the product of 2*p and the mean of the coefficients
          of correlation between an individual and its individual j>th
          parents, when they are taken for all possible combinations
          of sex.
     When no allowance is made for reproductive selection, it has been
 shown by Miss Alice Lee and myself that the four possible r's

for first parent and offspring are very nearly equal ;* assuming-
the equality of all possible rs's for the sth pareut and offspring, and
neglecting   e   we have
                                    PP
                                         = ^rP
or, we conclude that very approximately : The standard deviation of
the mid-sth parent may be obtained from the standard deviation of indi
vidual sth parents by dividing by 2i', and the correlation between mid-
sth parents and mid (s + p)th parents may be obtained by multiplying
the correlation between an individual and any sth parent by 2!?.
  Thus the variability of the        mid-parent rapidly decreases as we
                                      ;'sth
increase s, i.e., as we get back in ancestry the mid-parent comes more
and more nearly to represent in all cases the mean of the general
population.      Whether the correlation tends to decrease or increase
will depend on the relative rates of change of 2*? and rp.
   Since pp must always be less than 1, we obtain at once the interest
ing limit that the correlation of an individual and a pth parent is
always less than (0"5)iJ\
   For example the correlation between :
Offspring and parent                                 must be less £han   0'71

Their actual values as deduced from Mr. Galton's law are much
smaller, as we shall see later.
   (3) The reader will remark that in order to get these results in a
simple form we have multiplied the female deviations from the mean
by a constant factor m, which has afterwards been taken equal to
the ratio of male to female variability. The reason for this was two
fold. In the first place a is certainly not equal to a, and, conse
quently, m = I would not have given

female variability. This does not theoretically agree with Mr. Galton's
definition, for he reduces the female to the male standard by multi
plying them by the sexual ratio, or the ratio of the male to the
female mean for the organ under consideration. In order, therefore,
that my factor of reduction should agree with Mr. Galton's, it is
needful that the ratio of the standard deviations should be equal to
 the ratio of the means, or, in other words, that the coefficient of
 variation should be the same for the two sexes. Now for the stature
 of men and women, I find for 1000 cases of each sex the coefficients
 4-07 and 4-03 respectively, or the coefficient of variation is sensibly
 equal for both sexes.* Mr. Galton found from his anthropometric
 laboratory returns for somewhat fewer numbers, and probably for a
 lower social class, values of 3'75 and 3'79, again sensibly equaLf
 Hence the mid-parent, whether denned in my manner or in Mr.
  Galton's, would have a sensibly equal value in the case of stature,
  which is the one Mr. Galton dealt with in his ' Natural Inheritance.'
 The coefficient of variation is, however, not the same for both sexes
  in the case of all organs,J hence for the purpose of simplifying the
 formulas, I am inclined to think my modification of Mr. Galton's
  original definition will prove of service.
      (4) I shall now proceed to determine by the law of ancestral
  heredity the correlation between an individual and any sth parent
  from a knowledge of the regression between the individual and his
  mid-sth parent.

gives us sufficient equations to find the coefficients of total correlation
between the offspring and the successive mid-parents.                    Equations (v)
will then enable us to find the coefficients of             correlation between an
individual and any individual ancestor. But                 these in their turn will
suffice to determine all inheritance whether                direct or collateral (see
below).    In short if Mr. Galton's law can be              firmly established, it is
a complete    solution, at any rate to a first approximation, of the whole
problem of heredity. It throws back the question of inheritance upon
two constants, which can be once and for all determined ; herein. lies
its fundamental importance.             I   must confess that this element of
simplicity was at first my chief difficulty in accepting the law as laid
down in the paper on Basset hounds, and                   I even yet have a certain
hesitation, owing to an apparent difference in collateral heredity in
different social classes, and also to the apparent numerical value of
the inheritance of fertility in man.
    (5) I shall next obtain a solution of equations (ix). Taking the
minors of the n+1 constituents of the first row, namely, Boo, Hoi,
 Rus, .... Bo«, and multiplying them in succession by the constituents
of the 2nd, 3rd .... n + 1th row of B, we have by the ordinary theory
•of determinants the system :

    Divide each of these equations by Boo and let us use instead of (ix)

one or two limiting cases, and rather more generally than Mr.

the preference to the former, and rejected his law of partial coeffi
cients of regression in favour of the values, based on numerical
observation, of his total regression coefficients.

Or we may express the law of ancestral heredity in Mr. Galton's
form in the following simple statement: — The total regression of the
progeny on the mid-parent   of any generation is constant and equal to 0'6.
   Let us   see how these results agree with observations.    Mr. Galton*
tells us that his first estimate of mid-parental regression was
.'J/5 =: 0-6.   This estimate exactly agrees with theory.       He after
wards! changed the value to 2/3      =  0"67, which is less in agreement.
My own calculations,               J
                            on Mr. Galton's data, give r/ = 0*3959,
r," = 0-3603, r,'" = 0-2841, r,"" = 0-3018, or r, = 0-3355 instead of
0'3.    The probable error is, however, 0'026. If we do not weight
fertility the parental correlation§ = 0-41 + 0 03, a value which is
distinctly too high for Galton's law. It must be remembered, how
ever, that our deductions from that law are based on equality of
variation in each gennration, and that this equality is by no means
the fact.     I hope shortly to get final values for parental heredity
from my family measurements, which have now reached a total of
nearly 1,100 families, and thus settle how far Galton's law needs to
be modified. On the whole the confirmation obtained from stature data
for the law of ancestral heredity is very striking            am inclined

here to observe that we do not need to know the characters of parents,

  Remarks. — The correlation of the individual first parent is to be taken as the
mean of the four possible parental correlations duo to differences of sex, if these
are not sensibly equal, and a like rule holds for the individual »th parent.   The
individual parental regression is based on the assumption that the variability of
offspring and parent are the same.       In dealing with the mid-parent, female
deviations must first be reduced to male by multiplying them by the ratio of male
to female variability.

theory and observation,                    I

  (7) Mr. Galton's law gives us the partial regression coefficients
when all the mid-parents are known. It is desirable to deduce from
the  theory of multiple correlation the values of the partial regression
coefficients when we take 1, 2, 3, 4,. . . . mid-parents only. When q
mid-parents are taken let the partial regression coefficients be clq, cSi,

    I  do not agree with the last column of Mr. Galton's table giving the variability
of arrays.    For single correlation the variability (standard deviation) of an array
= <t«/1 —  rJ, where      the correlation and not the regression.

     (8)  I  venture   to think this table of considerable suggestiveness,
 and    will  now point out some of the conclnsions that may be drawn
 from it.
     (i) "With a view of reducing the absolute variability of a species it
 is idle to select beyond the grandparents, and hardly profitable to
 select beyond parents.         The ratio of the variability of pedigree stock
 to the general population decreases 10 per cent, on the selection of
 parents, and only 11 per cent, on the additional selection of grand
 parents.      Beyond this no sensible change is made. We cannot then
 reduce variability beyond 11 per cent, by the creation of a pedigree
 stock, i.e., by breeding from selected parents for 2, 3, 4,         .... n genera
 tions.     In some cases of course we appear to decrease variability —
 for example, if we increase the average size of an organ— for the
 absolute variability is then a smaller proportion of the actual size, and
 the relative variability, or coefficient of variation, may thus be steadily
 decreased.        If Mr. Galton's law be true, then pedigree stock would
 retain only a slightly diminished capacity for variation about the
 new type.       For example, the absolute variability of men of average
 height, 69"2 inches, being 2'6 inches, the absolute variability of men
 of 72 inches, obtained by selecting any number of 6-foot ancestors,
 would hardly fall short of 2'3 inches.*
     (ii) Two different classes of pedigree stock exist. In the one we
 start with the general population, and select special characters for
 1, 2, 3         n generations.      In the other we know the pedigree for
 1, 2, 3, ....n generations,         but have no reason for supposing that
 before these generations the stock was absolutely identical with the
general population.
    In the former case we put for the mid-parents
     h\ — hi —    &3 —  ....  —  lcn  —  K,   liu+ \
                                                     —    —  . . . .  — A'x —   0.
 Hence the regression formula is
                                                     =
                fc=(t+i+*+....+£)K                     (l-i)K.
    The values of k,JK. are tabulated in the last column of the table
above in brackets.         They give the ratio of character in offspring to
character in ancestors, if ancestors of equal full character have been
selected for n generations.           We see that in six generations the off
spring will have       been  raised    to within 1*6 per cent, of the selected
ancestral character.
    In the latter case wo must use the partial regression               coefficients
   * The probability of an individual of selected stock differing widely from the
type is of course much less than in the general population, because the stock i>,
as a rule, fur less numerous.

 «i, e2 . . . . of the table.            For example, in the case of Mr. Galton's
Basset hounds, 0 5015, 0-2553, and 0-1459 were the coefficients to be
used,    rather than 0'5, 0*25, and 0'125 when he proceeded to apply
the    law to three generations.                   The»« give the proper allowance for
the ancestry beyond the pedigree.                             Thus the great-grandparents
ought to have been given about a fifth more weight. If we proceed
to six generations in pedigree stock of the latter type then the
 offspring will be within 1*2 per cent, of the selected ancestry, i.e.,
 their stability as given by the last column = 0'9879.
    (iii) Now let us apply these results to the all-important problem
of panmixia and degeneration.                        Suppose a selection made of a par
ticular character for « generations, starting from the general popula
tion.     Then the offspring in the (n+                  l)th   generation     will have 1—    of
                                                                                            ^
the   character on the average.                   Now, stopping selection, let us breed
with     a first generation             of mid-parents with             1— —    of the character.
The offspring        will have        :
                                                       '

    The » + 2th generation will have:
                1/      1 \  . 1   /       1 \   , 1   ,   1  ,              1
               i(1-?)+4(1-«0+i+rG+
of the     character, and         so on.       The law is obvious ; the offspring will
always      have   the   same     amount       of the character as had the generation
after selection ceased.               If  we start with pedigree stock with unknown
ancestry beyond the nth generation, we reach the same conclusion.
Thus, after three generations                   the offspring will have 0-9027 of the
selected parents' character.                      Now stop selection and the fourth
generation        will have     :
                        0'9027       +     +
                    =   0-4515-r0-25O7-r0-1276               + 0-0729 =   0-9027,
the   fifth generation will have
                         0-9027   (ei+ 6j) +      fj+tl + rj =       0-9027,
again, and so on.            The general law is obvious.

    Thus, on the basis of the law of ancestral heredity the case against
panmixia      is even stronger than it appeared in my memoir on
heredity.* Assuming Mr. Galton's law of regression,               I  there showed
that panmixia was possible with a stable focus of regression, but that
the supporters of the consistent theory of panmixia must place that
focus of regression, in order that degeneration should be continuous,
in a position inconsistent with observed facts (p. 314). We now see
that with the law of ancestral heredity even this is not possible, a
race with six generations of selection will breed within 1*2 per cent,
of truth ever afterwards, unless the focus of regression instead of
 being eteady actually regredes.           Of course there are many ways in
 which this law may be modified.               For example, fertility may be a
maximum with the average, say, of the unselected original population,
and after a selection it may remain correlated, having the lesser
 values of the selected character more fertile than others.f                    Then,
of course, the stock would degenerate with panmixia.J                   This would,
however, be reproductive selection, not panmixia in the ordinary
significance, reversing natural selection.           We are far too ignorant at
 present of the correlation of fertility with other characters to base
any sweeping principle like that of degeneration by panmixia upon
it. Our attitude at present can only be that there are no facts, and
that there is no workable theory of heredity yet discovered which
favours in any way degeneration by panmixia.
    (9) Taxation of Inheritance.
                                        — If wo assume Mr. Galton's law of
ancestral heredity to be a limiting statement, we can at once from
 our general formulffl ascertain the influence of " taxing the inherit
       "
ance      in any other than Mr. Galton's form. He has, in fact, taxed
the inheritance (where by " inheritance
                                                     "

from     the mean of the general population, not actual size of the
character), 50 per cent, in each transmission.             There may, however,
be two types of taxation,             a general taxation on the individual
receipts    and  a special   tax  on  each transmission — corresponding, so to
speak, to a duty paid by an individual on coming into receipt of the
entire ancestral property, and a stamp duty on each conveyance of an
individual ancestor's contribution. The first is represented by the
7 of   our equation (x), and the second by the \/2p.
    Mr. Galton, in his memoir on Basset hounds, has stated certain
conditions of the law of ancestral heredity, and he concludes               (p.  403)
that his conditions are only fulfilled by the series

     It     seems to me that they are equally well fulfilled by the series

Mr. Galton's law of ancestral heredity          = l), allows a greater             (7

 Galton's unmodified law. Now the direct correlations as given by that
law certainly appear somewhat small for both stature and cephalic
index in man. Hence it is quite possible that when more extensive
data are forthcoming, it will be found necessary to modify Mr. Galton's
form and take 7 less than unity. The above table will suffice to indicate
the general direction of the correlation changes which result when 7
is varied.       Ono point should be noticed, the total regression on an
individual mid-parent (note, not the partial regression) continually
increases as we go further back, and will ultimately be greater than
unity; in our case this will happen at the 10th generation. Now in such
a generation an individual has 1024 10th great-grandparents,                     and,
were they independent, the mean of these could hardly differ widely
from the population mean.              Hence the total regression coefficient
being greater than unity is not so significant as it might at first
sight seem. What it amounts to is this : that if we only knew of an
individual that his mid-parent in a very distant generation had more
oi a character than the then population mean, and knew nothing
about his other mid-parents, then the individual would probably have
more of that character than the mid-parent.                The apparent paradox
arises from the very small variability of a distant mid-parent, and
hence the extreme improbablility of a mid-parent differing very
 widely from the population mean.               Of course with close in-and-in
breeding the modification introduced by assortative mating could
not be neglected, and our whole investigation would need modifica
tion.* Until, however, we have more measurements to deal with, it
is idle to develop at length all the consequences which flow from the
generalised form of Galton's law.
    (10) Collateral Heredity. — There is another point on which the
law of ancestral heredity gives us fall information, namely, the cor
relation between brothers, cousins, and all other collateral relatives.
In my memoir of 1895, I felt bound to reject Mr. Galton's regression
coefficient for brothers, because its value seemed to me in contradic
tion with experience.         I  wrote (p. 285) : —
   " There is not, I think, sufficient gronnd at present for forming
any definite conclusion as to the manner in which lineal is related to
collateral heredity.         It does not seem to me necessary that the
coefficient for the former should be half that for the latter, as sup
posed by Mr. Galton."
   And again : —
   *  I  hope   to return to this point again.   Wo have neglected  e in equations (ii)
and (iv).     In endeavouring to follow back   my own family to its fourth,  and eTen
sixth great-grandparents, I was surprised to find only one first and one second
cousin marriage among the ascertainable        ancestors. According, however, to O.
Lorenz (' Lehrbuch der Genealogie,' s. 305), the present German Emperor has only
 44 instead of 64 sixth parents, and 275 instead of 4096 twelfth parents !

    (12) On Gross Heredity. — In my memoir on heredity cf 1895,                         I
 have defined cross heredity as the correlation between different organs
 in any two relations.*            If we consider Galton's law of ancestral
 heredity to be applicable to the inheritance of any character or
quality whatsoever, then we can obtain from it a solution of the whole
problem of cross heredity.               This solution seems so simple and
plausible that it deserves careful consideration, and                  I  hope shortly
 to be able to test it by the measurements in my possession.
    Let A and B be any two relatives ; 1 and 3 represent any two
 organs in A, 2 and 4 the same organs in B.
    Now suppose we investigate the manner in which the index 1 to 3
 is inherited by B, i.e., let us find the correlation between the indices
 1 to 3 and 2 to 4.        Let p be the coefficient of heredity between the
 degrees of blood A and B, and suppose it by Galton's law to take
the same value for all qualities and characters, then r will be the
correlation not only between 1 and 2, and 3 and 4, but also between
 the indices 1 to 3 and 2 to 4.         The value of this correlation was given
            '
 by me in Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vol. 60, p. 493, Equation iv, and is

 where Vi, r2, v3, Vi are the coefficients of variation of the four organs,
and the r's are their coefficients of correlation.
    Now if there    be no secular selection v\         =  v2, v3  =   »«, and ra =   r2l ;

Or the mean of the two coefficients of cross heredity is the product of
the coefficient of direct heredity into the correlation of the two organs
in the same individual. Now in all cases of interchangeable relation
ship, i.e., brother and brother, or cousin and cousin, ru = r23, and
it is highly probable that this is also true where the relationship
is not interchangeable, e.g., parent and offspring.* Thus we reach
the exceedingly simple rule for cross heredity. Multiply the coefficient
of direct heredity     by the coefficient  of organic correlation, and    we have the
coefficient of cross heredity.
   For example, the organic correlation between femur and humerus
is about 0"85 for Aino or French males.                Hence we should expect to
find the cross heredity between femur of parent and humerus of
offspring to be about 0'3 x 0"85 = 0-25. Thus Galton's law, even if
it be not absolutely correct, will still serve as a useful standard to
test the problems of cross heredity.
    (13) Conclusion. — The above illustrations of Galton's law will
suffice to prove the wide extent of its applications.                 If either that
law, or its suggested modification,               be substantially correct, they
embrace the whole theory of heredity.                 They bring into one simple
statement an immense range of facts, thus fulfilling the fundamental
purpose of a great law of nature.            It is true that there are difficulties
which will have to be met, among which                  I would note two in par
ticular   :
    (i) Galton's law makes the amount of inheritance an absolute
constant for each pair of relatives.            It would thus appear not to be a
 character of race or species, or one capable of modification                       by
natural selection.       This seems to me a priori to be improbable.                   I
should imagine that greater or less inheritance of ancestral qualities
might be a distinct advantage or disadvantage, and we should expect
inheritance to be subject to the principle of evolution.                   This diffi-
   * For  example,  the correlation between the arm length of one brother and the
stature of a second, must bo equal to the correlation between the arm length of the
second and the stature of the first.    It is probable, but requires statistical confir-
matiou,  that the correlation between stature of parent and arm length of offspring
is equal to the correlation between arm length of parent and stature of offspring.

culty would be to some extent met by introducing the coefficient -/,
which I would propose to call the coefficient of heredity, and con
sider as capable of being modified with regard to both character and
race. As such a law would cover Mr. Gal ton's case, there does not
seem any objection to using the more general formula, until it is
found that the strength of heredity is the same for all characters and
races. Of course it may well be argued that heredity is something
prior to evolution, itself determining evolution, and not determined
by it. If this be so, its absolute fixity for all organs and races ought
to be capable of observational proof.
   (ii) For the inheritance of fertility in man from parent to offspring,
Miss Alice Lee has recently worked out 6,000 male, and 4,000 female
cases.    The result shows that fertility is probably a heritable cha
racter, but the correlation between parent and offspring is scarcely
one-tenth of that given by Galton's law.          The difficulties of any
fairly exact determination of the amount of fertility inherited in man
under the present artificial conditions are very great, but even allow
ing for these,   I  think we must assert that fertility is inherited in
man, but in a degree very much less than Galton's law would
require.
   I  hold, then, that, as far as our knowledge goes at present, we
must be cautions about treating 7 as exactly equal to unity.       That is
a limiting value which certainly gives strikingly good results for a great
deal of what is yet known, but we must wait at present for further
determinations of hereditary influence, before the actual degree of
approximation between law and nature can be appreciated.              Even
with regard to such determinations, there must be no haste to assert
that they actually do contradict Galton's law. That law states the
value of certain partial regression coefficients, the total regression
coefficients that we have deduced from them are only correct on certain
limiting hypotheses, the most important of which are the absence of
reproductive selection, i.e., the negligible correlation of fertility with
the inherited character, and the absence of sexual selection.       I  pro
pose   to  deal with   the results of Galton's law,     when    assortative
mating is taken into account, especially in the case of in-and-in
breeding, in another paper.       At present I would merely state my
opinion that, with all due reservations, it seems to me that the law
of ancestral heredity is likely to prove one of the most brilliant of
Mr. Galton's discoveries ; it is highly probable that it is the simple
descriptive statement which brings into a single focus all the complex
lines of hereditary influence.      If Darwinian evolution be natural
selection combined with heredity, then the single statement which
embraces the whole field of heredity must prove almost as epoch-
making to the biologist as the law of gravitation to the astronomer.

       On the Inheritance of the Cephalic Index."                    By Miss
       Cicely D. Fawoett, B.Sc, and Karl Pearson, M.A., F.R.S.,
       University College, London.            Received January 27, — Read
       February 17, 1898.
   (1) The cephalic index,     -when used to test any theory of heredity,
possesses many       merits, and   at the same time one or two defects.
In the first place it is supposed to be a marked racial character, and
therefore might     be considered   to be strongly inherited.      In the next
place it remains sensibly constant after two years of age; thus the
strength of inheritance can be ascertained by measurements on
young children, whose parents are more frequently alive than if we
have to wait for measurement           till  the offspring are of adult age.
Further, although        the cephalic index requires a more trained
hand to measure it        than some other measurements on the living
subject, the trained observer will always deduce sensibly the same-
results ;* on the other hand, stature measurements vary sensibly
with the hour of the day, and with the observer.                The need of a
moderately trained observer is the chief defect of cephalic index
measurements ; it hinders the rapid collection of numerous family
measurements ; the difficulty, further, of satisfactorily measuring the
female head without some derangement of the toilet is a further
hindrance, f The merits of the cephalic index, however, as a test of
heredity far surpass its demerits.          A well-organised measurement of
the cephalic index in pairs of relatives would probably give the best
results available for the laws of inheritance. The cephalic index
measured on the living head is of coarse not so satisfactory as that
measured on the skull, but the latter may be considered, even with
the aid of Rontgen rays, as at present quite out of the question. The
following paper has been worked out, not on very good material or
on material collected with the present end in view, but on the only
material that seemed at present available.           It suffices to justify the
view that the inheritance of the cephalic index offers a most satisfac
tory method of testing the laws of heredity.
   (2) Owing to the kindness of Mr. Francis Galton the Department
of Applied Mathematics in University College, London, was placed in
communication with Dr. Franz Boas, of the American Museum of
Natural History, who is well known for his elaborate system of

measurements on North American Indians.                       With extreme kindness
Dr. Boas* at once           forwarded     to England upwards of 1000 sheets of
measurements on comparable Indian tribes.                      These tribes, however,
contain extremely mixed blood.                  In the fewest cases were pure
Indian ancestors noted ; one of the grandparents at least exhibited as
a rule European blood — English, Dutch, French, Irish, &c. Dr. Boas
himself writes: —
      I
    " could not give you any series that was sufficiently extensive
and embraced pure Indians only, because among these tribes the
determination of relationships offers peculiar difficulties. I am afraid
that your results may also bring out the looseness of family
relations.       I  should not be surprised if the relation between father
and child were much lower than that between mother and child,
because often another person is actually the father of the child."
    Dr. Boas's last surmise is amply verified ; it will be found from the
table below that the coefficient of heredity between father and son is
abnormally small, while that between father and daughter is actually
less than the probable error of this series of measurements ! If we
put upon one side any purely hypothetical supposition that illegiti
mate births are more likely to be female than male, there would
seem reason to suppose some native custom by which it is held less
discreditable to pass off a daughter than a son upon the titular
husband.        It may be asked whether, if the racial mixture is so great
and the paternity so obscure, it was worth while to undertake the
lengthy arithmetict required to determine the hereditary correla
tions.     The answer is threefold : (a) if Galton's law of ancestral
heredity be correct, inheritance is not a racial character but a general
law of living forms, and racial mixtures will not influence the result ;
 (b) the results show that obscure paternity does not prevent good
values being found for other relationships ; in fact, the fulfilment of
Dr. Boas's surmise is in itself not without value, as showing how
well our algebraic theory fits itself to the facts ; it might almost be
said to provide a scientific measure of the conjugal fidelity of a race ;
(c) it is always worth while to undertake an investigation on the
best material available, even if it be poor material for this pur
pose, for it emphasizes the need of new and more elaborate obser
vations.
    (3)  It will     be seen   from the table that it has only been possible to
determine the coefficient of heredity for small series, varying from
80 to 143 pairs of the seven relationships, four corresponding to the
first degree of direct kinship and three to the first degree of collateral

kinship.      The probable        errors are,  as might    be expected     from such
small series, large.        Putting aside the paternal relationship, we are
justified in drawing certain general conclusions, which may be thus
summed up : —
    (a) The coefficients of heredity, as determined from the cephalic
index, differ in all cases from those determined for staturn by less
than their probable error, and therefore by less than the probable
error of their difference.           The stature coefficients were obtained for
the English        middle     classes.*    We thus conclude that these results
confirm Galton's law, in so far as they tend to show that the strength
of inheritance is not a character of race or organ.
    Cephalic index is clearly not more strongly inherited than stature.
Its variability is also very much that of stature. It is accordingly
difficult to see why it should be considered as peculiarly a racial
character.
    (6) The divergences between the observed values for the coeffi
cients of inheritance for the cephalic index, and the theoretical values
obtained on the basis of Galton's law of ancestral heredity, are
greater than the divergences between the former and the coefficients
for stature.    f   They do not, however, exceed the limits of errors of
observation.         In the case of mothers and sons the divergence is
very slightly above the probable error ; the observed and theoretical
values are identical in the case of mothers and daughters; they are
less than the probable error for brothers and brothers and only
slightly larger than it for brothers and sisters ; for sisters and sisters
the divergence is about one and a half times the probable error.
The mean weighted values of the coefficients for direct and collateral
kinship are 0'3366 and 0'4004!, the former differing by less than half
its probable error from the theoretical value 0'3000, and the latter
sensibly identical with its theoretical value, 0'4000.
    We conclude, therefore, that Galton's law of ancestral heredity
gives values for the inheritance within the limits of the probable
errors of observation.          But,
    (c) As in the case of stature there is, on the whole, a tendency of
the coetficients for cephalic index to be somewhat greater than their
values as given by Galton's law. It is therefore reasonable to sup
pose that the heredity constant 7 (introduced in the foregoing paper
" On the Law of Ancestral Heredity
                                               ") is not, as Mr. Gal ton takes it,
unity, but has some slightly less value.
    Other conclusions which may be drawn from the above table are:

  t It  is to be noted, that, putting paternity aside, the order of relative magnitude
of the coefficients   of heredity is precisely the same for both cephalic index and
stature.

 cephalic and more variable than the men. This is in accordance with
 the general conclusion reached in a paper on
                                                          " Variation in Man and
 Woman," * namely :
   " The lower races give us results in sensible accordance with those
we have drawn from the data for ancient civilisations, namely, the
women are on the whole more brachycephalic and slightly more
variable than the men."
    (e) The younger        generation is more brachycephalic                and more
variable than its parentage.
   The whole of this difference can hardly be due to any change of
shape of the skull with old age, for the majority cf parents had in
this case not passed the prime of life. It may be due to (i) a corre
lation between dolichocephaly and fertility or between dolichocephaly
and philogamy, or (ii) more probably to the action of natural
selection (results obtained, but not yet published, by the present
writers show a correlation between physique and cephalic index),
or (iii) to a greater or less admixture of white blood in the younger
generation.
   (/) Parents of sons are significantly less variable than parents of
daughters.        This is in accordance with the result previously ob
tained    that  mediocre fathers are likely to have sons,t but disagrees
with the result for stature — based on a far smaller probability — that
mediocre mothers are likely to have daughters.
   The conclusions of this paper, while appearing to the writers of
interest, are to be taken, in the first place, as suggestions for much larger
series of measurements and for new lines of investigation.

   In   a previous paper read before the Society on April 8, 1897,                  I
suggested that the special lines present in spectra of the first
division of helium stars (Type I, Divison la) might possibly be due to
oxygen.     These stars are associated by their position and distribu
tion with the gaseous nebula?, and some of the lines in their spectra
correspond with bright lines observed by Campbell in nebula?.                    The
snggestion from this        was   that  these    stars  are  in the   first  stage of
stellar development from gaseous nebulas.

  418         Mr. F. McClean.       Comparison    of Oxygen with the
     The special lines referred to are the extra lines which distinguish
  these spectra from those of the remaining helium stars of Divi
  sion lb.
     The indications in the spectra of the northern stars that these
  extra lines are due to oxygen are slight, as the lines at best are
  indistinct. Among the southern stars, however, there are several in
  the spectra of which these lines are better denned, and there is one,
  viz., ft Crucis, in which they are very fairly defined.
     The following stellar spectra are mounted on the accompanying
  plate, viz., «¦ Orionis, ft Scorpii, ft Canis Majoris, ft Centauri, and
  ft Crucis. These photographs are intended to show the gradual im
  provement in the definition of the extra lines, between k Orionis and
  ft Crucis, and to indicate their identity of origin throughout.
     The extra lines in the spectrum of ft Crncis are singled out by
  comparison with another helium star, viz., k Argus, of Division It,
 in which the extra lines do not appear. The lines are drawn out by
 themselves below the spectrum of ft Crucis. They are then com
 pared directly by juxtaposition with a drawing of the spectrum of
 oxygen as tabulated in the spectrum of air by Neovius (Stockholm,
  1891, and Appendix E, 1894, of 'Watts's Index').
     This comparison shows a close correspondence in the grouping of
 the extra lines with the spectrum of oxygen.          The most remarkable
 correspondence is in the case of the large group on either side of
 H8. A slight shift of about a tenth metre is required to bring the
 groups into identical positions.         However, the close similarity of
 the whole grouping of the two spectra as they appear on the plate
 admits of little doubt that the extra lines actually constitute the
 spectrum of oxygen.         If this be established the spectrum of the
 first division of helium stars would be due to hydrogen, helium, and
 oxygen.
     The scale attached to the spectra is based on standard lines that
 can be identified with certainty in the stellar spectra.         It is inter
 polated between the standard lines.           Its position in relation to the
 spectra is determined      by the hydrogen   lines.  The wave-lengths    em
 ployed are in accordance with Angstrom's scale.
     On the original negatives the distance between (H) and (F)
 measures about 1 inch.         The negatives are enlarged about eight and
 a half times.       It is difficult to fix the position of the lines — and
 especially of the hydrogen lines — on these enlargements with suffi
 cient accuracy.       A further correction than this would account for is
 however required in order to reduce the two spectra to exact coinci
dence.      I  believe it should be sought to some extent in a re
examination of the adopted wave-lengths of the hydrogen and of I
the oxygen spectra.

  Wolf-Rayet     stars, of which    it is the principal example, are thus
 classified as helium stars. There are also some coincidences between
 the bright lines of 7 Argus and the spectrum of oxygen, which
                                                                            •
 suggest a possible connection.
     The spectrum of ft Centauri is also given as a bright line helium
 star.    The bright lines in this case are due to hydrogen, and the
 spectrum resembles that of 7 Cassiopeia?. The spectrum of e Centauri
 is similar.
    I  take this opportunity of presenting a summary of the spectra of
 116   stars to the 3i magnitude in the Southern Hemisphere.            They
 were photographed between May and October last by means of my
 own object-glass prism, mounted in front of the Cape astrographic
 telescope.    This instrument, which is similar to my own telescope at
 Husthall, with which the spectra of the northern stars were photo
 graphed, was kindly placed at my disposal by H.M. Astronomer,
 Dr. Gill. It may be a little time before the actual photographs of
 the stellar spectra are ready for presentation, and meanwhile the
 results are of interest.
    In my   previous   paper  I  divided the sphere into eight equal areas
 consisting   or  two galactic equatorial areas and two galactic polar
 areas, situated on either side of the galactic equator.      The northern
stars already given occupy the upper or northerly lateral areas A,
 B, C, and D, also the southerly area AA.         The southern stars now
given occupy the lower or southerly lateral areas BB, CC, and DD.
 Their photographic spectra are distributed into these areas, and are
classified on the same system as in the previous paper.         The table of
distribution for the whole sphere by areas and classes is given below.
    There are in all 89 helium stars (Division I), distributed 71 in the
galactic zones and 18 in the galactic polar areas, the areas being
equal.     There are 29 in the upper galactic zone (B and BB), and 42
in the lower galactic zone (C and CC). There are 9 in the upper
polar areas (A and AA), and 9 in the lower polar areas (D and DD).
There are 23 in the northerly halves of the two galactic zones (B
and C) and 48 in the southerly halves (BB and CC).
    The 81 stars in Division II, the Sirian stars, and Division 111, the
Procyon stars (which along with Division I constitute Secchi's
Type I) are rather irregularly distributed throughout the sphere.
There are 40 in the galactic zones and 41 in the galactic polar areas.
There are 18 in the upper galactic zone (B and BB) and 22 in the
lower (C and CC). There are 29 in the upper polar areas (A and
AA) and 12 in the lower (D and DD). To the extent of the obser
vations there is no condensation of stars of Divisions         II  and III in
the galactic zones as there is in the case of stars of Division I.

are fairly evenly distributed throughout the sphere.     There are 52
in the galactic zones and 54 in the galactic polar areas. There are
22 in the upper galactic zone (B and BB) and 30 in the lower
 (C and CC). There are 27 in the upper polar areas (A and AA)
and 27 in the lower (D and DD).
   The general distribution of the types of spectra throughout the
sphere to the extent of the observations bears out generally the
conclusion that stars with spectra of the more advanced types, in
order of development, are evenly distributed in space. Also that
stars with spectra more recent in order cf development are mostly
congregated in the galactic zones. The helium stars of Division I
are predominant in the Southern Hemisphere,        being congregated
in the lower or southerly halves of the galactic zones (BB and CC).
They include 48 stars out of a total of 94 stars in those areas.
They are also more closely congregated in the vicinity of the galaxy
than is the case in the northerly halves of the galactic zones. In
the contiguous constellations of Musca, Crux, Centaums, Lupus,
and Scorpio there are 27 helium stars out of a total of 36 stars
included in the tables.     (The distribution of the helium stars
throughout the sphere was illustrated by two small hand charts,
not reproduced, on which these stars are coloured red.)         Appa
rently the region in which the first stage of stellar development is
now most active lies in the southerly half of the galaxy.

«' The Scientific Advantages of an Antarctic Expedition."             By
       John Murray, D.Sc, LL.D., Ph.D., F.R.S.                 Received
                     —
       January 25, Read February 24, 1898.
    From a scientiBc point of view the advantages to be derived from
a well- equipped and well-directed expedition to the Antarctic would,
at the present time, be manifold.          Every department of natural
knowledge would be enriched by systematic observations as to
the order in which phenomena coexist and follow each other in
regions of the earth's surface about which we know very little or
are wholly ignorant.       It is one of the great objects of science to
collect observations   of  the kind here indicated, and it may be safely
said that without them we can never arrive at a right understanding
of the phenomena by which we are surrounded, even in the habitable
parts of the globe.
    Before considering the various orders of phenomena, concerning
which fuller information is urgently desired, it may be well to point
ont a fundamental topographical difference between the Arctic and
Antarctic.     In the northern hemisphere there is a polar sea almost
completely surrounded by continental land, and continental conditions
for the most part prevail.      In the southern hemisphere, on the other
hand, there is almost certainly a continent at the South Pole, which
is completely surrounded by the ocean, and, in those latitudes, the
most simple and extended        oceanic conditions on the surface of the
globe are encountered.
                               The Atmosphere.
    One of the most remarkable features in the meteorology of the
globe is the low atmospheric pressure at all seasons in the southern
hemisphere south of latitude 45° S., with the accompanying strong
westerly and north-westerly winds, large rain- and snow-fall, all
round the South Polar regions.        The mean pressure seems to be less
than 29 inches, which is much lower than in similar latitudes in the
northern hemisphere.         Some meteorologists    hold that this vast
cyclonic system and low-pressure area continues south as far as the
pole, the more southerly parts beirg traversed by secondary cyclones.
There are, however, many indications that the extreme South Polar
area is occupied by a vast anticyclone, out of which winds blow
towards the girdle of low pressure outside the ice-bound legion.      In
support   of this view it is pointed out that Ross's barometric observa
tions indicate a gradual rise in the pressure south of the latitude of
75° S., and all Antaictic voyagers agree that when near the ice the

         The Scientific Advantages       of an Antarctic Expedition.            425
majority of the winds are from the south and south-east, and bring
clear weather with fall of temperature, while northerly winds bring
thick fogs with rise of temperature.
   All our knowledge of the meteorological conditions of the Ant
arctic is limited to a few observations during the midsummer
months, and these indicate that the temperature of tho snow-
covered Antarctic continent is even at that time much lower than
that of the surrounding sea. The anticyclonic area at the South
Pole appears therefore to be permanent, and when in winter the sea-
ice is for the most part continuous and extends far to the north, the
anticyclonic area has most probably a much wider extension than in
summer.       This is indicated by the south-easterly winds which at
times blow towards the southern point of the American continent in
June and July.
    All observations in high southern latitudes indicate an extremely
low summer temperature In winter we have no direct observations.
The mean of Ross's air temperatures south of latitude 63° S. was
28 74° F., which is about the freezing point of sea-water, and his
 maximum temperature was 43"5° P. Both Wilkes and D'Urville
observed pools of fresh water on several icebergs, and, when sailing
                                            " gigantic icicles
along the ice barrier, Ross saw                                    depending from
every projecting point of its perpendicular cliffs,"* so              it is probable
that extensive melting sometimes takes place.
    In the latitude of the Antarctic circle the air is frequently at or
near the point of saturation, and precipitation takes place in the
form of rain, sleet, snow, or hail. Most of the observations near the
ice-covered land show, however, a much drier atmosphere, and in all
 probability precipitation over the Antarctic continent takes place in
the form of fine snow crystals, such as is recorded in the interior of
 Greenland.
    There would appear, then, to be good reasons for believing that the
 region of the South Pole is covered by what may be regarded prac
 tically as a great permanent anticyclone, with a much wider exten
 sion in winter than in summer.           It is most likely that the prevailing
 winds blow out      from  the   pole   all  the year round towards the sur
 rounding sea, as in the case of Greenland, but, unlike Greenland, this
 area is probably seldom traversed by cyclonic disturbances.
     But what has been stated only shows how little real knowledge wo
 possess    concerning tho atmospheric conditions of high southern
 latitudes.    It is certain, however, that even two years' systematic
 observations within these regions would be of the utmost value for
 the future of meteorological science.

                                Antarctic Ice.
      From many points of view it would be important to learn some
  thing abont the condition and distribution of Antarctic sea-ice during
  the winter montbs, and especially about the position and motions of the
  huge table-shaped icebergs at this and other seasons of the year. These
  flat-topped icebergs, with a thickness of 1200 or 1500 feet, with their
  stratification and their perpendicular cliffs, which rise 150 or 200
  feet above and sink 1100 or 1400 feet below the level of the sea,
  form the most striking peculiarity of the Antarctic Ocean. Their
  form and structure seem clearly to indicate that they were formed
 on an extended land surface, and have been pushed out over low-lying
 coasts into the sea.
      Ross sailed for 300 miles along the face of a great ice-barrier from
  150 to 200 feet in height, off which he obtained depths of 1800 and
 2400 feet.      This was evidently the sea-front of a great creeping
 glacier or ice-cap just then in the condition to give birth to the
 table-shaped icebergs, miles in length, which have been described by
 every Antarctic voyager.
     All Antarctic land is not, however, surrounded by such inacces
 sible cliffs of ice, for along the seaward faces of the great mountain
 ranges of Victoria Land the ice and snow which descend to the sea
 apparently form cliffs not higher than 10 to 20 feet, and in 1895 Kris-
 tensen and Borchgrevink landed at Cape Adare on a pebbly beach,
 occupied by a penguin rookery, without encountering any land-ice
 descending to the sea. Where a penguin rookery is situated, we may
 be quite sure that there is occasionally open water for a considerable
 portion of the year, and that consequently landing might be effected
 without much difficulty or delay, and further that a party, once
 landed, might with safety winter at such a spot, where the penguins
 would furnish an abundant supply of food and fuel.            A properly
 equipped party of observers       situated   at a point like this on the
 Antarctic continent for one or two winters might carry out a most
 valuable series of scientific observations, make successful excursions
towards the interior, and bring back valuable information as to the
probable thickness of the ice-cap, its temperature at different levels,
its rate of accumulation, and its motions, concerning all which points
there is much difference of opinion among scientific men.
                               Antarctic Land.
     Is there an Antarctic continent?      It has already been stated that
the form and structure of the Antarctic icebergs indicate that they
were built up on, and had flowed over, an extended land surface. As
these bergs are floated to the north and broken up in warmer lati

tudes they distribute over the floor of the ocean a large quantity of
glaciated rock fragments and land detritus.           These materials were
                      " Challenger   " in considerable quantity, and they
dredged np by the
show that the rocks over which the Antarctic land-ice moved
were gneisses, granites, mica-schists, quartziferous diorites, grained
quartzites, sandstones, limestones, and shales.          These lithological
types  are distinctively  indicative of continental  land, and there can be
no doubt about their having been transported from land situated
towards the South Pole.           D'Urville describes rocky islets off
Adelie Land composed of granite and gneiss. Wilkes found on an
iceberg, near the same place, boulders of red sandstone and basalt.
Borchgrevink and Bull have brought back fragments of mica-schists
and other continental rocks from Cape Adare.           Dr. Donald brought
back from Joinville Island a piece of red jasper or chert containing
Badiolaria and Sponge spicules.            Captain Larsen brought from
 Seymour Island pieces of fossil coniferous wood, and also fossil
shells of Cucullcea, Cytherea, Cyprina, Teredo, and Natica, having a
close resemblance to species known to occur in lower Tertiary beds
in Britain and Patagonia. These fossil remains indicate in these areas
a much warmer climato in past times.          We are thus in possession of
abundant indications that there is a wide extent of continental land
within the ice-bound regions of the southern hemisphere.
   It is not likely that any living land-fauna will be discovered on
the Antarctic continent away from the penguin rookeries.               Still,
an Antarctic expedition will certainly throw much light on many
geological problems.       Fossil finds in high latitudes are always of
special importance.      The pieces of fossil wood from Seymour Island
can hardly be the only relics of plant life that are likely to be met
with in Tertiary and even older systems within the Antarctic. Ter
tiary, Mesozoic, and Palaeozoic forms are tolerably well developed in
the Arctic regions, and the occurrence of like forms in the Antarctic
regions might be expected to suggest much as to former geographi
cal changes, such as the extension of Antarctica towards the north,
and its connexion with, or isolation from, the northern continents,
and also as to former climatic changes, such as the presence in
 pre-Tertiary times of a uniform temperature in the waters of the
ocean all over the surface of the globe.
  Magnetic and Pendulum Observations, Geodetic Measurements, Tides,
                                and Currents.
    In any Antarctic expedition magnetic observations would, of
course, form an essential part of the work to be undertaken, and the
 importance of such observations has been frequently dwelt upon by
 eminent physicists and navigators. Should a party of competent

428                          Dr.  J. Murray.
observers be stationed at Cape Adare for two years, pendulum obser
vations could be carried out there and at other points within the
Antarctic, or even on the ice-cap and icebergs.        It might be possible
to measure a degree on the Antarctic          continent or ice-cap, which
would be a most useful thing to do.         By watching the motions of
the icebergs and ice from land at Cape Adare much would be learnt
about oceanic currents, and our knowledge of the tides would be
increased by a systematic series of tidal observations on the shores
of the Antarctic continent, where we have at present no observa
tions.    The series of scientific observations here mentioned, and
others that might be indicated, would fill up many gaps in our
knowledge     of the physical conditions        of these high southern
latitudes.
                       Depth of the Antarctic   Ocean.
    In regard to the depth of the ocean immediately surrounding         the
Antarctic continent we have at present very meagre information,
and one of the objects of an Antarctic expedition would be to supple
ment our knowledge        by an extensive series of soundings in all
directions throughout the Antarctic and Southern Oceans. It would
in this way   be possible,  after a careful consideration of the depths
 and marine deposits, to trace out approximately the outlines of the
Antarctic continent.       At the present time we know that Ross
obtained depths     of  100 to 500 fathoms all over the great bank
extending to the east of Victoria Land, and somewhat similar
 depths have been obtained extending for pome distance to the east of
Joinville Island. Wilkes sounded in depths of 500 and 800 fathoms
about 20 or 30 miles off Adelie Land.           The depths found by the
 " Challenger '' in the neighbourhood of the Antarctic circle were
 from 1300 to 1800 fathoms, and further north the "Challenger''
 soundings ranged from 1260 to 2600 fathoms.           To the south-west of
 South Georgia, Ross paid out 4000 fathoms of lino without reaching
bottom.     In the charts of depth which I have constructed         I have
always placed a deep sea in this position, for it appears to me that
 Ross, who knew very well how to take soundings, was not likely to
have been mistaken in work of this kind.
    The few indications which we thus possess of the depth of the
ocean in this part of the world seem to show that there is a gradual
shoaling of the ocean from very deep water towards the Antarctic
continent, and, so far as we yet know, either from soundings or tem
perature observations, there are no basins cut off from general
oceanic circulation by barriers or ridges, similar to those found
towards the Arctic.

         The Scientific Advantages of an Antarctic Expedition.          429
                      Deposits of the Antarctic Ocean.
    The deposits which have been obtained close to the Antarctic con
tinent consist of blue mud, containing glauconite, made up for the
most part of detrital matters brought down from the land, but con
taining a considerable admixture of the remains of pelagic and other
organisms.     Further to the north there is a very pure diatom ooze,
containing a considerable quantity of detrital matter from icebergs,
and a few pelagic foraminifera.      This deposit appears to form a zone
right round the earth in these latitudes.      Still further to the north
the deposits pass in deep water, either into a Globigerina ooze, or
into a red clay with manganese nodules, sharks' teeth, ear-bones of
whales, and the other materials characteristic of that deep-sea
deposit. Since these views, however, as to the distribution of deep-sea
deposits throughout these high southern latitudes, are. founded upon
relatively few samples, it cannot be doubted that further .samples
from different depths in the unexplored regions would yield most
interesting information.
                    Temperature of the Antarctic Ocean.
    The mean daily temperature of the surface waters of the Antarctic,
as recorded   by Ross, to the south of latitude 63° S. in the summer
 months, varies from 27'3° to 33G°, and the mean of all his obser
 vations is 29'85°. As already stated, his mean for the air during the
 same period is somewhat lower, being 28' 74°.         In fact, all observa
 tions seem to show that the surface water is warmer than the air
 during the summer months.
                        "
     The " Challenger      observations    of temperature      beneath the
 surface indicate the presence of a stratum of colder water wedged
 between warmer water at the surface, and warm water at the bottom.
 This wedge-shaped stratum of cold water extends through about 12p
 of latitude, the thin end terminating about latitude 53° S., its tem
 perature varying from 28° at the southern thick end to 32'5° at the
 northern thin end, while the temperature of the overlying water
 ranges from 29° in the south to 38° in the north, and that of the
 underlying water from 32° to 35°. This must be regarded as the
 distribution of temperature only during the summer, for it is im
 probable that during the winter months there is a warmer surface
  layer.
     In the greater depths of the Antarctic, as far south as the
  Antarctic circle, the temperature of the water varies between 32° and
  35° F., and is not, therefore, very different from the temperature of
  the deepest bottom water of the tropical regions of the ocean. The
   presence of this relatively warm water in the deeper parts of the

430                          Dr. J.  Murray.
Antarctic   Ocean may be explained by a consideration of general
oceanic   circulation.  The warm tropical waters which are driven
southwards along the eastern coasts of South America, Africa, and
Australia, into the great all-encircling Southern Ocean, there become
cooled as they are driven to the east by the strong westerly winds.
These waters, on account of their high salinity, can suffer much dilu
tion with Antarctic water, and still be denser than water from these
 higher latitudes at the same temperature. Here the density observa
tions and the sea-water gases indicate that the cold water fonnd at
the greater depths of the ocean probably leaves the surface and
sinks towards the bottom in the Southern Ocean, between the lati
tudes of 45° and 56° S. These deeper, but not necessarily bottom,
layers are then drawn slowly northwards towards the tropics, to
supply the deficiencies there produced by evaporation and south
ward-flowing surface currents, and these deeper layers of relatively
warm water appear likewise to be slowly drawn southwards to the
Antarctic area to supply the place of the ice-cold currents of surface
water drifted to the north. This warm underlying water is evidently
a potent factor in the melting and destruction        of the huge table-
topped icebergs of the southern hemisphere.         While these views as
to circulation appear to be well established, still a fuller examination
of these waters is most desirable at different seasons of the year,
with improved thermometers and sounding machines. Indeed, all
deep-sea apparatus has been so much improved as a result of the
"
   Challenger" explorations, that the labour of taking specific gravity
and all other oceanographical       observations   has been very much
lessened.
                   Pelagic IAfe of  the Antarctic Ocean.
   In the surface waters of the Antarctic there is     a great abundance
of diatoms and other marine alga?. These floating banks or meadows
form primarily not only the food of pelagic animals, but also the
food of the abundant deep-sea life which covers the floor of the
ocean in these south polar regions.      Pelagic animals, such as cope-
pods, amphipods, molluscs, and other marine organisms, are also very
abundant, although species are fewer than in tropical waters.       Some
of these animals seem to be nearly, if not quite, identical with those
found in high northern latitudes, and they have not been met with
in the intervening tropical zones. The numerous species of shelled
Pteropods, Foraminifera, Coecoliths and Rhabdoliths, which exist in
the tropical surface waters, gradually disappear as we approach the
Antarctic circle, where the shelled Pteropods are represented by a
small Limacina, and the Foraminifera by only two species of Olobi-
gcrina, which are apparently identical with those in the Arctic Ocean.

         The Scientific Advantages    of an Antarctic Expedition.    431
 Expedition in high southern latitndes, is the great rarity or absence
of the  pelagic larva? of benthonic organisms, and in this respect they
agree with similar collections from the cold waters of the Arctic
seas.     The absence of these larva? from polar waters may be
accounted for by the mode of development of benthonic organisms, to
 be referred to presently.   It must be remembered that many of these
 pelagic organisms pass    most of their lives in water of a temperature
 below 32°      and it would be most interesting to learn more about
 their reproduction and general life-history.
                    Benthos Life of the Antarctic Ocean.
   At  present we have no information as to the shallow-water fauna
of the Antarctic continent ; but, judging from what we do know of
the off-lying Antarctic islands, there are relatively few species in
 the shallow waters in depths less than 25 fathoms.         On the other
hand, life in the deeper waters appears to be exceptionally abundant.
 The total number of species of Metazoa collected by the " Challenger"
at Kerguelen in depths less than 50 fathoms was about 130, and the
number of additional species known from other sources from the
shallow waters of the same island is 112, making altogether 242
6pecies, or thirty species less than the number obtained in eight deep
hauls with the trawl and dredge in the Kerguelen region of the
Southern Ocean, in depths exceeding 1260 fathoms, in which eight
hauls 272 species were obtained.        Observations in other regions of
the Great Southern Ocean, where there is a low mean annual tem
 perature, also show that the marine fauna around the land in high
 southern latitudes appears to be very poor in species down to a depth
of 25 fathoms, when compared with the number of species present at
the mud-line about 100 fathoms, or even at depths of about 2 miles.
   In the year 1841 Sir James Clark Ross dredged off the Antarctic
continent species which he recognised as the same as he had been in
the habit of taking in equally high northern latitudes, and he sug
gested that they might have passed from the one pole to the other by
•way of the cold water of the deep sea.      Subsequent researches show
that, as with pelagic organisms, many of the bottom-living species
are identical with, or closely allied to, those of the Arctic regions,
and are not represented in the intermediate tropical areas. For
instance, the most striking character of the shore-fish fauna of the
Southern Ocean is the reappearance of types inhabiting the corre
sponding latitudes of the northern hemisphere, and not found in the
intervening tropical zone. This interruption of continuity in the
distribution of shore-fishes is exemplified by species as well as
genera, and Dr. Giinther enumerates eleven species and twenty-nine
genera as illustrating this method of distribution.

Fifty-four species of sea-weed shave also been recorded              as showing
a similar distribution.*         Bipolarity in the distribution of marine
organisms is a fact, however much naturalists may differ as to its
extent and the way in which it has originated.
    All those animals which secrete large quantities of carbonate of
lime greatly predominate in the tropics, such as Corals, Decapod
Crustacea, Lameilibranchs, and Gasteropods.               On the other hand,
those animals in which there is a feeble development of carbonate of
lime structnres predominate in cold polar waters, such as Hydroida,
Holothurioidea, Annelida, Amphipoda, Isopoda, and Tunicata.                 This
difference is in direct relation with the temperature of the water in
which these organisms live, a much more rapid and abundant pre
cipitate of carbonate of lime being thrown down in warm than in
 cold water by ammonium carbonate, one of the waste products of
organic activity.
    In the Southern and Sub-antarctic Ocean a large proportion of the
Echinoderms develop their young after a fashion which precludes
the possibility of a pelagic larval stage.              The young are reared
within or upon the body of the parent, and have a kind of com
mensal connection with her till they are large enough to take
care of themselves.         A similar method of direct development has
been observed in eight or nine species of Echinoderms from the
 cold waters of the northern hemisphere.              On the other hand, in
temperate and tropical regions the development of a free-swimming
 larva is so entirely the rule that it is usually described as the normal
habit of the Ecbinodermata.            This similarity in the mode of develop
 ment between Arctic and Antarctic Echinoderms (and the contrast
 to what takes place in the tropics) holds good also iu other classes
 of Invertebrates,       and probably accounts for the absence of free-
 swimming larvffi of benthonic animals in the surface gatherings in
Arctic and Antarctic waters.
    "What is urgently required             with reference to the biological
problems       here  indicated   is  a  fuller knowledge of the facts, and it
 cannot be doubted that an Antarctic expedition would bring back
 collections and observations of the greatest interest to all naturalists
 and physiologists, and without such information it is impossible to
 discuss with success the present distribution of organisms over the
 surface of the globe, or to form a true conception of the antecedent
 conditions by which that distribution has been brought about.

                           Concluding Remarks.
   There are many directions in which an Antarctic Expedition wonld
carry out important observations besides those already touched on
in the foregoing statement. From the purely exploratory point of
view much might be urged in favour of an Antarctic Expedition at
an early date ; for the further progress of scientific geography it is
essential to have a more exact knowledge of the topography of the
Antarctic regions. This would enable a more just conception of the
volume relations of land and sea to be formed, and in connexion
with pendulum observations some hints as to the density of the sub-
oceanic crust    and  the   depth of ice and snow on the Antarctic
continent might      be   obtained.    In case the above sketch may
possibly have created the impression that we really know a great
deal about the Antarctic regions, it is necessary to re-state that all
the general conclusions that have been indicated are largely hypo
thetical, and to again urge the necessity for a wider and more solid
base for generalisations.       The results of a successful Antarctic
Expedition would mark a great advance in the philosophy — apart
from the mere facts — of terrestrial science.
    No thinking person doubts that the Antarctic will be explored.
 The only questions are : when ? and by whom ? I should like to see
the work undertaken at once, and by the British Navy.            I should
like to see a sum of £150,000 inserted in the Estimates for the
purpose. The Government may have sufficient grounds for declining
 to send forth such an expedition at the present time, but that is no
reason why the scientific men of the country should not urge that
the exploration of the Antarctic would lead to important additions
to knowledge, and that, in the interests of science among English
speaking peoples, the United Kingdom should take not only a large
 but a leading part in any such explora tion.
                      Remarks by the Duke of Argyll.
    Scientific men generally feel, I think, that they do not need to give
detailed reasons in connexion with particular subjects of inquiry, to
 justify their unanimous desire for an Antarctic Expedition.         It is
 enough, surely,  for  them  to point out the fact that a very large area
of the surface of oar small planet is still almost unknown to us.
 That it should be so seems almost a reproach to our civilisation. As
 to detailed reasons, it may almost be said with truth that there is
 hardly one of the physical sciences on which important light may not

be cast  by Antarctic exploration.   Oceanic circulation ; meteorology ;
magnetism    ; distribution  of animal and vegetable life, not only in
the present but in the past ; geology ; mineralogy ; volcanic action
under special conditions — all of these are subjects on which the
phenomena of the Antarctic regions are sure to bear directly.
   If, however, I am asked to specify more particularly the question
on which I look for invaluable evidence which can be got nowhere
else, I must name, above all others, the most difficult questions
involved in quaternary geology.       Geologists are nearly all agreed
that there has been, very recently, a glacial age — an age in which
glacial conditions prevailed over the whole northern hemisphere to
a much lower latitude than they prevail now.              But geologists
differ widely and fundamentally from each other as to the form
which glacial agencies took during that period. In particular, many
                                          " ice sheet " — that is to
geologists believe in what they call an                              say,
in the northern world having been covered by an enormous mass of
                                                                   "
ice several thousand feet thick, which, as they assert, " flowed over
mountain areas as well as over plains, and filled up the bed of seas
of a considerable depth. Other geologists disbelieve iu this agency
altogether. They deny that even if such a body of ice ever existed,
it could possibly have moved in the way which the theory assumes.
They affirm, also, that the facts connected with glaciated surfaces
do not indicate the planing down by one universal sheet of
enormous weight and pressure; but, on the contrary, the action or
small and lighter bodies of ice, which have acted partially and un
equally on different surfaces differently exposed.
   We might have hoped that this controversy could be settled by
the facts connected with the only enormous ice-sheet which exists
in the Northern Hemisphere, viz., that which covers the great con
tinent of Greenland.       But that ice-sheet, enormous though it be,
does certainly not do what the ice-sheet of the Glacial Age is sup
posed to have done.         That is to say, it does not flow out from
Greenland, fill the adjacent seas, or override the opposite coasts,
even in so narrow a strait as Smith's Sound.        But this evidence is
negative only. In the Antarctic continent we have reason ts believe-
that there is a larger ice-sheet, and it certainly does protrude into
the adjacent seas, not merely by sending out vast floating frag
ments, but in unbroken ice cliffs of great height. Now we want to
know exactly under what conditions this protrusion takes place.
Dr. Murray speaks of it as " creeping seawards — a more cautious
                                          "
             "
word than flowing." But is it certain that it does even creep ?
May it not simply grow by accretion or aggregation till it reaches a
depth of water so great as to break it off by floatation ? Does it, or
does it not, carry detritus when no detritus has been dropped on its
surface ? Or does it pick up detritus from its own bed ? Or does

436                           Sir J. D. Hooker.
it push foreign matter before it ? Is the perfectly tabular form
of the Antarctic icebergs compatible with any differential movement
in the parent mass at all ; or does it not indicate, on the contrary, a
condition of immobility until their buoyancy lifts great fragments
off ? What is the condition of the rocks on which they rest H Is
there any thrust upon the mass from the mountain ranges on which
the gathering ground lies ? Or is the whole country one vast gather
ing ground from the continual excess of precipitation over melting ?
These    questions,    and  a   hundred   others,  have   to be solved by
Antarctic discovery; and until they are solved we cannot argue
with security on the geological history of our own now temperate
regions.     The Antarctic continent is unquestionably the region of
the earth in which glacial conditions are at their maximum, and
therefore it is the region in which we must look for all the informa-
ation attainable towards, perhaps, the most difficult problem with
 which geological science has to deal.
                        Bemarks by   Sir J. D. Hooker.
    Dr. Murray's admirable summary of the scientiflc information
obtainable by an organised exploration of the Antarctic regions
leaves nothing further to be said under that head.             I can only
 record the satisfaction with which I heard it, and my earnest hope
 that it will lead to action being taken by the Government in the
 direction indicated.
    Next to a consideration of the number and complexity of the
 objects to be attained by an Antarctic expedition, what dwells most
 in my imagination is the vast area of the unknown region which is to
 be the field   for investigation — a region which in its full extension
 reaches from the latitude of 60° S. to the Southern Pole, and em
 braces every degree of longitude.          This is a very considerable
 portion  of  the surface  of the globe, and  it is one that has been con-
 sidered to be for the most part inaccessible to man. I will therefore
 ask you to accompany the scientific explorer no further than to the
 threshold of the scenes of his labours, that you may see how soon
 and how urgently he is called upon to study some of those hitherto
 unsolved Antarctic problems that he will there encounter.
    In latitude 60° S. an open ocean girdles the globe without break
 of continuity. Proceeding southwards in it, probably before reach
 ing the Artarctic circle, he encounters the floating ice fields which
 form a circumpolar girdle, known as " the Pack," approximately con
 centric with the oceanic, interrupted in one meridian only, that
 south of Cape Horn, by the northern prolongation             of Graham's
 Land. Pursuing his southward course in search of seas or lands
 beyond, after the novelty of his position in the pack has worn off, he

           The Scientific Advantages        of an Antarctic Expedition.           437
asks where and how the components of these great fields of ice had
their origin, how they arrived at and maintain their present position,
what are their rate of progress and courses, and what their influence
on the surrounding atmosphere and ocean.                    I  believe  I am right in
thinking that to none of these questions can a fuller answer be given
than that they originated over extensive areas of open water in a
higher latitude than they now occupy, that they are formed of frozen
ocean water and snow, and that winds and currents have brought
them to where we now find them. But of the position of the southern
open waters, with the exception of the comparatively small area east
of Victoria Land,* we know nothing, nor do we know anything of the
relative amount of snow and ice of which they are composed, or of
their     age, or of the winds      and currents    that have carried       them to a
lower latitude.
     The other great glacial feature of the Antarctic area is " the
 Barrier," which Ross traced for 300 miles, in the 78th and 79th
 degrees of S. latitude, maintaining throughout the character of an
 inaccessible precipitous ice-cliff (the sea-front of a gigantic glacier)
 of 150 — 200 feet in height. This stupendous glacier is no doubt one
 parent of the huge table-topped ice-islands that infest the higher
 latitudes of the Southern Ocean ; but, as in the case of the pack ice,
 we do not know where the barrier has its origin, or anything further
 about it, than that it in great part rests on the bottom of a compara
 tively shallow ocean. It probably abuts upon land, possibly upon an
 Antarctic continent; but to prove this was impossible on the occa
 sion of Ross's visit, for the height of the crow's nest above the surface
 of the sea was not sufficient to enable him to overlook the upper
 surface of the ice, nor do I see any other way of settling this im
                                                                      —
  portant point except by the use of a captive baUoon an appliance
  with which I hope any future expedition to the Antarctic regions
  will be supplied. There were several occasions on which such an
  implement might have been advantageously used by Ross when he
  was coasting along the barrier; and there were more when it would
  have greatly facilitated his navigation in the Pack.
      I have chosen the subject of the Antarctic ice as the theme for my
  acknowledgment of the honour yon have done me in asking me to
  address this most important meeting, not only because it is one of
  the very first of the phenomena that demand the study of the
  explorer, but because it is the dominant feature in Antarctic naviga
  tion, where the ice is ever present, demanding, whether for being
                       "
     •  I refer to the pancake" ice, which in that area on several occasions formed
   with great rapidity around Ross's ships, lat. 7fic to 7S° 3., in February, 1842, aud
   which arrested their progress.     Such ice, augmented by furtlur freezing of the
   water and by snow, may     be regarded as the genesis of fields that, when broken up
   by gales, are carried to the north and contribute to the circumpolar pack.

     It may bo expected that should allude to those sections of Dr.
  Murray's summary that refer to the Antarctic fanna and flora. They
  are most important, for the South Polar Ocean swarms with animal
  and vegetable life. Large collections of these, taken both by the
  tow-net and by deep sea soundings, were made by Sir J. Ross, who
  was an ardent naturalist, and threw away no opportunity of observ
  ing and preserving         ; but unfortunately,       with the exception of the
  Diatomacece   (which     were   investigated     by Ehrenberg),    very few of the
  results  of his  labour    in this   direction  have  been  published.    A better
  fate, I  trust, awaits the treasures that the hoped-for expedition will
  bring back, for so prolific      is that ocean that the naturalist need never
  be idle, no, not even for         one of the twenty-four hours of daylight
  during a whole Antarctic          summer, and       I  look to the results of a
  comparison of the oceanic         life of the Arctic and Antarctic regions as
  the heralding of an epoch in the history of biology.

     With great pleasure        I accepted     the invitation to attend a discus
 sion meeting on the importance, for the advancement of every branch
 of science, of a scientific exploration of the Antarctic region. Re
 gardless of the season and my advanced age,              I hastened here to speak
 in the presence of so high a forum as the Royal Society of London,
 on the necessity of despatching as soon as possible an expedition
 towards the South Pole — an expedition cannot be dispensed with if
 we seriously desire the advancement of nearly every branch of human
 knowledge.       It is fifty-five years ago since one of the greatest Arctic
 and   Antarctic    explorers ceased his work, so exceedingly well executed,
 in the Antarctic regions, and, since that time, it has never been
 taken    up in any way comparable with that glorious scientific and
 nautical spirit manifested by Sir James Clark Ross.                  It is in view
 of this fact that we all look to the British nation as the one destined
to carry on the exploration of the South Polar regions, and to
assist    this object as much as lay in my power, and to do homage
to the memory of Ross, I could not fail to appear af this meeting.
    It is indeed a matter of great interest to examine the reason why so
long a time has been allowed to elapse since the first great successes
in the middle of this century. Undoubtedly political questions
have interfered in an unusual manner so to retard progress in Ant
arctic inquiry, but it is not that alone ; the cause is mainly that the
thorough understanding            of the importance of Antarctic research
requires an unusual amount of knowledge, and not in one branch
of science only, but in the whole complex of natural philosophy and

        The Scientific Advantages of an Antarctic Expedition.        439
 natural science. The positive advantages to be derived from a
 renewal of Antarctic exploration appear but few at first glance, and
 can only be detected by a far-sighted man. The Royal Geographical
 Society has taken tip the agitation for that renewal.  The Sixth Inter
 national Geographical Congress, two and a half years ago, devoted
 its influential exertions to the recommendation of it to the Govern
 ment, not only of this country, but, indeed, of all civilised countries.
 But now that the Royal Society has taken the matter up (an
 example which will be followed, I am convinced, by other academies
 of science), final success may be looked upon as matter of certainty.
    However much as has been done already to urge the importance
of the scientific investigation of the South Polar regions, from as
many points of view as there are branches of science cultivated
by mankind, I consider it my duty, as a representative of geo
physical science, to add all the arguments in my power to those
brought forward on the part of geologists, zoologists, botanists, and
others.
    A gravitation survey in connection with a thorough geographical
exploration of the Antarctic, is one of the most urgent requirements
of the science of our earth. There are no measurements of the
gravitation constant within the Antarctic region, indeed they are
very scarce in the southern hemisphere south of 30° south latitude.
Such measurements are so closely connected with the theory of the
figure of our earth, that it may well be asked how it can be con
sidered possible to achieve any advance in this respect, to arrive
at any conclusive results in this all-important fundamental matter,
without observations within the Autarctic region.        It is impossible
to foretell what effect an exact gravitation survey in that region might
exert upon our views with regard to all physical and terrestrial
constants, which depend on the radius of our earth.          Apart from
that consideration, we may hope for another important enlargement
of our knowledge bearing upon the connection between terrestrial
magnetism and gravity.         Gravity observations have been so much
simplified   of late by von Sterneck's ingenious apparatus, that there is
no serious difficulty in so multiplying gravity determinations within
the Antarctic region, that we shall be quite justified in speaking of a
"gravitation survey." The all-important question of the distribu
tion of land within the South Polar region is closely connected with
it, and our leading authority on geodesy, Professor Helmert, justly
lays great stress upon the observation of the force of gravity south
of 60° south latitude.         He induced the International Geodetic
Permanent Commission         to expressit   as their conviction that a
gravitation surveys within that region would be of the greatest benefit
for higher geodetic theory (October, 1895).
I     have already alluded to the probable connection between gravity

and terrestrial magnetism.     But apart from that, a magnetic survey
of the Antarctic region is of the greatest importance from other
points of view.    As, since the time of Boss, no fresh observations on
the values of the magnetic elements have been made, we are entirely
ignorant of the values of the secular variation south of £0° Iatitnde,
data so much needed for the construction of reliable magnetic charts.
 Of the situation of the southern magnetic pole, and of its motion
 during the last fifty years, we are equally ignorant. The situation
 of the southern extremity of the earth's magnetic axis and its motion
 throughout half a century are extremely important according to
 Gauss's theoretical deductions.      All computations, however intri
cate, must prove incomplete, and inadequately reward the immense
amount of labour bestowed upon them, unless reliable values of the
magnetic elements are first obtained, for which purpose a reduc
tion to a certain epoch by means of secular changes is indispensable.
But not merely for theoretical purposes is such value to be put npon
the knowledge of the magnetic character in the Antarctic, but also
for the construction of reliable magnetic charts for use in naviga
tion.    Certainly the studies of Carlheim-Gylleiskjold       and Tan
Bemmelen deserve great credit from a theoretical         point of view,
but they also cannot be carried to perfection unless we have a Found
knowledge of the magnetic character of the South Polar rrgior. —
at least as sound as that of the North Polar region.        Tn the time
of Ross, the magnetic Observatory at Hobart served as a safe
basis for observations on terrestrial magnetism, and now the excel
lent Observatory at Melbourne may be turned to a similar account.
    Well  as the mathematical    theory   of terrestrial magnetism has
been developed, of the physical theory of that mysterious natural
force, we are as yet in perfect ignorance.      This defect is certainlv
to some considerable degree caused by the deficiency of our know
 ledge in higher latitudes. It looks as if the magnetic character cf
 the South Polar region were such as would afford every facility for
 a sound investigation when        brought into comparison with the
 magnetic   conditions  of the  North   Polar region. A glance at the
 map shows how entirely different is the distribution of the magnetic
 force (action) in the two polar regions.    In the fouth there is to be
 noticed the interesting fact that the two foci of total intensitv are
 both situated    on the side towards the south of the Australian
 continent, and nearly on the same meridian.
    The magnetic action which makes itself manifest by magnetic
 storms or disturbances reaches its highest degree likewise south of
  the Australian continent, whereas to the south of South America
 these disturbances become very scarce and of a character in point
 of magnitude similar to those of the temperate zones.        This was
 most strikingly proved by the observations in Orange Bay and

        The Scientific Advantages           of an Antarctic Expedition.             441
South Georgia during the period of International Observations in
 1882-83.    Of course, the magnetic South Pole and the situation of
the foci above mentioned are in close connection with these facts,
but the reason for this distribution remains unexplained.               In
agreement    with  this is  the relative frequency  of the   South   Polar
lights within one and the same epoch. The map here shows the
results of a discussion of all observations on southern lights, and,
as may be perceived at a glance, the conformity with the fact jnst
mentioned with regard to the region of maximum disturbance is
striking. It may be mentioned, also, that a discussion of the mag
netic state of our earth for the epoch 1885 has yielded a curious
fact (perhaps merely a coincidence), namely, that Dr. Schmidt, of
Gotha, has calculated that part of the magnetic action of our earth
which lies outside        it,
                        above the earth's atmosphere probably, and has
arrived at the conclusion that this part amounts to about l/50th
part of the entire potential.       The curves which he constructed,
based on this calculation, show likewise a close coincidence with
the frequency of the southern lights. This requires to be further
investigated, for    it    perhaps a mere coincidence.
                            is                              The question
of atmospheric electricity, yet under the shadow of         hypothesis of
                                                                   a
more or less probability, may yield, in connection with the matters
touched upon, some results more definite than science has hitherto
been able to divine.     Under all these circumstances we perceive that
there are   a number of problems yet to be solved, which must stimu
late the scientific world to enter upon a close and conscientious
examination of a region still enveloped in total darkness.
   The necessity of climatological researches within the Antarctic
region has already been so much urged that              does not appear
                                                              it
necessary for me to enter upon the matter.         That      must remain
                                                                   it
impossible to arrive at exact climatological constants, so long as we
do not know the winter temperature in that large area round the
South Pole and bounded by the South Polar circle,               evident to
                                                                       is
every  one   conversant    with the  subject  and does  not   require  any
further illustration.
  With      regard   to     atmospheric      pressure there   is another curious
fact which requires             investigation, only to be carried on by observa
tions within the Antarctic.     The excess of barometric pressure in 35°
latitude over that in 6CP latitude amounts in the northern hemi
sphere to 19'0 mm. and in the southern hemisphere to only 3'7 mm.
Here  is  another problem worthy of examination.
   "With the recital of these few facts, which suffico to prompt us to
institute   a vigorous examination of the South Polar regions the
series is   far from being exhausted.      There     the question of the

geoid-deformation, the phenomena of the tides, the structure of the
ice arid its drifting, especially the interesting fact of the appearance

of ice in lower southern   latitudes, where it has never been observed
since observations thereon are recorded.
   The resolution of the Sixth International Congress of Geographers,
assembled here in August, 1895, according to which the present
century ought not to be allowed to expire without the unveiling of the
mysteries of the South Polar regions, ought to be carried into execu
tion by sending out an expedition to that end. All scientific institu
tions and societies have a well founded interest that such expedition
should take place without further delay.
                   Remarks by   Sir  Clements  Markham.
   I  need scarcely say how fully      I concur in every word that has
fallen ¦from Dr. Murray on the subject of the scientific results, and
more especially of the geographical results of an Antarctic Expe
dition. It is quite sufficient to point out the vast extent of the
unknown area, and that no area of like extent on the surface of the
earth ever failed to yield results of practical as well as of purely
scientific value by its exploration.
   But there is much more to be said in the present instance, because
the little that we do know of the Antarctic regions points unmis
takably to the very great importance and interest of the results
that are certain to attend further research.          The ice barrier dis
covered by Sir James Ross is known to be the source of the immense
ice islands of the Southern Polar Sea.        But it has only been seen for
a distance of 300 miles.    It requires far more complete examination
before any approach to an adequate knowledge can be obtained
respecting the extent aud nature of the supposed ice cap in its rear.
   We know that the Southern Continent is a region of actual
volcanic activity, but the extent, nature, and effects of that activity
remain to be ascertained.      On the Antarctic Circle land has been
sighted   at numerous   points, but it is unknown whether what has
been seen indicates small islands or a continuous coast line.
   Dr. Murray has pointed out that the whole Southern Continent is
certainly not bounded by such an ice wall as was seen by Sir James
Ross, and is not covered by an ice cap.         But the extent of the ice
cap  and  of the uncovered  land  is  unknown.     We are ignorant of the
distribution of land and sea, and of ice and water in summer, and of
the causes which influence snch distribution.
   The investigation of each one of these points, and of many others,
will lead to further discoveries as yet undreamt of, which must needs
be of the deepest interest to geographers.              There are eminent
scientific men present who will no doubt refer to the results of
exploration in other branches of science. Combined together they
make the exploration of the Antarctic regions the greatest and most
important work that remains to be achieved by this generation.

         The Scientific Advantages      of an Antarctic Expedition.      443
                    Remarks by Dr. Alexander Buclian.
   Dr. Alexander Buchan stated that his remarks would have exclusive
reference to the first two paragraphs of Dr. Murray's address, under
the heading of " The Atmosphere," but more immediately to the
relation between mean atmospheric pressure and prevailing winds.
He supposed he had been asked to speak on this occasion from the
extensive   and minute      knowledge    of the subject   he had necessarily
acquired in the preparation of the reports on atmospheric and
oceanic circulation which were published as two of the reports of tho
scientific results of the voyage o'f H.M.S. " Challenger."
   The former of these reports on atmospheric circulation, is accom
panied by twenty-six maps showing, by isobars for each month and
the year, the mean pressure of the atmosphere and by arrows the
prevailing winds of the globe, on hypsobathymetric             maps, or maps
showing by shadings the height of the land and the depth of the sea ;
first, on Gall's projection, and second, on north circumpolar maps on
equal surface projection. The isobars are drawn from mean pres
sures calculated for I066 places, and the winds from even a larger
number of places distributed as well as possible over the globe. It
may also be noted that the figures showing the averages of pressure
and prevailing winds are published with the report, accompani
ments to maps of mean atmospheric pressure and prevailing winds
of the globe not yet attempted by any other writer who has pub
lished such maps.
   This, then, is the work undertaken and published in these reports,
which occnpied seven years in preparing as time could be spared
from official duties. The result of the charting of the pressure and
prevailing winds is this : Stand with your back to the wind, then the
centre of lowest pressure that causes the wind is to the left in the
northern hemisphere and to the right hand in the southern hemi
sphere, a relation well known as Buys Ballot's law.           In charting the
1366 pressures   and    the  relative  prevailing   winds  no  exception was
found in any of the two hemispheres.            This is one of the broadest
generalisations   science    can  point  to, so  far as regards what takes
place in the free atmosphere.
    Some years ago a theory of atmospheric circulation was published
by the late Professor Ferrel, which, as it is not accordant with tho
broad results arrived at in the report on atmospheric circulation in
                   "
the " Challenger       reports, calls for serious consideration on account
of its bearing on any attempt proposed to be undertaken for the ex
ploration of the Antarctic regions.
    One of the more recent expositors of this theory is Professor
Davis, of Harvard College, who, in his ' Elementary Meteorology,'
Boston, U.S.A., 1894, gives an admirable exposition of the results

 444                            Dr A. Buchaii.
 now arrived at by the various workers in meteorology, and of the
 opinions and theories promulgated by different meteorologists in
 different departments of the science. The book is largely used in
 secondary schools and colleges of the United States, and the views
 there stated are widely held in America and are spreading into other
countries.
    The following extracts from Davis's book fairly represent         these
 views : —
    " The surface winds of the temperate latitudes, and the high level
 currents above them, sidling swiftly along on their steep poleward
gradients, must all be considered together.         They combine to form a
vast   aerial  vortex  or  eddy around   the  pole. In the northern hemi
sphere this great eddy is much interrupted by continental              high
pressure    in  winter  or  low pressure   in  summer,  and by  obstruction
from mountain ranges, as well as by irregular disturbances of the
general circulation in the form of storms" (p. 110).
   Now the facts of observation do not support the theory of the
existence at any season of the year, of a low barometric pressnre, or
an eddy of winds, round or in the neighbouring regions of the North
Pole.     Observations show us no prevailing winds blowing home
wards to the region of the North Pole at any time of the year.
No low barometric pressure occupies the immediate polar region in
any month ; but instead the opposite holds good for the four months
from April to July. In April and May the mean atmospheric pres
sure is higher in the region of the Pole than it is anywhere in the
northern hemisphere north of 43° lat. N. ; and in June and July
also higher than it is anywhere north of 55° lat. N.              Now the
higher pressnre in these four months necessitates the existence of
upper currents in order to maintain this high pressure about the
North Pole.        These upper currents towards the pole are exactly
opposed    to  the  requirements of the theory that the upper currents
in the region of the Pole must necessarily blow not towards hot
from the Pole.
   The actual centre, in this hemisphere, north of the tropic towards
which the winds on or near the surface of the earth blow, is not
the North Pole ; but in tho winter months the low barometric de
pressions in the north of the Atlantic and Pacific respectively, and
in the summer months the low barometric depressions in the Eura
sian and North American continents ; and the sources out of which
tho prevailing winds blow in the winter months, the high-pressnre
regions in Siberia and North America ; and in the summer months
the high-pressure       regions lying northward of these continents,
which, as already explained, are virtually the polar region itself.
These are the facts in all regions where the winds, according to
the theory, become winds blowing over the earth's surface.

         The Scientific  Advantages   of an Antarctic Expedition.   445
   As regards the southern hemisphere, Professor Davis states that    :
   " In the southern hemisphere the circumpolar eddy is much more
                                         " the
symmetrically developed."       Again,         high pressure that should
result   from  the low polar temperatures is therefore reversed into
low pressure by the excessive equatorward centrifugal force of the
great circumpolar whirl ; and the air thus held away from the polar
regions is seen in the tropical belts of high pressure" (pp. 110, 111)-
   The meaning of this is that the remarkable low-pressure region
of the southern hemisphere is continued southward to the South
Pole itself, the pressure diminishing all the way ; and that in the
region of the South Pole the aiv currents poured thitherwards along
the surface of the earth ascend and thence proceed northwards as
upper currents of such enormous intensity and volume that they
pile up in the tropical region of the southern hemisphere a mean
sea-level atmospheric presoure about an inch and a half higher than
the sea-level pressure near the South Pole whence it has started.
   Now, to bring the matter to the business which this meeting of
the Royal Society has in hand — if this theory were true and sup
ported by the facts of observation — it is plain that no meteorologist
could signify his approval of any scheme that could be proposed for
exploring the Antarctic regions, it being obvious that these strong
west-north- westerly winds, if they blow vortical ly round and in upon
the pole, heavily laden, as they necessarily would be, with the aqueous
vapour they have licked np from the Southern Ocean, would over
spread Antarctica with a climate of all but continuous rains, sleet,
and snow which no explorer, however intrepid and enthusiastic, could
possibly face.
    But is this the state of things ? Let it be at once conceded that,
as far south as about 55° lat. S., the prevailing winds and the
 steadily diminishing mean pressures on advancing southward, fairly
 well support the theory.         South of this, however, southerly and
 south-easterly winds begin to increase in frequency, until from
 60° lat. S. into higher latitudes, they become the prevailing winds.
 This is abundantly shown from the winds charted on the maps of
 the " Challenger
                    "
                       Report, as well as from the unanimous experience
 of all that have navigated this region from Ross to the present time.
 Thus the poleward blowing winds from west-north-west in these
 summer months stop short, distant at least 30° of latitude from the
 South Pole.
    These prevailing south-easterly winds necessarily imply, as has
 been shown in the analogous case of the North Pole, the existence
 of a more or less pronounced anticyclone overspreading Antarctica ;
 which in its turn necessarily implies the existence of upper currents
 from the northward, blowing towards and in upon the polar region
 to make good the drain caused by the surface out-blowing south

446                          Sir A. Geikie.
easterly winds.    It may, therefore, be concluded that both the
surface  winds and the upper aerial currents are diametrically opposed
to the requirements of this theory.
   What is now urgently called for is a well-equipped Antarctic-
Expedition to make observations which will enable meteorologists to
settle definitely the distribution of atmospheric pressure and the
prevailing winds of this great region.     Were this done, the position
in the Southern Ocean of the great ring of lowest pressure that en
circles the globe could be mapped out ; and since it is towards
such a low-pressure ring that the wind-driven surface currents of
the ocean flow, a contribution would thereby be made to ocean
ography, of an importance that cannot be overestimated, particularly
as regards the great question of oceanic circulation.
                        Remarks  ly Sir A. Geikie.
   Hardly anything is yet known of the geology of the Antarctic
regions.   By far the most important contributions to our knowledge
of the subject were made by the expedition under Sir James Ross.
But as he was unable to winter with his ships in the higher latitudes,
and could only here and there with difficulty effect a landing on the
coast, most of the geological information brought home by him was
gathered at a greater or less distance from the land with the aid of
the telescope.    Within the last few years several sealing vessels
have bronght home some additional scraps of intelligence which only
increase the desire for fuller knowledge.
   As regards the land, merely its edges have here and there been
seen.    Whether it is one great continent, or a succession of islands
and archipelagos,   may possibly never be ascertained.       We know
that in Victoria Land it terminates in a magnificent mountain range
with peaks from 10,000 to 15,000 feet high ; but that elsewhere it is
probably comparatively low, shedding its ice-cap in one vast sheet
into the sea.
   The rocks that constitute the land are still practically unknown.
The dredgings of the " Challenger " Expedition brought up pieces
of granite, gneiss, and other continental rocks, and detritus of these
materials was observed to increase on the sea-floor southwards in the
direction of the Antarctic land.        More recently several sealing
vessels have brought home from the islets of Graham Land, to the
south of the South Shetlands, pieces of different varieties of granite,
together with some volcanic rocks and fossiliferous limestones.      So
far as these rocks have been studied, they do not appear to differ
from similar rocks all over the globe.    The granites have been found
by Mr. Teall to be just such masses as might have come from any
old mountain-group in Europe or America.

blance to the
                     " radiolarian cherts" now found to be so widely
distributed among the older Palaeozoic rocks, both in the Old World
and in the New.          Ou closer examination, this first impression was
confirmed; and a subsequent microscopic study of thin slices of the
stone by Dr. Hinde proved the nndoubted presence of abundant
radiolaria. The specimen was a loose pebble picked np on the beach
of Joinville Island. We have no means of telling where it came
from or what is its geological age.         But its close resemblance to the
radiolarian cherts, so persistent in the Lower Silurian formations of
the United Kingdom, raises the question whether there are not
present in the Antarctic regions rocks of older Palaeozoic age.
    It would be of the utmost interest to discover such rocks in situ,
and to ascertain how far their fossils agree with those found in
deposits of similar antiquity in lower latitudes ; or whether, as far
back as early Palaeozoic time, any difference in climate had begun to
show itself betweeu the polar and other regions of the earth's surface.
    Among the specimens brought home by Dr. Donald and Captain
Lars en from Seymour Island in the same district arc a few contain
ing some half dozen species of fossil shells, which have been named
and described by Messrs. Sharman and Newton, who suggest that
they point to the existence of Lower Tertiary rocks, one of the
organisms resenibling a form found in the older Tertiary formations
of Patagonia. Large, well-developed shells of Cucullata and Cytherea
undoubtedly indicate the former existence of a far milder climate in
these Antarctic seas than now prevails.
    If a chance landing for a few hours on a bare islet could give us
these interesting glimpses into the geological past of the south polar
regions, what would not be gained by a more leisurely and well
planned expedition ?
    But, perhaps, the geological domain that would be most sure to
gain largely from such exploration would be that which embraces
the wide and fascinating field of volcanic action.            In the splendid
 harvest of results brought home by Sir James Ross, one of the most
thrilling features was the discovery of a volcano rising amid the
 universal snows to a height of more than 12,000 feet, and actively
 discharging "flame and smoke," while other lofty cones near it
 indicated that they too had once been in vigorous eruption.              Ross
landed on one or two islands near that coast and brought away some
 pieces of volcanic rocks.*
     If we glance at a terrestrial globe we can readily see that the
    * His collections are in the British Museum, but they have never been petro-
  gTapbically studied.

 volcanic ring or " circle of fire," which nearly surrounds the vast
 basin of the Pacific Ocean, Btretches southwards into New Zealand.
  The few observations that have been made in the scattered islands
  further south show that the Auckland, Campbell, and Macquarrie
 groups consist of, or at least include, materials of volcanic origin.
  Still further south, along the same general line, Mr. Borchgrevink
 has recently (1894- 95) made known the extension of Ross's volcanic
 region of Mount Erebus northwards to Cape Adare, the northern
  promontory of Victoria Land.          He noticed there the apparent
  intercalation of lava and ice, while bare snowless peaks seemed still
 further to point to the continued activity of the volcanic tires.
 Some specimens, brought by Captain Jenssen, from Possession
  Tsland were found by Mr. Teall to be highly vesicular hornblende-
  basalt; while one from Cape Adare was a nepheline-tephrite.
  This region is probably one of the most interesting volcanic tracts
 on the face of the globe.    Yet we can hardly be said to know more
 of it than its mere existence.       The deeply interesting problems
 which it suggests cannot be worked out by transitory voyagers.
 They must be attacked by observers stationed on the spot.          Ross
 thought that a winter station might be established near the foot of
 Mount Erebus, and that the interior could easily be traversed from
 there to the magnetic pole.
    But it is not merely in     Victoria Land that Antarctic volcanoes
 may bo studied.      Looking ngain at the globe, we observe that the
American volcanic band is prolonged in a north and south line
 down the western side of the southern continent.      That it has been
continued iuto the chain of the South Shetlands and Graham Land
 is proved by the occurrence there of old sheets of basalt, rising in
 terraces over each other, sometimes to a height of more than
 7,000 feet above the sea.       These denuded lavas may be as old as
those of our Western Isles, Faroe, Iceland, and Greenland.          But
that volcanic activity is not extinct there has recently been found
by Captain Larsen, who came upon a group of small volcanoes form
ing islets along the eastern coast line of Graham Land.            It is
tantalising to know no more about them.
    Another geological field where much fresh and important infor
mation might be obtained by Antarctic exploration is that of ice
and ice action.      Our northern hemisphere was once enveloped in
snow and ice, yet although for more than half a century geologists
have been studying the traces of the operations of this ice covering,
they are still far from having cleared up all the difficulties of the
study.     The Antarctic ice-cap is the largest in the world.        Its
behaviour could probably be watched along many parts of its
margiu, and this research would doubtless afford great help in the
interpretation of the glaciation of the northern hemisphere.

         7'he Scientific  Advantages   of an Antarctic Expedition.     449
    To sum up : — Geologists would hail the organisation and despatch
 of an Antarctic Expedition in the confident assurance that it could
 not fail greatly to advance the interests of their science.       Among
 the questions which it would help to elucidate, mention may be
 made of the following: —
    The nature of the rocks forming the land of the Antarctic regions
 and how far these rocks contain evidence bearing on the history of
 terrestrial climates.
    The extent to which the known fossiliferous formations of our
 globe can be traced towards the poles ; the gaps which may occur
between those formations and the light which their study may be
able to throw on the evolution of terrestrial topography.
   The history of volcanic action in the past and the conditions
 under which it is continued now in the polar regions ; whether in
 high latitudes volcanism, either in its internal magmas or superficial
eruptions, manifests peculiarities not observable nearer to the
equator ; what is the nature of the volcanic products now ejected
at the surface ; whether a definite sequence can be established from
the eruptions of still active volcanoes back into those of earlier
geological periods ; and whether among the older sheets leaf-beds
or other intercalations may be traceable, indicating the prolongation
of a well developed terrestrial flora towards the South Pole.
   The influence of the Antarctic climate upon the rocks exposed to
its action ; the effects of contact with ice and snow upon streams of
lava ; the result of the seaward creep of the ice-cap in regard to any
lava sheets intercalated in the ice.
   The physics of Antarctic ice in regard to the history of the Ice
Age in Northern Europe and America.
                 Remarks by Professor D'Arcy W. Thompson.
   The    exploration of the Antarctic gives promise of gains to
zoological knowledge that are in no degree less, in my opinion, than
in the case of the physical sciences.           The shore-fauna of the
Antarctic we know only by a few scanty collections made upon the
islands, especially upon Kerguelen Island ; and the fauna of the deep
sea is only represented by the produce of eight hauls of the
                                                                   " Chal

abundant life, indeed they were said, by common consent of the
naturalists of the " Challenger," to be the richest dredgings in all
her voyage: and they were as remarkable for the diversity as for the
abundance of the animals they procured.             We earnestly desire,
and the progress of zoological       science needs, further exploration of
the deep-sea fauna in all the oceans.      Our knowledge of the fauna of
the deep sea is only begun ; it is known much as the fauna of the

shore was known a hundred years ago, and we want to know more of
the undiscovered forms that are peculiar to it, and more of the struc
ture and affinities of those already discovered. Bat apart from
innumerable       facts appertaining    to systematic or morphological
zoology, such as every ocean has yet to yield to us, there are certain
great problems of geographical distribution to which the Antarctic is
peculiarly likely to give a clue. Lying open to, as it were at the
confluence of, all the great oceans, its fauna may co-ordinate and
explain many things in the divergent faunas of the Indian Ocean,
the Atlantic, and the Pacific. One such problem Dr. Murray has
touched      upon in his hypothesis of
                                         " bipolar distribution," that is to
say, of a general similarity and in many cases of actual identity
between the animals of the Arctic and Antarctic Seas. This theory
has been proclaimed before by others, by Theel, for instance, and by
Pfeffer ; but others have       contested   and   denied  it; for instance,
Ortmann in regard to the         Crustacea, and Chun in regard to pelagic
organisms.       We conld not    have a better illustration of the poverty
of our knowledge than the       circumstance that so broad and clear and
simple an issue as the existence or non-existence of a close relation be
tween the Arctic and Antarctic faunas should still be open to dispute.
    For my part      I think that the bipolar hypothesis, is not proven,
and I am inclined to think it is untrue.           I believe with Ortmarfn
that in the Decapod Crustacea at least one form is common to the
 Arctic and Antarctic Seas ; and with Chun and others that there is
 evidence that similar pelagic forms occurring in the north and south,
 though not in the surface waters of the tropical seas, are in these
 latter continued across the torrid zone in the deeper and cooler levels
 of the sea. I do not think that any single fish, or any Decapod or
 Isopod, or any certain one out of a large fauna of Amphipods known
 from the Antarctic Ocean, is also known from the Arctic and adjacent
 seas.    It  seems to me, however, that we have some good evidence of
 very curious similarities between the marine fauna of the Antarctic
 and that of the N. Pacific in the neighbourhood of Japan ; and it
 may be that this is to be in part explained by the existence of a line
 of communication along the Western American coast, in waters
 singularly cold for the latitude under which they lie. We know
 how, in this way, such conspicuous forms as the genus Serolis, the
 Penguins, the Sea-elephant, the Sea-lions, and the Fur-seals, I
 might add the giant Sea-weed Macrocystis seem to creep up the
 American shore, from what was probably their Antarctic home, to
  Chili, to the Galapagos, or even to North Pacific and to Japan. But
 these are illustrations merely of the zoological problems that Ant
 arctic exploration may solve. If the bipolar hypothesis be broken
 down, it will only give place to other hypotheses as interesting as itself.
 New facts will give rise to new hypotheses, for further facts to verify

of which we can foresee neither statement nor solution, as well as
the solution of those that we can already in some measure foresee.
"  On the Zoological Evidence for the Connection of Lake
        Tanganyika with the Sea." By J. E. S. MOORE, A.R.C.S.

        January 12, — Read January 27, 1898.
    (From the Huxley Research Laboratory, Royal College of       Science, London.)
   Before 1896, when I had the opportunity of studying the fauna of
Lake Tanganyika on the spot, it was known that there existed in the
so-called Sea of Ujiji, one animal, the affinities of which are undoubt
edly marine.          This was the medusa Limnocnida, which Dr. Boehm
saw as he crossed the lake in 1883.
   It was known further that the jelly-fish was associated in Tangan
yika with a number of strange molluscan forms, for the empty
shells of what appeared to be some six entirely new genera of gaster
opoda, had been brought home by Captain Speke, Joseph Thomson,
and Mr. Hore. As the animals contained in these shells have not
hitherto been known, their classification by the conchologists with
existing fresh-water types has always appeared extremely doubtful,
and from the first Mr. Edgar Smith, who described the greater
number of these forms, has held the opinion that they might eventu
ally turn out to have the same oceanic characters as the jelly-fish.
   It was therefore one of tho objects of my recent expedition to
obtain material for the complete determination of these molluscous
types,    and especially to ascertain if there were any other marine
organisms in the lake. The results of this attempt have been to
show : —
   I. That to the six genera of quasi-marine gasteropods, the shells
of which were known, viz., Typholia, Nassopsis, Limnotrochus, Syrno-
lopsis, the so-called Lithoglyphus, and Paramelania, there are now
to   be added at least two, entirely new generic forms, for which                    I
propose the names* Bathanalia and Bythoceras (figs.                  I and 2).     We
have therefore now representing the quasi-marine molluscs of Tan
ganyika eight genera of gasteropods, and to these should probably
be added among the Lamellibranchiata the so-called Unio Btirtoni
and one of the Tanganyika Spathas.f
  *   Diagnoses    of these new genera will be found in papers now in the hands of the

possess the same quasi-marine affinities.             Thus I found that among
the Crustacea there are two forms of prawns and one deep-water
crab.     Among the Hydrozoa the already known medusa Limnocnida.
Among Porifera one deep-water sponge; and lastly there are several
forms of Peridinea and ConJylostoma among the Protozoa. A large
proportion of these organisms are exceedingly peculiar ; but others
such as the two prawns, the deep-water crabs and sponge, and pos

              Connection   of Lake Tanganyika        vrith the Sea.            453
sibly the pelagic Protozoa, are much more nearly related to the
similar marine organisms -which have repeatedly contaminated the
fresh waters of the world elsewhere.          It should, however, be clearly
nnderstood that even these apparently more normal types have not
been found in Nyassa, Shirwa, or Eela, nor have tbey been recorded
from any of the Great Lakes further north. Therefore, although they
are less peculiar than their associates in Tanganyika, they probably
belong to the same quasi-marine, or what I shall in future call the
Halolimnic group.
   The results of a systematic survey which was made of the
geographical and bathymetric distribution of the aquatic molluscs
throughout the wide area over which the expedition had to pass have
demonstrated in the most conclusive manner the complete duality of
the Tanganyika fauna as a whole.* In Nyassa, Shirwa, Kela, and,
several minor lakes, taken together, all of which I visited and
dredged, there have been found the following molluscous types: —
 TJnio, Spatha,     Gorbicula,    Iridina, Limnwa, Isodora, Physopsis,
Planorbis, Ancylus, Ampullaria, Lanistes, Vivipara, Cleopatra, Bithynia,
and Melania.
   Not all of these fifteen genera which are now found living in
Nyassa are present in the smaller lakes. In the Shirwa they are
reduced to five, and in Kela they are only three.            The full Nyassan
series has, however, been recorded from the Victoria Nyanza, and in
this more northern group of lakes there is again seen the curious
reduction in the number of genera as we pass from the greater lakes
to the less. From these facts of distribution it is apparent that the
genera of molluscs, which occur in the African fresh waters, are very
constant over an immense area of ground.           There can indeed be little
doubt that the genera found in Nyassa characterise and constitute
the type of the truly African fresh-water fauna as a whole.
   The fauna of Tanganyika appears therefore to form a striking
contrast to this rule of uniformity in type which characterises the
fauna of all the other lakes.        Such divergence is, however, in one
sense more illusory than real.        All the Nyassa or Victoria Nyanza
genera are found living in Tanganyika, and the fauna of this lake
does not differ from the faunas of the others in kind or as a whole.
It differs from them merely in there being here added to the normal
series a number of molluscs which are not found elsewhere.                To this
superadded list, however, there attaches a unique interest, as it is
entirely composed of those ten genera of gasteropods and lamelli-
branchs which were instanced as possessing the same marine appear
ance as the jelly-fish and prawns.
    The strange geographical isolation of the halolimnic molluscs which

  454       Mr.  J. E. S. Moore.      Zoological Evidence for    the
  these facts disclose   is also true and characteristic of all the otber
  halolimnic animals   I  have named.     It is thus rendered evident that
 the entire halolimnic fauna as     it exists in Tanganyika now is some
  thing completely distinct from and superadded to the normal African
  lake fauna as a whole.     This fact is of the utmost import when we
  attempt to ascertain from what source the halolimnic animals have
  sprung.
     The isolation of these animals shows conclusively that they cannot
  have arisen, so to speak, de novo in Tanganyika through the effect of
  the conditions under which they live, for if this were so there would
  have arisen similar halolimnic animals nnder the apparently similar
 conditions which exist elsewhere.       For the same reason they cannot
 he regarded as the surviving representatives of an older fresh-water
 stock, since were this the case we should have to believe that this
 old stock had been destroyed in every African lake but one. Nyassa,
 moreover, appears to have been a fresh-water lake longer than Tan
 ganyika, yet in the Post-pleistooene deposits which occur along its
 shores no halolimnic fossils have been found.
     Now it is perhaps conceivable that prawns, which are active
 vigorous organisms, could by great exertions have made their way up
 the numerous falls along the single effluent of Tanganyika from the
 sea in recent times, for they have certainly thus entered many
 lakes already known.       But with respect to the remaining halolimnic
organisms, there is a singular feature common to them all which
effectually precludes any possibility of this.       All these animals are
 incapable   of being directly  associated  with  any living oceanic species.
 This fact alone demonstrates conclusively that the halolimnic fauna,
 wherever it came from, must be old.            It has either had time to
modify into its present condition from forms which are already known,
or, what is more probable, it has moro or less adhered to the characters
of the older types from which it sprang.           Delicate organisms, such
as the Medusa, could not have found their way up the effluent as it
now exists : it is barely conceivable that they can have been carried
overland, while it is altogether out of the question to suppose that
either of these processes could account for the presence of the halo
limnic molluscs in the lake, as these are almost exclusively deep water
forms.     The genus Typhobia and the genus Bathanalia are generally
beyond the hundred fathom line.          Limnolrochus and Syrnolopsis are
never found in less than 200 feet, and they occur up to 700 feet.
The morphology of these molluscs is therefore of the first importance
in determining the nature of the halolimnic group, for if the affinities
of these orgauisms have been misinterpreted, and if in reality it can
be shown that they have besn derived from ancient oceanic types,
they must have made their way into Tanganyika from the sea under
widely different conditions from those which now exist; in fact, the

                 Connection   of Lake Tanganyika with           the Sea.        455
proof of their oceanic character will more or less necessitate the idea
thst the Tanganyika region of to-day must have approximated in
character to an arm of the deep and open sea in ancient times.
    During my late expedition         I  was able to obtain sufficient material
for the complete morphological investigation of all the halolimnic
 molluscs, the shells only of which have hitherto been known, as well
as for the two new genera Bathanalia and Bnthoceras represented in
figs. 1 aud 2, and as 1 have worked over in detail a considerable number
of these forms I am now in a position to state definitely what they
really are. In 1857 S. P. Woodward, when describing the shells of
                                               ....
the so-called Lithoglyphus of Tanganyika, which had been obtained
by Speke, observed
                          " the univalve                      so much resembles a
Nerita or Calyptrcea that it would be taken for a sea shell if its
history were not so well authenticated," and similar reflections
were made by other observers when describing the shells more
recently obtained by Captain Hore.
    But possibly owing to the weight then attached to Murchison's
geological speculations respecting the African interior, undoubtedly
to the fact that the Tanganyika jelly-fish was not then known, and
also because the fresh-water habitat of these molluscs was indisput
able, the idea of their marine origin which was thus distinctly
before the minds of older zoologists subsequently became entirely
obscured.        The shell of Typhobia was hesitatingly classed by
 Smith in 1881, and more definitely by Fischer in 1887, with the
Melanidse* as a subsection of that group.                The shells of the Para-
 melanias were regarded as nearly related to the same, while the
really unique so-called Lithoglyphus of Tanganyika was equally
misplaced.        The mere fact of the jelly-fish being, as          I ascertained,
associated with other marine organisms in Tanganyika would throw
 suspicion on these purely conchological                determinations, and the
actual anatomical character of the halolimnic molluscs entirely con
firms this view.        The Typhobias are utterly unlike any Melania the
anatomy of which is known.              These gasteropods in the character of
their radulae and their alimentary canals, in the presence of a crys
talline style and an anterior stomachic ccecuni, in the possession of a
 well-developed postex-ior and anterior syphon, in the form of the
gills and osphradium, in the position of the anal, genital, and renal
apertures, as well as in the gross details of their reproductive
apparatus, most closely approximate to Stromhus and Pteroceras.
The same inference may be gathered from the longi-commissurate
character of the nervous system, while in the absence of arightpallial
anastomosis, as well as in the form of the subintestinal ganglionic

 trunk, the Typhobias undoubtedly approximate to the Solaridse and
  possibly to the Scalarids.       In fact, the structural tout ensemble of the
  Typhobias leaves little room for question that these gasteropods must
 be regarded as forms closely similar to a Pteroceras with a non-
 specialised foot.
     What is true of the Typhobias is also true of the allied genns
 Bathanalia, except that this form is in some respects more primi
 tive, and is certainly less specialised in its shell.                The so-called
 Lithoglyphus zonatus, L. neritinoid.es, and           L.  rufofilosus are seen at
 once, when anatomically        examined, to have been perhaps even more
 completely misplaced than the Typhobias. In the characters of their
 radulae and alimentary canals they approximate                to the Planaxidte,*
 while in the possession of an anterior stomachic coecum and style, they
 show undoubted affinity to some members of the Strombidae.                    In the
 character of their nervous system they are undoubtedly akin to the
 marine     Zygoneurous Cerithia on the one hand and the longi-commis-
 surate Stnithiolariid.ee on the other.          But the most remarkable ana
 tomical feature which these forms possess is the existence in the
 female of an enormous epidermal invagination of the body wall
 beneath the eye (fig. 3), into which the embryos descend from the
 female genital aperture along a deep groove, and                      I   have now
 complete evidence for regarding this groove, which is present in
 both sexes as truly homologous with the similar genital grooves
possessed by the Opisthobranchs.            The affinities of the new genera
 Bythoceras, Paramelania, and Nassopsis, are much more difficult to
 determine, but there is no doubt that in the curious condition of
their nerves and in the general features of their anatomy they are
extremely primitive.         The whole nervous system of these forms, in
the forwardly elongated character of the pedal ganglia and in the
relation and charactei-s of the cerebral and pleural ganglia and their
connectives, actually approximate             to that of a Cyclophorus. In
other respects it resembles that of Triion.
    Lastly, the one entire Limnotrochus which             I  possess seems to be
nearly akin to the Paramelanian group, but the anatomy of this
form will require more fully working out by sections than has yet
been done.

    Thus, although am not yet able to give a complete statement of
the character of all the halolimnic molluscs known, enough anato
mical work has now been done for this preliminary communication
to indicate clearly what will be the entire result of the investigation.
It has been seen that the theory of the marine origin of the
   * It is remarkable that representatives of this family abound in the Indian  Ocean
and on the East African coast, the so-called Lithoglt/phus of Tanganyika affording
one among many instances of similarity between the mollusean fauna of Tanganyika
and that of the Indian Ocean.

 halolimnic fauna of Lake Tanganyika is entirely supported both by
 the    facts of distribution and by those of the morphology                        of the
 individual halolimnic forms.                 Like the medusa, the halolimnic
 gasteropods combine the characters of several modem marine types,
 and so     they cannot by any possibility          be regarded     as the forerunners
 of the modern fresh-water stocks.*                 Consequently, the only way in
 which their existence in Tanganyika               can be accounted for is through
 the supposition that this region was,             as Thomson supposed, at some
 time in open connexion either on the east, west, or north, with a deep
 arm of the sea.
     Such a conception           is, however, in the most uncompromising
conflict with the views respecting the permanence of the African
terrestrial      conditions   which were advanced by Sir Roderic Murchison
in 1852,     t and which have       been more recently and so ably advocated
by    Dr. Gregory in 1896. J Nevertheless, the theory of the marine
   *  It  is certain from their    anatomical characters that some of the halolimnic
molluscs     (the Typhobias)  originate:! from marine ancestors later than Cretaceous
times, for they possess the characters of genera such as Sfrombus and Pteroeeras,

      OBITUARY NOTICES OF FELLOWS DECEASED.
   Benjamin Apthorp Gould was born at Boston, on September 27,
1824      He entered the Boston Latin School in 1836, and graduated
from Harvard College in 1844.         In 1845 Gould visited Europe to
make    himself acquainted     with the instrumental equipments of the
principal Observatories.       With this object he spent about three
months at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich ; four months at the
Paris Observatory ; a year at the Berlin Observatory ; four months
at  Altona; and a month at Gotha. He was thus brought into con
tact  with most of the leading astronomers of the time, and made
many lasting friendships.
    Dr. Gould returned to America in 1848. In 1852 he joined the
s taff of  the Coast Survey, and was employed as " Assistant in
          " on
Charge             many important determinations of longitude.       The
Reports    of   the Superintendent  of  the  United States Coast Survey,
1852 — 66, contain many valuable papers by I)r. Gould on points
connected with longitude determinations.           In 1855 arrangements
were made between           the Trustees    of the Dudley Observatory
and the authorities of the U.S. Coast Survey,              which it was
thought would prove mutually advantageous, and Professors Bache,
Henry, Pierce, and Dr. Gould were appointed members of the
 Scientific Council to superintend the work of the Observatory.        In
 1855, Dr. Gould visited Europe and obtained a new Transit Circle
from Messrs. Pistor and Martins, of Berlin, and some other instru
ments for the Observatory.         A new Heliometer was also ordered
from Air. Spencer, of Canastota, New York, but this instrument was
never completed.       On December 19, 1857, Dr. Gould was appointed
 director of the Dudley Observatory, but his relations with the
 trustees were not satisfactory, and in June, 1859, his connexion
 with the Observatory ceased.       In 1866, Gould took charge of the
 Valencia end of the telegraphic           determination   of the differ
 ence in longitude between that station and Newfoundland;            and
 the Astronomer Royal, Airy, afforded facilities for the connexion
 of Gould's station with Greenwich.          About the same time, Gould
 reduced the observations        made   by D'Agelet, at Paris, 1783 —
 85,  with a Bird quadrant.       The reductions were necessarily differ
 ential, but they afforded positions of about 2907 stars, some of
 which had not been observed by Bradley, and which were valuable
     vol. LXII.                                                  b

                                         ii
    for the determinations   of proper motions.     In 1866 Dr. Gould alio
    became deeply interested in the applications          of photography to
    astronomy.     He   measured   and   deduced  the  right  ascensions and
    declinations of about 50 stars from some photographs of the Pleiades
    taken by Ruthcrfurd, and showed that the results thus obtained
   agreed closely with Bessel's Helioraeter measures. In 1870, on the
   eve of his departure for Cordoba, he again took up this question and
  obtained the relative positions of the stars on Rutherfurd's plates of
   the cluster Praesepe.     Dr. Gould was so encouraged by his success
   that he made arrangements for the regular application of photo
   graphy at the Cordoba Observatory.            This work was, however,
   seriously interfered with by the breaking of his photographic object-
  glass in transit, and secondly, when a new object-glass had been
   secured, by personal difficulties and the pressure of other work ; but
  some valuable results were obtained.
      The establishment of the Observatory at Cordoba, and the work
  executed there by Dr. Gould and his assistants, must be regarded as
  the most important astronomical work of his life. These works in
 clude the ' Uranometria Argentina,' the 'Zone Catalogue,' and the
  '
     Argentine General Catalogue,' for the epoch 1875. The ' Urano
            "        " the
  metria      gives        brightness and position of every fixed star,
 down to the seventh magnitude within 100° of the South Poie,"
 with an atlas consisting of fourteen maps exhibiting on a stereo-
 graphic projection the position of the stars to the seventh magni
 tude.       The magnitudes are based fundamentally on Argelander's
                                '
scale. The ' Uranometria          was published in 1879.     The positions of
the stars in the General         Catalogue are generally fixed by several
observations and are accurate results; this Catalogue was published
in 1886. The volumes of the Zone observations were passed through
the press, after Dr. Gould had left Cordoba, by his successor, and
the last volume appeared only a short time before Dr. Gould's
death.
      The value of the work which Dr. Gould was enabled, by his own
energy and the devotion of his assistants, to carry out whilst resident
in Cordoba has received the fullest recognition of his contemporaries
and has placed him in the first rank of practical astronomers.           But
besides work of this class, Dr.          Gould established,   in 1849, the
'
    Astronomical Journal,' of which he continued the editor till 1861.
when its publication was suspended by the war ; but after his return
from Cordoba this Journal was re-established, and is at present con
tinued by his friends Dr. Chandler and Professors Asaph Hall and
Lewis Boss.
      Dr. Gould married -in 1861, Mary Apthorp Quincy, daughter of
the Hon. Josiah Quincy; Mrs. Gould died in 1883, and to her
                 '
memory the         Zone Catalogue of Stars ' is dedicated. Dr. Gould's

                                            Ill
   death, which     occurred    November        26,   1K)6, followed    an  accidental
   fall down some steps.
                                                                      '
      There is a list of 82 papers by Dr. Gould, in the Catalogue                    of
   Scientific Papers,' published bj the Royal Society.
     Dr. Gould was a Foreign Member of the Royal Society,                             a
   Foreign Member -of the Royal Astronomical Society, a Correspond
  ing Member of the French Academy of Sciences, and a member of
  very many other       learned societies.         In  1883  he  received the Gold
  Medal of the     Royal Astronomical Society.
                                                                           E. J.  S.
     Edward     Ballarp, who died        on the 19th January, 1897, will be
  :dentified   always   with   the   Central     Public Health Authority of this
 country, the scientific repute of which his labours have done so
 much to enhance.         As a sanitarian, however, Ballard's own reputa
 tion was assured ere he joined, in 1871, the Medical Staff of the
  Privy Council Office. At that date he had for sixteen years held
 office as Medical Officer of Health for Islington, exhibiting through
 out abilities, investigatory and administrative, which had served to
 render him conspicuous among the representatives of English sani
 tary knowledge and practice.               In Ballard, Simon, then Medical
 Adviser to the Government,          was not slow to recognise a man of the
 typa essential for his purpose in building up the future Medical
 Department of the State.             It was Simon's business, no doubt, at
 that   juncture, to discover, as inspectors, men capable of developing
 into the Ballards, Buchanans,           and Nctten-Radcliffes of after-days.
 Nevertheless that he did discover these men, and as well secured
 their services, must redound ever to his credit in the annals of
 English sanitary progress.
     Ballard was bom in 1820             at    Islington, a parish with which
 throughout his seventy-six          years of life he remained closely asso
ciated.      Here, at Islington School, he received his early education ;
here he was apprenticed, his " master

                                                      being parochial surgeon and
 workhouse      medical   officer  ; here, for many years, he piactised as a
physician,      both before and after appointment as District Medical
Officer of    Health  ; and here also he resided during the whole of his
twenty years      of Government service.
     At the early age of seventeen, Ballard commenced, as apprentice,
his medical career ; at nineteen he entered the Medical School of
University College.          Here he seems to have at once exhibited an
industry in the' accumulation of facts and an aptitude for exact obser
vation of altogether exceptional order, qualities of mind which then,
as in after life, rendered his work always so entirely trustworthy.
His career at University          College    and at the University of London
was a distinguished one.            He graduated M.B. in 18-13, and M.D. in

                                     iv
1844, winning at each of his several examinations honours in tbc
way of scholarships, exhibitions, and gold medals.      He became, as a
consequence, Medical Tutor to, and later on was elected Fellow of,
University College.
   For ten or a dozen years subsequent to graduation, Ballard        prac
tised as a physician,     though at the same time exercising tutorial
functions and writing    on professional subjects.   At this stage of his
career he joined the Medico-Chirurgical Society, serving the Society
as Referee of Papers, as Councillor, and finally as Vice-President.
But it was not until     1856,   when he accepted the post of Medical
Officer of Health for Islington, that he entered on what proved to be
his life-work.
   In those days the sanitary functions alike of health officer and
of local authority were ill-defined or not defined at all.         BallarJ
had to educate himself, and to educate also his masters, in matters
pertaining to public health ; and this, on his appointment, he at
once proceeded to do, with that singleness of heart and ignoring
of self-advantage which throughout his public life distinguished the
man.    Thus, while inculcating on his authority the broad and general
lines on which thoy should proceed in remedying the sanitary short
comings of their district, Ballard was hour by hour studying iu
infinite detail series on series of facts, local and other, the right
apprehension of which was, as he was very sure, necessary to fit him
as a trustworthy and far-sighted adviser in the interests of the
health of his district.      It was in this way that Ballard made com
mencement at Islington of those studies of his respecting the
influence of various trades on health, and respecting the relation of
" Sickness " to
                  Mortality, which subsequently, when in Government
service, he extended to the whole country, with such credit to him
self and to the Department of State which he served.
   In further illustration of his foresight as to questions of public
                                                              '
health likely to arise in the future, may be cited his essay On Vacci
nation : its Value and alleged Dangers.'      Therein he elaborately dis
cussed, with prescience almost, the very considerations which have
only lately been occupying, for a series of years, the attention of a
Royal Commission     ; and he delivered,   in 1868, practically the same
judgment on the subject as that announced         in 1896 by the Royal
Commission in question.
   Ballard's concern for problems of the future did not,         however,
render him in any degree insensible to the day-by-day            demands
of the present, so far as his district was concerned.              Current
events, in their etiological and in their administrative aspects,
obtained from him always their full share of attention ; as, for
instance, the now historic Islington outbreak of " milk-enteric
fever," in  1870.    At  that date, notwithstanding previous      obscrva

                                          V
 tion by Dr. Michael Taylor, of Penrith, respecting milk-conveyed
 infection, little was with certainty known on the subject, and Ballard
 himself was (as he has told the writer) altogether sceptical as to any
 real relation between the fever and the suspected milk-service.
 Nevertheless, he set to work in his customary fashion to collect all
the facts for and against       causation of the fever outbreak by means of
 milk ; and, as a result,     not  only did he convince himself that in the
 particular instance the suspected milk had actually disseminated the
poison of enteric fever, but also he formulated in this connexion such
an array of circumstantial evidence as to afford to other minds pre-
snmption short only of absolute proof that the particular milk had
had chief concern in the outbreak.            His report on tho subject has
necessarily served as a model to later investigators.
    The limits of space proper for a " notice " such as this forbid any
thing beyond mere attempt at indicating what sort of a man Ballard
was.     The work that he did in afterdays under the Local Govern
ment Board needs not to be set out.           He will be known hereafter, as
has been well said of him by Simou, as one of the chief confirmers
and extenders of the sanitary science of his age ; his researches on
effluvium nuisances, on food-poisoning,              on infantile diarrhoea, on
epidemic pneumonia,        and    on  a  variety   of   matters etiological and
administrative, are duly recorded          in the chronicles of the Medical
Officers of the Privy Council and Local Government Board.                     As
regards    his work,   official  and  post-official,   in later years, it may be
remembered that much of it was done in defiance of increasing
bodily infirmity.     Intellectually, Ballard remained ever young, and
bodily infirmity could not discourage or curb his efforts to master
the unknown.       After retiring from office he continued, as a labour
of love, his researches into the etiology of diarrhceal disease, and he
left, under his will, the data thus accumulated by him to the Medical
Officer of the Local Government Board.             On this snbject he was still
working day by day when attacked by capillary bronchitis, which
proved fatal in the short space of two days.
    Ballard was destitute of personal ambition.            He was content with
his work, and with appreciation of that work by those competent to
judge of it.      He sought neither honours nor emolument.                 From
Government he obtained no honours at all ; and such recognition as
his work brought him from Medicine and from Science was but
tardily bestowed.
                                                                    W. H. P.

                                            vi
time of the birth of li is son Henry was head master of the Grammar
School, Ashby-de-la-Zouch.*
     Green received his early education in his father's grammar school
at Ashby; and the man who'oiiginally inspired him with his life-long
regard for geology was the Rev. W. H. Coleman, one of the masters
in the Ashby School.             Coleman and his pupil were fortunate not
only in living in a district of exceptional geological interest, but
also in the circumstance that a few years previously (18134) Mr.
Mammat, a local geologist, had made the structure of the neigh
bourhood       classic in his         well-known work ' Geological             Facts.'
 Coleman,     who seems to have been not only a scientific enthusiast
but a man of singularly loveable character, died young. His memory
was fondly cherished by his pupil, who always spoke of him in
after years with great personal affection, and dedicated to bis
                                   '
memory his own work on Physical Geology.'
    In the course of a few years Green made himself so familiar
with the structure of the Ashby country that when Professor (after
wards     Sir Andrew) Ramsay paid            a  visit for the purpose of examin
ing the district on behalf of the National Geological Survey, he
was at once referred to Green as the acknowledged local authority on
 the subject.      Ramsay soon convinced himself of the young man's
 remarkable scientific abilities ; and, always on the look out for
 exceptional geological talent, suggested that if he desired to devote
 his life to geological work he should become a candidate for a post
 upon the National Survey.
     From Ashby School, Green proceeded to Caius College, Cambridge.
 In 1855 he was placed sixth among the W ranglers in the Mathema
 tical Tripos, and was elected a Fellow of his College in the same
 year.     During his tenure of his Fellowship he took pupils in mathe
 matics     at his   own     College, and afterwards          held  masterships      in
 mnthematics at two private schools.
     But. although mathematics had gained for him his high position
 in the University, and the teaching of mathematics had a special
  charm for him, yet the science of geology had obtained too strong
 a hold upon his mind and his sympathies to be relinquished.                       The
  love of the science which had been awakened in his early life by
  Coleman, and his own keen interest and pleasure in the pursuit of
  personal geological investigation had both become intensified and
  fixed at Cambridge by the eloquent teachings of Sedgwick ; and in
  18G1 Green applied for, and was appointed to, a post on the Geolo
  gical Survey of England              and    Wales.     His connexion       with the

  llr. W. W. WatU,    51. A., anil others, for information and kindly assistance in the
  preparation of this memoir.

                                      vn
Survey lasted from       1801   to  1874.   He   ranked    as   an  Assistant
geologist from 1861 to 1807, and as a geologist to the close of bis
Survey career.
    Daring the time of his connexion with the Survey, he waB
engaged first in mapping the Jurassic rocks in the Midlands, and
afterwards in surveying the Carboniferous           rocks in Derbyshire,
Yorkshire, and iiw bordering counties.         The broader results of his
field work became embodied in a large number of published maps of
the Geological Survey, some upon the 1-inch and some upon tho
6-inch scale.       But several detailed survey memoirs, descriptive of
the country surveyed by himself and his colleagues, were written
wholly or in part by him. Among these may be mentioned " The
                            " (1864), "
Geology of Banbury                        Geological Description of the
Country round Stockport" (1800), "Tadcaster" (1869), "Dews-
                              "
bury (1871), " Barnsley
       "
                                 (1878), and
                                             " Wakefield "
                                                              (1879).
    A memoir on the geology of North Derbyshire, of which the first
edition was issued in 1809 and the socond in 1887, was also written
chiefly by Mr. Green.        But his most important survey publication
 was his     "  Geology of the Yorkshire Coalfields," issued in 1878.
 This work is one of the largest, and from an economic point of view,
 certainly the most important memoir of a single coalfield yet pub
 lished by the Geological Survey of England and Wales. It gives an
 exhaustive account of the structure and economic anpects of all
 those parts of the great Yorkshire coalfield which lie around tho
 chief manufacturing centres of that county.             It is a complete
 record of the detailed work laboriously accomplished by Mr. Green
 and his colleagues on the Survey, and it contains one of the best
  descriptions of the British coal measures in the language.
     From this time forward Mr. Green became naturally regarded as
  one of the leading British authorities upon all geological matters
  connected with coal and coal mining, and the relationship of geolo
  gical structure to economics in general.
     In 1870 he resigned his post on the Survey, having been appointed
  Professor in Geology in the newly founded Yorkshire College at
  Leeds.    Students of geology, however, were few in number, and
  funds were not superabundant; but Green's energy and abilities
  found ample scope, for, in addition to holding the geological chair,
  he was appointed to the Professorship of Mathematics in the same
  College, and he acted also as lecturer upon the subject of Physical
  Geography.
     Professor Green's connexion with the Yorkshire College ceased in
  1888, when,     upon the resignation of Professor Prestwich, he was
  appointed    to the Chair of Geology in the University of Oxford. He
  threw himself with his characteristic energy heartily into his new
  work, giving not only the ordinary courses of lectures and laboratory

                                     vm
 instruction, but holding special excursion clnsses and delivering
 occasional courses of lectures to extra- University students.
     Early in 1895 he suffered from a severe attack of influenza. From
 this he never seems to have fully recovered, and in his enfeebled
 state the ceaseless strain of work and responsibility soon began to
 tell severely upon his general health. Early in August, 1896, he
 had a paralytic stroke.      This affected his right side and contined
 him to bed ; but he wrote to his friends cheerfully, through an
 amanuensis, that he was making good progress, and hoped before
 many weeks were over to be at work again.           But these hopes were,
 alas, illusive, and a second attack on August 19 proved fatal.
     Professor Green was MA. of both Cambridge and Oxford, and a
 Fellow and Vice-President of the Geological Society of London. In
 1886 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, on the Council of
 which he served in 1894 and 1895.         In 1890 he filled the office of
 President of Section C (Geology) at the meeting of the British
 Association at Leeds. He was Examiner in Geology to the Univer
 sities of Durham nnd Cambridge, Examiner for the Home and Indian
 Civil Services, Assistant Examiner in Physiography to the Science
 and Art Department, and, at the time of his death, one of the Exami
 ners in Geology for the University of London.
     Professor   Green contributed    occasional original papers to the
 Geological Society and to various scientific         magazines.    Among
 these may be mentioned his papers on the
                                                 " Carboniferous Rocks of
 the North of England" and on "Sub-aerial Denudation," "The
                         " and " The
 Geology of Donegal                    Geology of the JIalvern Hills."
 But his publications in this department of geology, when compared
with those of many of his geological contemporaries, are relaiively
few and insignificant. On the practical side of the science, however,
 there were not many who accomplished so much or whose reputation,
was so widespread or so well deserved.         His life-long acquaintance*
with the details of geological    structure, his clear head and his sound
judgment, rendered his advice on matters of engineering geology of
great value ; and, as a consequence, his services wero being continu
ally called into requisition in economic undertakings, especially
those in reference to coal mining and to water supply. He was
engaged in many of the most important operations of this nature
carried out in Britain during the last thirty years.        He also visited
parts    of South   Africa in the  pursuit  of his  practical work, and in
this way he was able to obtain a considerable insight into its little-
known geology.       The paper in which he brought his African results
before the Geological Society is one of the most important contribu
tions yot madj to the subject.
    Professor Green wrote papers upon the Yorkshire          coal measures
in a volume of ' Essays upon Scientific Subjects,'           issued by the

                                     ix
 Professors     of the Yorkshire College, and he published a popular
 little work upon the ' Birth and Growth of Worlds.'       But the book
 by which Green was most widely known among geologists and lovers
                        '
 of geology was his       Manual of Physical Geology for Students and
 General Readers,' the first edition of which was published in 1876,
and which attained to a third edition in 1883.          This manual is
admittedly      the best English work in this branch of the science. It
is  remarkably typical of its author, thoroughly practical and almost
painfully conscientious ; it is lucid and modest, hut at the same time
original and bold ; and it has done more, perhaps, than any other
work to foster a wide appreciation of physical geology.           In this
work we see Green at his best. His deep love for his science and its
students is evident in every chapter.     His delight in the beauties of
literature and in good literary style gives a peculiar charm to the
 book as a whole ; and the mathematical bent of bis mind is evident
in the crystallographic part of the work and in his original methods
of representing outcrops of strata and the like, methods which have
subsequently proved of especial utility in the advance of geological
science.
    Professor Green's geological teaching in his lectures, though
not     perhaps calculated to move to enthusiasm, was exact and
thorough.       His lectures were usually illustrated by careful experi
ments, and were directed less to the presentation of geological facts
and accepted theories than to the inculcation of the true scientific
method of research and habit of reasoning.           But as an original
worker in and as a teacher of practical field geology Green had few
equals. His own life training, his special artistic abilities, and his
love of detail all conspired to this end; and there can be no question
that it is to his labours and teaching that British stratigraphical
geology owes much of its present influence.
    In the death of Professor Green not only has Oxford University
lost a most distinguished member of its professorate, but geology
has lost a steady and fruitful worker, one who loved the science
entirely for its own sake, and whose life was spent in quietly labour
ing for its advancement.       His wide knowledge of literature and of
general science, and his deep and unbiassed appreciation of all modes
of their progress, made him a most pleasant companion ; while his
calm judgment and his cautious habit of mind rendered him an
invaluable colleague.      Always frank and fearless in the expression
of an opinion at which he himself had arrived, he was, nevertheless,
so hearty, so genial, and so unselfish that his loss will be most
keenly felt, not only by all his fellow workers in the science, but by
a still wider circle of loving friends.

     Edward James Stone was born in London on the 28th February,
  1831.    As a child his constitution was delicate, so that soon after
  entering the City of London School his health broke down, and he
  was sent to the country for several years, where he was educated at
  a private school until ready to enter King's College, London.
     Although his higher education only began at the age of 20, he
  took a scholarship at Queens' College, Cambridge, in 1856, whence
  he graduated        as Fifth Wrangler in 1859, and was immediately
 elected to a Fellowship.        The following year he was selected for the
  important position of Chief Assistant at the Royal Observatory.
  Greenwich, his predecessor in that post, the Rev. R. Main, having
 been appointed Radcliffe Observer at Oxford.
     With what diligence he applied himself to the duties of his office
 and how wide a view he took of his responsibilities, is made evident
  by the series of important papers which he soon afterwards began to
 communicate to the Royal Astronomical Society.
     His work was obviously congenial, he had a marked inborn
 capacity for dealing with large masses of figures, a high estimate of
 the practical importance of the work on which he was engaged,
 sound mathematical          training, and an almost impatient desire to
 derive from the long series of Greenwich observations results which
 would be of immediate value to science.
     It is not difficult to trace the origin of the line of research which
 Stone subsequently followed with such zeal and pertinacity.             Fresh
 from study of the lunar and planetary theories, so far as these
 subjects were treated in his Cambridge curriculnm, the attention of
 the young astronomer was early arrested by the interesting problems
 which were then opening up in consequence of the researches of
 Hansen and Le Verrier.
     We have a statement of the motif of Stone's first work in the
introductory paragraphs of his first astronomical paper,* " Deter
mination of the Solar Parallax from N.P.D. Observations of Mars at
 Greenwich and Williamstown."
    " In his tables of Mars, published in the 'Annals of the Imperial Observa
tory,' Paris, 1861, M. Le Verrier remarks that it is impossible to reconcile
the observations of Mars with theory without attributing to the perihelion a
motion greater than any which can be obtained except by a sensible increase
of the received planetary masses ; that the necessary agreement between
theory and observation could be obtained by increasing the received value of
the mass of the earth in proportion to the sun's mass by not less than a tenth
part, but that such an increase in the received value of the earth's mass
would necessitate a corresponding increase in the received value of the
sun's mean equatorial horizontal parallax of a thirtieth part.
    " M. Le Verrier deduced the same result from a discussion of the latitudes
                 *  '
                      Monthly Notices R.A.S.,' vol. 23, 1863, p. 183.

                                           xi
and motion of the node of Venus.           The difficulties raised in the theory of
Mercury,    although not removed,        were   slightly diminished by the same
increase of the earth's mass.
   " In his   solar tables, M. Le Vender has adopted the value 8-95" for the
mean equatorial horizontal solar parallax, this value was obtained by deter
mining from observation the coefficient of the lunar equation, and assuming
the mean lunar parallax and data furnished by the theories of precession and
nutation.
   " The way in which M. Le Verrier has thus evolved from the theories of
Venus, the Earth, and Mars, the necessity of the value of the mean solar
parallax much greater than the usually received value 8-57", and not differing
trreatly from 8'95", must render it extremely probable that the true value of
the sun's mean parallax does not differ greatly from that quantity."
   Stone then proceeds to discuss the Greenwich and Williamstown
observations,     and derives a value of 8'932" for the solar parallax.
   In the ' Monthly Notices ' for May, 1863, Stone remarks that in
the lnuar      theories    of  Plana, Pontecoulant,       and    Lubbock the    co
efficient   of   the parallactic inequality deduced with the usually
received values of the involved constants amounts to 122'1", which,
if we increase the valne of the mean solar parallax by a thirtieth
part, becomes 126'2", coinciding closely with the observed values as
derived by Airy, viz.: — 124'7" from meridian and 125"5'' from altazi
muth observations.          He suggests that it would be a point of interest
to determine whether Hansen's lunar theory would bear any con
siderable increase in the mean solar parallax.
   Stone had apparently overlooked a letter of Hansen's,* in which
the  writer says : —
   " The coefficient of the
                              parallactic equation  I found  to be
                                       125-705",
" an amount
                exceeding any which has hitherto been assigned, and which
indicates a greater value of the sun's parallax than has been deduced from
the observations of the transit of Venus. The Greenwich observations,
exclusive of any others, assign the foregoing value of the parallactic in
equality,  and the Dorpat observations         nearly the same value.     I cannot,
therefore, alter it."
                                              '
   In the following number of the               Monthly Notices, 't Hansen, in
reply to Stone, refers to the above quoted paragraph, and in the
 same periodical for November, 1863, gives with more detail, as the
result of his researches, the value 8-9159" for the mean solar

from his discussion of the Transits of Venus of 1761 and 1769, viz. : —

   Winnecke, who proposed the practical programme for the observa
tions of Mars in 1862, discussed the thirteen corresponding observa
tions made at Pulkowa and the Cape,* and found for the solar
parallax
                                         8-964".
This, together with Stone's result already quoted, seemed to prove,
from the practical as well as from the theoretical side, that the then
accepted value of this fundamental        constant of astronomy was
probably at least one thirtieth part of its amount in error.
   The question of the exact redetermination of the solar parallax
became at once one of supreme interest, and, as Airy put         " the         it,
noblest problem in astronomy."
   Stone threw himself into its discussion with his characteristic
vigour. In the 'Memoirs of the R.A.S.'t he discusses afresh the
meridian observations of Mars made at Greenwich in 1862, com
bining them with those made at Williamstown and the Cape of Good
Hope, and derives for the solar parallax
                                         8945".
  In May,    1865,      he communicated              to the   R.A.S. an important
memoir on the " Constant of Lunar Parallax," in which he derived
the value of that constant, as defined by Adams, from a series of
observations of the moon made at the Cape Transit Circle in the
years 1856-61, combined with corresponding observations made at
Greenwich. Up to the present time Stone's result           accepted by   is
astronomers as the most reliable direct determination of this impor
tant constant.
   In the Monthly Notices for April, 1867, Stone calls attention to
        '                         '
a slight numerical error in the computation of the value of the mass
of the moon which was employed by Le Verrier in his derivation of
the solar parallax from the known relations between the parallaxes
of the sun and moon, the mass of the moon, and the lunar equation.                   J
With this revised value of the moon's mass (computed from Le
Verriei-'s adopted values of the constants of precession and nutation)
and with the value of the lunar equation (6'50") derived by Le
Verrier from his discussion of the existing meridian observations of
 the sun, Stone derives for the solar parallax the value

   Following the same general line of research, Stone then under
takes a direct determination of the constant of nutation based on
Greenwich N.P.D. observations of Polaris, 51 H Cephei, and S Ursaj
Minoris, and the R.A. observations of Polaris made with the transit
circle 1851-65.     The preliminary results of this work are published
in the ' Monthly Notices,' vol. 28, 1868, p. 229, and vol. 29, 1869,
p.  28.    The complete discussion appears in the ' Memoirs of the
R.A.S.,' vol. 37 ; the resulting value of the constant of nutation is
                                    9134".
   In the concluding portion of this memoir, Stone draws attention
to the   strong evidence which his discussion gives of a periodic
change of latitude, a subject which, had he followed it up, might
have led to an earlier discovery of Chandler's now well-known law
of  variation of latitude, but his thoughts were otherwise occupied.
                                                                     '
   In the supplementary     number of the ' Monthly Notices for 1868,
Stone communicated to the Royal Astronomical Society his " Re-
discussion of the Observations of the Transit of Venus of 1769," in
which, after reverting to the above-quoted evidence in favour of an
increase in the accepted value of the solar parallax, he proceeds to
rediscuss the observations made at five stations where iuternal con
tacts of Venus with the sun's limb were observed both at ingress
and egress by ten observers.         An independent interpretation was
put upon the language employed by each observer to describe the
phenomena which he noted at different instants of time, and the
assumption was made that such phenomena could be divided into
two distinct classes — viz., true and apparent contacts — separated by
a definite interval of time.      This interval (assumed to be constant
for all observers) was introduced in symbolical form into all the
equations.    The solution of the equations so formed led to the
value
                                     8-91"
for the solar parallax, with the estimated probable error

    This is not the place in which to enter upon a detailed criticism of
the above discussion; nor, with the information now at our disposal
from the subsequent Transits of Venus of 1874 and 1882 and other
more recent sources, would      it be   fair to do so.      Although it is now
certain that the above value of the solar parallax is about one per
cent, too great, and that the representation              of the observations
conveys    an  impression  of  accuracy      which   is far  greater than that
obtainable in such observations, it is but justice to Stone's memory
to quote the opinion held at the time by astronomers of his own
country in regard to this work.            In February, 1869, on presenting
the gold medal of the Royal Astronomical Society to Mr. Stone for
his " Rediscussion of the Observations of the Transit of Venus in
1769 and his other contributions to Astronomy," the President,
Admiral Manners, said : —
    "
      By this important investigation, Mr. Stone has earned for him
 self the gratitude of astronomers of all countries.              He has shown,
 beyond all doubt, that the method pursued by his illustrious
 countryman Halley,' when fairly treated, is capable of furnishing a
 value of the solar parallax commensurate in precision with the
expectations formed of it.
    " But this is not all.        Mr. Stone, by his researches in this
 instance, has wiped from astronomy a reproach, which did not
 indeed legitimately attach to it, but which only one of those intel
 lectual triumphs which from time to time have adorned the annals
 of our science was capable of extirpating."
    In order to illustrate the sequence of Stone's researches, we have
 thus far recorded only such of them as bear upon the determination
 of the solar parallax and its allied constants.          We must now return
 to other works which he carried out during the period that he was
  chief assistant at Greenwich.            Amongst the most important of
 these was the large share which he took, under Airy's direction, in
  the preparation of the Greenwich seven-year catalogue of 2022 stars
  for the equinox 1860.

                                          XV
    Throughout his whole life, one of Stone's most characteristic
 qualities was his high sense of responsibility and strict regard to
 official duty. However absorbing may have been the independent
 researches in which he was engaged, his official duties were at all
 times his first consideration.         These occupied not only his official
 hours at the Observatory, but he gave to them and to strictly allied
 work much of the labour of his private time.
     In the Greenwich catalogue for 1850, Airy employed the very
 unsatisfactory proper motions of the British Association Catalogue
 of Stars.     For the formation of the 1860 catalogue the proper
 motions determined by Main* were available.                       Recognising the
 importance of   Main's   work,   Stone continued       it,   and,  in the ' Memoirs
 of the R.A.S.,' 1864, vol. 33, gave, for 460 stars of the seven-year
catalogue, proper motions computed by reducing Bradley's observa
tions (as derived in Bessel's Fundamenta) to the equinox of 1860,
and comparing the results with the corresponding places of the 1860
catalogue.
    A further proof of his deep interest in his official duties is given
in his paper " On the Accuracy of the Fundamental Right Ascen
sions of the Greenwich Seven-year Catalogue for 1860," published
in vol. 34 of the 'Memoirs of the R.A.S.,' where he specially dis
cusses the accuracy of the fundamental right ascensions of 7 Pegasi,
/3 Geminorum, a Virginis, and a Aquilee.
    In November, 1867, Stone communicated to the Royal Astronomi
cal Society a paper " On Bessel's Mean Refractions," in which he
showed that the tabular refractions of Bessel's Fundamenta were
too great, and reqnired to be diminished by one five-hundredth part,
in order to represent the Greenwich observations of circumpolar
stars made in the years 1857-65.               This important conclusion has
since been f ally corroborated at the Washburn Observatory, in the
 United States, by Comstock in his determination of the constant of
 aberration, and also by a discussion of the Cape and Greenwich
 observations.f    Nyren's discussion of the Pulkowa refractions also
 points to the same conclusion.
    Besides the already mentioned important papers connected with
 well-marked lines of continuous research, we find no less than
 twenty notes of a more miscellaneous character, communicated by
 Stone to the Royal Astronomical Society.               These papers testify to
 the wide interest which he took in all contemporary                     astronomical
 research during the ten years he remained Chief Assistant at Green
 wich.
    In the early part of     1870 Sir Thomas Maclear resigned his post
 as  Her Majesty's Astronomer at the Cape, and in June of the same
                 • ' Memoirs  R.A.S.,'  yoU. 19 and 28.

                                          XVI
year    Stone   was     appointed his successor.        The thirty-six years of
Maclear's directorate had been fruitful             in  many ways.    An arc of
meridian had been measured, a splendid series of extra-meridian
observations secured, and the greater part of all this work had been
reduced and published.         Maclear's inborn tastes had drawn him from
a  lucrative profession and forced him to become an astronomer.              He
was by nature of an enthusiastic disposition and an ardent observer.
The clear skies at the Cape offered him ample opportunity to accu
mulate observations, but he was never provided with a staff sufficient
to overtake arrears of reduction.          He had therefore to choose between
limiting the number of observations or leaving many of them unre
duced and unpublished whilst he secured as many more as he could.
He chose the latter alternative, and thus of the long series of meri
dian observations made during the thirty-six years of his directorate
nothing had been published except the meridian observations of 1834
and such star places as were required for comet comparison stars,
moon culminators,        &c.
    Stone had for a long time recognised the special importance of
forming an accurate and extensive catalogue of southern stars, and
bad even endeavoured to persuade Airy to extend the range of mag
nitude of stars observed at Greenwich, and to construct a catalogue
of northern stars complete to some such order of magnitude as the
7th. In his introduction to the ' Cape Observations of 1871, 1872,
                Stone states : " The chief inducement which led me
             '
and 1873
to accept the appointment was the opportunity which the position
afforded for the formation of a general catalogue of southern stars
to about the 7th magnitude." It was therefore with enthusiasm
and high resolve to construct such a catalogue that Stone betook him
self to the Cape. But his official instructions were imperative on
one point, viz., that he was to render the large number of meridian
observations accumulated by Maclear available for the use of astro
nomers with as little delay as possible.
    Such an instruction was one which would have discouraged most
men.
    "I  found  myself," says Stone,* "with a very limited staff, unexpectedly
confronted    with the result of thirty-six years of miscellaneous observing in
all states of reduction, nothing completed, and nothing which could be
brought forward for publication and use without a very considerable
expenditure of time and skilled labour.         I fear the course pursued of con
tinuous miscellaneous observing without reduction has not tended to the
advancement      of accurate astronomy       to any extent proportional to the
labour expended upon the work, and still required to be expended upon
it, before the results can be rendered useful. Such observing is rarely
conducted in a way to facilitate the subsequent reductions or to economise

labour in observing.      This will be apparent to anyone who will count the
number of observations of stars between 67° and 117° north polar distance,
 and consider that a catalogue formed from the results of other years would
.contain observations of these stars to very nearly the same relative extent.
Of the large number of observations accumulated here from 1832 to 1855 with
the transit instrument and mural circles, the places of the southern stars, out
of reach of northern observatories, will, when reduced, still be of value for
proper motions, but the immense number of observations of well-known
stars made here with the old instruments can now, I fear, never repay
the labour required for their reduction                     I have made these
remarks, not only in justice to the present staff, and to explain the work
 upon which they have been employed, but because it was these considera
tions which led me to pass over the earlier observations, and to commence
 the systematic reductions with the year 1856, when the transit circle was
 first brought into regular use.     I felt that these reductions could not be
 any longer delayed without the value of the results being greatly diminished.
 I had, and still have, hopes that the data collected in the present cata
 logue for corresponding observations at the northern observatories would
 be found sufficient to meet the actual requirements      of astronomers so far
 as these requirements    can be met by the material collected here, and that
 I might be relieved from the laborious and somewhat useless task of com
 pleting the reductions of the earlier observations of stars whose positions
 have been fixed already with an accuracy greater than could be expected to
 be attained in the observations made with the, comparatively          speaking,
 inferior instruments in use at this observatory before the introduction of the
 transit circle."
     We dwell somewhat on this point becanse inquiry has shown that
 these words convey precisely Stone's freqnently expressed views, and
 we can thus more fully admire the high sense of duty which
  prompted the self-sacrifice       and devotion with which he applied
  himself to the subsequent execution of an uncongenial but honour
  able task.
     The meridian results for the year 1856 were published by Stone in
  1871,  for the years 1857 and 1858 in 1872, and those for 1859 and
  1860   in 1874.   The general catalogue of      1159 stars, derived from all
  these observations    and reduced to the equinox of 1860, was pnblished
  in the year 1873.
     In the interval of his regular labours Stone next devoted his
  attention to the examination and publication of the results of obser
  vations made with the transit instrument and mural circle in the
  years 1834 to 1840.       Maclear had already reduced the whole of
  these   observations,   and Stone    accepted these results generally as
  satisfactory, but he redetermined the azimuthal errors and re-rednced
  the observations of the close circumpolar stars.        The work of exami
  nation occupied Stone from time to time as opportunity offered, and
  "
    much progress     was made in       it during the comparative leisure
  enjoyed   during my     visit to England in 1875."        The results were

                                  xviii
                                                           '
finally published by Stone in    1878,  in the form of the   Cape Cata
logue of 2892 stars reduced to the equinox 1840.'
   But Stone did not allow these labours to interfere with his main
object.   Within a month of his arrival at the Cape a working list
of stars witliin 5° of the South Pole had been prepared, and obser
vations with the transit circle were commenced.     The work was pro
secuted with systematic vigour notwithstanding the loss of two
assistants — Mr. Sinfield, who died in September, 1871, and Mr. Mann,
his chief assistant, who, after a year's illness, died in April, 1873.
Although there was considerable delay in replacing these valued
assistants, Stone was able to publish in 1876 the annual results of
the Cape observations for 1871, 1872, and 1873, containing accurate
places of all Lacaille's stars within 15° of the South Pole, and of
nearly all the stars to the 7th magnitude within the same zone.
At the same time he was able to announce that the similar stars
within 35° of the South Pole had already, in December, 1875, been
observed, and arrangements made for the observation of the next
zone, 135° to 145° N.P.D., in the year 1876 ; that in the year 1877
the work, if persevered with, should overlap that of some of the
northern observatories, and with the zone 115° to 125° N.P.D., it
might perhaps be brought to a close in 1878.      This programme was
fulfilled to the letter, and the observations of the zones were com
 pleted in the end of 1878.
    Meanwhile a large stereographic projection of the southern hemi
sphere had been prepared, and upon it were projected the places of
all the stars which had already been observed, and wherever lacuna
 appeared within the limits of N.P.D. 115° to 180°, efforts were made
 during the first four months of 1879 to fill them up by observ
 ing stars of rather a lower magnitude than the 7tb of Lacaille's
 scale. During the same period also such control observations as
 seemed necessary were taken, and the whole work of observation
 was completed.
    The reductions had been rigorously kept up to date, and before the
 end of May, 1879, the whole of the star places had been reduced to
 the equinox of 1880, the means taken and the precessions and secular
 variations computed.
    The Rev. Robert Main, Radcliffe Observer at Oxford, died on the
 9th of May, 1878.     Stone, having nearly fulfilled the object for
 which he came to the Cape, became a candidate for the post, and
 was soon afterwards elected to it. The Radcliffe Trustees yielded
 to the request that Stone might be allowed a year to complete his
 work at the Cape, and the Rev. Charles Pritchard, then Savilian
 Professor of Astronomy at Oxford, was appointed interim director.
 On the 27th May, 1879, Stone sailed from the Cape, taking with him
 all the documents necessary for the preparation of his great southern
 catalogue for press.

                                      xix
    At Oxford,    Stone applied himself to this work with such energy,
that in 1881 the Cape Catalogue of 12,441 stars for the equinox
1880 was passed through the press, and its publication was welcomed
by astronomers as one of the most important contributions ever made
to sidereal astronomy.
    His personal welcome amongst his colleagues was no         less cordial.
He was at once elected a Vice-President of the Royal Astronomical
Society, and, on the vacation of the presidency by Mr. Hind, Stone
was elected to the chair.
    We must now briefly review Stone's other labours during his stay
at the Cape.     In  1871 he  published an experimental determination     of
the velocity of sound, based on chronographic determinations of the
interval which elapsed between the flash of the Cape Town time gun
and the instant when the noise of the report reached the Cape
Observatory.       Various papers on the theory of probabilities, including
a  criterion for the rejection of discordant observations, also appear
from Stone's hand during this period, and there are sundry papers
in the ' Monthly Notices ' on proper motions of stars, observations of
comets and variable stars, &c, which testify to his continued interest
in 'general astronomy,        notwithstanding his preoccupation in the
great   work of his catalogue.
   In 1874 he undertook an expedition to Klipfonteiu, in Namaqualand,
and successfully observed the solar eclipse there on the 16th April of
that year.      He employed a slit spectroscope, with two dense flint
prisms of 60°, and was successful in observing the reversal of the
Frannhofcr lines at the instant of disappearance of the sun's limb.
On the same expedition he made a valuable series of magnetic
observations in Namaqualand,         the first series of its kind secured
in that region.
    In 1877 (Appendix to the Cape Observations for 1874) he pub
lished a set of star constant tables for computing the apparent
places of stars from their mean places, or vice versa.        These tables
have been largely used, first at the Cape, and subsequently at Green
wich and other observatories.
    When the ' Parliamentary Report on the Telescopic Observations
of the Transit of Venus made in the expeditions of the British
               '
Government       reached the Cape, Stone immediately recast the phases,
recomputed      the  results, and by return mail communicated to the
Rojal Astronomical Society* the results of his rediscussion, which
gave, instead of the official result (8-76"), the value
                                     8-89"
for   the solar parallax.     He followed up this communication by a
further paper published in the next number of the 'Monthly Notices,'
                                 • March, 1878.

                                    XX
in which he included a discussion of the Cape observations, and
arrived at a very similar conclusion.
   At Oxford, Stone had barely finished the work connected with bis
great catalogue when he was nominated secretary of a committee of
the Royal Society, to advise the Treasury and Admiralty with
respect to the steps which should be taken for observation of the
Transit of Venus, in 1882. An executive committee was appointed
by Government, in 1881, and, at the request of this committee, Stone
undertook the duties of " Directing Astronomer in connexion with
the arrangements for the observations of the Transit of Venus, and
with the subsequent deduction of the resnlts."            The Radcliffe
Observatory   was  converted   into a training school for the observers,
and Stone devoted himself, heart and soul, to the organization of the
various expeditions.    The thoroughness with which he did this work,
and the great labour which he gave to it, are only fully known to
those who were connected with the expeditions.           Stone's . report,
which is attached to that of the executive committee and published
in a Parliamentary Blue Book, was issued in 1887.             It gives a
detailed precis cf all the observations, and derives from the obser
vations of various classes of contact different values of the solar
parallax.
    From the ' Report of the Council of the Royal Astronomical Socieiy
for February, 1888,' the adopted value of the solar parallax from
 Stone's discussion of the British Transit of Venus observations,
appears to be
                             8-832" + 0-024".
    In 1883, Stone communicated to the Royal Society a paper
entitled " The principal Cause of the large Errors at present existing
between the positions of the Moon, deduced from Hansen's Tables
and Observation, and the Cause of an apparent Increase in the
secular acceleration in the Moon's Mean Motion required by Hansen's
Tables, or of an apparent Change in the time of the Earth's Rota
tion."
    This was soon followed by a communication to the Royal Astro
nomical Society of a paper entitled " On the Change of the Length
of the Tabalar Mean Solar Day which takes place with every Change
in the adopted value of the Sun's Mean Sidereal Motion."
    Stone's contention was that by the adoption of Le Vender's Tables
                                            '
 of the Sun in the ' Nautical Almanac of 1864, and in subsequent
editions of the same work, for the computation of the snn's longitude
and the sidereal time at mean noon, instead of Carlini's tables, pre
 viously employed for this purpose, a per saltum change was made in
 the unit of time used by astronomers, the original and cumulative
 effect of which, from 1864, was to change by twenty-seven seconds

                                       xxi
the   absolute  instant of any nominal mean time computed in the
beginning of 1883, and that this error accnmnlates at the rate of
1"48* per annum.        It was in vain that Airy, Adams, and Cayley
endeavoured privately to convince Stone of the error of this con
clusion, and to show him that the effect of the change in question
was l/365th part of what he claimed it to be. Adams then pub
lished a paper,* which explains the whole point at issue in the
clearest and simplest manner, viz., that mean solar time is measured,
not by the sun's mean motion in longitude (as Stone's theory sup
poses), but by the motion of the mean sun in hour angle, which is
about 365 times greater in amount.         Cayley, Gaillot, and afterwards
Newcomb, published notes and questions intended to put the matter
in a way that should convince Stone of his error. But no arguments
or illustrations were of avail, and, during the last ten years of his
life, almost the whole of his time which was not occupied by pressing
official duty was employed in devising fresh methods of presenting
his theory for discussion, or in comparing the places of the moon, as
observed at Oxford, with Hansen's tables both corrected and uncor
rected for the term cZS given by Stone's theory.             By a very remark
able coincidence the present errors of Hansen's Tables of the Moon
agree within very narrow limits with the corrections dS, and it must
have been this circumstance which completely blinded Stone's eyes
to the true state of the case. What Stone's theory does not explain
is the simple fact that if no change had been made in the ' Nautical
            '
Almanac in 1864, or, what is the same thing, if the mean solar
times derived from Carlini's (or Bessel's) tables had been used to
convert the sidereal times of observed transits of the moon at Oxford
into Greenwich mean time, and if the mean times so computed had
been used as arguments to derive the tabular place of the moon from
Hansen's tables, it would be found that the errors of Hansen's tables
in right ascension would have differed but a few hundredths of a
second of time from what they would have been if computed from
the data of the present ' Nautical Almauac.'
    On taking up residence at Oxford, Stone found that the staff con
sisted of but one assistant, whose time was chiefly occupied in making
and reducing the regular meteorological observations and observing
stars for clock error.      Two assistants were added to the staff, a
systematic     examination   of the transit circle was instituted, and
regular meridian observing was begun in 1880.                 Plans were made
for the construction of a catalogue of all stars to the 7th magnitude
from N.P.D. 115° (the northern limit of his Cape zones) to the
equator. Observations were secured at a rate varying from about
2000 to 3500 per annum from 1881 to 1893, these were regularly
reduced and published in annual volumes, and in 1893 meridian
                    * '
                        Monthly Notices E.A.S.,' vol. 44, p. 43.

  observing, except of the sun and moon and occasional stars, seems
  to have been suspended during the completion of the ' Radcliffe
  Catalogue' for 1890.           This catalogue contains places (based gene
  rally on a minimum of three observations of each star, and many more
  of clock-stars and others) of all stars to the 7th magnitude between
 N.P.D.     115° and        the equator;       and, wherever gaps occur in
 the distribution of 7th magnitude stars, such gaps have been filled
 up by the observations of stars of a fainter order of magnitude.
  The sun and moon were also regularly observed on the meridian, and
  a considerable number of occultations, comets and double stars were
 observed with the extra-meridian instruments.
     In 1886 an excellent equatorial by T. Cooke and Sons, with an
 object glass of 10 inches aperture, was presented to the Radcliffe
 Observatory by Mr. J. Gurney Barclay, and with the aid of this fine
 instrument the value of the extra-meridian work was greatly
 enhanced.
     In 1888 Stone co-operated with Tale, Leipzig, and the Cape in the
 heliometer observations of the minor planet Iris for solar parallax,
 and his staff contributed meridian observations of the planet and
 comparison stars.          In 1889 meridian observations of Victoria and
 Sappho    and   of  their   comparison stars were also made under Stone's
 direction in connexion            with the solar parallax campaign     of that
 year.
    In  addition    to all this astronomical work meteorological observa
tions    were systematically recorded, reduced and published.             Stone
then planned      the  observation of similar meridian      observations  of all
stars to the 7th magnitude in successive zones northwards from the
equator, and the work was actually begun before his death.
     Stone's reductions of Hornsby's observations of 7 Draconis made
at the Radcliffe Observatory 1788-91 have been published in the
                         '
'
   Monthly Notices for June, 1895, and show of what admirable
quality these zenith sector observations are. Hornsby's observations,
made with two brass quadrants of 8 feet radins and a transit instru
ment of 4 inches aperture, next attracted Stone's attention, and
before his death he had made considerable progress in reduction of
the observations       of    1774.    Stone considers that these observations,
extending     as they      do   for a number of years subsequent to 1774,
promise results of very considerable value.            By thus bringing them
to light and proving their excellence, Stone has opened for his
successor a mine of scientific wealth which will certainly not be
neglected.
    In 1896, Stone was a member of the party which accompanied
Sir George Baden-Powell in his yacht to Nova Zembla, and wa-?
thus one of the few astronomers who were favoured with fine
weather for observing the total eclipse of the sun of that year.

                                   xxiii
Stone secured successful observations ; the paper he wrote on the
results of them was not printed before his death, but it will shortly
appear in the memoirs of the Royal Astronomical Society.
   Stone's scientific papers number in all about 150, and cover a
very wide range ; they were chiefly communicated to the Royal
Astronomical Society.
    Such, in brief, is the record of Stone's labours.    Very very few
astronomers have done more of solid and useful work for the
advancement of astronomy.        But for the simultaneous and almost
phenomenal labours of Gould at Cordoba, it might be said of Stone
that he created our knowledge of the exact sidereal astronomy of the
Southern Hemisphere.
   Unlike Maclear and Gould, he was not a great observer; at
Greenwich he personally made about 2| per cent, of the observa
tions secured there during the period 1860 to 1869 ; at the Gape and
Oxford he made very few of the observations, but he closely super
vised his assistants, and laboured early and late at every detail of
reduction and examination.
   Trained in the rigid and systematic school of Airy, and gifted
with remarkable powers of speed, accuracy, and endurance in com
putation, he was enabled to carry out, with a very small staff, the
great record of work which he produced.         He made the chief part
of Maclear's meridian observations available for science, and created
his two great catalogues — the Cape Catalogue of 12,441 stars for
1880, and the Radcliffe Catalogue of 6424 stars for 1890.       By these
works his name will be chiefly remembered.        But the influence of a
man so earnest and diligent as Stone was in most departments of
astronomy, can never die ; it will live to inspire like zeal and devo
tion in others, who are seeking truth for truth's sake, as Stone did.
    After a short and painless illness, Stone died suddenly at the
Radcliffe Observatory on the 9th of May, 1897, the nineteenth anni
versary of the death of Main, his predecessor.
    Stone was a Fellow of Queens' College, Cambridge. In 1868 he
was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and, as already stated,
 was in 1869 awarded the gold medal of the Royal Astronomical
 Society.   He was a Corresponding Member of the Society Nationale
 des Sciences Naturelles, Cherbourg, and Honorary Member of the
 Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester.          In 1881 he
 received the  Lalande   Medal  of the   Paris Academy  of  Sciences for
 his Cape catalogue ; in 1892 the University of Padua conferred upon
 him the honorary degree of Doctor of Natural Philosophy, and from
 March, 1883, he was a Member of the Meteorological Council,
 London.

    On    the   29th May, 1897, died Julius von Sachs, Professor of
Botany      in  the University of Wiirzbnrg, after six weeks' illness of
acute phthisis, the result of influenza.          The following account of his
life is based upon information, kindly supplied by members of his
family, derived from a manuscript autobiography, which does not,
however, extend beyond the year 1882.
    Julius Sachs was born at Breslau on October 2, 1832. After
quitting the gymnasium iu 1845, he appears to have turned his
attention      to biological    studies, for in 1851 he became private
assistant to the physiologist Purkyne at Prague. Whilst there he
entered upon a regular university course, devoting his attention to
animal anatomy and physiology, and subsequently, for two whole
years, to physics       and mathematics          He must, however, have also
been     studying botany       at this  time,   for he soon began to publish
botanical papers ; but it is not clear under what circumstances he
pursued this study, for, though he inscribed himself for Kostelet-
zky's botanical lectures, it appears that he did not attend them.            In
1856 he took his doctor's degree, the subject of his dissertation,
which was not published, having been Diffusion. Shortly after this
he   finally adopted a botanical career, establishing himself in 1857 as
Privatdocent for plant-physiology in the University of Prague.
Whilst still at Prague, Sachs was invited by the Agricultural
Academy of Tharandt, in Saxony, to write a memorandum on the
importance of plant-physiology to agriculture, with the result that,
in April, 1859, he was appointed physiological                assistant to the
Agricultural Academy           there.     In  1861  he  was  called   to be the
Director of the Polytechnic at Chemnitz, a post which he held for
only four months, when he was transferred to Poppelsdorf, near
Bonn, as the Director of the Agricultural Academy at that place;
here he remained till 1867, when he was nominated Professor of
Botany in the University of Freiburg-in-Breisgau.                   In 1868 he
accepted the Chair of Botany in the Bavarian University of Wiirz-
burg, where he remained until his death, in spite of calls to the
Universities of Heidelberg, Vienna, Berlin, Jena, Bonn, and Munich.
He was nominated a Geheimrath, and was ennobled by the King of
Bavaria.       His election as Foreign Member of the Linnean Society
dates from 1878, and of the Royal Society from 1888.
    To give anything like an adequate account of Sachs' labours would
be to write the history of plant-physiology from 1857 to 1885, after
 which time his active work, in consequence of ill-health, may be said
to have ceased.       Nothing more that a mere sketch of his scientific
career    will  be attempted.
    It                       '
        appears from the Catalogue of Scientific Papers,' that Sachs'
activity as an author dates from the year 1853, when he published
three papers in the Bohemian journal ' Ziva,' two of which were

                                           XXV
zoological (on the Crayfish and on IHnotherium ijiijnuhum) and one
botanical (" Ueb. das Wachsthnm der Pflanzen "), followed by a
series of botanical papers, mostly morphological and systematic,
which appeared in the same journal in the course of the years
1854—56.       During this period two papers of his appeared in the
'                           '
   Botanische Zeitung (1855) on Collema and Crucibulum respectively ;
the former of these is of special interest inasmuch as in it Sachs
expresses views which nearly anticipated the theory of the structure
of Lichens propounded by Schwendener in 1868, and now almost
universally accepted. But it is not until 1857 that we find him
devoting himself especially to that department of botany with which
his name will always be associated, when he commenced that series
of physi ological investigations which he carried on, with scarcely an
interval, for more than a quarter of a ceutury.                The most important
line of research which he struck out in what we may term his
Prague-period, was that of investigating the metabolism of the plant
by means of the micro-chemical examination of the tissues.                 Begin
                                 "
ning with the paper                Ueb. einige neue microscopisch-chemische
Reaction8-methoden,"*           it led on to the series of " Keimungsgeschich-
ten," relating to a variety of plants (bean, grasses, date, onion, <fcc),
the publication of which extended over a number of years, and which
may be fairly said to have laid the foundation of our knowledge of
micro-chemical        methods, as also of both the morphological              and
physiological details of the process of germination.
    The period of his tenure of office at Tharandt is memorable for
 his resuscitation of the method of " water-culture," originally sug
gested by Duhamel,t and the application of it to the investigation
 of the fundamental problems of nutrition.              It is to the introduction
 of this method that we owe whatever accurate knowledge we possess
 of the relative physiological importance of the various mineral con
  stituents of the plant's food.
    Of the many valuable contributions to plant-physiology which
  Sachs made whilst at Poppelsdorf (1861-67), perhaps the most
  fundamentally important are those which relate to the function of
  chlorophyll.     Whilst Von Mohl and others had recognised the almost
  universal occurrence of starch-grains in the chloroplastids, it remained
  for Sachs to give the explanation of the fact.             Ho ascertained that
  the formation of starch-grains in chloroplastids is dependent upon
  exposure to light ; in other words, upon the conditions already known
  to be essential      for the absorption and decomposition of carbon
  dioxide by the green parts of plants.           Bringing these facts into their
  proper correlation,      he arrived at the weighty conclusion that tho

starch-grains to be found in ch loroplast ids are the first visible pro
duct of their assimilatory activity. This period of Sachs' life was
that in which he first made his mark as a writer of books. In 1865
                  '                                                            '

(as vol. 4 of the uncompleted Handbuch der Physiologischen Botanik,'
edited by Hofmcister) ; and although his well-known ' Lehrbuch der
Botanik '* was not actually published until 1868, the work fairly
belongs to the period under consideration.            In neither of these books
do we     find    much indication of that literary ability which marks
his later works, no doubt because their structure rendered any
attempt at literary form impossible.           They are both of them mines of
information, especially as regards the older botanical literature.           But
they are much more than this.             Though they may both be included
under the designation "text-book," unlike most text-books they con
tain a large mass of original work on the part of the author.             Thus,
they are not only learned, but also stimulating.            It is not too much
to say that they have contributed very largely to the unprecedented
expansion of morphological            and physiological    research which has
taken place since their publication, a statement which is especially
true with regard to this country. They are generally admitted to be
the best works of the kind which had appeared up to that time, and
although they have now become somewhat antiquated, it is doubtful
if they have been excelled by any such works which have appeared
since.    One feature in them deserves special notice, and that is the
manifestation, in the illustrations of the ' Lehrbuch' in particular, of
the remarkable artistic faculty which Sachs possessed.
    The preparation of the earlier editions of the ' Lehrbuch ' is no
doubt accountable for the relatively small number of original
memoirs which Sachs published during the years 1865-72, a period
which included his brief sojourn at Freiburg and his settlement at
Wurzburg.         But  he   had not been long in Wiirzburg before he
resumed his researches, the more important of which were published,
together with contributions            by his colleagues and pupils, in the
                '
well-known Arbei        ten  des Botanischen      Instituts in WUi zburg,' the
first number of which appeared in 1871.                His papers in the first

phenomena of growth, and include his remarkable investigations
 into the periodicity of growth in length, which clearly established
the retarding influence of the highly refrangible rays of the spectrum.
The contents of the second volume (1S78-82) are of very great
interest.     We find here the last of his researches on growth, intro
ducing the " clinostat," an important            addition to   the apparatus  of

tributed. Then there are his classical papers on the structure of aud
the arrangement of cells in growing-points ; and finally the papers in
which he elaborated his "imbibition-theory"                    of the transpiration-
current. Though it now seems probable that this theory is insuffi
cient to explain the facts — the problem, however, still remaining
unsolved in spite of many subsequent attempts at solution — yet these
papers contain a great mass of important observations, the result of
enormous labour and experimental skill, which must be taken into
account by all who attempt investigation                  in this direction.      This
volume also contains the noteworthy papers on " Stoff und Form
der Ptlanzenorgane," an attempt at a material explanation of the
differences distinguishing the chief members of the plant-body, as
also the various metamorphosed forms of one and the same member.
This attempted explanation, though it cannot be said to have met
with general      acceptance, has still its adherents, and is to some
extent borne out by his subsequent observations, published in the
third volume of the ' Arbeiten,' on the suppression of the develop
ment of flowers in plants grown in light which has passed through
a   solution of quinine,       and    has   consequently       lost  the  ultra-violet

of the assimilatory activity of the leaf, as also of the distribution of
the products of this activity from the leaf to the rest of the plant.
    With this third volume Sachs' work as an investigator may be said
to have closed, though he subsequently published from time to time

    The        Vorlesungen ueber Pflanzenphysiologie,'* which               appeared
in   1882 (second edition        1887), was prepared to take the place of the
physiological       sections  of  the ' Lehrbuch,' the preparation of a revised
edition of the morphological and systematic portions being assigned
to a former colleague, Professor Goebel.t                   The method of the
'Vorlesungen' is, however, altogether different from that of the
'
   Lehrbuch.'        There is in it but little trace of that laborious compila
tion      of facts from all sources which is the characteristic           feature of
       '
the      Lehrbuch.'       On the contrary, the references are comparatively
few.        The book is, in fact, an exposition of the physiology of plant*
from his own standpoint ; it is his confession of faith.               In reading it
one      seems    to hear Sachs himself speaking, an illusion which is to
some       extent   justified by the fact that it was taken down from his
dictation.
     In closing this brief appreciation of his scientific work, it only
remains to point out that there is scarcely a branch of botanical
knowledge to which Sachs did not make some important and lasting
 addition.
     As    a lecturer Sachs was pre-eminent:         he possessed great readiness
of    utterance,    together   with  rare   force and lucidity. His experimental
lectures in particular will not easily be forgotten by those who have
had the privilege of attending                them.    The eloquent speech, the
                             —
pictorial illustration generally by means of a stick of charcoal and
 large sheets of white paper — the manipulative dexterity, all combined
 to make these lectures fascinating and to rivet attention, even though
 their duration was never less than, and often exceeded, two hours.
 But, beyond all his other gifts, Sachs was endowed with a vigorous
 and stimulating personality, with the faculty of arousing in others the
 enthusiasm with which he himself was overflowing.                  In his best days
 at Wurzburg, his laboratory was filled with students from all the
 countries of Europe. Among those who worked there are many well-
 known Continental botanists, such as Pfeffer, Goebel, de Vries, Prantl
  (who died a few years ago), Errera, Wortmann, Noll ; and not a few
  Fellows of the Royal Society, I. B. Balfour, P. O. Bower, F. Darwin,
  W. Gardiner, D. H. Scott, II. M. Ward, and the present writer.
  Great as has been tho direct influence of his own work upon the
 progress of botany, tho indirect effect exerted through his pupils has
 been oven greater.
     Apart from his botanical            knowledge,   Sachs was a man of           wide

    Samuel Haughton, who died on the 31st October, 1897, sprang
 from an old Quaker family, and although both of his parents had
 withdrawn from the Community of Friends, he spent his boyhood
amidst Quaker surroundings.         The early impressions which he then
received    remained    permanent through life, and he retained deep-
rooted within him many of the best of the Quaker principles.
    He was born in Carlow on the 21st December, 1821, and was early
sent to a large school which was kept in that town by the Elector of
the parish.     It was during his school life that his interest in natural
science was    awakened.     He had the good fortune to come under the
influence of Mr. Emerson, one of the masters of the school, a most
gifted scholar, and a man endowed with a profound love of nature.
With him as an associate young Haughton roamed over the surround
ing country in search of specimens. The banks of the beautiful river
which flows through his native town, the bog-land in the immediate
vicinity, and the slopes of the neighbouring hills, were systematically
explored, and botany and geology became his favourite recreations.
    At the age of seventeen Haughton entered Trinity College, Dublin.
He possessed in a remarkable degree the qualities which lead to
success in college life, quickness of apprehension, a clear head, and
a tenacious     and ready memory.       Indeed the distinction which he
attained as a student was such         that immediately after taking his
degree, an unexpected vacancy having occurred, his friends induced
him to enter as a candidate for Fellowship.           "With little more than
six months' preparation,     he succeeded   at his first trial (1844) in that
moRt formidable examination,         a feat quite unprecedented in the
history    of  the  college.  Set  free  thus early from the prolonged
drudgery which is the usual preliminary of a Fellowship contest,

the fear of impending examinations, to follow out those line3 of
study and research which his natural bent of mind made him.
specially qualified to undertake.
   He lived in the same house          in college   as the  eminent mathe
matician McCullagh, and conceived the warmest regard and admira
tion for him.      Very possibly it was due to this association that
Haughton's earlier work was in the domain of physical science ; and
at the age of twenty-six he obtained his first extra-collegiate dis
tinction, viz., the award of the Cunningham Medal by the Royal
Irish Academy for his memoir " On the Equilibrium and Motion of
 Solid and Fluid Bodies." Soon, however, he turned his attention to
geology, and in 1851, on the removal of Professor Phillips to Oxford,
he was elected University Professor in that subject.            This chair he
occupied for thirty years,   and   only resigned   it on his appointment as
one of the Senior Fellows of Trinity College in 1881.
   Very early in his career, before he bad entered college, Haughton
 had shown a strong inclination towards the profession of medicine.
It was his boyish dream to prepare himself as a medical missionary,
and to devote his life to missionary work in China.            It was the old
Quaker    instinct  working within    him,  an  instinct  which   became the
great ruling principle   of his life,  the desire  to  succour   and help the
weak in the great battle of life. It is fortunate for science and the
cause of education that bis early ambitions were not realised.           Still,
although his thoughts were      for  the time deflected into other chan
nels, and his duties as a Fellow of the College and as Professor of
 Geology led him into a totally different field of work, his early yearn
ings were not completely eradicated.         The natural course of events
had drawn him away from medicine, but geology brought him back to
it. He perceived that he could not properly treat of animal remains
preserved in fossils without a knowledge of comparative anatomy,
and the readiest means of obtaining this knowledge appeared to him
to lie in the thorough study, in the first instance, of human anatomy.
He was thus led to enter     the   Medical School, and consequently we
find him, at the somewhat advanced age of thirty-eight, and already
a Fellow of the Royal Society, already widely known as a mathe
matician and a geologist, undergoing all the drudgery attending a
course of professional study.      Well aware that there is no royal road
to knowledge, he threw himself into the full routine of attendance
on lectures and hospitals, and pursued his dissections and laboratory
work as cheerfully as the youngest student in the school, and as
assiduously as if he had to earn his bread by the practice of medi
cine. Although greatly burdened by other duties, he passed all the
degree examinations at the prescribed periods, and finally graduated
in medicine in 1862.
   Thus introduced into the inner life of the School of Physic,

                                  XXXI
Dr. Haughton could not help seeing that it stood sadly in need of
reform. Although the medical degrees of the University were at
that time eagerly sought by young medical aspirants, the school
of Trinity College was the last place where they cared to study.
Immediately after his graduation, Dr. Haughton threw his whole
energies into the improvement of the school, and to attain this
end he was not slow to use the influence which he had deserv
edly acquired with the senior members of Trinity College.              He
was appointed Medical Registrar, and at once proceeded to work.
To render the reform effectual it was necessary to grapple with
many ancient abuses — a task from which he did not shrink. He
was a man of unbounded courage and great pugnacity — to join in a
fight was never unwelcome.      But these instincts were kept in check
by great kindliness of heart, and none of his former antagonists
who may have survived him has cause to remember with pain
any expression he ever used. The years which followed proved a
somewhat stormy period in Dr. Haughton's life, and he had to adopt
in certain instances measures which might appear to be harsh, but
which were rendered absolutely necessary by the exigencies of the
case.     One of his leading characteristics was his absolute unselfish
ness, and it may be well to mention in connection with these con
troversies that no one could point to a single act of his which was
dictated by self-interest.   But he was stern and almost unforgiving
                                                                             *
with those who, by idleness or otherwise, did damage to the good
 name of the college he so sincerely loved.        When Dr. Haughton
 took in hand the reform of the School of Physic it was one of the
 most insignificant of the schools which then existed in Dublin ;
now it takes the foremost rank, and this change, brought about in
 little more than thirty years, is largely, if not entirely, due to the
sagacious and enlightened manner in which he guided its policy.
     It was during the earlier years of his connexion with the medical
 school that he commenced a series of observations on the mechanical
 principles of muscular action.     The rssults of these investigations
 appeared    from   time to time   in  the ' Proceedings of the Royal
                         '
  Society,' and of the     Royal Irish Academy,' and ultimately took
  final shape in his book on ' Animal Mechanics,' which was published
 in 1873.    This is probably Dr. Haughton's greatest work. For ten
 years he laboured at  it, and during that time   itwas his daily practice
 to spend two hours in the dissecting room in the study of the com
 parative anatomy of the muscular system of vertebrates.       What may
 be regarded as being the key-note of the work           struck in the fol
                                                           is
 lowing short extract from the preface.     He says — " have met with
                                                       :    I
  numerous instances in the muscular mechanism of vertebrate animals
 of the application of the principle of least action in Nature by   ;
  which
      I      mean that the work to be done   is effected by means of the

                                   XXX11
 existing arrangement of the mnscles, bones, and joints with a less
  expenditure of force than would be possible under any other arrange
  ment ; so that any alteration would be a positive disadvantage to the
  animal." In this — as indeed in all his writings — he takes up a most
  uncompromising attitude towards the theory of evolution or, as he
            it,   " the                         "
 expresses               unproved hypothesis      of the descent of living
 organisms from "a supposed common ancestor."               He wonld have
  none of  it.
    In 1878 Dr. Haughton retired from the post of Medical Eegistrar,
 and became the chairman of the Medical School Committee and
  University Representative on the General Medical Council.
    With regard to his work as a member of the General Medical
  Council, Sir William Turner writes            " Dr. Haughton, as
                                           :                           might
 naturally be expected, gave especial attention to matters con
 nected with medical education.        His speeches on the preliminary or
 entrance examination of intending medical students were charac
 terised by shrewdness, both of thought and expression, and were
 enlivened by wit and humour. He held that the entrance examina
 tions to the medical profession should be conducted by the national
 bodies engaged in general education, and he advocated the im
 portance of mathematics as a mental training.           His brightness and
 warmth of nature made him very popular with his colleagues, who,
 when his declining health made       it    necessary for him to resign his
 seat, expressed, through the President, their regret that he was no
 longer able to assist them in the discharge of their duties."
    As a Governor of Sir Patrick Dunn's Hospital Dr. Haughton
 likewise did noble work. For thirty-four years he laboured in its
behalf, and even during the failing years of his life his interest never
 slackened, and he rarely missed a Board meeting.            The undaunted
 courage which      he showed during    the  epidemic  of cholera  in 1S66is
 not likely to be forgotten.     At that time there was most inadequate
provision     for  the  proper nursing  of the cholera patients in Dublin,
 and as the disease spread, very naturally the entire nursing machinery
broke down.         Dr. Haughton called for volunteers from amongst
the students and organised from them       a   nursing staff which did duty
during the time that the epidemic lasted. In this work he drew no
distinction between himself and the student members of the staff.
He took his turn at nursing with the rest and, by the energetic and
                                               ;
enthusiastic way in which he grappled with the difficulty, he did
much to alleviate the suffering of the sick and panic-stricken poor in
Dublin at   a     most trying and anxious time.       The experience which
Haughton passed through during         the  outbreak  of cholera left on his
mind an abiding sense of the value of bedside work. He was thus
led to found medals for the encouragement of clinical work in
Dunn's Hospital, and the last act of his life was, out of very scanty

                                    xxxiii
savings, to provide for the making of these rewards more substantial
and permanent.
    The Government having thrown open to public competition com
missions in the Artillery and Royal Engineers, Haughton was not
deterred by his many other duties from organising, in conjunction
with his friend Mr. Galbraith, classes for such students as were pre
paring for these services. The success of their teaching was so
remarkable that the proportion of Irish candidates who obtained
commissions was higher at that time than it has ever been since, and
this success continued until the conditions of the competition were
filtered to the detriment of University candidates.     In connexion with
these classes he published with Mr. Galbraith a series of manuals
which became text-books for the general use of the College.
    No account of the part which Dr. Haughton has played as a pro
minent figure in Irish life would be complete without reference to
his long and intimate connexion with the Royal Zoological Society
of Ireland.    In 1860 he became a member of its Council, and in 1864
he was elected its Honorary Secretary.          For twenty-one years he
filled this office, and he only resigned it to assume the duties of
President, which he discharged for five additional years. During a
large part of the time in which he acted as Secretary the Society
was in a very struggling condition, and it passed through more
than one financial crisis which threatened to swamp it ; indeed it
is very probable that had there been a less courageous and able
man at the helm the Society would have been submerged altogether.
But Haughton never lost heart, and the Society owes its present
secure position in a great measure to the plucky fight which he then
fought. He enjoyed extremely telling how when the bank on one
occasion   threatened   to foreclose  the Society's account, he had met
the difficulty by offering to deposit      a ferocious Bengal tiger as
security for the debt.
    He had   a  passionate fondness for animals.      He was never seen
in Dublin without his dog; and on his death bed, when lying speech
less, he endeavoured with the little power which still remained in
his left arm to acknowledge the advances of his little Scotch terrier.
    Some of the happiest hours of his life were spent in the Zoo
logical Gardens.     A distinctive feature of the social life in Dublin
                            " Zoo breakfasts." On Saturday
consists in the weekly                                          mornings
the members of Council meet in the Gardens and take breakfast
together before procetding to business. It was at these meetings
that Haughton appeared at his very best. Surrounded by friends of
long standing, all of whom had the greatest admiration and affec
tion for him, he was wont to give full scope to his bright and
joyous nature.
     Among Hanghton's      many talents    perhaps the greatest    was his
                                                               /  -'

                                      xxxiv
   talent for acquiring friends.      As we have said,     he was singularly
   unselfish, for if his friends     had any fault to find in him it was
   his little care of his own        material interests : he was perfectly
   transparent and sincere, and absolutely loyal.         Thus he kept all
   the friends he     made,   and no  one  was more successful in gaining
   new ones.       He was one of the most charming of companions, over
  flowing with wit and humour, ready to take a lively part in any
  discussion,     and able from a well-stored memory to relate many
   results of a much varied experience.      And those who were attracted
  by his social qualities found, as they came to know hiui better, that
  he possessed those sterling qualities on which the solid foundations
  of friendship can be laid. He used to be a regular attendant at
  the meetings of the British Association, the chief use of which
  is the bringing of men of kindred pursuits together.            There he
  formed valuable friendships with scientific men, of whom it may be
  enough to name Tyndall, who came from the same part of Ireland,
 and Huxley, with whom, though they were widely apart on tbeir
 theological views, he always maintained a cordial and intimate
 friendship.       His medical friends outside Ireland are too numerous
 to    be mentioned, but he used frequently to speak of Acland of
 Oxford, Sir William Turner, Sir John Simon,. and Sir Richard
 Quain.      It is needless to say how his loss is felt by those with whom
 he was in the habit of daily working, and it may in truth be said
 that no man has left a wider circle of sorrowing friends.
     He received many honours during his life. Only a few of these
 need be alluded to here.         He was elected a Fellow of the Royal
 Society in 1858.       He received the degree of D.C.L. (Hon. causa) of
 Oxford in 1868 ; the degree of LL.U. (Hon. causa) of Cambridge in
 1880; the degree of LL.D. (Hon. causa) of Edinburgh in 1884; the
degree of M.D. (Hon. causa) of Bologna in 1888.
     It is impossible to give in the space at our disposal anything like
a proper conception of the published work of Dr. Haughton.             Few
men had a greater multiplicity of interests, and although it is prob
able that if he had been more of a specialist he would have left
behind him a larger amount of work of permanent value on some
one subject, yet his many-sidedness pre-eminently fitted him for the
place he filled in the government of a large educational institution.
In the Royal Society Catalogue 173 memoirs and papers aie entered
under his name, and this only takes his work down to 1883. The
                                                '
majority of these were published in the Proceedings of the Royal
Irish Academy,' of which he was a member for fifty-two years, and
of which he lived to become the President.
     Some idea of his amazing versatility may be gained by a glance
through the titles of his papers as they are given in the Royal
Society's Catalogues. The following is a small selection from these :—

    Dr. Haughton's contributions to physical science were principally
in the subjects of elasticity, the theory of light, solar radiation, and
the tides.
   Fond of controversy, he plunged into the discussion which raged
in the middle of the present century on the nature of transparent
media.     He very early came to the conclusion (1849) that it was
only by a study of the facts of reflection and refraction that the
question could be decided, and with this end in view he made a
great number of laborious observations on the refraction of polarised
light from many substances. The results he obtained remain as a
monument to his industry and a permanent contribution to science,
although the controversy as to the nature of transparent media has
drifted into new channels, owing to the development of the electro
magnetic theory of light.
   His work on solar radiations was undertaken in connexion with the
geological question as to the age of the earth, the causes of the
glacial epoch, and of geological climates.        By the aid of very
laborious calculations he considered the effects produced on terres
trial climates by changes in the distribution of land, by alteration in
the temperature of the sun, and by the quantity of carbonic acid and
aqueous vapour in the air.
   His observations on the tides were originally undertaken with the
view of rendering the navigation of the Irish Sea and the English
Channel safer to outward and homeward bound ships. He after
wards became a recognised authority on tides, and was not only
consulted by Arctic explorers, but was entrusted with valuable
records obtained during Arctic voyages for the purpose of report.
    Dr. Haughton likewise devoted much of his time to chemical
problems, and in the later years of his life some of the higher
                                                             /3

                                        xxxvi
    mathematical      conceptions    of chemistry, which he himself called
     "Newtonian chemistry," greatly engrossed his attention.         He endea
     voured to develop the consequences of a theory of chemical combina
     tion depending on the assumptions that in chemical actions energy
    was conserved as well as a quantity analogous to areas.         Our know
    ledge   of  the   dynamics    of  molecules  is  hardly great enough to
    criticise such a theory effectively.
        Dr. Haughton's work in the field of geology includes contributions
    upon subjects of a very diverse nature.         He has written extensively
    on mineralogy,       petrography,    physical geography,     and physical
    geology.
        Mineralogy first claimed his attention, and in 1853 he began to
    publish a series of papers on Irish minerals.           One of the last of
    these dealt exhaustively with the fine meteorite which fell at
    Dundrum in co. Tipperary, and which through his ins tr a mentality
   was presented by Lord Hawarden to the Museum of Trinity College.
        His petrographical communications are still more numerous and
   important. His work on the Irish granites is singularly complete,
   and was commenced in 1856, at a time when the use of the petro
   graphical microscope had not been revived by Sorby. When this is
   taken into account we cannot help being struck by the results
  obtained by Haughton.
       A highly interesting observation is contained in his papers on the
  Trap Dykes of the district of Mourne and on the Carlingford
  Granite. He detects a chemical reaction between the intruding
 granite and the limestone, and points out how the granite is thereby
 altered to what may be called a Syenite.
       On the Bubject of physical geology Haughton contributed many
                    '                                        '
 papers to the         Proceedings of the Royal Society        and elsewhere.
 The first of the series relates to the effect on the distribution of
 climate in geological time from the shifting of the earth's axis, due to
 continental npheaval.         Haughton arrived at the conclusion — which
 is in agreement with the views of Professor G. Darwin — that the
 effect would be insignificant.           In a paper which appeared in
 '
    Nature,' Haughton estimated the whole duration of geological time
 as 200 million years.        This opinion he based on the probable rate of
formation of stratified rock. He assumed these to possess a thick
ness of 177,200 feet.           He likewise investigated the question of
                                                          '
geological climate in connexion with Bossetti's Law of Cooling,'
and arrived at the conclusion that the secular cooling of the sun
has been the chief factor in changes of geological climate.
      In 1858 he published in the ' Philosophical Transactions ' his
important work on the joint-planes of the Old Red Sandstone of
co. Waterford, and with this also may be associated his observations
on the remarkable uniformity in magnetic bearing of the joint-planes

                                        xxxvn
   of these rocks with the joint-planes of Cornwall granite, Donegal
   granite, the carboniferous        limestone of co. Fermanagh,          and the
   granite  and  slate  of Mourne.      Daubree    has  likewise   expended infi
   nite pains on the subject of joint-planes.
                                   '                                        '
      Haughton's book entitled Lectures on Physical Geography gives
   some idea of his marvellous grasp of facts, and of his many-sidedness.
   His ' Manual of Geology ' is also in many respects a remarkable book.
  The chapter on " Symmetry " is specially characteristic of the writer.
  Those who read the closing chapter of that book, and who cannot
  accept the opinions he expresses regarding Darwinism, will at least
  respect the deep and sincere feeling which cansed him to reject the
  Darwinian philosophy as being opposed to his religious views.
                                                                      D. J. C.
      William Francis Drvmmond Jbbvois was born at Cowes on the
   10th   September,    1821.   In February,      1837,    he joined the Royal
  Military Academy, Woolwich, and two years later obtained his com
  mission in the Royal Engineers.           After passing through the School
 of Military Engineering at Chatham, over which Sir Charles Pasley
  then presided, he sailed for the Cape of Good Hope.               Here he was
 soon actively employed.        When      only twenty-one he was appointed
  Brigade-Major to a force sent to the Orange River to control the
 movements of the Boers ; and in 1846-7 he took part in an expedi
 tion against the Kaffirs. On the latter occasion he made, under
 circumstauces      of considerable difficulty, a military sketch of British
 Kaffraria   which   was of great use in subsequent wars.           Thirty years
 later it was the only map of the district, possessing any pretensions
 to accuracy, which the general commanding                  could find for his
 guidance.     In 1848 Captain Jervois returned to England with a
 special recommendation from the Governor to Lord Raglan as an
 active, able officer who could "afford every information on all military
                             "
 and geographical points connected with the colony.
     The Duke of Wellington had always held strong views with regard
to the military importance of Alderney, and, in 1852, it was decided
to protect the harbour of refuge, then in course of construction, by
strong fortifications. This duty was entrusted to Captain Jervois,
who designed the works and superintended their construction.                  Sir
W. Jervois maintained to the last that Alderney was still a place of
importance in the defence of England, but other views prevailed, and
the forts he constructed are now in ruins.
    In 1855 Major Jervois was transferred to London and served on
Lord Monk's Committee on Barrack Accommodation.                   The following
year   he  was appointed   Assistant     Inspector-General    of  Fortifications,
and with characteristic energy at once took up the question of the
defence of our dockyards.        He studied the ground at Portsmouth

                                 XXXV111
and Plymouth, prepared projects for occupying particular lines of
ground by forts, and, with a staff of specially selected officers,
designed the works to be constructed.
   The movement for the protection of our dockyards and naval
arsenals originated in the celebrated letter of the Duke of Wellington
and in a Memorandum prepared in 18-47 by Lord Palmerston with the
assistance of Sir John Burgoync.       In the latter paper it was pointed
out that it was possible for France,  under certain conditions, to land a
force which, amongst other operations, might destroy our dockyards,
and so paralyse our naval resources for years.        Public opinion was
at the time opposed to the movement, but, after the Crimean War,
a change took place, and    some   progress was made* as already men
tioned, in designing works. It was not, however, until 1858, when
the Government received private information that the French were
secretly making preparations for war, and were obliged to take
measures of precaution, that the importance of the question forced
itself upon public attention.     In 1859 Lord Palmerston, who was a
strong supporter of the view that it was necessary to secure oar
naval bases against any hostile enterprise, again became Prime
Minister.    A Royal Commission ou the National Defences was
appointed, with Major Jervois as secretary, and, in 1860, it reported
to Parliament. After much discussion a resolution was carried in
the House of Commons to the effect that the recommendations of the
Commission should be carried out as rapidly as possible, and that the
cost should be met by a loan.
   Major Jervois, who had practically guided the work of the Com
mission, and the preparation of the Report, was now entrusted with
the task of fortifying the naval bases and arsenals and the principal
harbours and coasting stations of the United Kingdom, the Colonies,
and dependencies.     On this duty he was employed until 1875 when
the accounts of the great loan for fortifications were finally wound nj>
with a saving of more than £200,000.         The nineteen years spent at
the War Office formed the most important period of Sir W. Jervois'
life. -During the whole of it he acted as secretary to the Committee on
the Defence of the Empire, and rendered very valuable services to
his country.    The fortifications, chiefly from a mistaken view of
their object, have been much criticised. They were projected and
carried out in accordance with the strong recommendations of men
of the largest experience in actual war, and were intended to render
the bases from which the navy worked secure. The great works
themselves will always be a monument to the ability and energy of
Sir W. Jervois. The difficulties that had to be encountered and over
come were very great.     When the work was commenced rifled artil
lery was in its infancy; armour plating was in the experimental
stage; torpedoes and submarine mires had made no progress : and

                                 xxxix
 high explosives for mines and shells were still in the distant future.
 There was no delay, however, in adapting the works to the changes
rendered necessary by these developments.          The lines of defence
were laid out further from the dockyards to meet the increased
range of artillery ; arrangements were made by which the armour
plating of the forts could be strengthened to meet any further de
velopment of artillery ; and a committee was appointed to consider
how submarine mines and torpedoes should be utilised to strengthen
the defence of ports and harbours.
    The works during and after execution were sharply criticised, and
they were defended with energy and success by Colonel Jervois before
committees and in papers read at the Royal Institution and the
Royal United Service Institution.      Fortifications constructed from
twenty-five to thirty years ago must obviously need modification in
some points to enable them to meet later developments in the art of
attack.   But, on the whole, it may be said that the works for which
Sir W. Jervois and his associates are responsible constitute a solid
and enduring contribution to the defences of the country, and that
for many years to come they will fulfil the object for which they
were erected.    Amongst the greatest of those works are the fortifica
tions for the protection of Portsmouth, Plymouth, Portland, Pem
broke, Cork, the Thames, and the Medway.
   In 1863, 1864, and 1865 Colonel Jervois went on three separate
missions to advise on the defence of Canada; in 1S63 and 1869 he
was sent to inspect the works at Halifax and Bermuda, and in 1865
and 1866 to prepare projects for strengthening the fortifications
at Malta and Gibraltar. In 1871-72 he was employed by the Govern
ment of India to inspect and report on the defences of Aden, Perim,
Bombay, and the Hughli, and he also visited British Burma, and
reported on the defences of Rangun and Mulmein.
   In 1874 Sir W. Jervois, who had been made a C.B. in 1863, was
created K.C.M.G. in recognition of his services to Canada.      In 1875
he left the War Office and was appointed       Governor of the Straits
 Settlements.   Soon after his arrival at Singapore lie found himself
confronted by the necessity of making war on the Malay States of
Perak and Suugei Ujong, to punish them for the treacherous murder
of Mr. Birch, the British Resident.      By his promptitude in con
centrating a strong force at the seat of war, the operations were
soon brought to a successful conclusion, and he then elaborated plans
for the government of the protected Malay States.        In 1877 lie was
sent to Australia to advise the Australasian Governments on matters
of defence, and to prepare schemes for the protection of their ports.
Whilst employed on this duty he was appointed Governor of South
Australia, and, after completing a term of six years (1877-8o), was
made Governor of New Zealand for a like term (1883-89). In

                                     xl
these two colonies      he showed himself to be as good a constitutional
governor, working       with  ministers responsible to a Parliamentary
majority, as he had proved himself to be a good autocrat in the
Straits Settlements.       From 1877 to 1889 he was adviser to the
Governments of all the Australasian colonies on questions connected
with the defence of their harbours and coasts, and during this period
he placed the defences in a much better position to resist any incur
sion by the ships of hostile Powers than they were on his arrival.
    In 1889 Sir W. Jervois, who had been made a G.C.M.G. in 1878,
returned to England, and in the following year was appointed a
member of Mr. Stanhope's            Commission on military Defences
 (1890-91).     In 1888  he was elected a    F.R.S.  In 1892 he wrote an
                   '                       '
article in the       Nineteenth Century       magazine advocating that
the coast defences should be placed in the hands of the navy — which
attracted some attention at the time.        But most of the years of his
retirement were passed quietly in the country, until an unfortunate
carriage accident ended his life on the 17th August, 1897.
                                                             c. w. w.
    William Aechee was the eldest son of the Rev. Richard Archer,
 vicar of Clonduff, Rathfriland, co. Down. He was born on May 6,
 1827.     His two younger brothers were educated at Trinity College,
 Dublin, and were afterwards in the Government service, but no
 particulars of his own early education are available.    The significant
 fact of his life was the foundation in 1857 of the Dublin Micro
 scopical Club, of which for a long period Archer was secretary, and
 to a large extent the moving spirit. The club was started by a small
 group of students, who were drawn to natural history studies by the
 teaching of Allman and Harvey, the two distinguished men who
 successively occupied the chair of botany at Trinity College, Dublin.
 The club, which still exists, was limited to twelve members, and pro
 bably no society so small has ever accomplished so much important
 scientific work.     Each member from the first took up some special
 line, and Archer devoted himself to the investigation of the Protozoa
 and microscopic algco of the moor-pools of Ireland.
    In this fascinating field of research, the richness of which can
 perhaps hardly be paralleled in any other country, Archer laboured
 for the rest of his life. He devised a simple but effective method of
 collecting and of preserving for future examination his collected
 material.    As might be expected a long experience gave him extra
 ordinary dexterity in the work. Nothing could be more interesting
 than to accompany him on one of his excursions.         He knew how to
 find his way through the bogs and instinctively selected the by no
  means obvious spots where the best harvest was to be found.
     A striking instance of his extraordinary skill as a collector was his

                                     xli
detection in 1863 in a small rock-pool, no larger than a wash-hand
basin, on Bray Head, of the beautiful Volvocinacea, Stephanosphirra
pluvialis, Cohn, then only known from six isolated localities ranging
from Scotland to Austria.      He described for the first time an
amoeboid state of the constituent cells.
   When the writer of this notice went to reside in Ireland in 1870,
the parting advice of a friend was to seek out and make the acquaint
ance of Archer.    Under his guidance the treasures were revealed of
a field                 fascinating as it was novel. Nothing can
                of nature   as
be imagined more entrancing than the work under Archer's guid
ance of examining with the microscope the results of a day's
gatherings.
   In the course of the long period which Archer devoted to their
study he acquired a knowledge of the minute fresh-water organisms
of Ireland which was certainly unequalled amongst British naturalists,
and perhaps not surpassed for any other country.        But he did not
content  himself with the mere identification and cataloguing of forms.
He was constantly observant of their biological significance, and to
follow the work of others in this respect, he made himself acquainted
with the principal European, and especially Scandinavian languages.
The chief of his detailed observations were communicated to the
Dublin Microscopical Club, and are to be found in its minutes, which
                                  '
from 1864 were published in the Quarterly Journal of Microscopical
Science.'
   More extended studies were given in a series of separate papers
published in various scientific journals. Of these the titles of fifty-
                                                    '
nine are contained in the Royal Society's             Catalogue.'   He was
fastidious in recording anything which he had not worked out to his
complete satisfaction, and much of the results of his laborious re
search is doubtless lost. His most considerable             contribution to
algology is the revision of the Desmidere in the second edition of
                '
Pritchard's Infusoria.'
   It      however, probably to his work amongst the Protozoa that
          is,
Archer     will   owe his ultimate place in science. It was his good
fortune to discover in 1868 Chlamydomyxa labyrinthuloides, one of the
most remarkable and enigmatical of all known microscopic organ
isms. In 1867 Cienkowski had described, from the harbour of Odessa,
Labyrinthula, the only other with which Chlamydomyxa can be com
pared.     The two together form Lankester's class Labyrinthulidea       ;
 but, though both produce        protoplasmic network, Chlamydomyxa,
                                 a
nnlike Labyrinthula, possesses a laminated cellulose shell, within
 which    itis most usually found inclosed.    As Lankester points out, it
 has obvious affinities with the Mycetozoa, but its ultimate place in
 classification      a problem which still awaits the result of further in
                     is
 vestigation.      Archer's admirable research, the result of many years

                                       xlii
 observation, was, owing to his peculiar modesty, not extracted from
 him without reluctance ; but it immediately procured his election
 into the Royal Society.        It had been preceded, on its publication in
 1875, by other papers scarcely less important, in which he established
 the Chlamy dophora, a new order of Heliozoa, and described many other
 new genera, of which Rhaphidiophrys is one of the most remarkable.
 He trained himself to be an admirable draughtsman, and the beauti
 ful illustrations to his papers fall somewhat short of the delicacy of
 the original drawings.
    Archer was always a man of small means, and the necessary occu
 pations of his earlier life were never very congenial to him. In 1872
 the Marquis of Ripon, then Lord President of the Council, entirely
 unsolicited,   offered Archer, who was personally unknown to him, the
 Professorship of Botany in the Royal College of Science for Ireland.
 Archer, with characteristic conscientiousness, shrank from the respon
sibilities of a teaching chair.      Four years later his friends were more
successful in getting him appointed Librarian of the New National
 Library, a post for which his careful and business habits admirably
fitted him.       He threw himself into the work of organising the
library    with  characteristic  determination, and no doubt impaired the
strength of a constitution which was never robust.            Unfortunately
his duties largely withdrew him from scientific work. He retired on
a pension in 1895, and died August 14 of the present year.               He
never married.
    Apart from the scientific enthusiasm which dominated his charac
ter, Archer had a singular charm of manner.         A gentleness and refine
ment    of disposition, almost   feminine,  made  him  impossible to quarrel
with, and he was one of those fortunate people who go through life
without making an enemy. There was no want of robustness, how
ever, about his scientific insight; but a quaint sense of humour
would always parry a contentious criticism. A few words may be
quoted from the notice by his friend, Mr. Frazer, in the October
number of tho 'Irish Naturalist' as to the regard with which he
                                      "
was held as a public servant : — He was, as head of a great library,
eminently successful in discharging his duties, and securing the
esteem of his subordinates and of the public at large ; those especially
who profited by his assistance in forwarding their literary researches
will gratefully acknowledge their indebtedness to his patient and
untiring desires to meet their wishes and advance their interests.'*
   Archer filled the oflBce of Secretary for Foreign Correspondence to
the Royal Irish Academy from 1875 to 1880, and in 1879 was the
recipient of its Cunningham Gold Medal.
                                                             W. T. T. D.

      Louis Pasteup, was born at Dole, on the 27th of December, 1822,
  but his childhood was passed in Arbois, whither his family removed
  when he was an infant of two years old. His parents were in humble
  circumstances, his father being a hard-working tanner; that he was,
  however, a man of character and stern experience is shown by the
  fact that he had not only fought in the legions of the First Empire,
  but had been decorated; on the field of battle by Napoleon, and bore
  the title of Chevalier de la Legion d'ETonneur.
      The home at Arbois appears to have been one of those establish
  ments which revolve round the children, and the greatest sacrifices
  were made by the parents to secure the best educational advantages
  for the son. Pasteur, as a boy, however, showed but little inclina
  tion to work at books, preferring to play the truant and spend his
  time in following his favourite pastime of fishing or sketching
  portraits of his companions and neighbours.      As he, however, grew
  older and began to realise the strain upon the resources of his
  parents which his education entailed, he, with that energy and de
  termination which characterised all his actions throughout life, put
  away his fishing tackle and locked up his cherished pastels so as to
  place himself out of the reach of temptation and set to work. From
  that day onwards Pasteur may be said to have hardly ever paused in
  the pursuit of those Herculean labours which his genius throughout
  his life supplied in such rapid succession for his indomitable energy
  to perform.
      The college at Arbois having no chair of philosophy, Pasteur
.^went to Besancon, where ho graduated Bachelier es Lettres, and
   was appointed " maitro repetiteur," in the College.
      Pasteur's interest in chemical science had already commenced at
   this time, and his eagerness to acquire knowledge resulted in his
  overwhelming his teachers with questions, and we are told how one
  of these, the venerable Professor Darlay, was so embarrassed by his
  eager inquiries that he was reduced to telling young Pasteur that it
  was for him to interrogate his pupils, and not for them to catechise
  him before all his scholars ! Pasteur, however, was not to be dis
   couraged by treatment of this kind, and he went for private assistance
   in his studies to a pharmacist who enjoyed considerable local reputa
   tion through being the author of a paper which had been considered
                                  '
   worthy of publication in the Annates de Chimie et de Physique.'
      His old schoolmaster, at Arbois, had often urged upon Pasteur
   "
     pensez a la grande Ecole Normale," and perhaps this encouragement
   led him to present himself for the entrance examination        at this
   Institution.   He obtained the fourteenth place, a position which so
   dissatisfied him that he withdrew, and going up again later on,
   in October, 1843, he was rewarded for his energy and perseverance by-
   being placed fourth in order of merit.

      As a student at the Ecole Normale, Pasteur enjoyed the privilege
  of attending the lectures both of Balard, at the Ecole Normale, and
  of Dumas, at the Sorbonne.        His energy was boundless, not even on
  Sundays did he rest from his chemical studies, and on one of these
  days of rest he actually succeeded in accomplishing the remarkable
  feat of preparing no less than 60 grams of phosphorus from bones,
  the operation lasting from four in the morning to nine o'clock at
 night.
      But although Pasleur owed so much to each of those great masters
  o!: chemical science, Balard and Dumas, it was a junior man, M. Dela-
  fosse, who really directed the course which his researches should
  take.    A former pupil and assistant of the renowned Haiiy, M.
  Dclafosse turned his pupil's attention to the study of crystals and to
  problems of molecular physics, in which domain Pasteur's first laurels
  were subsequently     won.
      On completing    his curriculum at the ficole Normale, Pasteur was
 retained as assistant by Balard, and having now the opportunity of
 carrying on research he determined to perfect himself in crystal
 lography, and set to work to repeat a very complete investigation
 made by M. de la Provostaye, on the crystalline form of the tartrates.
 It was soon evident, however, that mere repetition and confirmation
 were not Pasteur's strong points, for although a comparative novice
 at the kind of work in question, he was able to see what had escaped
  the observation of his skilled predecessor in this field.        Thus, both
 on the crystals of tartaric acid itself, as well as on those of its salts,
 he at once found small facets which had not hitherto been described.
      The presence of such facets on quartz crystals had not escaped the
 attention of Haiiy, who indeed had further divided such quartz
 crystals into left and right-handed quartz, according to the side on
 which these facets were developed. Biot, again, in his extended in
 vestigations on polarisation,       had found that some specimens of
 quartz turn the plane of polarisation to the right and some to the
 left, whilst Sir John Herschel, in 1820, suggested that the two
 phenomena were connected, and that the left-handed quartz crystal
 rotated the plane of polarisation in one direction, the right-handed
in the other. Experiments showed that this was actually the case.
 These remarkable relations appear to have made a profound impres
 sion on young Pasteur, and so deeply imbued was he with the idea
that polarimetric effect must be associated with crystalline form,
that the appearance of these hemihedral faces (as these facets are
technically called) seemed to him of the very highest importance,
and to deserve the most careful study.           To this end he prepared no
less than nineteen different      tartrates,  and found that all exhibited
hemihedral      faces.    Pursuing his minute examinations           of these
crystals,   he found   that  whilst  the   crystals  of the inactive  tartaric

                                      xlv
 acid ¦which were destitute of these little surfaces were symmetrical,
the crystals of the optically active tartaric acid were unsymmetrical,
or dissymmetric, as he called it. Now, to the symmetric character of
the crystals of the one tartaric acid, generally known as paratartaric
 or racemic acid, he attributed the inactivity of this tartaric acid to
 polarised light ; whilst with the dissymmetric character of the crys
tals of the other tartaric acid he connected its action on the polarised
beam. In studying these apparently trifling details, Pasteur found
that by crystallising the inactive tartaric acid in a particular way,
by preparing the sodium ammonium salt and crystallising this, be
obtained .two different kinds of crystals — the one set being identical
with those of the active tartaric acid already known, whilst the other
set were the   mirror images of these and had never been seen by the
eye of man before.       The young philosopher at once drew the con
clusion that if the dissymmetry of the known tartaric acid cansed it
to tnrn the plane of polarisation to the right, the dissymmetry of
this new tartaric acid should turn it to the left.
   With infinite pains Pasteur picked out from the mixture the
individual crystals belonging to each of the two types, and arranged
them in two heaps.          Each of these heaps of crystals was then
separately dissolved in water, and the two solutions submitted to
polarised light.      In accordance with his anticipation, whilst the
solution  of  the   crystals of the known form was found to turn the
plane of polarisation to the right, the solution of the new crystals,
the mirror images of the old, was found to tarn the plane through
precisely the same angle to the left.
   Of such moment did this discovery appear to Pasteur that, rush
ing from the laboratory in a fever of excitement, and meeting M.
Bertrand in the corridor he embraced him, exclaiming, overcome
with emotion :
                   " Je viens de faire une grande decouverte ;" and such
indeed it was ; but it is related how, whilst producing a great sensa
tion in scientific circles, it was received with no little scepticism by the
Academy of Sciences who instructed Biot to report upon it. Pasteur
has himself described the sceptical and almost suspicious attitude
adopted by this great investigator towards the work of this enthu
siastic  novice   in the regions of scientific research, and how, as step
by step Biot verified        the accuracy of Pasteur's observations, he
became more and more excited until, finally, when he found that the
solution of the new crystals, as Pasteur had affirmed, exhibited a
strong lfflvo-rotation     in the polarimeter, he seized him by the hand,
exclaiming with visible emotion, " Mon enfant, j'ai taut aime' les
sciences dans ma vie que cela me fait battre le coeur."
   Pasteur proceeded to point out that the differences in optical pro
perties and in crystalline form exhibited by these two oppositely
active tartaric acids were doubtless dependent on the two molecules

                                     xlvi
  having   a  different arrangement of their constituent atoms, the
  arrangement in each case being dissymmetric,      and clearly indicated
  that whatever the dissymmetry of the one tartaric acid might consist
 in, it must be related to the dissymmetry of the other tartaric acid
 in the same sort of way as the dissymmetry of the left hand is
  related to the dissymmetry of the right hand.        At the time, how-
  over, organic chemistry was not sufficiently advanced to make any
  immediate use of these speculations, but the philosophical reflections
  in which he indulges show how, so long ago, he had completely fore
  shadowed and grasped the scope of that important branch of chemical
  science now known as Stereochemistry.
     But if we are impressed with the sagacity and suggestiveness of
  Pasteur's theoretical speculations, we are filled with even still greater
 admiration on again turning to his experimental work. The field of
 investigation which he exposed to view by his discovery of the rela
 tionship between the racemic and tartaric acids appears as limitless
 ns the prairie which is bounded only by the horizon, and nothing can
 testify more eloquently to the experimental genius of Pasteur than
 the circumstance that already during the comparatively short period
 of time in which he himself was pursuing its cultivation, he suc
 ceeded in determining the exact methods by means of which it can
 be exploited.    No new methods have been devised, no substantial
 modifications or improvements have been introduced, although many
 hands of divers nationalities have since been busily engaged in til
 ling the estate which he himself was constrained to abandon now
nearly thirty years ago.
    Pasteur's academic career was now assured, and the close of the
year 1848 finds him Professor of Physics at the Lycee of Dijon,
whilst three months after his installation there he was nominated
Deputy Professor of Chemistry at the University of Strassburg,
 becoming full professor in 1852.       His removal to Strassburg had
another significance, quite apart     from  the greater scope which it
afforded him for carrying on his scientific work, for here he met his
future wife, the daughter of M. Laurent, Rector of the Strassburg
Academy.      Their mamage, which took place in 18G0, was a singu
larly happy one, for Madame Pasteur, as Dr. Roux has said, became
not only "une compagne incomparable," but Pasteur's "meilleur
collaborateur."
    During tho five years he resided in Alsace, Pasteur devoted him
self almost exclusively to the systematic investigation of asymmetric
compounds.      Associated  with this period of his life we find those
important and now classical researches on the conversion of right-
handed tartaric acid into iuactive tartaric acid (racemic acid) on the
one hand, and into a new form of inactive tartaric acid (mesotartarie
acid) on the other, his discovery of the method of splitting np

                                   xlvii
 t-acemic acid into its component dextro- and lsevo-tartaric acids by
 means of optically active bases, and his famous refntation of Des
saignes' reputed conversion of fumaric and maleic acids into aspartic
acid, identical 'with that hitherto only obtained from asparagine.
    Pasteur had himself studied these various bodies before the publi
cation of Dessaignes' memoir, and he had found that whilst fumaric
and maleic acids were not dissymmetric and were destitute of all
optical activity, aspartic acid, on the other hand, like asparagine,
 from which   it is derived, was endowed with molecular dissymmetry,
und was active towards polarised    light.
    If Dessaignes' facts were correct,   they would mean that he had
accomplished what Pasteur firmly believed to be impossible — the
preparation by artificial chemical means of an optically active mole
cule from an inactive one.      Pasteur, with his usual restless energy,
determined at once to set this doubt at rest, and hurrying to
Vend6me he obtained from Dessaignes a specimen of his artificial
aspartic acid. On returning to his laboratory, Pasteur examined it
with the minutest care, and found that, in spite of its great resem
blance to the acid derived from asparagine, it differed in a very im
portant particular, inasmuch as it was entirely devoid of the action
on polarised light which characterised       the former, and he had no
difficulty in showing that Dessaignes' acid was not identical with the
natural aspartic acid, but only its inactive isomeride.
    So far Pasteur had kept strictly to the domain of pure chemistry
and molecular physics, and his attention was entirely absorbed by
problems which, while of profound theoretical interest, gave no
indication of the direction which his future labours would take,
and to the pursuit of which his whole life was subsequently to be
devoted.
    It was an incident, trifling in itself, which first suggested to
Pasteur the application of fermentation processes to the study of
chemical substances.      His attention having been called to a chance
observation made by a German firm of manufacturing chemists, that
solutions of impure commercial tartrate of lime fermented when left
in warm weather in contact with organic matters, ho determined at
once to utilise this fact and induce, if possible, fermentation     in a
solution of ordinary right-handed tartaric acid.        Dissolving a salt
of this acid, he added to the solution a small quantity of albumen
with the result that fermentation ensued and the liquid, originally
clear, became gradually turbid, a phenomenon which Pasteur found
was due to the presence of small living cells, upon which he subse
quently showed the process of fermentation        to be dependent.  This
method he also applied to solutions of the paratartrate (racemate)
with the same results.      On examining the solutions, after fermenta
tion, with the polarimeter, the most profound difference was found

                                    xlviii
to exist between them. In the case of the paratartrate (racemate),
the liquid, originally inactive, exhibited, as the fermentation pro
ceeded, a gradually stronger and stronger deviation of the plane of
polarisation to the left until the maximum was reached and the
fermentation ceased.       It was then found that during the process of
fermentation the right-handed acid had been consumed, leaving the
left-handed acid alone master of the field ; and thus, freed from the
constraining influence of its right-handed brother, was able to assert
itself and exhibit, for the first time, its left-handed rotatory power.
Thus whilst right-handed and left-handed tartaric acids are chemi
cally identical, and are distinguishable only.by their crystalline form
and opposite action on polarised light, they are, nevertheless, utterly
 different from a physiological point of view ; for the right-handed
 tartaric acid is alone taken up and transformed by the fermentative
 bacteria which refuse to have anything to do with the left-handed
 tartaric acid. Thus the apparently trivial difference in the arrange
 ment of the atoms in space in the case of these tvyo tartaric acids
 makes an overwhelming difference in their physiological character.
 A    couple of years later, in 1856, the Royal Society conferred the
 Bumford Medal on Pasteur " for his discovery of the nature of race-
 mic acid and its relations to polarised light."
     A new chapter in Pasteur's life opens with the year 1854, when, at
 the age of 32, he was nominated the first Dean of the Faculty of
  Sciences which had just been created at Lille.        In this capacity, at
 ODce realising that the work of his department           should, to some
  extent,   be  brought into touch with one of   the leading industries of
 the district   —  the manufacture of alcohol from beetroot and grain — he
  offered courses of lectures on fermentation, and with his character
  istic energy threw himself into the serious study of his subject.
      It is impossible here to pass even in the briefest review the history
  of the progress made in the knowledge of fermentation before the
  subject was attacked by Pasteur; suffice it to say that at this time
  fermentation processes were not generally regarded as vital pheno
  mena at all. The dominant opinion concerning them was that enun
  ciated by Liebig, who viewed the classical transformation of sugar
  into alcohol as a purely chemical process, depending not on the living
  yeast cells which the microscope had revealed, but on the dead yeast
  undergoing post-mortem decomposition :
      " Beer
               yeast, and in general all animal and vegetable matters in
   putrefaction, impart to other bodies the state of decomposition in
   which they are themselves. The movement, which by the disturbed
   equilibrium is impressed on their own elements, is communicated
   also to the elements of bodies in contact with them."
      Pasteur had been indirectly brought in contact with fermentation
   phenomena in the course of his researches on asymmetry, for amongst

                                     xlix
the optically active compounds known at the time was the amyl
alcohol, which is obtained as a by-product in a number of fermenta
tions. In 1857 he brought before the scientific world the result of
his researches on the lactic fermentation, the first of that series of
masterly investigations which he was to pursue during the next
twenty years. In 1860 this was followed by a paper on the alcoholic
fermentation.
     In  the lactic fermentation,   Pasteur noticed  that a greyish  solid
material was deposited, and that the quantity of this increased during
the process.      On examining some of this substance under the micro
 scope, he found that it consisted of very minute corpuscles, quite
 different from the yeast cells observed in the alcoholic fermentation,
 but which he felt convinced must be of analogous nature.        Taking a
 trace of this grey material, he introduced it into an artificial solu
 tion of sugar, to which he had added some decoction of yeast and
 chalk, and soon he had the intense satisfaction of witnessing the lactic
 fermentation in full activity in this liquid. From this fermenting
 liquid he transferred again a minute trace into another similar solu
 tion of sugar, and so on, invariably obtaining the same fermentation,
 invariably finding also the same corpuscles in the deposit.
      In order to meet the objection which he conceived might be raised
 by Liebig and his supporters that the fermentative change in the
 sugar was due to the decomposition of the albuminoids present in the
  decoction of yeast employed, Pasteur replaced the albuminoids in his
 fermentations by ammonium salts. In these solutions of pure sugar,
  with nothing but mineral additions, he demonstrated that the yeast
  grew and multiplied, and that its growth was accompanied by the
  conversion of the sugar into alcohol and carbonic anhydride, whilst
  similarly those totally distinct living corpuscles, to which be gave the
  name of levure lactique, proliferated in solutions of the same com
  position, and their multiplication was accompanied by the trans
  formation of the sugar into lactic acid.
      The amount of new experimental material collected by Pasteur in
  support of this vitalistic as opposed to the time-honoured      chemical
  theory of fermentation is enormous, whilst his extraordinary power
  of seeing what others had failed to observe before him is again
  exemplified in his discovery of succiuic acid and glycerine as invari
  able products of the alcoholic fermentation of sugar.
       These researches, besides being of fundamental       importance in
   throwing light upon one of the oldest, but hitherto obscurest, depart
   ments of scientific investigation, opened up an entirely new field of
   work, for with the inauguration by Pasteur of artificial culture solu
   tions, that path was first indicated which has gradually expanded
   into the fascinating science of Bacteriology.
       Whilst busily immersed in his researches on fermentation at Lille,

                                      1
 Pasteur received the intelligence, in October, 1857, that be had been
 appointed Director of Scientific Studies at the ficole Normale in
 Paris. Thero being no scientific laboratory attached to the post,
 Pasteur, unable to obtain any funds from the Government for such a
 purpose, improvised one out of a garret in the building and equipped
 it out of his own purse. Here he pursued with unabated energy the
 investigations which his removal from Lille had temporarily inter
 rupted, and it was in the course of his further researches on fer
 mentation that he made a discovery which, in respect of its wide and
 fundamental significance in relation to the economy of nature, is per
 haps without an equal amongst his numerous and great achievements.
 This important discovery revealed the existence of living forms
 which grow, multiply, and develop mechanical energy in the absence
 of that oxygen which it had hitherto been regarded as one of the
 most far-reaching discoveries to have shown was indispensable for the
 whole living creation.
    This new condition of existence, which he found pertained to the
 butyric ferment, Pasteur called anaerobic, as opposed to aerobic life,
 in which oxygen is essential to the continuance of life. This revo
lutionary discovery raised a perfect storm of opposition, and Pasteur's
attitude to his opponents is well exemplified by the following words
of his own : — " Whether the progress of science- makes of this vibrio
a plant or an animal it matters little, but it is a living thing, endowed
with movement, which lives without air, and is a ferment."
    This anaerobic life of the butyric ferment was not allowed to remain
 an isolated observation without bearing on other facts; but, on. the
contrary, its relationship to other known facts was at once discerned
by Pasteur, who already in the same year, 1861, makes another com
munication to the Academy of Sciences, in which he develops in out
line that celebrated theory of feraientation which has served to stimu
late so many valuable researches.
    Pasteur in his investigation of fermentative phenomena had thus
by the yoar 1861 shown, firstly, the worthlessness of the form of
words by means of which Liebig and the chemists of the time sought
to banish all biological considerations from the study of these ques
tions.    Secondly, he had worked out a method of scientifically
attacking    these problems, in which, for the first time, both the chemi-
c.il and biological aspects of the subject received their due share
of attention.     Thirdly and finally, by the systematic use of this new
method of investigating fermentation phenomena, ho had discovered
the possibility of life without air, and had collected sufficient experi
mental data to venture on a new theory of fermentation.
   The further researches which the new theory of fermentation
stimulated were deferred for some years in consequence of his atten
tion being directed to certain phenomena closely related to fermenta

                                      ti
tion, and indeed demanding        a     fall and final explanation    before
 satisfactory progress could be made in this direction.
     The researches to which we find Pasteur next devoting himself
 •were directed to the settlement of the much vexed question — Can
 life originate spontaneously   ? It     is impossible here to describe the
 history of this momentous controversy, but so unsatisfactory was the
 state of scientific opinion on this question in 1860 that the Academy
 •of Sciences gave as a subject for a prize competition :
                                                              " Essayer, par
 des experiences bien faites, de jeter un jour nouvean sur la question
 des generations spontanees."       It is at this moment that Pasteur
 enters the lists, and the circumstance that we have for more thau
  twenty years heard nothing of the doctrine of spontaneous genera
 tion is due to the effectual manner in which he successively hurled
 into the dast the several champions who appeared on its behalf in the
 intellectual tournament which followed.
     Iu looking back upon this period of Pasteur's career, one is dis
 posed to regret that his great powers should have been so long absorbed
 in this work of exterminating a mere superstition, but, as a matter of
 fact, much good came of this crusade in a number of ways. Inci
 dentally, experiments, which have now become classical, were made
 on the distribution of micro-organisms in our surroundings such as
 air and water, whilst healthy urine and the blood of normal animals
 were, in 1862 and 1863, shown to be free from microbes and capable
 of being preserved without alteration for an indefinite period of
 time, provided they were collected with suitable precautions.          Van
 der Broeck had, indeed, already, in 1857 and 1858, proved that
 grape-juice, white and yolk of egg, gall, urine, and arterial blood, if
suitably collected, could be preserved without change in their
natural condition, whilst subsequently sterile milk in its natural
condition was obtained direct from the udder by Lister, Cheyne,
Meissner, and others. The spontaneous generation controversy was,
moreover, highly fertilo in developing the general methods of bacte
riological research, and many of the most familiar operations em
ployed in the study of micro-organisms date from this period.
    It is almost needless to say that the prize offered for researches
throwing light on the question of spontaneous generation was
awarded to Pasteur, and in 1862, at the age of forty, he was elected
a member of the Academy of Sciences.
    Pasteur now returned to his fermentation studies, and about this
time we find him delivering an address to the vinegar manufacturers
of Orleans, an address which has since become famous by reason of
the important revelations which it contained concerning the pro
duction of vinegar by new methods.            He had Rhown that the con
version of    wine   into vinegar   is    the work of a minute rod-like
organism, which he called Mycoderma aceti, and he was now able to

                                          lii
point out to these manufacturers that instead of waiting the cus
tomary two or three months for the completion of the process, the
vinegar could be elaborated in from eight to ten days by simply
exposing the vats containing the mixture of wine and vinegar to               a
temperature of from 20 to 25° C, and sowing on the surface a small
quantity of this organism. As in the case of the alcoholic fermenta
tion, so in that of the vinegar or acetic fermentation, Pasteur was
neither the first to discover the process, nor the first to see the living
ferment, nor yet even the first to connect the process with the life of
the micro-organism.       The chemical change involved and the part
played by oxygen in the souring of wine were already indicated
Lavoisier the process was ascribed to catalysis, or contact action            by by
            ;
Berzelius in 1S29. The familiar skin which forms on the surface of
the acetifying liquid was already named mycoderma by Persoon in
 1822, and the bacterial cells of which this pellicle      composed were
                                                             is
 seen and actually described under the name of Utvina aeeti                   by
 Kiitzing in 1837, who even suspected connexion between the life of
                                                    a
 the organisms and the vinegar process,
    But it   ishere that Pasteur stands out in such bold relief from so
 many other distinguished savants of the century, for by building up
 his discoveries on a solid rock of scientific experiment they have with
 stood those " whips and scorns of time
                                            "
                                              which have often succeeded
 in demolishing the less successfully raised structures of his pre
decessors.
   In perusing the terse summaries in which Pasteur records his
labours on the acetic fermentation in the  Comptes Rendus,' the
                                                         '
breadth and scope of the view which he takes of the phenomena
before him at once impress the reader, whilst the alertness of his
mind to developments, which even now are only partially realised,             is
not   less remarkable.
   In placing the vinegar process on a sound scientific basis, Pasteur
had obviously already broached the subject of the "maladies des
vins," for that the souring of wine     one of the most wide-spread
                                                    is
ills to which     it
                  subject,
                       is   surely well known to all possessing even
                                   is
 the most modest of cellars.   What more natural, therefore, than
 that Pasteur should conceive that those other and more mysterious
 deteriorations which wines so frequently undergo, might receive                a
 rational explanation by the application of the same methods which
 had elucidated the vinegar process    Nor were these methods found
                                                ?
 wanting in dealing with the diseases of wine, for whilst in healthy
 or normal wines            Pasteur found only yeast cells, in all those   wines
 which connoisseurs condemned as diseased he found other micro
 organisms as well, and the nature of these micro-organisms was
 found to vary according to the complaint with which the wine was
 charged.       Although       a number of different bacteria     connected with

                                    liii
these several     maladies   of wine    were  described and figured by
Pasteur, it must not be supposed that the mechanism of these pro
 cesses was investigated with anything like the completeness of the
acetification process. A large amount of work still remains to bo
done in connexion with these more obscure difficulties which attend
the production of soured wine, but to Pasteur is due the broad
explanation of these phenomena as dependent upon the presence of
foreign organisms, and the further elucidation of the subject is
chiefly a matter of laborious detail.
    Pasteur, however, did not rest content with having discovered
the cause of the deterioration of wine ; he at once set to work to
tind out a means for its prevention, and in the first instance he
sought to suppress the mischievous vitality of the micro-organisms
present in wine by the addition of antiseptics.        These experiments
were not, however, satisfactory, and he, therefore, had recourse to
heating the wine, and in this manner effecting the destruction of, or
ensuring the paralysis of, the micro-organisms which produced the
undesirable changes in its quality. This heating or partial sterilisa
tion of a liquid — for the temperature employed was far below boiling,
and was only designed to paralyse the activity of the micro
organisms present and not necessarily to destroy them — was first
                                                        "
applied by Pasteur, and is now generally known as pasteurisation."
It has of late been largely and successfully employed in connexion
with wine, beer, milk, cream, and other food materials of a perishable
nature.
    Pasteur's fermentation studies were, however, interrupted by an
incidental investigation into which he was, so to speak, forced by his
superiors, but which proved an admirable preparatory school for
those great labours on micro-organisms and disease which have
 rendered    his name a household word throughout the civilised
 world.
    In 1865 the silkworm culture, which forms such an important
 industry in the south of France, was threatened with ruin in conse
 quence of a most disastrous disease having made its appearance
 amongst the worms.        A commission of inquiry was appointed, of
 which Dumas was made chairman, and he at once turned to Pasteur
 for assistance, requesting him to undertake the scientific investiga
 tion of the scourge which had wrought such misery amongst silk
 worm proprietors, reducing a successful and wealthy industry to the
  verge of destruction.    Pasteur was very loath to leave his researches
  on fermentation and urged his entire ignorance of the subject, but
 Dumas would not listen to any plea as to his incapacity to undertake
 the work.      " Tant mieux," he replied to Pasteur, "vous n'aurez
 d'idees que celles qui vous viendront de vos propres observations."
     During five years Pasteur was unceasingly engaged in studying

                                      liv
   the diseases of silk-worms, for he found that   it was not only pebrine
   which decimated the silk-worm litters:, but that another and totally
  distinct disease, flacherie, was also responsible for an enormous
   mortality amongst the worms.         For five years then Pastenr was
  absorbed in unravelling these two diseases, and in discovering the
   best means for their prevention, and the vast amount of work which
   he accomplished in this connexion can only be approximately esti
   mated by studying the two splendid volumes entitled ' Maladie des
  Vers a Soie,' published in 1870.
      The opposition, the criticism, and the relentless scepticism with
  which the researches on silk-worm diseases and their prevention
  wore received at the time, in a measure foreshadowed the bitterness
  of the conflict in which he was subsequently to become engaged in
  defending his investigations on the treatment of rabies.
      The mental strain of bis work told heavily upon Pasteur, and
  before he had been able to put the last and finishing touches, as it
 were, to his investigations, he was struck down with a severe attack
 of paralysis, from which his recovery was at first despaired of.
  Throughout his illness, however, his mind remained perfectly clear,
 but he never subsequently recovered the full use of his limbs.
      The war of 1870 plunged him into deep despair, for Pasteur was
 perhaps an even more ardent patriot than savant, and for a time he
 seemed completely crushed, and unable to take up the thread of his
 researches.     Prevented from returning to Paris on account of the
 Commune, ho gladly availed himself of the offer of his old pupil,
 Duclaux, to come and work in his laboratory at Clermont Ferrand.
 Here he commenced those classical researches on the diseases of beer,
 which had for their object such an illumination of tho brewing
industry as would enable France to produce malt liquors of equal
value and excellence to thoso for which her hereditary enemy across
the Rhine had so long been pre-eminent.         These researches were in
 187(3 collected    and printed in a single volume, bearing the title
 '
    F.tudes sur la Biere,' which is unquestionably the best known of all
Pasteur"s publications in this country, and which has been translated
into English.      Throughout this volume Pasteur shows unmistakable
signs that his thoughts and ideas were beariug in the direction of the
applications which his methods and discoveries might have in the
interpretation and treatment of the phenomena of disease.        We find
him making the significant suggestion that " l'etiologie des maladies
contagieuses est peut-etre a la veille d'en recevoir une lumiere inat-
tendue."      Indeed, his researches had already borne fruit in many of
the directions indicated by the above words, for Kayer and Davaine
were encouraged to once more approach the investigation of anthrax,
whilst we know that as early as 1865 Lister, then a surgeon in Glas
gow, began his work in antiseptic surgery, based entirety on Pasteur's

                                    Iv
¦brilliant researches,  -which demonstrated the truth of the germ
theory of putrefaction.
   Pasteur followed with the closest attention and deepest interest
the developments of his ideas at the hands of the medical world, but
hesitated himself to undertake the responsibility of their application
to the study of infective diseases.
                                       " I am neither doctor nor veterin
ary surgeon," he declares with modest diffidence.         He was, how
ever, in reality equipped as no man before had ever been, not only
 with the necessary experience and training accumulated during
many years of devotion to original research, but also with the
scientific machinery necessary for the successful conduct of such
investigations, having brought his technique and methods to a pitch
of refinement and perfection which had never been equalled before.
   Although fifty-five years of age, it is perhaps not surprising then
to find Pasteur ultimately devoting himself with all the enthusiasm
of youth to the study of pathological phenomena, the first subject
which attracted his attention being the well known infectious cattle
disease called anthrax.
    We cannot here enter into the details of the history of this investi
gation, but suffice it to say that the work of Rayer and Davaine, of
Pollender, of Delafond, of Koch, brilliant as the researches of these
investigators had been, had not succeeded in convincing the medical
and scientific world that the virus of anthrax was identical with the
so-called rodlets seen by Davaine in anthrax infected blood, and that
                          " the
these rodlets, and not          globules and plasma side by side with
them," constituted the real agents of the disease. The incontestable
proof of the truth of this new doctrine was left for Pasteur to furnish,
and we know that he succeeded in removing all doubt on the question
of the etiology of anthrax once and for all. But more than this, in con
 junction with his assistants, Jouberfc and Chamberland, he discovered
another pathogenic micro-organism, the bacillus of malignant oedema,
an organism giving rise to a deadly septicaemia, which in its anaerobic
mode of life much resembles the butyric ferment which Pasteur had
 so successfully studied in 1861.
   Having thus turned his attention to pathological researches,
 Pasteur cast about him in all directions to obtain material, even
 walking the hospitals and heroically overcoming his instinctivo
antipathy to the sight of suffering and distress.     But the occupation
of discovering pathogenic bacteria could not permanently engross
 Pasteur's attention, and his mind's eye had long been riveted on that
great achievement of Jenner's which towers in royal isolation above
 the plains of the medical history of centuries.
    " II faut immuniser contre les maladies infectieuses dont nous
 cultivons les virus," was Pasteur's constant cry to his assistants at
 this time. Haunted by this idea, Dr. Roux tells us how, during the

                                       Ivi
  busy period which preceded the discovery of the attenuation of
  viruses, numbers of impossible experiments were gravely discussed
  amongst them, to be only laughed over the following day.
     Tet another living virus must, however, be mentioned, which
  Pasteur successfully   identified  in these earliest days of his patho
  logical res?arcbes, this was the specific agent of fowl cholera, the
  bacillus Cholerm gallinarum.
     True it is that Perducito, in 1878, and Toussaint in the following
  year, had discovered and described the presence of this particular
  micro-organism in the blood of birds afflicted with this malady, but
  Pasteur was able to carry these observations a great and important
  stop farther, for he succeeded in separating out this bacillus, and in
 cultivating it outside the animal's body, and in artificially inducing
  the disease in other fowls by the inoculation of such cultures.
  Interesting and important as was this achievement, it was destined
 to become of yet greater significance, for it was in the study of these
  fowl cholera organisms that Pasteur made that epoch-making dis
  covery of the attenuation of virus and the artificial production of
 immunity.
     On returning to his laboratory from a holiday which had inter
  rupted his researches on fowl cholera, Pasteur, to his dismay, found
 all his cultivations of the microbes of this disease either dead or
 nearly so, and that many of the animals which he inoculated with
 these exhausted cultures appeared to suffer no ill effects whatever, a
 condition which contrasted painfully , from the experimenter's point of
 view, with the unerring fatal termination which had accompanied
 such inoculations before the vacation.        Having at length succeeded
 in obtaining a virulent culture, the idea occurred to Pasteur of re-
 inoculating the birds which had survived the previous treatment
 with the exhausted cultures. What was his astonishment on seeinc
 that these birds resisted the attack of the virulent organisms which
 proved rapidly fatal to those which had undergone no previous in
oculation with the exhausted cultures.         Convinced that this was no
chance    circumstance,   but   that  he   was  here face to face with an
entirely new phenomenon, Pasteur repeated the experiment in
various ways, and found that he had indeed realised his great
ambition of " immunising against an infectious disease, of which
they cultivated the virus," and the microbe, which had hitherto
only proved a malignant foe, was constrained to become the bene
ficent protector of its prey.
    Numerous investigations were now made to determine upon what
factors this conversion of the virus into a vaccine depended, and
before long Pasteur was able to announce that the secret lay in
the prolonged action of the air upon the culture at a suitable
temperature.      It was in the following year, 1881, on the occasion

                                            Ivii
uf  the • International       Medical      Congress in London, that Pasteur,
discussing his latest discoveries in the domain of immunity, paid a
graceful tribute to his great predecessor of nearly a century before
in this    direction       " J'ai
                      :              prete   a   l'expression de vaccination une
extension    que la science, je l'espere, consacrera comme un homrnage
an merite et aux immenses services rendus par un des plus grands
homines      de   l'Angleterre, Jenner."               From this time onwards
Pasteur's attention became concentrated upon the artificial production
of  attenuated viruses or vaccines, and he set to work to prepare the
vaccine of anthrax.            The simple method which had proved so
successful in the ease of the fowl cholera virus had, however, to be
modified in that of anthrax, for the bacilli of anthrax, unlike those
of fowl cholera, possess the property- of             producing spores, so that in
stead of exposure       to  the  air   diminishing the virulence of the culture,
it did but serve to afford the bacilli of anthrax an opportunity of
giving ris6 to spores, in which condition the virus is far more per
sistent and far more hardy than in the bacillar form.
   It was necessary, therefore, to produce the anthrax vaccine by
preventing the production of spores and then ageing the cultivations
containing only the bacillar forms.                    This was accomplished by
keeping    the cultures at 42 — 43° C, at which temperature no spores
are formed, and according to the length of time to which the cultures
are  thus exposed more and more attenuated viruses or vaccines of
anthrax are obtained.
   The gain to France from the application of Pasteur's method of
vaccinating animals against anthrax has been estimated by M.
Chamberland at 5,000,000 francs in respect of the lives of sheep
which have been saved, and 2,000.000 francs for horned cattle.
Djring the ten years 1884 to 1894 it is stated that as many as
3,400,000 sheep had been vaccinated with a                 mortality of 1 per cent.,
and 438,000 horned cattle, with a mortality                 of 3 per thousand.
   Pastenr also showed that whilst the bacillus of anthrax can be
rendered artificially less virulent, it can also become artificially en
dowed by suitable treatment with an increased virulence.                        A dis
covery   which    might      at   first  sight   appear    to be of  purely  scientific
interest, but which has in due time been found to possess an
enormous     practical importance.
   Gradnated vaccines were also obtained of the microbe giving rise
to the disease known as Bouget de pore, or swine measles.
   And now we come to Pasteur's last and crowning achievement,
the  prevention     of disease in man— his discovery of             a cure  for rabies
<>rhydrophobia.
   Here    again the limits of space prevent our entering into the
details of this truly heroic struggle of the savant with the secrets of
nature.     During five years, for Pasteur's researches on rabies were

                                   Iviii
commenced already in 1880, and his first memoir on the subject was
not published until the year 1885, during five years the great master
was engaged with his faithful assistants in elaborating and perfect
ing a method for the prevention of rabies in human beings.             The
results of these years of work may be briefly summarised in the
                                         "
following concise words of Roux : — The spinal marrows of rabid
rabbits when exposed to the action of the air, in a dry atmosphere,
become desiccated, and lose their activity.     After fourteen days the
virus is attenuated to such an extent that it is harmless, even in the
largest doses.     A dog receiving this fourteen-days-old marrow, then
on the following day thirteen-days' marrow, then that of twelve
days, and so on up to the fresh spinal cord itself does not take
rabies, but has become immune to it. Inoculated in the eye or in
the brain with the strongest virus it remains well.       In fifteen days,
therefore, it is possible to confer immunity upon an animal from
rabies.    Now, human beings bitten by road dogs do not usually
develop rabies until a month, or even longer, after the bite.         This
time of incubation can be utilised to render the person bitten re"
fractory."
   Still, however, the most difficult, the most perilous task remained
to be accomplished — the application of the knowledge and experience
thus acquired to the prevention of rabies in man.          It was in July,
1885, that this momentous step was taken, and in October of the
same year, Pasteur communicated that celebrated memoir to the
Academy of Sciences in which he described the results of what he
                         "                        A profound impression
modestly designated a tentative heureuse."
was produced by this successful result, and wounded persons soon
streamed in from all parts, and during the following year as many
as 2,682 individuals were treated, each of whom on an average,
received between fifteen and twenty inoculations.          Nearly 20,000
persons have now undergone       Pasteur's  anti-rabic  treatment   at the
Paris Institute, and the mortality has been less than 5 per 1,000.
   This magnificent triumph was not easily secured, and it was
amidst the most determined opposition at home and abroad that
Pasteur had to fight over two years for the public recognition of
this great discovery ; the effect of this strain told terribly upon his
health, and Pasteur was obliged to give up his life in the laboratory,
although he never ceased, down to the very last days of his life, to
take the keenest interest in all the investigations which wer»
being carried out in that great institute which bears his name, and
which is the public expression of gratitude for the magnificent
services to suffering humanity with which his name will for ever
be associated.
   It was in November,     1888, that the Institut Pasteur was opened
with  a  brilliant ceremonial, by the President of the Republic, and

                                         lix
we   have only to glance at the             Annates of the      Institute, to see
how   amply it has since justified          the   great   hopes with    which its
inauguration was accompanied.
   If Pasteur's life was darkened by struggles, it was equally illumi
nated with brilliant victories, which he not only prized on account
of the vindication of the truths for which he fought, and for the love
of science, but also for the lustre which they shed upon his beloved
country.
   " Si la science n'a pas de patrie," has said Pasteur, " l'homme
de science doit en avoir une, et c'est a elle qu'il doit reporter l'in-
fluence que ses travaux peuvent avoir dans le monde."                    It was in
this sense that Pasteur participated with such profound feelings of
emotion and gratitude in the magnificent celebration of bis jubilee
which took place on December 27, 1892, in commemoration                           of
his seventieth birthday.          Dr. Boux has told us how this unique
ceremonial, in which nations forgot politics and joined together
to honour and gratefully           acknowledge        the monumental        labours
of one of the greatest men of science of the century, profoundly
moved Pasteur.
                        " Puis Pasteur ne vecut plus que par l'amour
des siens;      il fallait les soins et toute l'affection dont il etait
entoure pour prolonger sa faiblesse."                It was in the autumn of
 1895 that the news      of  Pasteur's   grave   state  of health gave cause for
universal anxiety, and on the 28th of September he passed away at
Villeneuve-l'fitang, near Garches.              A mausoleum erected by the
 Pasteur family in the Institnt Pasteur affords a last resting place to
the mortal remains of him who
                       " Defender of the living, now shall keep
                         His slumber in the arsenal of life."
    Pasteur has left behind him nearly two hundred notes and me
 moirs inserted     in the ' Annales de Chimie et de Physique,' in the
                                    " Recueil des Savants Etrangers," &c,
   Comptes Rendus,' in the
 '
 besides several works published separately.
    The honours which were showered upon him by numerous foreign
 public and scientific bodies, besides those bestowed upon him by his
 own country, are too many for record here ; mention should, however,
 be made that the Royal Society, which had awarded him the Rum-
 ford Medal in 1856, conferred             upon him the Copley Medal in
  1874, and   in  1869  elected  him   a Foreign    Member of the Society.
