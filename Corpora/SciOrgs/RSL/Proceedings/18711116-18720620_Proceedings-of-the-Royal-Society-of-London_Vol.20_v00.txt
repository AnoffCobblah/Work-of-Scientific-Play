 I. "   Considerations     on the  Abrupt Change at Boiling or Conden
        sing  in reference  to the Continuity of the Fluid State of Matter."
       By Professor James Thomson, LL.D., Queen's College, Belfast.
       Communicated by Dr. Andrews.               Received July 4, 1871.
    When we find a substance capable of existing in two fluid states different
in density and other properties while the temperature and pressure are the
same in both, and when we find also that an introduction          or abstraction
of heat without change of temperature or of pressure will effect the change
from the one state to the other, and also find that the change either way
is perfectly reversible,    we speak  of the  one   state as being an ordinary

gaseous, and the other as being an ordinary liquid state of the same matter;
and the ordinary transition from the one to the other we would designate
by the terms boiling or condensing, or occasionally by other terms nearly
equivalent, such as evaporation, gasification, liquefaction from the gaseous
state, &c.   Cases of gasification from liquids or of condensation from
gases, when any chemical alteration accompanies the abrupt change of
density, are not among the subjects proposed to be brought under consi
deration in the present paper.     In such cases I presume there would be
no perfect reversibility in the process ; and if so, this would of itself be a
criterion sufficing to separate them from the proper cases of boiling or
condensing at present intended to be considered.      If, now, the fluid sub
stance in the rarer of the two states (that     in what       is,

diminution    of pressure, or be changed considerably in other ways by
alterations of temperature and pressure jointly, without its receiving any

of the fluid      (as to temperature, pressure, and volume), which          would   in
ordinary      language be regarded as belonging to the liquid state.
   Dr. Andrews (Phil. Trans. 1869, p. 575) has shown that the ordinary
gaseous and ordinary liquid states are only widely separated forms of the
same condition of matter, and may be made to pass into one another         a      by
course of continuous physical changes presenting nowhere any interruption
or breach of continuity.   If we denote geometrically all possible points of
pressure and temperature jointly, by points spread continuously in     plane  a
surface, each point in the plane being referred to two axes of rectangular
coordinates, so that one of its ordinates shall represent the temperature
and the other the pressure denoted       that point, andby we mark all the
                                                                       if
successive boiling- or condensing-points of temperature and pressure as a
continuous line on this plane, this line, which may be called the boiling-
line, will be   separating boundary between the regions of the plane cor
                    a
responding to the ordinary liquid state and those corresponding to the
ordinary gaseous state. But, by consideration of Dr. Andrews's experi
mental results, we may see that this separating boundary comes to an end
at  point of pressure and temperature which, in conformity with his lan
     a
guage, may be called the critical point of pressure and temperature jointly         ;
and we may                 from any ordinary liquid state to any ordinary
                         see   that,
gaseous state, the transition may be effected gradually by an infinite variety
of courses passing round outside the extreme end of the boiling-line.
     Now     it   willchief object in the present paper to state and support
                         be my
a view which has occurred to me, according to which        appears probable

in the nature of things,   theoretical continuity across this breach having

some real and true significance.               This theoretical continuity, from the
ordinary liquid state to the ordinary gaseous state, must be supposed to
be such as to have its various courses passing through conditions of pres
sure, temperature, and volume iu unstable equilibrium for any fluid matter
theoretically conceived as homogeneously distributed while passing through
the intermediate conditions.           Such courses of transition, passing through
unstable conditions, must be regarded as being impossible to be brought
about throughout        entire masses of fluids dealt with in any physical opera
tions. Whether in an extremely thin lamina of gradual transition from a
liquid to its own gas, in which it is to be noticed the substance would not
be homogeneously distributed, conditions may exist in a stable state having
some kind of correspondence with the unstable conditions here theoreti
cally conceived, will be a question suggested at the close of this paper in
connexion with some allied considerations.
  • It is first to be observed that the ordinary liquid state does not neces
sarily cease abruptly at the line of boiling-points, as it is well known that
liquids may, with due precautions, be heated considerably beyond the
boiling temperature for the pressure to which they are exposed. This
condition is commonly manifested in the boiling of water in a glass vessel by
 a lamp placed below, when the temperature of the internal parts of the
 water, or, in other words, of the parts not exposed to contact with gaseous
 matter, rises considerably above the boiling-point for the pressure, and the
 water boils with bumping *. At this stage it becomes desirable to refer to
 Dr. Andrews's diagram of curves showing his principal results for carbonic
 acid, and to consider carefully some of the remarkable features presented
 by those curves.        In doing so, we have first, in the case of the two curves
 for  13°-1     and  21°•5,  which pass through the boiling interruption of con
 tinuity, to guard against being led, by the gradually bending transition
 from the curve representing obviously the liquid state into the line seen
 rapidly ascending towards the curve representing obviously the gaseous
 state, to suppose that this curved transition is in any way indicative of a
 gradual transition from the liquid towards the gaseous state. Dr. Andrews
 has clearly pointed out, in describing those experimental curves, that the
 slight bend at about the commencement of the rapid ascent from the
 liquid    state is to be ascribed to a trace        of air unavoidably present in the
 carbonic     acid ; and  that if the    carbonic   acid  had been absolutely pure, the
 ascent from the liquid to the gaseous state would doubtless have been quite
 abrupt, and would have shown itself in his diagram by a vertical straight
    * It has even been found by Dufour (Bibliotheque Universale, Archives, year 1861,

being horizontal and vertical respectively.     Now in the diagram here sub
mitted the continuous curves (that is to say, those which are not dotted)
are obtained from Dr. Andrews's       diagram, with the slight alteration of
substituting, in accordance with the explanations just given, an abrupt
meeting instead of the curved transition between the curve for the liquid
state and the upright line which shows the boiling stage.         Looking to
either of the given curves which pass through boiling, and, for instance,
selecting the curve for 13°-l, we perceive, from what has been said as to
the conditions to which boiling by bumping is due, that for the tempera
ture pertaining to this curve the liquid state does not necessarily end at
the boiling pressure for this temperature, and that thus in the diagram
the curve showing volumes for the liquid state must not cease at the foot
of the upright line which marks the boiling stage of pressure, but must
extend continuously, for some distance at least, into lower pressures in some
such way as is shown by the dotted continuation from a to b.        But now
the question arises,^ Does this curve necessarily end at any particular
 point b 1 We know that the extent of this curve in the direction from a

presented before the explosive or bumping change to gas occurs, is very
variable under different circumstances, being much affected by the presence
of other fluids, even in small quantities, as impurities in the fluid experi
mented on, and by the nature of the surface of the containing vessel, &c.
   The consideration of the subject may be facilitated, and aid towards the
attainment of clear views of the mutual relations of temperature, pressure,
and volume in a given mass of a fluid may be gained, by actually making, or
by conceiving there to be made, for carbonic acid, from the data supplied
in Dr. Andrews's experimental results, a solid model consisting of a curved
surface referred to three axes of rectangular coordinates, and formed so
that the three coordinates of each point in the curved surface shall repre
sent, for any given mass of carbonic acid, a temperature, a pressure, and a
volume which can coexist in that mass.           It   is to be noticed here that in his
diagram of curves the results for       of the several temperatures experi
                                        each
mented on are combined in the form of a plane curved line referred to two
axes of rectangular coordinates, one of each pair of ordinates representing
a pressure, and the other representing the volume corresponding to that
pressure at the temperature to which the curve belongs.   Now to form a
model such as       I
                 am here recommending, and have myself made, Dr. An
drews's curved lines are to be placed with their planes parallel to one an
other, and separated by intervals proportional to the differences of the tem
peratures to which the curves severally belong, and with the origins of co
ordinates of the curves situated in a straight line perpendicular to their
planes, and with the axes of coordinates of all of them parallel in pairs to
one another, and then the curved surface is to be formed so as to pass
through those curved lines smoothly or evenly*. The curved surface so ob
tained exhibits in a very obvious way the remarkable phenomena of the vo-
luminal conditions at and near the critical point of temperature and pressure,
in comparison with the voluminal conditions throughout other parts of
the range of gradually varying temperatures and pressures to which it ex
tends, and even throughout a far wider range into which it can in imagi
nation be conceived to be extended.  It helps to afford a clear view of the
nature and meaning of the continuity of the liquid and gaseous states of
matter.      It   does so by its own obvious continuity
                                                     throughout its expanse
round the end of the range of points of pressure and temperature where
an abrupt change of volume can occur by boiling or condensing.       On the

curves laid down on paper as cross sections of the required model at various places
in its length.

6                            Prof. J. Thomson on the                         [Nov. 16,
places.  The model admits of easily exhibiting in due relation to one
another a second set of curves, in which each would be for a constant
pressure, and in each of which the coordinates would represent tempera
tures and corresponding volumes.        It may be used in various ways for
affording quantitative relations interpolated among those more immediatel v
given by the experiments.
   We may now, aided by the conception of this model, return to the con- 1
sideration of continuity or discontinuity in the curves in crossing the boil/
ing stage.   Let us suppose an indefinite number of curves, each for one
constant temperature, to be drawn on the model, the several temperatures
differing in succession by very small intervals, and the curves consequently
being sections of the curved surface by numerous               planes closely spaced
parallel to one another and to the plane containing            the pair of coordiuate
axes for pressure and volume.         Now   we can see that, as we pass from curve
to curve in approaching towards the critical point from the higher tempe
ratures, the tangent to the curve at the steepest point or point of inflec
tion is rotating, so that its inclination to the plane of the coordinate axes
for pressure and temperature, which         we may regard as horizontal,       increases
till, at the critical point, it becomes
                                     a right angle. Then it appears very
natural to suppose that, in proceeding onwards past the critical point to
curves successively for lower and lower temperatures, the tangent at the
point of inflection would continue its rotation, and the angle of its inclina
tion, which before was acute, would now become obtuse.       It seems much
more natural to make such a supposition as this than to suppose that in
passing the critical point from higher into lower temperatures the curved
line, or the curved surface to which it belongs, should break itself asunder,
and should come to have a part of its conceivable continuous course abso
lutely deficient. It thus seems natural to suppose that in some sense
there is continuity in each of the successive curves by courses such as
those drawn in the accompanying diagram as dotted curves uniting conti
nuously the curves for the ordinary gaseous state with those for the ordi
nary liquid state.
   The physical conditions corresponding to the extension of the curve
from a to some point b we have seen are perfectly attainable in practice.
Some extension of the gaseous curve into points of temperature and pres
sure below what I have called the boiling- or condensing-line (as, for in
stance, some extension such as from c to d in the figure)    think    I        we need
not despair of practically realizing in physical operations.    As              a   likely

admitting speedily of dry steam nearly at its condensing temperature for
its pressure (or, to use a common expression, nearly saturated) into a
vessel       with   a piston or plunger,   all kept hotter than the         steam,   and then
allowing the steam to expand till by its expansion it would be cooled below
its condensing-point for its pressure ; and yet I would suppose that if this
were done with very careful precautions the steam might not condense, on
account of the cooled steam              being surrounded entirely with a thin film of
superheated steam              close to the superheated containing vessel.   The fact
of its not condensing might perhaps best be ascertained by observations on
its volume and pressure. Such an experiment as that sketched out here
would not be easily made, and unless it were conducted with very great
precautions, there could be no reasonable expectation of success in its at
tempt    and perhaps it might not be possible so completely to avoid the
             ;
presence of dust or other dense particles in the steam as to make it prove
successful.  I mention             it,

proceed  to state,        in
                     support  of these views,  several considerations  founded
on the ordinary statical theory of capillary or superficial phenomena of
liquids, which      dependent on the supposition of an attraction acting
                         is
very intensely for very small distances, and causing intense pressure in
liquids over and above the pressure applied              by

led to the forecasting of new results in advance of experiment.  Hence,

    § 1.  Action of Hydriodic Acid        on Codeia    in presence   of Phosphorus.
    In Parts I. and II. of these researches the action of hydrobromic acid
on codeia and its derivatives has been partially investigated ; and as the
action of this acid appears to be in some*respects similar to, but in others
different from, that of hydrochloric acid, it appeared to be of interest to
examine the action of hydriodic acid also.
   Some preliminary experiments on this subject made two or three years
ago in conjunction with the late Dr. A. Matthiessen, showed that when
codeia is boiled with a large excess of strong hydriodic acid, no appreciable
quantity of methyl iodide is evolved even after some hours' treatment ; a
brown tarry      mass containing much free iodine was produced, but at the
time nothing fit for analysis was obtained from this ; since then, Dr.
Matthiessen and Mr. Burnside* have corroborated the non-formation of
methyl iodide under these circumstances.
   If, however, phosphorus be added simultaneously                 with the hydriodic
acid, so as to prevent the accumulation of free iodine, methyl iodide is
evolved at 100° and upwards in quantity close upon that required for
the equation

from a base containing H2 more than morphia.

hydric sulphide on iodine and water         : in the dilute      acid thus got, iodine
was  dissolved,  and  the whole digested at a very gentle heat with phosphorus,
more iodine solution being added from time to time ; finally the whole was
distilled several times from potassium iodide.            A colourless acid of sp. gr.
1-7-1-75, and containing 50-55 per cent, of III, was thus obtained, and
preserved colourless by keeping a stick of phosphorus in the bottle.                 The
codeia used in these experiments was part of a further supply most libe
rally presented by Messrs. Macfarlane, of Edinburgh.
   On heating on the water- bath a mixture of 10 parts codeia, 30 to 50 of
this acid, and 1 of phosphorus, the evolution of methyl iodide is noticed in
a few minutes     ; simultaneously the liquid becomes brown, indicating the
separation of free iodine ; after two or three hours the brown colour dis
appears, and the evolution of methyl iodide ceases.             If the liquid be heated
to gentle ebullition, at first the same effects ensue, but more quickly ; the
resulting product, however, varies in composition according to the tempe
rature at which the reaction was effected.
   In one experiment 55 grammes of codeia yielded by condensation 22*5
grammes of methyl iodide, the theoretical yield being 24*6 from crystallized
codeia, Cls H21 NOj, H20 ; hence upwards of 90 per cent, of the theoretical
yield  was obtained.      In  order to prove the elimination of -jL- part of the
carbon in the form of methyl iodide, 4-3045 grammes of codeia, dried at
 140°— 150° C, was heated to gentle ebullition with 30 grammes of 55 per
cent, hydriodic acid and about 2 of phosphorus ; the vapours evolved
were passed through      a flask to condense     aqueous vapour, and then through
a combustion-tube filled with red-hot lead chromate, the COa produced
being absorbed in the usual way, an aspirator being attached at the far end
so as to create a diminished pressure throughout the apparatus, and thus
guard against loss of methyl-iodide vapour by leakage at any of the nume
rous corks and joints*.        After three hours a current of pure oxygen was
led through the apparatus, to sweep out the last traces of methyl-iodide
vapour    from the flasks and ensure the perfect combustion                of deposited
carbonaceous particles.
   4*3045 grms. codeia thus gave 0'617 grm. COa.
   0-3720 grm. codeia, burnt in the usual way, gave 09830 C02.
                                                              Found.        Calculated.

In another experiment, not carried to          a complete conclusion, the COa col
lected represented 3-7 per cent, of the codeia used.
   The methyl iodide produced was found, after washing with water, dry-

  phorus, to boil at 42°-45°       C,  and to correspond in every respect with the
  ordinary methyl iodide.
     If  the reaction with hydriodic acid takes place on the water-bath, the
  resulting product appears to have the composition C03 H3e I2 N, 012, 4HI ;
  but if the mixture be heated to gentle ebullition throughout, the tempera
  ture not being allowed to exceed 110°-115° from loss of aqueous fluid by
  evaporation, the substance obtained contains the elements of two molecules
 of water   less,   = C0, H32 I2 N4 O10,     4HI   ;  whilst    if the mixture   be  rapidly
 boiled, so that by evaporation the boiling-point rises to 1 30° and upwards,
 the ultimate product contains less oxygen than this last body, being
  Cm HM 14 N4 00, 4HI.          These three formulae might each be halved; but
 inasmuch as compounds containing not less than CM have been got from
 these products by simple treatments, the higher formulae are more probable.
     All three substances are, while moist, colourless tars, drying at 100° to
 brittle waxy-looking       masses, not fusing at        1 00° when perfectly dry     ; they
 are soluble in hot water, a decomposition               being thereby produced     ;   while
 moist they appear to absorb oxygen with avidity, rapidly becoming yellow
 or orange.     They are also extremely hygroscopic ; and from the high per
 centage of iodine contained, the ease with which they decompose on heat
 ing, and the difficultly combustible carbon left, their analysis is a matter of
 some considerable       difficulty.   From all      these circumstances combined, the
 numbers obtained do not always accord quite as closely as might be expected
 in the case of crystalline and easily purified substances.
    To obtain the compound CM HM               1„ N4  0l2,   4HI,    10 parts of codeia,  30
 of 55 per cent. hydriodic acid, and 1 of phosphorus may be heated on the
 water-bath for three to four hours, at the end of which time the evolution
 of methyl iodide has entirely ceased : by filtering the syrupy hot liquid
 through asbestos to separate particles of amorphous phosphorus and addi
 tion of a little water when cold, a colourless tar is precipitated, which soon
 sets to a hard brittle mass ; this is broken up and thoroughly washed with
water to separate the phosphorus acids produced simultaneously, and finally
freed from moisture as far as possible by pressure between filter paper, and
dried at 100°.
    The same body may also be obtained by dissolving the original substance
in slightly warm water, precipitating with sodium carbonate, and extraction
of the mass thus thrown down with ether and agitation of the first portions
of the ether extract with hydriodic acid : the tar thus got is identical in all
respects with the original substance.             After drying at 100° the following

    The falling short in the percentage of iodine found in these specimens is
readily accounted for by the action of the water which necessarily adheres
to the tarry product got by either of the above processes ; it will be sub
sequently shown that by the action of water on this body the elements of
HI are removed from it.
    This compound is apparently formed by the reaction
        Codeia hydriodate.                                     Now body.

The iodine thus     set free is  of course reconverted into HI by the action of
the phosphorus,      a  mixture of phosphorous and phosphoric acids being
thereby produced.        The reaction
                        3I3 + P2 + 6H2 O = 2H, P03 +      6HI
 requires for 50 grms. of codeia 3*45 grms. of phosphorus           to be converted
 into phosphorous acid ; whilst the equation
                        5I2+P3+8H2O=2H3P04+8HI
 requires 207 grms. to be converted into phosphoric acid.             In one experi
 ment 2-8 grms. of phosphorus, as nearly as could be estimated, were found
 to have become converted into the mixture of the two acids, 50 grms. of
 codeia having been employed.
     On attempting to procure the free base C0„ H3e I2 N2 0n from the hydrio-
  date got as above, by precipitation with sodium carbonate, a snow-white
  mass was obtained containing, besides a small quantity of the desired base
  (soluble in ether), a large quantity of two other bases derived from this
  one (but sparingly soluble in ether).          The description of the products
  thus got will be given in a subsequent section.

  If codeia,  hydriodic acid (3 to 5 parts), and phosphorus be heated to rapid

accelerated by adding a few drops of sodium carbonate to the boiling solu

product is apt, however, to be more strongly yellow- coloured when ob
tained in this way than when got by treatment with water alone.

  It is not impossible that this substance is not a definite compound, but
  only a mixture ; nevertheless, a free base of this composition and its hy
  driodate have been obtained by the action of sodium carbonate on the
  compound CK H3e I3 N4 012, 4HI, from whence it appears probable that
 the body analyzed is really a definite compound, formed by the reaction
              C„  H33  I, N4 O10, 4HI=HI + CM H31 IN, O10, 4HI.
     Both the final and intermediate products have a very curious structure
 under the microscope      ; although   they simulate in a high degree the ap
 pearance of crystals as they separate from a hot aqueous solution, yet on
 microscopic examination they are found to consist of strings of coalesce;!
 globules not unlike the yeast-plant.       In qualitative reactions all the bodies
 hitherto described are very similar : ferric chloride gives no coloration to
 the aqueous solution of the hydriodate ; silver nitrate is reduced on standing,
 producing a yellow tint ; nitric acid gives an intense yellow ; sulphuric
 acid and potassium dichromate only separate iodine; sodium carbonate
throws down a white precipitate scarcely soluble in excess, and soon be
coming yellow, salmon-colour, and finally dark brown ; ammonia gives a
similar precipitate somewhat more soluble in excess, while caustic potash
readily dissolves the white precipitate first formed.        In many of these re
actions this group of codeia derivatives utterly differs from the bodies got
by the action of HC1 or HBr ; most of these latter derivatives give colours
with ferric chloride and sulphuric acid and dichromate ; all give a blood-
red with nitric acid, while the free bases turn more or less green by expo
sure to air.

formed   by the action of hydriodic acid on codeia at about 130°, a
substance similar in characters to that got from the other two compounds
is produced.  The final product, however, differs somewhat in its physical
characters from those just mentioned ; instead of coming out from the hot
aqueous solution in solid flakes, it appears in very minute solid oil-globules
which do not readily subside, and give to the liquid a great resemblance to
fresh milk          ;   sometimes the globules do not subside for many days.
     Dried at           100° these globulesgive numbers indicating a compound ana
logous to that of the non-iodized base just described ; it however, much                is,
more difficult in this instance to remove the last portions of basic HI                                    ;
moreover, four molecules of water appear to be taken up, probably in lieu
of the oxygen lost.

 this compound a voluminous white precipitate is produced, which is ap
 parently a mixture of three bases, two of which contain iodine, whilst the
 third is free from that ingredient.          The first one, which forms only a
small fraction of the whole, is the free base of the original compound,
C68 H86 12 N4 0la ; this is readily soluble in ether, and may be obtained
as hydriodate      (as previously  stated) by digesting the precipitate with ether,
and agitation of the extract with hydriodic acid, whereby the original sub
stance is reproduced.          To prevent frothing, the precipitate must be well
drained from the aqueous portion.            By continuing the extraction until
some 6 litres of ether have been employed for exhausting the precipitate
from 40 grms. of original substance, the whole of this base is removed, or
nearly so. Attempts to prepare the base itself, by evaporation of the ether
yielded only a tarry substance which could not be removed from the vessel
employed ; treatment with water or alcohol more or less decomposes it.
    By employing       a large bulk of ether after this first base has been almost
wholly removed, an extract is obtained from which on evaporation solid
flakes separate ; these are much less soluble in ether than the first base,
and after drying at 100° gave the following numbers, indicating the formula

   Apparently these flakes still retained a trace of the first base; the
mother liquor from which they separated, when evaporated to dryness, left
a small amount of residue containing 14-18 per cent, of iodine.             Treated

     Evidently      a   slight   loss    of iodine has occurred from the action of the
adhering moisture while drying, as the original flakes contained rather too
high a percentage of iodine.

   A portion of the substance left after extraction with ether was treated
several times successively with large bulks of ether (about 4 litres of ether
to 10 grms. of precipitate each extraction).  After the majority of the sub-
stance had thus been dissolved, a portion of the last ether extracts was
evaporated down and yielded flakes agreeing approximately with the com
position required for a mixture of one molecule of CM H,1 1N4 O10, and two
molecules of C^ HM N4 OJ0.

   From the foregoing experiments it is clear that the action of so Hum
carbonate on the compound C03 llm I2 N4 0l2, 4HI is identical with that of
water described in § 2, the two bases CM H31IN4O10 and C^H^N^O,,.
being the principal products.
   On precipitating in a similar way the compound Cc, IIM I2 N, O10, 4HI,
the same reaction appears to take place ; from the precipitate ether extracts
only traces at first, indicating probably that the base C„ H3: I2 N4O10 is
not produced in any quantity,                as apparently        the more highly iodiz             •l!   bases
are more soluble in ether.

analogous reaction seems to ensue    the precipitate; very sparingly solu    is
ble in ether, and on treatment with hydriodic acid furnished   hydriodate                  a
of which 0-233 grm. dried at 100° gave 0-142 Agl: hence 1=32-94
per cent.; the compound C03HwN2O:o, 4HI requires 31-13 per cent.,
whilst the original substance requires 40-53 per cent.

     As the action of water on the three compounds first described                                 is   to re
move the elements of             HI     associated with the carbon radicals of the bases,
itwas thought probable that by treating the products of the action of water
on these compounds with strong boiling hydriodic acid, the        thus lost                 HI
might be again added on.       reaction of this nature does indeed take place,

   (1) The action of hydriodic acid on codeia polymerizes the ultimate                   it,

Hydrobromic acid            also polymerizes codeia,                   but not   so completely as   hydri
odic acid, there being formed, in addition to the tetra-bases, compounds
which (from their crystalline character and other physical properties) are
apparently derived from one molecule only of codeia.  Hydrochloric acid
doej not appear to have  marked polymerizing effect on codeia.

       municated by the Foreign Secretary.             Received July 22, 1871.
 [From   the Anzoiger der k. Akademie dor Wissenachnftcn in Wien for Juno  15, 1871.]
    Professor Hornstein,      of Prague, has communicated to the Imperial Aca
 demy    of  Sciences of Vienna a paper entitled " On the dependence of the
Earth's Magnetism on the Rotation of the Sun."
    He shows that the changes of each of the three elements of the force of
terrestrial magnetism (declination, inclination, and horizontal force) indicate
 a period of 26^ days. The periodic change of declination for Prague (1870)
amounts to 0705 sin (x-f- 190° 20'), where ,r=0oat the commencement of
 18/0, and #=360° at the commencement of 18/1. For Vienna the range
is a little larger.      The range of inclination is nearly one-third of that of
declination, that of the intensity nearly 24 units of the 4th decimal (the
intensity in June 1870 was nearly 2-0485).
    Professor Hornstein regards these changes of the earth's magnetism as
the effect of the sun's rotation, and by a mean of several determinations
finds for the duration of the period 26"33 days.           This number may con
sequently be regarded as the result of the first attempt to determine the
synodic period of the sun's rotation by means of the magnetic needle.
The resulting true periodic time of the sun's rotation is 24-55 days, al
most exactly agreeing with the time of rotation of the sun-spots in the
sun's equator deduced from astronomical observations (according to Sporer
24-541 days).

    The author, after adverting      to the process by which in a former paper
he  had   attempted the computation of the Lengths of Waves of Light, for the
entire series measured in the Solar Spectrum by Kirchhoff, from a limited
number of measured Wave-Lengths, and to the discordances between the
results of these computations and the actual measure of numerous wave
lengths to which he subsequently had access, calls attention to his remark
that means existed for giving accuracy         to the whole.     The object of the
present paper is so to use these means as to produce a         table of corrections

applicable through the entire range of Kirchhoff's lines, and actually to
apply the corrections to those computed wave-lengths which relate to
spectral lines produced by the atmosphere and by many metals.
    Adopting               the comparisons with Angstrom's and Ditschei-
                    as foundation
ner's measures given in the former paper, and laying these down graphi
cally, the author remarks that in some parts of the spectrum the agreement
of the two experimenters is very close, that in some parts they are irrecon
cilable,and that in one part (where they agree) there is a peculiarity
which leads to the supposition that some important change was made in
KirchhofFs adjustments.      He then explains the considerations on which
he has drawn a correction-curve,                    whose ordinates are to give the correc
tions applicable to his former                     computed numbers.    A general table of
corrections is then given, and this is followed by tables of the Lengths of
the Light-Waves for the air and metals as corrected by the quantities
deduced from that general table.
   The author remarks that he has not yet succeeded in discovering any re
lation among the wave-lengths for the various lines given by any one
metal &c. which can suggest any mechanical explanation of their origin.

equations which admit of a geometrical interpretation.                          In fact when there
is only a nodal curve, the first equation is
                                        j+6t=b(2n-4)-2q,
which we may verify when the nodal curve is a complete intersection, P=0,
Q=0 ; for if the equation of the surface is (A, B, C^P, Q)3=0, where
the degrees of A, B, C, P, Q are n-~2f, n—f-g, n
                                                   — 2y,f, g respectively,
then the pinch-points are given by the equations P=0, Q=0, AC
                                                                — B2=0,
and the number.;' of pinch-points is thus
                        =fg(2n-2f-2g)=(2n-4yg-2fg(f+g-2);
but for the curve P=0, Q=0                     we have         t=0, and its order and         class are
b=zfg,    q=/g(/+g—2),                  or the formula is thus verified.
     Similarly when there is only              a cuspidal curve, the second equation is
                                  2x+3u = c(5«-12)-6r+3fl,
which may       be verified when the cuspidal                   curve is a complete intersection,
P=0, Q=0            ;   the equation of the surface is here               (A, B, C^P, Q)2=0,
where  AC— B3=MP+NQ, and the points x, oi are given as the intersec

tions of the curve with the surface (A, B, C](N,   M)3=0.
   Now AC— B2 vanishing for P=0, Q=0 we must have A==Aa3 + A',
B=Aa/3+B', C = A/32 + C, where A', B', C vanish for P=0, Q=0 ; and
thence M=AM' + M", N = AN' + N", where M", N" vanish for P=0,

                                   —
Q=0. The equation (A, B, C^N,
Q=0, thus becomes A\N'a— M'/3)3 = 0 ; and its intersections with the
curve P=0, Q=0 are the points P=0, Q=0, A=0 each three times, and
the points P=0, Q=0, N'a— M'a=0 each twice ; viz. they are the points
2x+3w.
  But if the        degree       of A   is   =\,   then the degrees of N',        M',    «2, a/3,   /33   are
2n-3f-2g-\,                   2n-2f-3g-\, n-2f-\, n-f-g-~\, n-2g-\,
whence the degree of  A*(N'«— M'/3)U =5n—6f—6g, and the number of
points    =fg(5n-6f— 6g), viz. this
          is                             =fg(5n—\2) — 6fg(f+g — 2), or

that of M, arc given. Quite recently Mr. Glaisher lias shown that the values
of these logs are inaccurate' from about the 59th decimal. This inaccuracy
the author regrets, and has therefore recalculated them, and now gives
their values entire and corrected. The values of logs,           and 10 agree          2,   3,   5,
with and verify Mr. Glaisher'    as will be seen, to about the 100th decimal

and      thought (from this and the great care used) that the remaining
          it   is
decimals now given are free from error.    The value of e, given in the
former paper, has lately been verified by                                  Mr. Glaisher to        137 decimals.
The value of M has also been recalculated and the accuracy of its value;
(as far as division   concerned) may be relied on, inasmuch as proofs
                                      is

  Three                    of inaccuracy in fmding the value
              cases and sources                                                              of   E in   the
former  paper (Proc. Roy. Soc.  vol. xv. p. 429) having been                                 pointed     out
by Mr. Glaisher, and some other minor errors not noticed by                                  him having
since been detected by the author, and these having vitiated                                 the results,
but only in a slight degree the inferences drawn from them (for in the
/ormer paper the last and leading conclusion as to the value of E, though
limited, was certainly correct), the author has been led, from a deep sense
of obligation to the Royal Society, to revise, correct, and extend what he
had previously done.   And it will be seen, from comparing Mr. Glaisher's
remarks and results with what follows in this paper, that the supplementary
matter herein given, including the extension of E &c. to 110 places of
decimals, can scarcely be without interest to mathematicians, and especially
as regards the summation of the harmonic series in the formula for finding
the value of E.
   Not having seen M. Oettinger's article in Crelle's 'Journal,' "On Com
puting the value of E," the author is unable to state what artifices he used
in summing the harmonic series. Mr. Glaisher gives a very simple and
obvious one from  M. Oettinger, which the author could not but see and
employ for calculating the values of the reciprocals of the even numbers.
  In summing the harmonic series, the author found the reciprocals of all
numbers up to 200, as far as 200 places of decimals ; next the reciprocals
from 200 to 500, to only 105 decimals; and afterwards the reciprocals of
the odd composite numbers up to 5000, to the same extent.      In passing
from    S2000
                to    SJ000
                               some extra calculation            was necessary, which need not be
stated here.    It            is,
                      however, necessary to calculate, in extenso, the reci
procals of  the  odd composite numbers only to half the number of terms
which    it  proposed to sum.
              is                  The reciprocals of all the prime numbers
must of course be calculated separately.
   The leading artifices the author employed to shorten calculation may be
best stated and explained                  by
                               supposing that the reciprocals of all the odd
numbers         below         5000 have been computed and retained separately, also

will give the sum of the harmonic series to 10,000 terms.
   Before proceeding further it should be stated that, having obtained the
correct value of E, from S200 &c. to 1 10 decimals, verifying Mr. Glaisher's
to 99 decimals,           it was comparatively                    easy    to extend         Ss00
                                                                                                   and   S1000

     When     we have          S100,       the calculations         from Bernoulli's 31 numbers will
lead to obtaining E only to about 92 decimals.  This value may no doubt
be extended by finding the ratio between the last and each succeeding
Bernoulli's number.    Such ratio                         is,
                                    however, only approximative, and can
yield correct results of only limited number of decimals.

III. "An       Experimental       Determination     of the Velocity of Sound."
        By E.   J.   Stone, M.A.,     E.R.S., Astronomer Royal at the Cape
        of Good Hope.         Received August 21, 1871.
                                       (Abstract.)
    A  galvanic current passes from the batteries at the Royal Observatory,
 Cape Town, at 1 o'clock, and discharges a gun at the Castle, and through
relays drops a time-ball at Port Elizabeth.         It appeared to the author that
a valuable determination of the velocity of sound might be obtained by
measuring upon the chronograph of the Observatory the interval between
the time of the sound reaching some point near the gun and that of its arrival
at the Observatory.        As there is only a single wire between the Observatory
and Cape Town, some little difficulty was experienced in making the neces
sary arrangements, without any interference with the 1 o'clock current to
Port Elizabeth     ;  but this difficulty was overcome by a plan which the author
describes, and which was brought into successful operation on Feb. 27,
 1871.     The experiments could not have been carried out, on account of
the encroachment they would have made on the time of the Observatory
staff, had it not been for the assistance of J. Den, Esq., the acting manager
of the Cape Telegraph Company, to whom the author is indebted for the
preparation of a good earth-connexion near the gun, for permission to
Mr. Kirby, a gentleman attached to the telegraph office, to assist in the
experiments, and for a general superintendence of the arrangements at
Cape Town.
    The observed times of hearing the sound were recorded on the
chronograph      by two observers, situated one       (Mr. Kirby)      at a distance  of
641 feet from      the gun, the other (Mr. Mann) at the Observatory, at a
distance of 15,4-19 feet from the gun.          The former distance was sufficient
to allow    the connexion of the main wire to be broken at the telegraph
office after the gun had been fired, but before the sound reached the first
observer.
    As there were no reciprocal signals, a correction was made by calculation
for the effect of the wind, its velocity being measured by a set of Robin

             On a supposed Alteration of Aberration of Light     t$c.
                                                                            35
son's cups. The personal equation, under the circumstances of the observa
tions, was found as follows : — A gun was fired at such a distance from
the Observatory as to be heard with about the same degree of distinctness
as the time-gun at the Castle.       This distance was found to be 1483 feet.
The registrations on the chronograph were made by Mr. Kirby at the
distance of 162 feet from the gun, and Mr. Mann at the Observatory. For
this comparatively small distance, the time of transit calculated from the
velocity deduced from the time taken to travel over the larger distance
may be deemed exact. The observed time for the smaller difference of
distance was found to be too great by 0'-09, which correction has been ap
plied to all the observations.      It depends more on want of sensibility in
picking up and recognizing faint sounds than upon mere habit of making
contacts. When the observers were interchanged, the observed interval of
time appeared still too large, but in this case by 0''02.     It is clear that
such personal equations are not eliminated by au interchange of ob
servers, nor by return signals.
    In  the reduction   of the equations, the coefficient of elasticity of air
under    a constant   volume (that is to say, the ratio of the increment of
pressure for an increment 1° F. of temperature to the pressure at 32° F.)
was regarded as an unknown quantity as well as V, the velocity of sound
at 32° F.     The reduction of the equations furnished by the observations,
which    were 38 in number, gave
                          V=10°06     feet per second,

 Regnault's value of a. being (V0020.
    There appeared to be but little difference between the residual errors
as dependent on the motion of the air.       The author grouped the residuals
into two classes, according to the dampness of the air ; but there appeared
to be no appreciable difference in the velocity as dependent upon damp-

    A discussion has taken place on the Continent, conducted partly in the
 ' Astronomische Nachrichten,'
                                    partly in independent pamphlets, on the
 change of direction which a ray of light will receive (as inferred from the
 Undulatory Theory of Light) when it traverses a refracting medium which
 has a motion of translation.    The subject to which attention is particularly
 called is the effect that will be produced on the apparent amount of thai

36            The Astronomer Royal        on a supposed   Alteration      [i"^v.   23,
angular displacement of a star or planet which is caused by the Earth's
motion of translation, and is known as the Aberration of Light. It has been
conceived that there may be a difference in the amounts of this displace
ment, as seen with different telescopes, depending on the difference in the
thicknesses of their object-glasses.   The most important of the papers con
taining this discussion are : — that of Professor Klinkerfues, contained in a
pamphlet   published at Leipzig in 1867, August; and those of M.                 Iloek,
                                                 '
one published 1867, October, in No. 1669 of the    Astronomische                 Nach-
richten,'and the other published in 1869 in a communication to                 the Ne
therlands Royal Academy of Sciences.    Professor Klinkerfues maintained
that, as a necessary result of the Undulatory Theory, the amount of
Aberration would        be   increased,   in accordance with    a    formula    which
he has given ; and he supported it by the following experiment            :—
  In the telescope of a transit-instrument, whose focal length was ahout
18 inches, was inserted a column  of water 8 inches in length, carried in a
tube whose ends were closed with glass plates ; and with this instrument
he observed the transit of the Sun, and the transits of certain stars whose
north-polar distances were nearly the same as that of the Sun, and which
passed the meridian nearly at midnight.      In these relative positions, the
difference between the Apparent Right Ascension of the Sun and those of the
stars is affected by double the coefficient of Aberration ; and the merely
astronomical circumstances are extremely favourable for the accurate test
ing of the theory.  Professor Klinkerfues had computed that the effect of
the 8-inch column of water and of a prism in the interior of the telescope
would                      coefficient of Aberration by eight seconds of
            be to increase the
arc.    The observation appeared to show that the Aberration was really
increased by 7"'l.   It does not appear that this observation was repeated.
   A result of physical character so important, and resting on the respect
able authority of Professor Klinkerfues, merited and indeed required fur
ther examination.   Having carefully considered the astronomical means
which would   be most accurately employed for the experiment, I decided on
adopting a vertical telescope, the subject of observation being the meri
dional zenith distance of y Draconis, the same star by which the existence
and laws of Aberration were first established.       The position of this star is
at present somewhat more favourable than it was in the time of Bradley,
its mean zenith-distance north at the Royal Observatory being about 100"
and still slowly diminishing. With the sanction of the Government, there
fore, I planned an instrument, of which the essential part          is,
                                                                  that the whole
tube, from the lower surface of the object-glass to      plane glass closing the

lower end of the tube,     filled with water, the length of the column of water
                             is
being  35-3  inches.   The    curvatures of the surfaces of the two lenses con
stituting the object-glass, adapted, in conjunction with the water, to correct
spherical and chromatic aberration, were investigated by myself and verified
by my friend Mr. Stone (now Astronomer at the Cape Observatory).            The

18771 .]      of Aberration of Light    through a Refracting Medium.             37
 micrometer     is constructed   on a plan arranged by myself, by which the
 double observation in reversed positions of the instrument can be made
 with great    case.   The reference to the vertical is given by two spirit-levels,
 both to be read at every single observation.       The work  of construction was
 intrusted to Mr. James Simms, who carried it out             with great ability.
 Distilled water was supplied by H. W. Chisholm,               Esq., Warden of
  Standards.
     Had the result of the observations     been confined to the determination    of
 an astronomical     constant, or the variation   of its value for different tele
  scopes, I should not have thought it worthy of communication to the Royal
  Society'.   But it is really a result of great physical importance, not only
  affecting the computation of the velocity of light, but also influencing the
  whole treatmeut of the Undulatory Theory of Light.          In this view I have
  thought that an informal statement of the conclusions may be acceptable to
  the Society, reserving for publication in one of the annual Greenwich
  Volumes the details of the observations.
     The instrument was mounted in a small Occasional Observatory first con
  structed for the transit-instrument of Mr. Struve when he was engaged in
  determining the longitude of Altona, and now planted on the
                                                                           " South

  Ground of the Observatory.         The seasons at which the meridional zenith-
  distance of y Draconis is most affected by aberration in opposite directions
  are the Equinoxes.
     For understanding the following Table, it is to be remarked that an ap
  parent value of the Geographical Latitude of the Instrument is formed from
  every observation, by subtracting the Observed Instrumental Zenith-distance
  North of the Star from the Tabular Declination of the Star given in the
  'Nautical Almanac.' The observed zenith-distance is affected with the True
  Aberration as seen in the instrument, the tabular declination is affected
  with the Received Aberration used in the computation of the ' Nautical Al
  manac,' and the apparent value of the geographical latitude is therefore
  affected by the difference between the True Aberration as seen in the instru
  ment and the Received Aberration. If, therefore, under all circumstances,
  and especially in the comparison of days when the sign of aberration has
  changed, the apparent value of the geographical latitude is sensibly con
  stant, it proves that the True Aberration is the same as the Received Aber
  ration, or at least that one is not a multiple of the other.
     The last column of the Table is given only to show to how large an ex
  tent Aberration    enters into the star's Apparent Declination.
     Every result for Observed Zenith-distance in the Table is the mean          of
  observations in reversed positions of the instrument.

 circle, on the north brow of the hill, the zenithal direction is disturbed to
 wards the north and the astronomical latitude is too great.
    There is only one point in this investigation upon which a doubt can be
 suggested as possible, namely the evaluation of the micrometer-scale.            It
was thus conducted : — The micrometer-plate contains 26 wires, and the
 fixed part of the instrument contains 25 crosses, each interval being nearly
 256". With this arrangement every wire-interval is measured with great
 ease, and the whole series    of 25 intervals is accurately obtained in terms    of
the micrometer.       By placing the instrument in a proper position, the same
intervals are obtained in time of the star's transit, which is easily converted
into arc. The comparison of these gives the value of micrometer-divisions
which has been employed.
    The following verification, of somewhat inferior accuracy, has been made
by measures of the instrument.           It appears that the ray of light passes
through 0-9 inch of glass, 35'3 inches of water, and 0'8 inch of air, nearly
(the measure of the last being slightly uncertain).           Remarking that the
dividing surfaces    are horizontal  and plane, it is easily seen that the micro
meter-scale ought to be such as is due to an air-telescope whose length in
inches    = j^  + ~f^ +   0*8 = 27-8 inches.      And from this, with observation
of transit of the star, it  was found that the measure     of 25 intervals of wires
ought to be 0*8693 inch : as measured with a pair of compasses, it was
found sometimes 0-8/l, sometimes 0-8/5.            The agreement is fully as close
as can be expected from the rudeness of the operation, and shows distinctly
that there can be no error of principle in the method of evaluing the
micrometer-scale.

    This paper contains the results of a series of magnetic observations
taken in the east of France during the months of August and September
1869, and is a continuation of the paper on the survey of the west of
France, published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1870, p. 33.
    No change was made in the observers, nor in the methods of observa
tion, during the two surveys ; and the only alteration in the instruments
was the substitution in 1869 of a Jones theodolite in lieu of the small
altazimuth     by Cook used in 1868.
    Observations were made at twenty-one stations in the following order : —

  The secular variations of these several elements are — 0°-054, — 0°-1696,
 + 0-0047, and —0-0195.         The yearly acceleration will therefore be
— 0°-00082 for the dip in 1863-5, the value found by General                             Sabine        for
the epoch 1/80 to 1830 being -0°-00085.
     As regards the horizontal            force, the secular variation             in the       east    of
France is considerably less than in the west ; but the change for the whole
of France is almost identical with that deduced by Dr. Lamont for 1858,
the yearly acceleration being less than 0'000007.
     A
     comparison of the lines of equal dip, declination, intensity, and hori
zontal force, deduced from the observations taken in the east and west of
France, leads to the following conclusions.
   The isoclinals are found to be rather further apart and more inclined to
the geographic meridian, but receding less quickly from    in the east than  it,
 in the    west   ;   the isogonics are more distant from each other, but make                          a
less     angle with the meridian, in the    east than in the west but the results

 obtained     from      the declination     observations    of 1869 are less trustworthy
 than those for 1868, on account                 of the unsteadiness of the new theodo
lite.

lines both the angle and the distance are somewhat in excess in the east,
though the difference is diminishing.

        posed     to   the    Open Air."           By Charles Tomlinson,                   T.lt.S.
        Received      July   26, 1871.
    It is a remarkable proof of the difference between the air of a room and
 that of a field or garden in the country, that supersaturated saline solu
tions, which crystallize the moment they are uncovered in a room, may
 be   kept uncovered in an open space                   during many hours without crys
 tallizing.
     During the last three years I have made many experiments to confirm
 this conclusion in the little garden at the back of my house at Highgate.
 I have no doubt that in a more open space further in the country the results
 would have been more perfect ; but still I venture to think they are suffi

 ciently striking to merit a place in the Proceedings.'                      The following were
 conducted during the spring of the present year.
     A solution of two parts of sodic sulphate and one part of water was
 boiled and filtered into 3- and 4-ounce flasks, of which the opening of the
 short cylindrical neck is just three-quarters of an inch.                     The filtered solu
 tions  were   reboiled     and  the   flasks    covered    with   watch-glasses.        One flask
 was placed on a stool in the middle of a gravel-walk and the watch-glass
 removed.       I  uow proceed to quote from my note-book some results in the
 order of time, and then to summarize them.
     1871, March 17. Put out flask containing cold solution at 12.30 p.m. ;
 temp. 56° Fahr. ; clouds, and afterwards suu, 60° and upwards.                           At 2.50,
 therm. 50°. At 4.30 found the solution solid, and upon it a speck of soot
 which had evidently acted as a nucleus.
     At 5.30 put out flask ; temp. 43°, with slight wind ; 6.30, 41°; 7.30,
 42°, with a good deposit of the seven-atom salt.                         At 9, temp. 40°, and
 deposit much increased.            At   1 1,  solution solid, and the seven-atom deposit
 chalky white.
     March    18.    2.15, put out flask and uncovered it under clear sky.                      At
 4, temp. 57°, fine crop of crystals, evidently due to evaporation, which was
 so powerful that a round patch immediately below the opening of the neck
 was white and pulverulent from the formation of anhydrous salt. In this
 case the crystallization took place, as in the case of a saturated solution, in
 an open dish, only much more quickly, on account of the much larger
 quantity of salt in the supersaturated solution.                     There was no formation
 of the seven-watered salt *.

     The  same flask was      reboiled and left to cool during an hour.            It was
 put out at 5.15; temp. 55°, with clouds;                at 6, temp. 47£°; at 6.35,
 temp. 45°.       At 7.15 the seven-watered salt was forming and heat-currents
 ascending ; cloudy.       At 9, the seven-atom salt was much increased in quan
 tity; temp. 45°. At 9.45, the solution solid, the nuclear action directly
 under the mouth of the flask.
     March    19.  Added    a small quantity    of water to supply waste from evapo
 ration and reboiled the same flask.           When cold, put the flask out at 5 p.m.
 At 6.30 brought it back into room, and it crystallized within two or three
 minutes.
    Reboiled this flask aud put it uncovered in the garden to cool at 6.35.
 At 8.45 foggy, and temp. 43°. Shook the solution ; it was very viscous,
 but did not crystallize.       At 9.30 abundant deposit of moisture : at 10.30
 thick mist, temp. 4l£°; no crystallization.
    March 20. At 7 a.m. found a considerable deposit of the seven-watered
 salt, much of it finely crystallized ; flask and stool very wet; temp. 40°.
Took the flask indoors, and after a few minutes the solution crystallized
and the seven-atom salt became opaque.                 There was a speck of soot on
the solution, but it lay so loosely that it had evidently not disturbed the
surface-tension of the solution.
    Three flasks were put out in the garden and uncovered. One crystallized
from the action of a speck ; a second during the day deposited some seven-
watered salt and then crystallized by evaporation, producing some very
fine crystals of the ten-watered salt with dihedral summits. These crystals,
although so fine, were produced rapidly (as under the action of films), as
was evident from phenomena which may often be seen in the sudden crys
tallization of supersaturated solutions, namely, the heat liberated in the
passage    of the liquid to the solid state volatilizes a portion of the water of
the solution, and the vapour rising upwards towards the neck condenses
on the inner surface of the flask ; but the ring of glass just above the soli
dified solution is rendered too warm to condense the vapour, so that the
llask presents the curious appearance of salt at the bottom in a chalky white
deposit covered by a layer of crystals or by an opalescent layer ; then
comes a zone of clear glass surmounted by a wide deposit of condensed
vapour.      The heat thus given out during the solidification of supersaturated
saline solutions may vary from 10° or 20° to 100° F.
    The third flask put out under this date crystallized          some hours    later by
evaporation.
   April 25. Flask out all night.             This morning found it covered with
dew, some of which trickled down              into the solution without acting as a
nucleus.
   April 27. Two flasks put out, and after a few hours rain               came on     and
was kindenough     to suggest that the largo crystals might bo due to evaporation.   Such
was certainly the case in some of these garden experiments.

1871.]      Mr. C. Tomlinson       on Supersaturated   Saline Solutions.         43
both the solutions crystallized.       Heated the flasks over a spirit-lamp, and
passed   the solutions    through   a filter, when in each case a minute black
speck, which had acted as a nucleus, was left on the filter.
   Two flasks that had been standing some time on the window-ledge, each
containing a deposit of the seven-watered salt, were put out during the
heavy rain of a thunder-storm and uncovered. The drops repeatedly entered
the flasks, splashing up the solution ; but they did not act as nuclei.        The
flasks were thus exposed during six hours, when one of them was brought
in and placed on the table ; it immediately became solid.
   After the storm, and while the sun was shining, snipped off some
pieces from some young leaves of the currant- and gooseberry-bush ;
they did not act as nuclei, even when shaken up in the solution.               The
upper surfaces of the leaves had been washed in the rain, but the
under surfaces were dry.         The scissors used were washed in spirit, and
several cuttings made in order still further to clean the blades, before
any of the pieces were allowed to fall into the flask.
   The conclusions which I think myself justified in drawing from these
and similar experiments are the following : —
    1. That a highly supersaturated solution         of sodic sulphate may        be
exposed    to the open air of the country in an uncovered flask and in
cloudy    weather   for from twelve to twenty hours without any formation
of the ordinary ten-watered crystals.
    2. That if the temperature fall to about 40° Fahr. and under, the
modified seven-watered salt is formed at the bottom of the solution just as
in covered vessels.
    3. That if the exposed solution suddenly crystallize into a closely
packed mass of needles, a nucleus may always be found in the form of
an insect, a speck of soot, a black point of carbon, &c.
    4. That if during the exposure rain comes on, the solution generally
crystallizes suddenly, in consequence of an active nucleus being brought
down ; but if the flask be put out during heavy rain, when we may sup
pose all the solid nuclei to have been brought down, the rain-drops, now
quite clean, fall into the solution without any nuclear action.
    5. That the young and newly sprouted leaves of trees, such as those of
gooseberry- and currant-bushes, have no nuclear action.
    6. That in clear cloudless weather, when the force of evaporation is
strong, the solutions, after some hours' exposure, produce fine groups of
crystals of the ten-atom salt, just as a saturated solution would do      if left  to
evaporate slowly in an open dish.
    7. That  if the  solution,  after being exposed to the open air, be brought
into a room, it crystallizes immediately under the action of aerial nuclei.
    Supersaturated solutions of Epsom salts and of alum were similarly ex
posed, and the results were in harmony with the above conclusions.             The
following are a few cases.

 quite filled.   Put this into the garden at 4 p.m., temp. 55°. At 6, temp.

 6.35, no change ; temp. 40£° ;      removed the watch-glass from the flask in
doors, and the solution crystallized immediately.          At  8 the solution in the
garden crystallized, apparently from evaporation         ; temp. 39|°.
   The   results obtained by exposure to the open air      of highly supersaturated
solutions of sodic acetate are not in harmony with the above, on account of
the tendency of such solutions, when left to repose, to arrange themselves
into layers of different density ; so that while the lower part of the solu
tion becomes more supersaturated, the upper part becomes less so.                 By
keeping    such  a solution during  some  weeks  in  a long test-tube plugged with
cotton-wool, the upper part of the solution is scarcely more than saturated,
so that it may be touched with an unclean wire without crystallizing, and
the wire may be passed about one-third down the tube before the solution
becomes sensitive to the action of a solid nucleus.             But when once the
crystallization is started, the whole contents of the tube become solid, and
the tube may be inverted without the escape of any liquid.
   For   these   garden experiments a solution of four parts sodic acetate
to one part of water was boiled and filtered into two small flasks, which
had been previously washed with spirits of wine, rinsed with water, and
then with a little acetic acid.
    March 18. At 8 p.m. the flasks were exposed in the garden ; at 11.15
the temp, was 35°.        On the 19th, at 8.30 a.m., after being left out all
night, both the solutions were liquid, but very viscous.               At 10.50 the
flasks were brought into a room and placed on the mantle-shelf, where they
remained all that day as well as the next.            On the 21st they were still
liquid ; one of them was touched with the end of a wooden penholder, and
it at once became solid ; the other flask was left uncovered on the shelf
until the 24th before it became solid.       On the 21st the solution that was
touched with the nucleus was reboiled with the addition of half an ounce

out at 8.35.       At 10.30 the temperature was 35°, and next morning nt
8 a.m. 31°.        The flask was now brought in and left on the mantle-shelf,
                                                                             loss

    P.S. August 17, 1871.— I may mention           that  the  suggestion made
above, that in an open space far from houses the results would be still
more perfect, has been realized by exposing in such a space supersaturated

 VII. " Note        on the   Spectrum of Encke's     Comet."     By William
         Huggins,      D.C.L., LL.D., V.P.R.S.       Received November 16,
         1871.
     I  give the following observations of Encke's comet, and of the spectrum
  of  its light, in the order of the dates of the evenings on which they were
  made.
     Oct    1 7. The comet presented the appearance of a nearly circular faint
  nebulosity, in which no condensation could be certainly distinguished.
      Nov. 7. By this time an important change had taken place in the ap
  pearance of the comet.       There was now a strong condensation of light
  towards the east.       The more condensed part of the comet, which was
  fan-shaped, was bounded on the eastern side by a tolerably defined con
  tour, which approached in form to a parabolic curve.          Surrounding this
  brighter portion of the comet was a much fainter nebulosity, of which the
  boundary on the eastern side appeared to form a line at right angles to the
  axis of the comet.
      I  suspected a very minute stellar nucleus just within the eastern extre
  mity of the brighter condensed part, and to a small extent north of the
   comet's axis.
      Nov. 8. The description given yesterday is applicable to the comet to
   night. The brighter part appears more defined and in stronger contrast
   to the fainter outlying nebulosity.     The nucleus is now visible with cer
   tainty.      On the western preceding side of the comet, the side towards the
   sun, the cometary light becomes gradually fainter and more extended until
   it is lost to view.
       On this evening the light of the comet was examined by the spectro
   scope.      The larger part of the light was resolved by the prism into a
   bright band in the green part of the spectrum.       The band was defined at

its   less     refrangible limit, and gradually faded towards the blue.                          The
micrometer gave 5160 mill iont hs of a millimetre as the wave-length of the
less    refrangible          boundary     of the band. Two other bright bands were
occasionally suspected ; one of them appeared to be about two thirds of
the distance from the bright band towards D, the other a little distance
beyond F.            No continuous spectrum could be detected. The nucleus was

 probably much too minute and faint to give a continuous                          spectrum that
could be seen.
     No difference in the spectrum                was seen when the slit v.:as moved over          the
comet in different directions, as far as its feeble light permitted.
     The spectrum of a hydrocarbon, giving the bands which appear to he
 due to carbon, was then reflected into the instrument, and observed simul
 taneously with that of the comet.                    The band in the green was found to he
 identical in position with the brightest of the bands of carbon, and to he
 similar in gradation of brightness from its less refrangible limit.
     Nov. 9. The observations of yesterday were confirmed.                             The second
 more refrangible            band,   which   was   then   caught only by glimpses, was found
 to be coincident with the third band in the carbon spectrum.                           The wave
 length of the less refrangible limit was about                       473;)""".    The least re
 frangible      of   the    three   cometary     bands   could  be seen  only occasionally.
     Nov. 12. The observations on this evening contain no new facts.
     Nov. 13. To-night the nucleus appears as a minute, well-defined stellar
 point.
     In  the spectroscope the three bands are distinctly seen.                       The position
 in the spectrum of the least refrangible band corresponds with the first
 band of the carbon spectrum                 ;  it commences from the red, with              a wave
length of about             5632nm.
     Attempts were made with a double•image prism, a Nicol's prism, and a
 Nicol's prism combined with a Savart's system of plates to detect
 polarized light in the comet, but without success.
     Nov.     14.    The form of the comet remains nearly the same.                        The out
lying nebulosity             is  now  chiefly  on   the  south  of the  axis of the   comet.     The
nucleus appears to be precisely at the extreme eastern limit of the brighter,
more condensed part of the comet.
     The    same spectrum was seen, but fog coming                   on interrupted      the obser
vations.
     On this evening             an attempt was made again to detect polarized            light.     A

double-image prism was placed between the eyepiece and the eye.                   The
prism    was brought   into four   different  positions  90°  apart.     At each posi
tion of the prism an attempt was made to estimate the relative brightness
of the two images.       The power of the prism was just sufficient to give two
images of the comet without their overlapping.             The difference in bright
ness of the images was exceedingly small ; I could not be certain that any
appreciable difference really existed.        However, I attempted in each case
to select one of the two images as the brighter one. Afterwards I deter
mined the position of the prism at the four different estimations, and                I
then found that three of the estimations were in accordance with a portion
of the comet's light being polarized in a plane passing through the sun,
and one in opposition to that supposition.            I hesitate to attach any posi
tive value to these observations ; but they may perhaps be taken as show
ing that no considerable part of the comet's light is polarized.
    The foregoing observations appear to show that the spectrum of this
comet is identical with that of Comet II. 1868, a description of which I
had the honour to present to the Royal Society*.
    It is worthy of notice that the cometary matter appears drawn out and
 diffused towards the sun, and that it has not yet come under the influence
of the force, or   been subjected to the conditions, whatever they may be, by
which in most      cases cometary      matter appears to be powerfully        repelled
from the sun.
    The observations were made with the telescope belonging to the Royal
 Society, of 1 5 inches aperture. The spectroscope contained one prism with
 n refracting angle of GO, and the small observing telescope magnified six
times.

  We havo lost this year three distinguished Fellows of our Society, — Sir
John Herschel, Mr. Babbage, and Sir Roderick Murchison. Of the first-
uamed, and most illustrious, Sir John Herschel, you might well expect
from me a much moro than ordinary notice ; but, happily, such a notice
(at once far more worthy of the occasion than any thing which could have I
been competent to furnish, and more full than could have fallen within the
limits of an Anniversary Address) will bo in your hands within a few days
in our Obituary Notices.     Iwould only add my own most warm and cor
dial assent to every part thereof which falls within my capability of judg
ment. The deaths of Mr. Babbage and of Sir Roderick Murchison aro more
recent ; but we may bo sure that the caro of our excellent senior Secretary
will, at the proper time, supply suitable obituary notices of their scientific
achievements, — perhaps, in the case of Mr. Babbage, obtaining such a
notice from some eminently qualified member of the great University to
which ho belonged. All these three gentlemen wero of advanced age, and
the health of all threo had been failing for a more or less considerable in
terval ; yet it is comparatively but a short time since the last departed
(Sir Roderick Murchison) still displayed such an energetic and vigorous ac
tivity as will make his loss severely felt, most especially by the Royal
 Geographical   Society, from whom and from the Geological      Society largo
 and worthy notices may doubtless be expected in their respective obituaries ;
 while our own obituary may contain such a brief but valuable statement of
 the wider bearings of his geological labours as may still come appro
 priately from the Royal Society.  It might bo an indulgence to myself, but
 perhaps scarcely appropriate from this Chair,       if,

cable and desirable, iu the present building at Kcw belonging to Her
Majesty's Government ; or in the event of the Government at any time
declining to continue to place that building at the disposition of the Royal
Society, then in any other suitable building which the Council of tho
 lloyal Society may determine.        It is further provided that, " in the event
 of tho Royal Society at any futuro time declining to continue such an
 observatory, either, as at present, at Kcw or elsewhere, the securities pro
 ducing the income shall bo transferred to another corporation for educa
 tional purposes."      The cost of tho meteorological observations by self-re
 cording instruments at Kew is at present defrayed from public funds
 placed at tho disposal of a Committee nominated, at the request of Her
 Majesty's Government, by our President and Council, and consisting of
 Fellows of tho Society serving gratuitously.         Carrying out Mr. Gassiot's
 views, tho Council     of  the Royal Society   has formed  the same individuals
         "
 into a Kcw Committee," also serving gratuitously, and having the proceeds
  of tho Gassiot Fund at their disposal, and applying them to the maintenance
  of magnetical observations by self-recording instruments primarily ; and
  secondarily, as far as may bo practicable, to aiding any other suitable
 physical investigations for which it may be possible to find spaco and
  adequate supervision.
      Among tho first duties which have required the attention of the Kew
  Committeo has been the agreeable one of responding to an application made
  to them by  Dr. Jclinek, Director of the Central- Anstalt fur Meteorologie und
  Erdmagnctismus, to procure for that establishment a set of self-recording
  magnetographs similar to those at Kew.          The request has been of course
  complied with; and it is hoped that tho apparatus will be ready for
  transmission to Vienna iu March next, being the time named by Dr.
  Jelinek as that at which tho new building in courso of erection in that
  city is expected to be completed. The Committee has also been apprised
  by a letter (dated in Juno last) from Mr. Stone, Astronomer Royal at
  the Capo of Good Hope, that ho had at that date applied to the Admiralty
   (being the Department of Her Majesty's Government under which the Cape
   Observatory is placed) for a set of magnetographs, similar to those at Kcw,
   to be employed at the Cape.      Tho Kew Committee hold themselves in readi
   ness  to supply tho desired apparatus when they may reccivo directions
   to  that effect from the Admiralty ; such directions, however, have not
   yet been received.      If Mr. Stone's request is granted, tho Cape Observa
   tory will  bo the  third in the British Colonial Dominions      employing such
   instruments,   the other two being tho        Colaba Observatory, under Mr.
  -Chambers, at Bombay (for which our thanks arc due to Sir Stafford       North

1871.]                                    President's AdSess.                                       51
cote, when Secretary of State fo/lndia), and the Mauritius Observatory,
under Mr. Meldrum (that establishment itself, as well as its magnetographs,
being mainly due to the action of'Sir Henry Barkly, F.lt.S., when Governor
of that colony).
   The care of our Foreign Secretary in watching scientific proceedings in
other countries has recently called our attention to the investigation of a
new feature in the cosmical connexions of terrestrial magnetism, in a paper
by Professor  Hornstein, of Prague, entitled, " On the dependence of the
Earth's Magnetism on the Potation of the Sun"          From an examination
                                                                        *'.
of the magnetic records at Prague and Vienna, Professor Hornstein infers
the existence of periodic magnetic disturbance in very close accord with
                          a
the synodic period of the rotation of the sun-spots in tho sun's equator.
  As the existence of the Great Melbourne Telescope    in no small dogreo     is
owing to the exertions of Members of this Society, and to their influence,
you will be glad to hear that       now in regular and successful work,
                                               it   is
after several difficulties             and misadventures,            such as often occur        in the
early trials of uncommon instruments or new sorts of observations.  Some
of these will be found in the volume of correspondence which your Council
has thought    desirablo to publish, both as containing
                 it                                        complete history       a

also as presenting     collection of the opinions of persons whose know
                              a
ledge  of large telescopes must make these opinions specially valuablo
to any who may hereafter be engaged in similar undertakings.    In parti
cular one matter, about which considerable apprehension was  entertained,
the rcpolishing the specula at Melbourne, has been well performed.    Tho

may best be published, especially the drawings of nebula;    ; but there is no
doubt that this will soon be overcome.
    In  my Address of 1869    I had the pleasure of announcing to the Society
the advanced state of the fine equatorially-mountcd telescope, fitted more
especially for spectroscopic research (therefore rather for celestial physics
than for more strictly astronomical work), which, while it was to remain
the property of the Royal Society, was intended by the President and
 Council to be placed in the able and zealous hands of Mr. Huggins, who
was preparing     at his own expense a suitable building for its reception.
 The necessary spectroscopic apparatus for use with it has not been long
 completed ; but some of our Fellows are aware that Mr. Huggins has been
 already doing work with this fine instrument in his observations of the
 spectrum of Uranus, and in his quite recent examination of the spectrum
 of Encke's Comet, which he finds to agree with that of carbon, and to be
 apparently identical with that of Comet II. 1868, of which a description
 appears in the Phil. Trans, for 1868, p. 555.     His other observations have
 been hitherto mainly confirmatory of those he had previously obtained of
 the spectra of the nebula; and stars; but he hopes for more definite results
 regarding the approach or recession of stars, and in particular the rate of
 the recession of Sirius.
     In  my last Address  I spoke with pleasure of the approaching completion
 of the fino series of Pendulum Experiments extending throughout the
 continent    of India, from Cape Comorin to the high tablelands of the
 Himalayas (to which it was further proposed to add two stations on the
 homeward route, t. e. Aden, and a station near the " Bitter Lakes "). Of
 this magnificent series, designed to comprise thirty Indian stations, twenty-
 five Indian stations had then been completed by the skilled and inde
 fatigable exertions of Captain Basevi of the Royal Engineers.        Only five
 more remained, one on the Indus, and four in the higher Himalayas ; but,
  alas ! while engaged on these, Captain Basevi's health yielded to the com
  bined effects of arduous exertion, of climate, and finally of mountain
 exposure.     His last completed station (to the south of Leh, in lat. 33°)
 was at an altitude of 15,500 feet. He then proceeded to one still higher,
  closely approaching 17,000 feet, which was to be the last of all, and there
  died.   His character, services, and the sacrifice of his valuable life have
 received a fitting tribute from his immediate chief, Colonel Walker, head of
 the Trigonometrical Survey of India.       We may securely anticipate that,
 under the superintending care of Colonel Walker, not only will the pro
  gramme of operations in India be carried out with entire satisfaction, but
  also that effectual provision will be made for that repetition of the deter
  minations in England which is essential to the completion and full
  assurance of the scientific results of Captain Basevi's labours in this great
  undertaking.

 ] 87 1 .]                     President's Address.                            53
    The existence of a Lunar Atmosphoric Tide, as indicated by differences
of barometric pressure corresponding systematically to differences of
the moon's position relatively to the meridian, has received a further con
firmation by tho discussion by Mr. Bcrgsma, of the Royal Netherlands
Observatory at Batavia, of a series of hourly observations of the ba
rometric pressure at that Observatory, extending (Sundays excepted) from
January 1866 to January 1869, made specially with a view to this in
vestigation.      The discussion is on tho same plan (slightly modified and
thereby improved) as that by myself of the observations at St. Helena,
from October 1843 to September 1845 inclusive, in tho Phil. Trans, for
 1847 ; and that by Captain Elliot of the observations at Singapore, from
 1841 to 1845, in the Phil. Trans, for 1852.          The results, as regards the
 existence of the periodic tide, are substantially the same in the three cases,
 but may probably be more approximatively exact in value in the more recent
 investigation.     From the observations of tho three years at Batavia, Mr.
 Bergsma finds that the Lunar Tide has at that station two maxima and
 two minima.        The two highest barometric pressures are those for the
 lunar hours 1 and 13, being the hours following the two passages of tho
 moon through the meridian.         The two lowest pressures are those for the
 lunar hours 7 and 19, being those following the two passages of the
 moon through the horizon.         The means found for each of the years 1866,
 1867, and 1868 show nearly the same features as the means for the
three years.      The difference between the mean of tho two maxima and
the mean of the two minima is 0-107 millim. at Batavia: this dif
ference was found for St. Helena 0-094 millim., and for Singapore 0-145
 millim.
    The Fellows will remember that in my two last Addrosses (for 1869 and
           I
 1870) referred to the valuable memoirs of Professor Heer, of Zurich, on
the fossil plants brought of late, at various times, from the Arctic regions.       "*
 Professor Nordenskiold revisited the shores of West Greenland in 1 870 ;
 and on learning that ho had given the principal geological facts and fossils
                                                       I
 collected in that expedition to Professor Heer, lost no time in communi
 cating with the latter gentleman, and received from him (through Mr.
 Robert Scott, F.R.S., Director of the Meteorological Office) a reply, which
 appeared to me so interesting that      I  placed  it in the hands of Sir Charles
 Lyell, asking him, if   ho would bo so    kind, to  furnish me with a notice suf
ficiently brief to be included in this Address.                             I
                                                       He has done so, and sub
join   it  in his own  words : — " The first voyage of Parry in 1819-20 made
 " the naturalist acquainted with the marvellous fact that plants similar to
 " those of our ancient coal once flourished in Melville Island, lat. 75° N. ;
 " and now wo learn more exactly, from the fruits of Nordcnskiold's late
 " Expedition, that the arctic plants of that early Palreozoic period are not      V
" only traceable over a wide area, but that not a few of them are identical
" with European species ; and it is remarkable that the specimens which
"   have been brought    from these high latitudes are equal in size and show

" as vigorous a growth as those found fossil in Europe.          Plants that are
" comparatively modern, of Miocene date, discovered hy various explorers
" in Greenland and Spitsbergen, had already testified to the existence of a
" mild climate in Tertiary times, such as formerly prevailed in Central
" Europe, and which, according to Heer, had probably reached to the pole
" itself. Now we learn, from the same eminent botanist, that the fossils
" brought in 1870 from Atarne and Atarnekerdluk, in Greenland, by Nor-
"  denskibld and his companions, throw light on the flora of a geological
" period, the Cretaceous, intermediate between the Carboniferous and Mio-
"  cene  ; for among these newly found fossils       are plants referable both
"  to the Lower and Upper Cretaceous formation, which prove, says Pro-
"  fessor Hecr, that in these high latitudes,       as  in Central Europe,    the
" Lower Cretaceous flora consisted principally of Ferns, Conifers, and
" Cycads ; while in the Upper Cretaceous, Dicotyledoncs appear ; and both
" these great divisions of the Upper Mesozoic flora show a warmer climate
" than the Miocene."
    It is satisfactory to learn that there is a probability that these researches
will   be resumed    in 1872 by a   second North-German Expedition to East
Greenland.
    The Scientific Institutions and establishments of our country have been
honoured this summer by long and careful visits from His Majesty Pedro
II., Emperor of Brazil, whose remarkable competence to appreciate such
Institutions may be said to be universally recognized. At a recent Meet
ing of tho Royal Society, we have had the pleasure of enrolling His
Majesty's name in tho List of our Fellows.         We have only to regret the
Emperor's unavoidable absence from our Meetings ; unavoidable because
the Society having been in recess during his visit to England, the election
could not havo taken place until the new Session, when he had quitted our
shores. It was pleasing to hear on this occasion, from Fellows distin
guished in different branches of science, the warm and competent testimony
borne to his Majesty's acquirements and to his rare scientific intelligence.
    As your President,    I have been called upon, by the Royal Commission on
Scientific Instruction and the Advancement of Science, to give evidenco re
garding the assistance which, in the course of the last fifty years, has been
rendered from time to time by Her Majesty's Government in the advance
ment of science, on the recommendation of the Scientific Institutions of the
country, and especially on the recommendation of tho Royal Society.
The evidence thus given has been printed by tho direction of the Commis
sion, and is procurable in the usual manner.
    I  proceed to the award of the Medals.
     The Copley Medal has been awarded to Dr. Julius Robert Mayer, of Heil-
 bronn, for his researches on the Mechanics of neat, including essays on : —
 1. The Forces of Inorganic Nature ; 2. Organic Motion in connexion with

1871.   J                    President's Address.                                 55
Nutrition ; 3. Fever ; 4. Celestial Dynamics ; 5. The Mechanical Equiva
lent of Heat.
    Imay presume that the last named, viz. tho Mechanical Equivalent of
Heat, though not the solo, is yet tho principal ground on which the award
of the Copley Medal was made ; and, so far as this may have been tho
case, the award may perhaps be considered to require some explanation on
the part of tho President and Council, inasmuch as this is the second of
two Copley Medals awarded (and,        I
                                    believe, in each case rightly awarded)
for what may, perhaps, bo mainly regarded as one and tho same dis
covery, — the later (which is the present award to Dr. Mayer) being for
investigations earlier in date than those of our countryman Mr. Joule, to
whom the first Medal of the two was awarded.        This seeming inconsistency
can,    I
        believe, be fully justified.   Seeing also the scientific interest of tho
history of the double investigation,       I
                                         have thought it desirable to obtain a
short but comprehensive notice on the subject from the able hands of our
junior Secretary, Professor Stokes ; it is as follows : —
    " In a paper published in 1842, Mayer showed that he clearly conceived
 " the convertibility of falling force, or of tho vis viva, which is its equiva-
 " lent or representative in visible motion, into heat, which again can dis-
" appear as heat by reconversion into work or vis viva, as the case may bo.
 " Ho pointed out the mechanical equivalent of heat as a fundamental
" datum, like the space through which a body falls in one second, to bo
" obtained from experiment. Ho went further. When air is condensed
 " by tho application of pressure, heat, as is well known, is produced.
 " Taking the heat so produced as the equivalent of tho work done in com-
 " pressing tho air, Mayer obtained a numerical value of the mechanical
"   equivalent of heat which, when     corrected by employing a more preciso
"   valuo of the specific heat of air than that accessible to Mayer, does not
"   much differ from Joule's result.     This was undoubtedly a bold idea,
"   and tho numerical     valuo   obtained by Mayer's method         is,   as we now
"   know, very nearly correct.      Nevertheless     it   must bo observed that an
"   essential condition in a trustworthy determination     wanting in Mayer's
                                                              is
"   method  ; the portion of matter operated on does not go through a cycle        of
"   changes.   Mayer reasons as   ifthe production of heat were the sole effect
"   of the work done in compressing air.             But the volume of tho air     is
"   changed     at the same time, and      quite impossible to say priori
                                           it   is                           it
"   whether this change may not involve what        analogous to the statical
                                                       is
"   compression of spring, in which
                    a                 portion,
                                           a    or even   large portion of tho
                                                              a
"   work done in compression may have been expended.   In that caso tho
"   numerical result given by Mayer's method would have been erroneous,
"   and might have been even widely erroneous.  Hence the practical cor-
"   rectness of the equivalont obtained by Mayer's method must not lead us
"   to shut our eyes to the merit of our own countryman Joule, in being tho
"   first to determine the mechanical equivalent of heat by methods which
 " arc unexccptiouable, as fulfilling the essential condition that no ultimate
 "
   change of state   produced in the matter operated upon."

by   the Royal Society for the long, laborious, and valuable researches with
which from time to time you have enriched our Transactions.

   I  present you with this Medal in testimony of the appreciation by the
Royal Society of tho results of your researches in Zoology, Physiology, and
Comparative Anatomy.
    In  conclusion,   I desire to avail myself of this occasion to express my
warmest acknowledgments to the Fellows of the Society for the kind con
sideration which     I  have received from them at all times and in all circum
stances,  and, in particular, for their attendance at, and thereby their sup
port of, the President's soirees, in which      I have attempted to follow in the
footsteps   of my  predecessors.     Since  the date of Sir Joseph Banks's Presi
dency, at the close of tho last century, it has been regarded as the privilege
of the President to receive the Fellows, either at his own house or at that
 of the Society, together with others whom ho might think it would be
 agreeable to them to meet.          There has thus been afforded to persons
 engaged in mechanical or other inventions, auxiliary to science or other
 wise connected therewith, a convenient opportunity for tho exhibition
 and discussion of their various apparatus.        The soirees have also been de
 scribed, and   I   believe  justly  so, as affording   suitable opportunities for
 the interchange of kindly feeling and good companionship between tho
 President and the Fellows.           I  may venture to say that    I have found
 them thoroughly so in the ten years during which           I have had the honour
 of the Presidency ; and      I  beg  to  express my  grateful   acknowledgments
 accordingly to the Fellows, collectively and individually.

  1871.]   Mr. G. Gore     on the Solvent Power        of Liquid    Cyanogen.       67
     The extinct Phatcolomyt Mitchelli, indicated by remains brought to
  England in 1835 by Sir Thomas Mitchell, C.B., the discoverer of the
 bone-caves of Wellington Valley, Australia, is determined by specimens
 subsequently obtained by Prof. Alex. M. Thomson and Gerard Krefft,
 Esq., from the   same caves.     A  second species,     distinguished   by characters
 of the nasal bones, is called, after its discoverer, Phatcolomyt Krefftii.
 Modifications of the lacrymal, maxillary, and palatal bones in the existing
 kinds of Wombat are also applied to the determination of the fossils :
 specimens from the freshwater deposits of Queensland are thus shown to
 belong to the species, Phatcolomys Mitchelli, originally founded on fossils
 from the breccia-caves of New South Wales.              The author next proceeds
 to point out the characters of the mandible in existing Wombats available
 in the determination of extinct species of Phatcolomys.             On this basis he
 defines specimens which he provisionally       refers to his Phatcolomys Krefftii.
 He then points out the mandibular              characters of Phaseolomys Mit
 chelli, and shows that the existing Phaseolomys latifrons was represented
 by mandibular fossils from the breccia-caves of Wellington Valley. Pro
ceeding next to the description of fossil mandibular remains of the genus
 Phaseolomys, from the freshwater deposits of Queensland, the author
defines Phascolomyt Thomtoni, Phatc. platyrhinus, and Phatc. parvus.
The latter, seemingly extinct, species is markedly inferior in size to any
of the known existing species.       An account of the extinct kinds of Wom
bat, exceeding in size the existing species, will be the subject of a succeed
ing communication.        The present is illustrated by subjects occupying
seven plates and eight woodcuts, all the figures being from nature and of
the natural size.

glass of the annexed shape were employed.

    Each tube was closed at one end, and had a flanged mouth at the other.
The limb A was l£ inch long, the limb B 2 inches, and C 7 inches.
    In making the experiments, each tube was first filled, to an extent of
51 inches of its length, with highly dried crystals of mercuric cyanide ; a
small fragment of asbestus* was then pushed tightly against the end of the
cyanide by means of a thin rod of gutta percha, and the bend of the tube
cleaned by means of a slender brush.           A number of taper plugs of gutta
         * This may be dispensed with  if the mercuric cyanide is perfectly dry.
                                                                        G 2

percha were previously made by softening the end of a rod of that sub
stance in boiling water and then chilling it ; and loops of thin copper wire
were also prepared for the purpose of securing the plugs.
    Having placed in the bend of the tube the substance to be operated on,
a plug was wetted with chloroform and at once firmly inserted in the
mouth of the tube and secured by means of the wire.                   A wet rag was
wrapped round the limb B, and the portion of the limb C containing the
cyanide was inserted in a loosely fitting tube of copper foil within a tube of
wrought iron about two feet long, supported in a nearly horizontal                posi
tion, with the end D the lowest.
    A   vessel having been previously    arranged to drop cold water continually
upon the wet rag, a glass screen was placed by the side of the exposed
part of the glass tube, and heat was gradually applied, by means of a row
of Bunsen's burners, to the part of the iron tube containing the limb C.
In about four minutes liquid cyanogen began to form, and in about five
minutes longer about two inches in length of the bend was filled with
that liquid, and the heat was then discontinued.            The temperature of the
iron tube was below that of visible redness ; if the heat applied was not
too great the glass tube retained its original form, and might afterwards
be easily removed from its casing and set aside for future examination.               A
white fog, and signs of a heavy vapour in the bend of the tube, always
immediately preceded the formation of the liquid.                 In many instances
some     of the cyanogen retained the liquid state for several days, and even
weeks, especially if the bend of the tube was kept cool by means of a wet
sponge.
    The cyanide employed in the experiments should be crushed to a coarse
powder, and highly heated a long time, with constant stirring, until it is
of a slightly brown colour ; otherwise, immediately previous to the appear
ance of the liquid cyanogen, a small quantity of a brownish treacley liquid
distils over and affects the results.
    More than 130 substances, including solids and liquids, and a great
variety of simple and compound bodies, were subjected to the action of
the liquid ; the substances were, in nearly all cases, as free from moisture
as   it   was   possible  to obtain them.    The following      are  the results   ob

 deep red liquid.       Picric acid moderately soluble; the solution was yellow.
White phosphorus dissolved very slowly, and to but a small extent*.
 Gum benzoin, also white cane-sugar, dissolved slowly and sparingly.              Gum
assafoetida and gamboge dissolved slightly, and formed yellowish liquids.

became brown.         The gums myrrha and guaiacum coloured the liquid yel
lowish. Bisulphide of carbon, saturated with sulphur, rapidly set free its
sulphur in the form of crystals, the bisulphide being absorbed and dis
solved by the cyanogen.           A saturated solution of phosphorus in bisul

    III. " On    Fluoride of Silver.— Part      III."   By G. Gore, F.R.S.
                           Received October 6, 1871.
                                     (Abstract.)
    In this communication the author has finally shown that the action of iodine,
under the influence of heat (including the process described by Kammerer,
Phil. Mag. 1863, vol. xxv. p. 213, for the isolation of fluorine), does not
liberate uncombined fluorine, but produces fluoride of iodine and iodide of
silver, a double salt, composed of iodide of silver and fluoride of platinum,
being produced at the same time by corrosion of the platinum vessels, if
the temperature approaches a red heat.
    The fluoride of iodine produced is a highly volatile and colourless liquid,
does not corrode mercury or red-hot platinum, corrodes glass at 60° Fahr.,
and crystals of silicon at a red heat, also platinum in contact with argentic
fluoride in a state of fusion ; it instantly turns a deal splint black, fumes
powerfully in the air, and is decomposed with violence by water into
hydrofluoric and iodic acids, in accordance with the following equation       : —
IF, + 3HaO=5HF        + HI03.      It dissolves iodine, and is absorbed by that
substance ; it is also absorbed either by argentic fluoride or iodide when
those substances are cooled in its vapour, and may be expelled from them
at a red heat.    Its vapour quickly darkens the colour of a deal splint, and
very gradually    turns  paraffin brown.
   The platinum vessels in which the reaction with iodine was effected
were considerably corroded (but less so than when bromine or chlorine
were employed), and many expensive vessels were rendered useless by this
cause during the experiments.
    No chemical change occurred on heating argentic fluoride to redness
with pure carbon.
    By heating this fluoride to redness in a current of dried coal-gas, it was
wholly reduced to metallic silver, hydrofluoric acid and tetrafluoride of
carbon being evolved.
   In liquid   cyanogen, argentic fluoride neither dissolved nor suffered che
mical change ; but at a low red heat, in a current of dry cyanogen gas, it
was entirely reduced to metal, either nitrogen and tetrafluoride of carbon,
or fluoride of cyanogen being liberated.          An aqueous solution of silver
fluoride was precipitated by passing a prolonged current of cyanogen gas
through it.     Fluoride of silver was also decomposed by fusion with para-
cyanogen.
    Argentic fluoride was not dissolved or chemically changed by immer
sion in anhydrous liquified hydrocyanic acid ; but by passing the dry acid
in vapour over the red-hqjt salt, the latter was decomposed and metallic

   1871.]                 Mr. G. Gore      on Fluoride  of Silver.                  71
   silver liberated.    Aqueous hydrocyanic acid readily precipitated a solution
   of argentic fluoride.
       Fluoride of silver was not decomposed by heating it to redness in an
   atmosphere of carbonic oxide or carbonic acid gases ; but by prolonged
   passage of the mixed gases through an aqueous solution of the salt, a
   brown precipitate, soluble in aqueous hydrofluoric acid, was produced.
       By fusing the fluoride in a current of vaporous terchloride of carbon,
  it was wholly converted into argentic chloride, the vessels being much
  corroded,      and an insoluble    double salt of platinum and silver formed.
  Similar results took place on using tetrachloride of carbon. Silver fluoride
  was insoluble, and remained unchanged in liquid tetrachloride of carbon
  at 60° Fahr. ; and terchloride or tetrachloride of carbon had no chemical
  effect upon an aqueous solution of the silver-salt.      A solution of bromine or
  iodine in tetrachloride of carbon was quickly decolorized by agitation with
  small particles of argentic fluoride.
       Crystals of boron did not decompose fluoride of silver at a low red
  heat, nor chemically change at 60° Fahr. an aqueous solution of the salt
  containing either free hydrofluoric or nitric acids.
      'Vitrified  boracic acid violently decomposed fluoride of silver in a state
  of   fusion, emitting copious white acid fumes ; but it had no chemical
  effect upon an aqueous solution       of the salt at 60° Fahr.
      By placing crystals of silicon upon argentic fluoride in      a state of fusion,
  they become at once red-hot, undergoing rapid combustion, and evolving
  fluoride of silicon. A lump of fused silicon slowly decomposed an aqueous
 solution of fluoride of silver, setting free metallic silver in crystals.      Crys
 tals of silver     behaved    similarly, but much more rapidly, and evolved
 abundance of gas if the solution contained free hydrofluoric acid ; on add
 ing nitric acid to this mixture, bubbles of spontaneously inflammable sili-
 cide of hydrogen gas were evolved and ignited.
      Pure and dry precipitated silica added to fluoride of silver, at a tem
perature of low redness, evolved much heat, with violent action, and set
 free metallic silver.
     No chemical change took place on passing fluoride of silicon over red-
 hot fluoride of silver.
     Argentic fluoride in    a state of fusion is  rapidly decomposed by sulphur
with evolution of heat      ;  fluoride of sulphur is at the same time produced,
and argentic sulphide        formed.     To ascertain whether fluoride of sulphur
is a gas or a volatile liquid, an apparatus called a " gas-collector" was
devised and employed, and a full description of its construction is given. By
using this apparatus, substances may be heated without contact with the
external air, and without subjecting the joints of the apparatus in which
they are heated to leakage by expansion cr contraction of the gaseous
contents.
     Fluoride of sulphur was found        to be a heavy colourless vapour,   uncon-
densablc at the temperature of melting             ice and at the ordinary      atmo

spheric pressure.          It corrodes glass, fumes strongly in the air, and has a
characteristic and very powerful dusty odour, not very unlike that of a
mixture of chloride of sulphur and sulphurous anhydride.                           Sulphur
rapidly decomposed           an aqueous solution     of argentic fluoride.
     Sulphurous anhydride passed over fluoride of silver at an incipient red
heat, produced little or no decomposition of the silver-salt.                     Vaporous
fluoride of sulphur also produced no visible effect.
     By passing the vapour of liquid chloride of sulphur over the fluoride in
 a state of fusion, chemical action occurred, a vapour was evolved which
corroded glass and possessed a dusty odour, but did not condense to a
 liquid; it was probably fluoride of sulphur. The saline residue consisted of
 argentic chloride        and sulphide.       A solution of argentic fluoride was de
 composed        by  agitation   with   liquid chloride of sulphur, hydrofluoric acid
 being evolved, and argentic chloride and sulphide produced.
     Argentic fluoride did not dissolve in bisulphide of carbon.                By passing
 the vapour of the latter substance over the silver-salt at a red heat, a
 chemical change took place, and a fuming acid vapour was evolved, in
 accordance with the following equation : — 4AgF+CS2=2Ag3S + CF4.                           A
 solution     of  bromine    or iodine   in  bisulphide   of   carbon  was rapidly   decolo
 rized by agitation with particles of argentic               fluoride,  and the liquid ac
 quired the odour of tetrafluoride of carbon.

      Schunckf, and subsequently the author of this paper i, many years ago
 studied the action of chlorine upon orcin, and obtained more or less crys
  talline products, contaminated with a brown resinous matter, from which
  however, they did not succeed in separating the crystals in a state of purity.
  In the year       1864    De Luynes § obtained a crystalline substance by acting
  on orcin with a mixture of potassium chlorate and hydrochloric acid.                     De

                                    Chlororcin.
    Pentachlororcin, C7 H3 CI, O2. — This compound was obtained by the
action of chlorine upon orcin when the former was kept in excess.          Two
methods of effecting this object were employed, — the first by adding the
orcin to chlorine hydrate, the other by the action of potassium chlorate
and hydrochloric acid.
    A pulpy mixture of the crystalline hydrate of chlorine and water was
first prepared by passing a current of chlorine, with occasional agitation,
through water to which about one third of crushed ice had been added,
until a sufficient quantity of the hydrate was formed.      On gradually add
ing a moderately strong aqueous solution of orcin, a purple colour was
produced when the solution first came in contact with the chlorine hydrate,
but disappeared immediately on agitation.       The addition of the orcin was
continued until nearly all the chlorine hydrate was decomposed.         It was
always advisable to leave a slight excess of the latter, as a purer product
was then obtained, and also to have some crushed ice present in the mixture,
to avoid decomposition and consequent loss of the hydrate by the heat
produced during the reaction.         The colourless or pale yellow solution,
on standing, yielded a crystalline deposit of crude pentachlororcin.
    After many trials, however, it was found that pentachlororcin could
generally be more conveniently prepared in quantity by submitting orcin
 to the chlorinating action of a mixture of hydrochloric acid and potassium
chlorate   in the following manner : — Four parts of powdered potassium
chlorate and a solution of two parts of orcin in seven parts of hydrochloric
acid were added to 35 parts of hydrochloric acid, sp. gr. 1 . 1 7, placed in a
large beaker, and kept cool by immersion in water ; a small portion of the
potassium chlorate was first added to the hydrochloric acid in the beaker ;
on pouring in some of the solution of orcin, the same evanescent purple
colour made its appearance as when chlorine hydrate was used ; the alter
nate addition of the chlorate and the orcin solution was continued in such
a milliner that there might always be an excess     of chlorate, and that the
contents of the beaker never became very hot.       It was found necessary to
use concentrated hydrochloric acid in this experiment, as otherwise the
product was largely contaminated with a viscid oily compound.             After
twelve to twenty hours the crystalline chlororcin was collected and washed
with a small quantity of water.      Orcin treated with chlorine hydrate yields
nearly twice its weight of crude chlororcin, but with potassium chlorate and
hydrochloric acid about 150 per cent. of its weight.
    Iu order to purify the crude chlororcin obtained by either of the above-
described methods, it was dissolved when dry in a considerable quantity of
carbon disulphide (eight measures), filtered and concentrated by distillation
 (to one half).    On being set aside for some time it usually crystallized
out   ; but as it exhibits strongly the phenomenon of supersaturation, espe
cially when impure, it was sometimes necessary to agitate or add a crystal

 of the substance.        The solution then immediately deposited the chlororcin,
 and occasionally became hot enough to cause ebullition of the carbon disul-
 phide.      Two or three crystallizations rendered it quite pure.       Pentachlor-
 orcin crystallizes from carbon disulphide in large colourless prisms, melting at
  120°-5.      It is moderately soluble in bisulphide of carbon and benzol, and
 readily in ether.       It dissolves somewhat in cold alcohol, and when boiled
 with it for some time undergoes a chauge which I have not as yet investi
 gated, — water throwing down an oil which only solidifies after having been
 exposed to the air for some days in a shallow vessel.           The pentachlororcin
 is but very slightly soluble in water, to which, however, it communicates
 an exceedingly disagreeable and persistent bitter metallic flavour.          When
 boiled with water it is decomposed, an oil and a crystalline solid passing over
 with the vapour.         The oil, which has a peculiar odour, recalling that of
 chloropicrin, is heavier than water ; the solid compound crystallizes in
 needles, and is identical with the trichlororciu described below.            When
 heated with concentrated sulphuric acid it blackens and decomposes, giving
 off hydrochloric acid. It dissolves in nitric acid by the aid of heat, and
 crystallizes out unchanged on cooling.             The addition of water to the
 solution precipitates the pentachlororcin.         By long boiling with the acid it
 is decomposed with evolution of nitrous fumes.

    Trichlororcin, C7H,C1, O2. — When pentachlororcin was heated with
hydriodic acid to 100° it was decomposed, trichlororcin being formed
and iodine set free. The best method of conducting the operation, so as
to obtain a pure product, was to add the pentachlororcin in small portions
to a mixture of amorphous phosphorus and hydriodic acid, containing
eight or ten per cent. of iodine, and to digest between each addition until

1871.]           Bromine-substitution Compounds of            the   Orcins.             75
the liberated iodine had been reconverted into hydriodic acid.                   When all
the pentachlororcin had been introduced, the digestion was continued until
the trichlororcin appeared as a colourless oily layer at the bottom of the
flask.      On cooling, a considerable portion more crystallized out of the
hydriodic acid in colourless needles. The oily trichlororcin, which solidified
on cooling, was dissolved in a small quantity of spirit, filtered to separate
it from the excess of amorphous phosphorus, and the alcoholic solution
precipitated by water.         The amount of crude product thus obtained was
about 75 per cent. of the weight of the pentachlororcin originally employed.
One or two crystallizations from boiling water slightly acidified with acetic
acid rendered it quite pure.           If very pure pentachlororcin had not been
employed in the preparation the crude product was more or less coloured,
and could only be purified with considerable difficulty, as the colouring-
matter adheres to the trichlororcin with great obstinacy.                   It was found,
however, that several alternate crystallizations from benzol and petroleum-
oil, and a final crystallization from water, almost entirely removed the
brown colouring-matter.            It fuses to an oil under boiling water, in which
it  is moderately    soluble, crystallizing      out almost completely on cooling in
long colourless transparent needles, which become white and opaque when
 exposed to the air.       It is but sparingly soluble in carbon disulphide, mo
 derately in petroleum-oil, rather more so in benzol, and excessively soluble
 in ether and alcohol.          It  is soluble in boiling glacial acetic acid, and
 crystallizes out on cooling in thin transparent plates, which become white
 and opaque on the addition of water.               Trichlororcin melts at 123°, and
 when heated to a very much higher temperature it blackens and gives off
 hydrochloric acid, even under diminished pressure.                  It cannot, therefore,
 be   distilled in vacuo, but it passes over readily with the vapour of water.
 When heated for several hours to 180° with moderately strong hydriodic
acid and phosphorus, it was found to be reconverted into orcin, which could
 be extracted from the solution by agitating it with ether.               The addition of
 alcoholic ammonia      to  a solution    of the  trichlororcin   in  alcohol  threw down
 a white crystalline precipitate, but slightly soluble in water or alcohol.
 This compound, when dissolved in a large excess of dilute aqueous ammonia,
 and submitted to the action of metallic zinc in a close vessel at the ordinary
 temperature, yielded a colourless solution.              On exposing this to the air,
 however, it acquired a fine blue colour, which was changed to red by the
 action of acids.      Further investigation will no doubt show the nature of
 this compound.

 many attempts     were   made   to prepare        trichlororcin      by his method with
varying proportions of the materials, pentachlororcin was invariably ob
 tained, contaminated, however, in some instances, with a large amount of
viscid oily impurities.        I conclude, therefore, that De Luynes's tri
chlororcin was either isomeric with that above described, or that it was an
impure substance.

                                      —    This compound was readily formed by
the action of   an excess of bromine on orcin.               Seven parts of bromine and
about 200 of water were placed in a stoppered bottle, and a moderately
strong aqueous solution of one part of orcin added by small portions, with
constant agitation.      The yellow crystalline product thus obtained, amount
mg to 370 per cent. of the weight of the orcin, was then collected, and
purified by repeated crystallization          from carbon disulphide, in a manner
similar to the corresponding chlorine compound.                    It is almost insoluble in
water, very soluble in alcohol and ether, and moderately so in benzol and
carbon disulphide, from the latter of which it may be obtained in very large
and almost colourless transparent crystals.                  It melts at 126°, and when
boiled with water appears to undergo a decomposition similar to the penta
chlororcin. Heated with concentrated sulphuric acid it gradually dissolves,
and on continuing the heat hydrobromic acid and bromine are evolved in
abundance.      Like the corresponding chlorine compound, it dissolves in hot
nitric acid, crystallizing   out again on cooling, but is at the same time far
more readily decomposed.          When boiled with amorphous phosphorus and
moderately strong hydriodic acid it is rapidly decomposed, and passes
into solution probably as orcin.       With very weak hydriodic acid, however,
containing about     one  per cent.  of   iodine and excess of amorphous phos
phorus,   the  decomposition     takes   place     more gradually, and a heavy oily
layer is obtained, which solidifies ou cooling.               This, after purification,       was

    Pentachlororcin hypochlorite,      C7 H4 Cl6   O, =   C7 H3 Cl5 Oa, H CI O.— A
white crystalline substance was obtained in endeavouring to prepare penta
chlororcin by the action of calcium hypochlorite and hydrochloric acid on
orpin ; but as it appeared to differ somewhat from that compound it was
carefully examined.       After some trials the following was found to be the
best method of preparation : — Five parts of orcin were dissolved in a mix
ture of four measures of hydrochloric acid, sp.gr. 1 • 1 7, with four measures
of water    ; and this solution was then gradually added to a moderately strong
clear solution of calcium hypochlorite, taking care to leave the latter in
excess.      The liquid, which has a milky appearance, was then strongly aci
dulated with hydrochloric acid, and allowed to stand 24 hours, when it
deposited a considerable quantity of white crystals.            These were collected,
dried, and purified by crystallization from benzol, as, unlike pentachlor
orcin, they are but sparingly soluble in carbon disulphide.            When pure it
crystallizes in transparent prisms of great dispersive power.             It is very
 soluble in ether, moderately so in light petroleum-oil,         and almost  insoluble
in water.      When heated with hydriodie acid and phosphorus it is decom
 posed, but apparently without the formation of trichlororcin.             It is very
 soluble in alcohol, and after boiling the solution for some time the addition
of water causes the precipitation of an oil, which solidifies if exposed to the
 air for  a few days.    When the substance is boiled with water the latter
 becomes milky, and gives off pungent vapours. The hypochlorite dissolves
 in hot nitric acid, and crystallizes out on cooling ; hot concentrated sul
 phuric acid decomposes it. It has a considerably higher melting-point
 than pentachlororcin, namely 140o,5. The following results were obtained

    Pentachlorresorcin,      Ce H CI,   Oa.
                                            —An      attempt was made to obtain a
 chlorresorcin   by submitting    resorcin   to   the  action of chlorine hydrate in a
 manner similar to that which had been so successfully employed in pre
 paring pentachlororcin ; but the results obtained were unsatisfactory, the
 product being very small in comparison to the resorcin taken, and even that
 so contaminated with oily impurities that further examination was deemed
 inexpedient.      The action of potassium chlorate and hydrochloric acid,
 however, gave a much more favourable result.                  Five parts of potassium
 chlorate and a solution of two parts of resorcin in eight of hydrochloric
 acid were gradually added to forty parts of hydrochloric acid, which was
 prevented from becoming very hot by immersion in cold water. The ope
 ration was conducted in a manner similar to that previously described in
 the preparation^ pentachlororcin ; but more care was required to obtain a
successful result, and the amount of product was comparatively small, about
 70 per cent, of the resorcin.        The crystalline compound which is deposited
on standing was collected, and, after being simply pressed to remove some
of the mother-liquor, boiled with a considerable quantity of carbon disul-
phide.      The supernatant aqueous layer          was then separated     by means of a
separating-funnel, and the greater portion of the carbon disulphide removed
by distillation.    When sufficiently concentrated the anhydrous chlorresorcin
crystallized out in brilliant colourless plates or flattened prisms.             One or
two recrystallizations rendered it pure.            The crude product of the action
of the chlorate and hydrochloric acid on resorcin appeared to consist prin
cipally of   a hydrate   of the chlorresorcin,      as when    it was rapidly heated for
a short time with a comparatively small proportion of carbon disulphide,
and the solution filtered, it deposited a white crystalline compound in minute
scales, sparingly soluble in the disulphide.            On submitting the solution to

   The analyses of those chlorine and bromine derivatives of resorcin that
have just been described thoroughly establish the existence of the com
pounds C6 H Cl5 02 and C„ H Br5 02, which closely resemble in their pro
perties the corresponding pentachlororcin, C7 H3 Cl5 02, and pentabrom-
orcin, C7 H3 Br, 02, obtained from ordinary orcin.               The view of the con
stitution   of the orcins put forth by Kekule', who regards them as dihy-
droxyl   derivatives    of the benzols, is scarcely in accordance with the method
of formation and composition of these compounds, as in the case of the
pentabromresorcin         five hydrogen atoms in the resorcin are undoubtedly
directly replaced by bromine, although one of them, according to Kekule" s
view, exists as hydroxy 1.
   An attempt      was made to prepare the resorcin body corresponding to that
obtained from orcin by the action of calcium hypochlorite and hydro
chloric acid, and which I have designated pentachlororcin hypochlorite, but
without success.         The product was a very viscid oil, which showed no
signs  of  solidification     even after standing for some weeks, and from which
I was unable to obtain any crystalline compound.

                              Received October 11, 1871.
   In  a paper which         I communicated to the Royal Society of London in
 1850*,    "On     the Oils produced by the Action of Sulphuric Acid upon
various    Classes of Vegetables," after describing the sources, method of
preparation, and characteristic properties of furfurol and its educts, I de
scribed another isomeric substance closely resembling furfurol, both in its
physical and chemical properties, and which             I  named fucusol from the
source whence it had been obtained, namely, Fucus               nodosum, F. veiiculosus,
F. serratus, &c.
   The nature of the substance which yielded furfurol was involved in
considerable obscurity until the publication of Gudkow's paper

                                            Fucusol.
    I  Lave found     that when seaweeds            were boiled with       very dilute      sul
phuric acid, containing about           3 per cent,       of acid, that a substance cor
responding to that described by Gudkow was obtained, which, when
distilled' with sulphuric or hydrochloric acid, yielded fucusol.                        In my
paper of the year 1850 I have described the difference in the physical
properties of furfurol and fucusol, and also the difference between the pro
ducts obtained by the action of ammonia upon them and the bases derived
from these.      I have again repeated the examination of these substances
 with great care, and find my former statements to be correct.                    In addition
 to these, I have recently prepared the aniline compound analogous to fur-
furaniline *. Fucusaniline hydrochlorate crystallizes in needles of a mag
nificent purple     colour,    and closely resembles the corresponding                 furfurol
compound.
    As is well     known    f,   when furfurol is hoiled with water                and    silver
oxide, metallic silver is deposited and silver pyromucate formed, the latter
remaiuing in solution.         In a similar manner I found that when fucusol was
digested at 100° C. for five or six hours with an excess of recently pre
cipitated silver oxide and a considerable quantity of water, its odour gra
 dually disappeared, and at the completion of the reaction a silver-salt was
found     in solution,   whilst    metallic    silver was deposited, partly in a gra
nular state and partly as a mirror, on the bottom of the flask.                      Sufficient
 hydrochloric    acid  was    then    added    to   the  hot  filtered   solution  to  precipi
tate the silver.      After the removal of the argentic chloride it was care
fully evaporated at         a  temperature below 100° and the brown semi-
crystalline mass thus obtained boiled with light petroleum-oil, which dis
solved the acid and left the colouring-matter.                     One or two crystalliza
tions from boiling water rendered            it quite pure.

        De La Rue, D.C.L., F.R.S., Balfour Stewart, F.R.S., and
        Benjamin Loewy, F.R.A.S.                 Received October 12, 1871.
    1.   In the short account of some recent investigations by Professor Wolf
and M. Fritz on sun-spot phenomena, which has been published lately in
the 'Proceedings of the Royal Society' (1871, vol. xix. p. 392), it was
pointed out that some of Wolf's conclusions were not quite borne out by
the results which we have given in our last paper on Solar Physics in the
Philosophical Transactions for 1870, pp. 389-496. A closer inquiry into
the cause of this discrepancy has led us to what appears a definite law,
connecting numerically the two branches of the periodic sun-spot curve,
viz. the time during which there is a regular diminution of spot-produc
tion, and the time during which there is a constant increase.
    It will be well, for the sake of clearness, to allude here again, as briefly
as possible, to Professor      Wolf's results before stating those     at which   we
have arrived.
    2. Professor    Wolf had previously devoted the greater part of his laborious
researches to a precise determination of the mean length of the whole sun-
spot period, but latterly he has justly recognized the importance of obtain
ing   some    knowledge of the average character of the periodic increase and
decrease.       Hence he has, as far as he has been able to do so by existing
series    of observations, and his peculiar and ingenious method of rendering
observations made at different times and by different observers comparable
with each other, endeavoured to investigate more closely the nature of the
periodic sun-spot curve by tabulating and graphically representing the
monthly means taken during two and a half years before and after the

   (1) It is shown now, with greater precision than was previously pos
sible, that the curve of sun-spots ascends with greater rapidity than it
descends. This fact is shown in the subjoined diagram, which it may be
of interest to compare with the curves given previously by ourselves in the
above-mentioned place.       The zero-point in this diagram corresponds to
the minimum of each period ; the abscissae give the time before and after
it, viz. two and    half years, or thirty months the ordinates express the

and presuming that the behaviour is approximately the same throughout

                                                                     \   descent    cor

the other hand,       in the minimum of 1833-8, and still more in that of

    4. Finally, Professor Wolf arranged in the manner shown in the follow
ing Table the successive minima and maxima, in order to arrive at some
generalization which might enable him to foretell the general character and
length of a future period.         Taking the absolute differences in time of every
 two successive maxima, and the mean differences of every two alternating
minima, he shows that the greatest acceleration of both maximum and mi
 nimum happens together.            This result strengthens our own conclusions,
 to be immediately stated, by new evidence, as it is derived from observa
 tions antecedent to the time over which our researches extend.

     From this Professor Wolf predicts for the present period a very accele
  rated maximum     — a prediction which seems likely to be fulfilled.
     5. Comparing, now, M. Wolf's results with our own, it must not be
  overlooked, in judging of the agreement or discrepancy of these two inde
  pendently obtained sets, that our facts have been derived from the actual
  measurement and subsequent calculation of the spotted area from day to
  day since 1833 recorded by Schwabe, Carrington, and the Kew solar
  photograms, which measurements are expressed as millionths of the sun's

187 1 .]          on some recent Researches in Solar Physics.                               85
visible hemisphere, while the conclusions of M. Wolf are founded on cer
tain " relative numbers," which give the amount of observed spots on an
arbitrary   scale, chiefly designed to make observations made at different
times and by various observers comparable with each other.                           This will
obviously, in addition to the sources of error to which our own method is
liable, introduce     an amount of uncertainty arising from errors of estima
tion and the possibility of using for a whole series an erroneous factor of
reduction.      Nevertheless we shall find a very close agreement in various
important    results   ; and this seems a sufficient proof of the great value and
reliability of M. Wolfs "relative numbers," especially for times previous
to the commencement of regular sun observations.
    6. The following is a comparison of the data of periodic epochs, as fixed

    It will be seen from this comparison that only one appreciable difference                  .
occurs, viz. in the maximum of 1847, which              M. Wolf fixes nearly          one and
 a quarter years before our date.
    The   mean    length of a period is found by us to be 11-07 years, which
agrees very    well  with M. Wolf's value, viz. 1 1- 1 years.

 and descent of the graphic curve, beginning with the minimum of 1833 : —

    Professor   Wolf gives 37 years and 7'4 years for the                 ascent and descent
 respectively  ;  and considering         that he derived these         numbers only from
 an investigation     of  a portion    of   each period, the agreement is indeed sur
 prising, and would by itself suggest that the times of ascent and descent
 are connected by a definite law.
    8.   M. Wolf   has expressed in general terms the          following law with refer
 ence to this relation     of increase and decrease of spots : —

     We, on the other hand, have, by            an inspection     of our curves (vide Phil.
  Trans. 1 870, p. 393), been induced            to make the following       remark on the
  same question    : —
     " We   see that the second curve, which was longer in period as a whole
  than either of the other two, manifests this excess in each               of its branches,
  that is to say, its left or ascending branch is larger as a whole than the
  same branch of the other two curves, and the same takes place for the
  second or descending branch.           On the other hand, the maximum of this
 curve is not so high as that of either of the other two ; in fact the curve
  has the appearance as if it were pressed down from above, and pressed out
 laterally so as to lose in elevation what it gains in time."
     Although both statements appear to lead up to the same conclusion,
 viz. that ascent and descent are connected by a law, still they differ essen
 tially in this respect, that if A, B, 0 represent the three following consecu
 tive events,    descent,   ascent,    descent, Professor       Wolfs law refers to the
 connexion between        A   and B, while our remark refers to B and C.                  We
 consider two successive minima as the beginning and end of a single period,
 while M. Wolf, at least in this particular research, places the minimum
 within the period, and compares the descent from the preceding maximum
 with the ascent to the next one.
     9. We have considered the connexion thus indicated of sufficient im
 portance to apply to it the following test. If, using the previous notation,
 a definite relation exists between A and B, the ratio of the times which
 the events occupy in every epoch ought to be approximately constant ;
 similarly with respect to B and C ; and this ratio should not be influenced
 by the absolute duration of the two successive events.                 It is clear that the
 greater uniformity of these ratios will be a test for their interdependence.

    These differences from the mean are so considerable, that in the present

important    relation    seems,  however,     to   result from    a similar comparison of
any ascent and the immediately succeeding descent, or between B and C.

   The agreement of these ratios with each other, and the small differences
from the mean of the single ratios, justify us in the mean time, until a
greater number of periods are before us, to state the connexion between
the two branches of the periodic curve from one minimum to another in
the following more precise terms : —
   IfTbe     the time of duration of sun-spot increase from a minimum to a
maximum, then 2' 1 5 X T {with a probable error of less than + 0'05) will
be the duration    of the sun-spot decrease until the next minimum.
   This law, together with the fact which we have previously established,
that   a longer period shows generally a depressed curve, while a shorter is
characterized by great peaks, points strongly to the conclusion that the
energy of the ultimate causes of sun-spot production, whether these causes
be  intrasolar or extrasolar, is for      every   period constant.

   The first three figures which accompany this note represent the comet
on   evenings on which its appearance was described in a note on the
spectrum of the comet which I had the honour to present to the Royal
Society*. A continuance of bad weather prevented me from making later
observations of the comet, with the exception of one evening, December 5,
when figure 4 was obtained under unfavourable circumstances.
   Fig. 1. November 7, 7.30 p.m. — From Oct. 17, when the comet con
sisted of a nearly round nebulosity without condensation in any part,
to Nov. 7 no observations could be obtained.               At the latter date, the re
markable fan-form      which distinguishes this appearance of the comet was
already distinctly presented.        The faint light by which the comet was sur
rounded terminated on the side from the sun, that from which the tail is
usually projected, in a straight boundary at right angles to the longer axis
of the comet. At the opposite side, that towards the sun, the faint nebu
losity expanded and became fainter until it could be no longer traced. The

situated not at             the extreme western point, but a little within towards theit,
north.
  The         of the fan were slightly curved, suggesting an approach to
          sides                                                                                  a

faint light            by

an angle      of from 85°         to 90°.
  The nucleus bad become brighter, and now appeared to form the extreme
eastern point of the fan.
  No prolongation of the eastern boundary, where the tail        usually                    is
formed, was seen.

brighter parts only of the comet to be satisfactorily observed.
   The condensation of light was now much stronger at the eastern end, but
a   defined nucleus was not detected.
    The fan form            was less marked       ;   the brighter part of the comet more re
sembled       a   brush-like     flame.
    The atmospheric haze nearly concealed the faint light surrounding
the  comet, but, by glimpses,   tail was now seen to project towards the

  The tail appeared              to come from the northern            side   of the longer axis of
the comet, and to consist of              a   faint ray with sides nearly parallel.

I. " Experiments            made     to determine Surface-conductivity              for Heat
        in Absolute Measure."                By Donald M'Farlane.                   Commu
        nicated by Sir William Thomson, F.R.S. Received August 8,
         1871.
     The experiments described in this paper were made in the Physical
 Laboratory of the University of Glasgow, under the direction of Sir Wil
liam Thomson, during the summer of 1871.                     A set of similar experiments
 were made in 1865 ; but being merely preliminary, carried ou by different
 individuals, and embracing only a limited range of temperatures, it is
 thought unnecessary to allude further to them here*.
     A  copper ball, 2 centimetres radius, having a thermo-electric junction at
 its centre, was suspended in the interior of a double-walled tin-plate vessel
 which had the space between the double sides filled with water at the
 atmospheric temperature, and the interior coated with lamp-black.                         The
 other junction was in metallic contact with the outside of the vessel, and
 the circuit was completed through the coil of a mirror galvanometer. One
junction was thus kept at a nearly constant temperature of about 14° Cent.,
 while the other had the gradually diminishing temperature of the ball.
     Having adjusted the galvanometer to the degree of sensitiveness desired,
 the copper ball was heated in the flame of a spirit-lamp till its tempera
 ture was considerably above that required to throw the spot of light off the
 scale ; it was then put into position in the interior of the tin-plate vessel,
 and as soon as the spot of light came within range, the deflections from
 the zero position were noted at intervals of one minute exactly till the
 change of deflection was reduced to about two scale-divisions per minute.
     Two series of experiments were made in this way, each consisting of
  several sets of readings.          In the first the ball had a bright surface, and in
  the second it was coated with a thin covering of soot from the flame of a
 lamp, and in both the air was kept moist by a saucer containing a quantity
  of water placed in the interior of the tin-plate vessel.
      As the range of differences of temperatures of the junctions extended
  over 50° Cent., the change in the difference of thermo-electric qualities of
  the copper and iron wires forming the junctions was very considerable,
     * Theso experiments     consisted of two series, one with the air moist by a little water
  placed in the interior of   the vessel, tho other having tho air dried by substituting sul-
          acid for the water in the first; and the results in the two cases were so nearly alike,
  i^iric
                   due to the moisture or dryness of the air could not bo distinguished from
       ^k^lUvt
           ^^jcrvation.      From this circumstance, as well as the limited range of tempe-
                   csults aro not given here.

  and it was necessary to make a careful therraometric comparison of the
  temperatures of the junctions and galvanometer deflections. For this pur
  pose    the junctions were tied to the bulbs of two previously compared
  thermometers, having their stems divided to tenths of a degree Cent. ;
  these were then placed in two vessels of water, one at the temperature of
  the air, and the other heated by small additions of hot water, and kept
  well stirred    ; simultaneous          readings of the thermometers and galvano
  meter    deflections were then taken at various points of the scale*, from
  which the formula
                                    y=0°-0924 + 0°-00C022/.v
  was obtained, where y is the value             of  a scale-division in terms of a degree
  Centigrade, and     x the galvanometer deflection ; and the difference of tem
  perature of the junctions is therefore
                                ay=0°'0924.r-|-0o-0000227.r2,
  from which the numbers in col.             II. of the following    Tables were calculated.
      The method adopted in reducing the observations was this : — Each
 single set of readings was arranged in a vertical column, and the whole
 series placed side by side with corresponding numbers in the same hori
 zontal line ; the means of the horizontal lines were formed into a similar
 column, and divided into groups, each consisting of four consecutive
 numbers, and the means of these groups form the numbers in col. I. of
 the Tables.
      Col. II. contains the differences of the temperatures of the junctions at
 iutervals of four minutes, corresponding to the mean deflections in col. I.
      Col.  III. contains the common logarithms of the numbers in col. II.
      Col.  IV. contains the differences of the successive numbers in col.                  III.
 divided by 4.
      Col. V. is formed from col. IV., by multiplying by the Napierian
 logarithm of 10, and is the rate at which the difference of temperature
 varies per minute.
      Col.  VI.  shows the quantity of heat emitted from the ball in gramme-
water units per square centimetre per second per degree of difference of
temperatures, and is formed by multiplying the numbers in col. V. by
•009385t, a constant depending on the surface of the ball and its capacity
for heat.
     * These readings were plotted, and the curve drawn through the points agreed very
 closely with a portion of a parabolic curve whose equation is
                                        y=2-4+10-6x--019r')

we get 295° as the neutral point of the specimens         of copper and iron wires used — a very
close agreement with former observations, considering the great distance oT the neutral
point from the temperature of the observations.

        municated byDr. ShARPEY,Sec. R.S.            Received October 19, 1871.
                                      (Abstract.)
    This paper     is a record   of the structural  details of nineteen species of
 Bats, and for purposes of comparison the author has appended a description
 of the muscles of the Flying Squirrel (Pteromys) and of the Flying Lemur
  (Galeopithecus).       The species of Bats examined were the following : —
 Pteropus     edulis,   medius,  Edwardsii, Macroglossus minimus, Cephalotes
 Pallasii, Cynonycteris       amplexicaudalis, Eleutherura marginata, Rhino-
 lophus ferrum-equinum,       speoris, and diadema, Megaderma lyra, Artibeua
jamaicensis, Vampyrops vittatus, Vespertilio murinus, Vesperugo pipis-
 trelhis, Synotus barbastellus, Plecotus auritus, Noctulina altivolans, and
 Scotophilus hesperus.
    As the habits of the Bats are singularly different from those of the other
 mammals, the study of their myology becomes a matter of great interest ;
 the special features displayed by their muscles are very numerous, but the
 principal of these may be tabulated as follows : —
    1st. The singularly modified occipital trapezius.
    2nd. The enormously developed and subdivided great pectoral.
    3rd. The digastric being intersected by a linear inscription, forming a
 connecting link between the mammals with a single-bellied depressor of
 the mandible and those with a biventral muscle.
    4th. The separate and displaced scapular deltoid.
    5th. The palmaris longus acting as a superficial flexor.
    6th. The displacements of the lower-extremity muscles consequent on
 the rotation of the lower limbs backward — such as the everted iliacus, the
 diminished glutei, and the weakness of the extensors of the knee.
    7th. The increased size of the gracilis.
    8th. The absence in general of the sartorius, tensor vaginae femoris,
 biceps, plantaris, popliteus, and soleus.
    It is interesting, in connexion with this last peculiarity, to notice the
occurrence of a rudimental sartorius in one species and of a rudimental
popliteus in another.
    The cutaneous muscles are of very great interest, and this is increased by
the comparison with those of the other flying mammals.
    The author regards it as a point of very great importance that he has
heen able to apply the test of nerve-supply in the identification of some
disputed muscles.         Thus he has shown that the upper part at least of
the occipito-pollicalis    is of the nature of the trapezius, although its con
tinuation   is a cutaneous muscle       ; and this is interesting, as in the
                                                                              other
flying mammals        the entire  of this muscle is cutaneous and springs from

 the upper part of the platysma : he has also been able to show that the
 abdominal pectoral is not part of the pectoralis minor.
    By dissecting a large number of species, the author has been able to
 correct a number of errors in the hitherto-published records of the myology
 of the Cheiroptera — such as the origin of the fourth pectoral, the insertion
 of the latissimus dorsi, the arrangement of the forearm-muscles, &c.
    Although the general plan of the muscular system           is the same in all the
 species, yet there are very many suggestive varieties ; and from a comparison
 of their muscles, it would seem that each of the four great groups of
 Bats is characterized by a slightly different arrangement of muscles.
    The author has, for purposes of brevity, carefully abstained from adding
 any thing of theoretical deduction to this paper, which he has endeavoured
 to confine to a simple statement of anatomical facts.

    Sharpey, Sec. U.S.         Received November 17, 1871.
                                           Owens College, Manchester, Nov.  16,  1871.
    My dear Dr. Sharpey, — Since            I  read my last communication       to the
Royal Society on the organization of the Fossil Plants of the Coal-measures I
 have done a large amount of work, having cut between two and three hundred
new sections and with most satisfactory results.           I have obtained a series
of specimens almost completing the life•history of one plant from Burn
tisland, beginning with the tips of the smallest twigs and ending with the
large stems.      The former are mere aggregations of parenchyma with a
central bundle of barred vessels mixed with a small amount of primitive
cell-tissue.    As the twig grew the      leaves   assumed definite form, and the
central vascular bundle opened out at its central part, so as to form a cy
linder, the interior of which was occupied by parenchyma.              This cylinder
grew rapidly,    the  number  of  its  vessels  steadily increasing ; but  they were
all equally arranged as in, what      I  have termed, the medullary vascular cy
linder, i.   e. not in radiating series.       We thus obtain the origin of that
remarkable cylinder, and see that it is the expanded homologuc of the cen
tral vascular bundles of the living Lycopods. Whilst these processes were
in progress the cortical portion became differentiated into layers, and the
parenchymatous cells of the pith continued to multiply, so as to occupy
the expanding interior of the vascular cylinder.           After attaining a certain
size, through the above processes, a new element of growth appeared ; an
exogenous addition was made to the exterior of the cylinder, also consisting
of barred vessels, but these are arranged in the radiating series described in
my last memoir. This series continued to grow until it attained to consider
able dimensions    ; but the entire vascular system always remains small, com
pared with the diameter of the stem, the chief bulk of which consists of

an enormously      thick bark.     The structure just descibed is that of a true
example of the genus Diploxylon of Corda.              But I have got abundance
of specimens with leaves on the exterior          of  the bark, demonstrating that
the plant is a true Lomatophloios, thus indicating the correctness of my
supposition, advanced in my last memoir, that sooner or later the genus
Diploxylon would have to be abandoned.
    As  if to place beyond doubt the accuracy of these interpretations,       I have
now got magnificent specimens, apparently representative of a cambium layer,
in which the half-grown vessels and the imperfectly formed medullary rays
 are exquisitely clear.     In addition to these discoveries I have obtained a
Lepidostrohus,     which  I  have no doubt is the   fruit of the above plant.   It is
provided with both microspores and macrospores, the exteriors of the latter
being curiously furnished with numerous caudate prolongations, causing
them to resemble some of the fossil Xanthidia of the chalk.
    I have further obtained, both from Lancashire and Burntisland, beau
tiful stems of another type, and which I have no doubt belong to Astero-
phyllites.     These began to grow, as before, with a central vascular bundle
surrounded by a cylinder of parenchyma, but the transverse section of the
bundle soon became triquetrous instead of circular. This, it may be remem
bered, is the characteristic of the corresponding bundle of the strobilus which
I have just described in the ' Transactions of the Literary and Philosophical
Society of Manchester,' under the name Yolkmannia Dawsoni, and which
I referred to Asterophyllites. This central triangular axis does not ex
pand or become converted into a hollow cylinder ; but vessels are at once
added to each of its three sides, exogenously, and in radiating series, until
it becomes converted into a cylindrical woody axis. I have specimens show
ing the nodes and internodes, leaving little, if any, room to doubt the close
affinity between the plant in question and the verticillate-leaved Astero
phyllites.
    The details of these discoveries, along with those respecting a most re
markable series of Lycopodiaceous plants, to which I have given the name
 of Dictyoxylon, but which name will have to be abandoned for the late
Mr. Gourlie's name of Lyginodendron, will be laid before the Royal Society
with as little delay as possible.         I may observe that the plants last re
ferred to have developed, so far as type is concerned, in a way very similar
to that of the Lomatophloios, allowance being made for generic and specific
peculiarities.
                                       I am, my dear Sir,
                                               Very sincerely yours,

    I ought    not to close  this letter without  acknowledging the indefatigable
 energy of G. Grieve, Esq., of Burntisland, who has supplied me with a
 constant stream of specimens, upon which I have been able to operate, thus
 rendering an admirable service to the cause of palaeophytology.

 ' Investigations      of the Currents       in the Strait    of Gibraltar, made
       in August 1871, by Captain             G. S. Nares, R.N., of H.M.S.

       by Admiral Richards.             Received December 28, 1871.
    In fulfilment of instructions    to afford to  Dr. Carpenter, F.R.S., who was
                   '
attached to the      Shearwater,' every opportunity to investigate the Gibraltar
current,    and to    " use every effort to set the question at rest," Captain
Nares spent six days, from August 22nd to the 30th, in examining the
currents and taking soundings and observations of temperature in the Strait
of Gibraltar. The details and results, embodied in a report, were delivered
to the Admiralty, and, by favour of Admiral Richards, have furnished ma
terial for the following summary.
    While the observations were being made, east winds, force 0 to 6, were
experienced : they were reported as having also prevailed during the pre
vious fortnight.
    The movement of water in the Strait was found to be tidal, affected by
a surface-current running into the Mediterranean from the Atlantic.            The
ebb-tide, which is a combination of the two streams running in the same
direction, sets to the eastward, and at a rate considerably faster than the
 flood•tide, which is caused by the two streams meeting, and which runs to
the westward.
    In the Narrows, in the middle of the Strait, the surface-water is      affected
 by tidal influence, but not to     so great an extent as the water inshore ; for
 the east-running current from the Atlantic being here collected into an ex
 tremely narrow and strong-running stream, it is only during easterly winds
and calms that a decided set to the westward is enabled to manifest itself;
during westerly winds the tidal       set to the westward is doubtless frequently
 overpowered by      the  extra strength of the in•running Atlantic current, and
 no set to the westward can be expected ; at the same time there must be a
 considerable diminution      of the east-running current during the flood-tide.
 In the Narrows the actual distance run by the surface-water towards the

Atlantic during       flcol-tide under the most favourable circumstances,
                       one
viz. strong continuous east wi :dJ, was only two miles, while the easterly
set was found to be at bast ten mile3 during the eb'j.
   This, however, is the case with the surface-water only; the bottom stratum
is unaffected by the in-running current from the Atlantic and sets east or
west according to the tides for equal periods ; and there is no reason to sup
pose that it is interfered with by westerly winds as the upper water un
doubtedly is.
   On the shallow ridge at the west entrance of the Strait the in-running
current from the Atlantic is insufficient to counteract the effect of the
west-running      flood-tide, and a tidal influence was shown on both the surface-
and bottom-water.
  It was found that the surface-water moved towards the east during the
ebb-tide faster than the bottom-water ; with the flood it set towards the
west slower than the bottom-water ; and it ran towards the east faster than
it ran towards the west. The bottom-water ran to the westward with the
flood faster than      it ran    to the eastward   with the ebb.     The power exerting
itself to produce this excess of west-running water at             the bottom is there
fore sufficient to annihilate the in-running current which                makes     itself so
easily felt in the water above.
   The prevailing       of the surface•current running from the westward into
                        set
the Mediterranean being met and checked by an advancing tidal wave coming
from the eastward, the water is raised and causes the flood-tide          e. en     (i.
the shore)    ;after the wave has passed the water falls, running to the east
ward with the prevailing current; thus the flood or rising tide by the shore
in the Strait     produced
                  is               by
                                the west-running current.   The change of the
tidal stream in the bottom stratum corresponds with the time of high and
low water at Gibraltar.        With east winds, the surface-current       stops
runnin" to the east from one to two hours after low water         turns to run
                                                                      ;   it
to the east again at high water.
   These observations may be of great practical use to the large number of
sailing-vessels engaged in the Mediterranean trade.       Vessels intending to
beat out of the Strait to the westward should get under weigh, or sail out
from under shelter, at low water       at half flood long tacks may be made
                                          ;
from shore to shore, but shelter must be gained before high water.
   The method and apparatus employed in observation of the currents were
similar to those with which we have become familiar through the reports
of recent deep-sea researches. The current-drags were made of canvas,
hanging   4feet below two light wooden crossed yards, each feet long,          4
                                         to 75 lbs., the weights being attached
secured in the middle and weighted
to the bottom of the canvas.
                                   This was suspended at the requisite depth
by   afine line, 02 inch in      diameter,   hanging from one end of an iron
          feet long,
         5£             foot in  diameter          in
                                               the middle, and pointed at each
buoy,

                                    of floating 100 lbs. weight.    Close to the

 the light line was incapable of doing. The line was made very fine, to eli
 minate as much as possible the error which must always creep in in conse
 quence of the suspending-line passing through currents running in different
 directions and at different speeds.
    In practice it   was found that the surface- and bottom-water        were rarely
 moving at the same speed, which was indicated by the buoy from which
 the current-drag was suspended being pulled through the surface-water.
 The movement of the current-drng itself floating in the lower stratum must
 therefore have been affected to a certain extent corresponding to the force
 of the upper current pressing against the buoy.           In making    a correction
for this movement, Captain Nares estimates that the current-drag was it
 self retarded to an extent equal to half the difference of their speed.
 Although the pressure on the buoy carried it away from a position imme
 diately over the current-drag, yet the suspending-line was never more than
 5° out of the vertical, showing that the current-drag did not vary its depth
 of flotation to any appreciable extent.
    To obtain the surface-drift, a current-drag, lowered       2 feet below the sur
face, was suspended from a cork sphere, 1         foot in diameter, which, floating
with the top just    above water, presented as little surface as possible to be acted
 upon by the wind, and kept the current-drag itself below the wash of the sea.
    As  these observations were made       in August, when the evaporation of the
 Mediterranean     is at its maximum, and the freshwater supply derived from
 rain and rivers at a minimum, no great increase in the in-running superficial
current can be expected during the winter months when these conditions
are reversed.
    From    these remarks we pass to the practical work        of observation  ; and
it may suffice    to give  in full detail the proceedings of   one day only, which
will serve to show how the conclusions were arrived at.
    On August 22nd, in mid-channel 4 miles S.S.W. of Tarifa, wind east,
force 3, with a smooth sea, about one hour after high water, after sounding
in 325 fathoms, a current-drag was lowered 2 feet below the surface, and
allowed to drift, the ship keeping station close to it to enable its position
to be fixed occasionally by angles between shore objects.
    It drifted in 23 minutes E.N.E. 0-8 mile = 1*7 mile an hour. By
observations immediately afterwards the temperature of the water at the
surface was found to be 63°, and at 200 fathoms below 57°.
    At 4| hours after high water, a boat was anchored in 330 fathoms.            The
surface-current    was then    running towards the    east at an estimated speed   of
l*fi knot   an hour.     A current-drag was lowered 150 fathoms, but soon after
settling   down,   and  before   any measurement of the distance run could be
obtained, its suspending-line fouled the anchor-line and was carried away,
showing that a strong under-current was running to the eastward, which
subsequent observations proved was its natural course at this time of tide.
The anchor was then picked up to change its position rather to the west
ward, where the strait was broader.

 100                         Capt. G. S. Nares    on the                 [Jan. 18,
    At  2 hours after low water, the density  of the bottom-water in  1 70  fathoms
 having been ascertained, a boat was anchored midway between Tangier and
 Cape Plata.     At 3 hours after low water the surface-current was found to be
 running to the westward one knot an hour by log-line.         A current-drag was
 then lowered 125 fathoms.        By  mast-head   angles  from the boat at anchor
 it drifted in ten minutes     N. 87° W. 450 yards = T35 mile      an hour.     The
 drag pulling its buoy through the surface-water to the westward indicated
 that the bottom-water was really moving at an estimated rate of 1*5 mile
 an hour.     At 4 and 5 hours after low water, shore positions showed that
 the surface-water was running S.S.W. 0-4 mile an hour          ; and at   5i  hours
 it was stationary.
    The observations     on this day, although  not so continuous or complete as
 those taken subsequently, proved that the bottom-water was affected by
 tidal influence, running to the westward as the water was rising, and to the
 eastward as the water fell.
    August 23rd. — One hour and a half after high water, the weather being
 calm, with smooth sea, a buoy was anchored in 125 fathoms, with 25
fathoms of light chain and 1 50 fathoms of No. 2 sounding-line, on the north
part of the shallow ridge stretching across the Strait between Capes Spartcl
 and Trafalgar.
    The surface-current, and probably the bottom-water also, was running
so strongly to the eastward that the buoy sank from the pressure of the
water against it and the line.          As it did not show itself again at slack
water, it probably collapsed from pressure.        Two buoys were then anchored
in the same place with a similar line and chain. The lower buoy sank
below the surface, leaving the second one floating with one foot of the top
above water, indicating a strain of nearly 200 lbs. exerted by the pressure
of the current on the line and buoys. At 2£ hours after high water the
surface-current was running east 1*25 mile an hour by log-line.                At a
depth of 25 fathoms the direction and speed of the under-current were the
same.     At 3| hours after high water, the drag was lowered to 100 fathoms,
when a perceptible retardation of the under-current was observed, the
surface-water setting to the east past the boat at an estimated rate of | knot
an hour.
    The drag was then lowered to 119 fathoms, being 6 fathoms from the
bottom, and attached to a buoy ; and on being observed half an hour later,
or about 5 hours after high water, it was found by mast-head angles to

the second buoy at anchor floated on its bilge, showing the surface-tide to
have slackened and the strain to have lessened to about 1 10 lbs., estimated
as being equal to    j  a knot.   Soon after the top of the underneath buoy
floated one foot out of water, indicating a further decrease of tide.
    At low water the bottom current-drag had drifted during the last hour
O'l mile N.W. by N.          The surface-current was running past the buoy to
the eastward, and was therefore exercising some influence on the current

at one hour after low water the drag had drifted W. | N. at a rate of 0*18
mile an hour, while the surface-current had stopped running, as shown by
the buoys at anchor.
   Two hours after lowwater, the drag being placed at a depth of 108 fathoms,
10 fathoms above the bottom, immediately ran away with its buoy to the
westward, and drew it fast through the surface-water against a light west
wind, force      1 ;         time the anchored buoys showed a very slight

   From this day's observations it appears that the bottom-water turned to
run to the westward a little before, and the surface-stratum at about an
hour after low water.
   On August 26, wind east, force 3, with a considerable swell from the
eastward, while making observations on the penetration of light at different
depths of water, some current-buoys          were anchored in mid-channel
south of Europa Point, in 480 fathoms, to indicate the direction of the
surface-current.      Half an hour before high water, when the current, if
affected by tide alone, should have been ruuning to the westward, it was
found to be running towards the east at about half a mile an hour, indicated
by the lowest of three buoys floating 2 feet above water. During the next
2 hours, or until 1 \ hour after high water, the lowest buoy was out of sight
and the second buoy had a slight strain on           it,
                                               the tide estimated to be running
three quarters of       mile an hour.

the second buoy swimming, with half its depth immersed, indicated           tide  a
of about   1  mile an hour.      The pressure on the buoys now increased
sufficiently to  sink  two  of them  completely, and the strain proved to be
too much for the anchor, which was found to be shifting its position.
   At low water the current was running at its greatest speed, estimated to
be   3 miles an hour, with no appearance of changing.

                                      again commenced running to the
eastward past the anchored buoys, and soon after the line was observed to
have been carried away.
     One hour and         a   half later the current-drng       was lowered 225 fathoms,

 102                        Capt. G. S. Nares on the                     [Jan. 18,
when its attached buoy immediately started off, moving towards the east
much faster than the surface-current.         Angles taken to positions on shore
showed that the drag was moving to the eastward 2*1 miles an hour.
   Subsequent observations, made on the south side of the ridge of shallow
water between Capes Spartel and Trafalgar, and in the Narrows south of
Tarifa, confirmed the foregoing results, and showed that while the surface-
current was running east 1 and 2 miles an hour, the bottom-currentwas moving
in thesamedirectionfrom2*4to2,6miles. Somewhat later, the under-current
at 50 fathoms and the surface-current       were found to have the same rate    of
speed, namely 3'8 miles an hour.        Differences of rate then took place, but
the current maintained its direction and tidal character ; and as the rate of
the under-current    gradually decreased, there is no reason to suppose that it
did not turn to run to the westward at low water.          The quicker movement
of the under-current at the early part of the tide may have been due to
retardation of the surface-current     by a strong breeze from the east.       For
all practical purposes the bottom-current below 100 fathoms may be re
garded as uniform.       The current was found to turn with the tide, and to
vary its rate in accordance with the progress of the ebb or the flow.
   In concluding his report, Captain Nares remarks that on the 28th a much
stronger east-running bottom current was experienced, which he attributes
to the observations on that       day being made in the position where the
easterly in-set runs strongest  ; but it may have been occasioned by a reflux
of water into the Mediterranean stronger than usual to replace that blown
to the westward during the previous         east winds,  which the swell denoted
had been blowing strongly a day or two before.          For the first two hours of
the ebb-tide the bottom-current ran to the eastward faster than the surface-
current, the same as observed on the 28th.
   The strong west-running under-current of        1*8 mile an   hour thus shown
to exist in the Narrows where the inflow of the Atlantic stream retards the
surface-current    most, agrees fairly with the slower movement of 1 '2 mile
an  hour   in  the  broader and shallower part to the westward, where the
surface-water is less affected.
   In the Narrows the last of the ebb and first of the flood sets across from
Tarifa towards Point Ceres, joining the inshore current running to the
westward along that shore.
   These observations show that the under-current         in the narrowest part of
the Strait is affected by tidal influence, the same as the water on the shallow
ridge to the westward.     But the eddies, which would naturally be expected
at this  part, in consequence of the funnel-shaped mouth of the Strait,
complicate the movements and prevent such exact demonstrations as those
found further to the westward, where the current stream runs more steadily.
   The Report will shortly be published in full by the Admiralty.

oxidized and the rest be eliminated unaltered      ; or, lastly, all may be elimi
nated again unaltered.        Assuming the last to be the case, it would follow
that,    if a certain quantity of alcohol be taken daily, the amount eliminated
would increase from day to day until, at last, the amount eliminated daily
would equal the daily consumption, be this time 5, 10, or more days.           If,
on the other hand, all the alcohol consumed is either oxidized or elimi
nated within 24 hours, no increase in the daily elimination will take place
in consequence of the continuance of the alcohol diet. Guided by these
 considerations, the author undertook        two series of experiments, in which
 the amount of alcohol eliminated by both kidneys and lungs was carefully
 estimated.       The analytical processes employed are described in detail.
     First series. — After a total abstinence from alcohol for 1 1 days, the
 urine and breath were examined, after which, from the 12th to the 24th
 day, both inclusive, the author took 112 cub. centims. of brandy daily (equal
 to 48-C8 grms. absolute alcohol).         The urine and breath were examined
 on the 12th, the 18th, and the 24th day.            The urine was also examined
  during the 5 days following the cessation of the alcohol diet.        The analy
  tical results obtained are given in a Table.
      Second series. — After having again abstained from the use of alcohol,
 in any     shape,  during 10 days, the author took 56 cub. centims. of brandy
  (same as above) at 10 a.m. on March the 29th.            The urine was collected
  for every 3 hours up to the 12th, from the 12th to the 24 th hour, and
  during the next succeeding 2 days. The alcohol eliminated in the breath was
  also estimated during the same intervals.        The analytical results are also
  arranged in a tabular form.
      The results of both series may be summed up as follows : —
      The amount of alcohol eliminated per day does not increase with the
  continuance of the alcohol diet ; therefore all the alcohol consumed daily
  must, of necessity, be disposed of daily ; and as it certainly is not elimi
  nated within that time, it must be destroyed in the system.
      The elimination of alcohol following the ingestion of a dose, or doses,
  of alcohol ceases in from 9 to 24 hours after the last dose has been taken.
      The amount of alcohol eliminated, in both breath and urine, is a minute
  fraction only of the amount of alcohol taken.
      In the course of these experiments, the author found that, after six
   weeks of total abstinence, and even in the case of a teetotaller, a substance
   is eliminated    in the urine, and perhaps also in the breath, which, though
   apparently not alcohol, gives all the reactions ordinarily used for the de
   tection of traces of alcohol, viz. it passes over with the first portions of the
   distillate, it yields acetic acid on oxidation, gives the emerald-green reac
   tion with bichromate of potassium and strong sulphuric acid, yields iodo
   form, and its aqueous solution has a lower specific gravity and a higher
   vapour tension than pure water.         The presence of a substance in human
   urine and the urine of various animals which yields iodoform, but is not
   alcohol, had already been discovered by M. Lieben.            The quantity pre

sent in urine       is,
                however, so small that the precise nature of this substance
has not ns yet been determined.
  Finally, the author points out an apparent connexion between this sub
stance and alcohol.             It   was found      that, after the elimination           due to the
ingestion of alcohol had             ceased, the amount          of this substance eliminated in
a given time at first remained below the quantity normally excreted, and
only gradually rose again to the normal standard.    A careful study of
this connexion may perhaps              serve to throw some               light upon the physiolo
gical action of alcohol.

                                                                        the
 rose to 26°. The flask was now -transferred to water at 48°, when
                                                             mass.   As the
 opaque-white crystals broke up into an amorphous woolly
                                                             time the usual
 temperature of the solution rose to 40°, then for the first
 transparent octahedra of the anhydrous salt fell   down.    Next day the

flask was opened ; crystallization of the ordinary                                    salt set in from        the
surface, and the temperature rose from 44° to 65°.
     Thus      one more hydrate             is added to those already known                      as belonging
to this remarkable salt.                   It   doubtless contains less water than the seven-
atom hydrate ; but I know of no method of testing its hydration, since its
existence depends upon the low temperature, and shelter from the action
of nuclei.         In this way it          resembles         the various         hydrates described in my
                     '
paper in the Transactions.'
  The solution was next made       twice as strong as before, that        two                           is,
parts of Glauber's salt were dissolved in one part of water, and after boiling
and filtering and reboiling as before, the flask was set aside to cool.
When the thermometer marked 42°, the flask was put into the freezing-
mixture.           At 38°
                     few transparent octahedra were thrown down, and the
                                 a
heat-currents thereby liberated delayed the cooling.  In fourteen minutes
itreached 26°, and the transparent crystals at the bottom became opaque
white.   The thermometer was stationary during some minutes at 26°,
when    began again to descend
          it                      but on agitating the flask in the freezing-
                                                     ;
mixture, crystals of the opaque-white salt were formed, and the tempera
ture regained 26°, the solution above being bright and clear, and still
supersaturated. In few minutes crystallization set in from the surface,
                                     a
and the thermometer rose from 26° to 53°, the whole being now solid.
  These opaque crystals resemble in texture newly formed white lead                                            ;
and at whatever temperature they may be formed below 26°, their forma
tion causes the thermometer to rise to 26°, and that, too, in solutions of
1  part, parts, or
               2   parts salt to one of water.

times amorphous, and then      covers the surface of the flask like thick
                                                it

freezing-mixture.

40° there was   fall of transparent anhydrous crystals.

anhydrous salt so as to cover the bottom of the flask, and to rise     little                           a
way up  the sides.  The  flask was transferred to  freezing-mixture at  10°;a
when at 33° the anhydrous salt became opaque, doubtless from the fixa
tion of   portion of water less than that required for the formation of the
               a
seven -atom salt.                At 24° opaque tufts and fern-like crystals
                                                          were formed.
At 22° there was sudden   andacopious deposit of this opaque-white hy

1 872.]                  Solutions   of Glauber's Salt.                         Ill
with my experience.       Not much more than half       an ounce  of  a compara
tively weak solution of Glauber's salt, such as     1 salt to 1 water, may rise
from 20° to 5fi° on suddenly becoming solid ; and with 2 or 3 salt to 1 of
water the rise may not be greater, especially if a considerable mass of the
two abnormal hydrates be already formed, and only a small portion of the
solution remain to become solid.
   In another experiment, 3 parts salt to 1 of water were boiled and fil
tered into two test-tubes and one 2-ounce flask.        One tube, on being put
into the freezing-mixture, sank to 35°, when the solution suddenly became
solid, and the thermometer rose to 78°. The other tube-solution threw
down so large a quantity of anhydrous crystals as to prevent the reading
of the thermometer.       The solution in the flask threw down anhydrous
crystals  at 44°, and then sank very slowly to 40°, where it remained sta
tionary upwards of ten minutes, in consequence of the liberation of heat-
currents, occasionally rising to 41°.        A large quantity of transparent
crystals was now heaped up on the bulb of the thermometer ; the tempe
rature descended to 38°, with slight starts upwards ; and in slowly de
scending to 33°, there was a large increase of the transparent crystals.         At
32° the flask was transferred to a fresh freezing-mixture      at  1 0°,  and the
solution slowly descended     to 22°, when it was again removed to a fresh
freezing-mixture, also at 1 0°.     Soon a number of large fern- like crystals
covered the side of the flask, starting, apparently, from the top of the co
pious deposit first produced, and rendering the upper part opaque in a
well-defined line.    The temperature rose to 26D, and continued there
some minutes, when the solution        suddenly crystallized, and the thermo
meter rose to 48°.
   Supersaturated solutions of potash alum, exposed to low temperatures,
behave much in the same way as the solutions of double salts described in my
former paper. A solution of 300 grains of the salt in 1 £ oz. of water, boiled
and filtered into clean test-tubes, and, when cold, put into a freezing-mixture
at about 0°  F., displays the beautiful ivy-leaf kind of foliage, of    a brilliant
white colour, already referred to. The growth starts from the bottom or
from the surface of the solution, or from both, and soon the whole solution
becomes solid.    If the tube be put into water at 32°, the solid rapidly
melts, and the liquid is a clear bright supersaturated solution as before.
   Lowel, in his first memoir (An. de Ch. et de Ph. 3 serie, tome xxix.),
found that when supersaturated solutions of Glauber's salt, in sealed tubes,
were subjected to temperatures varying from —8° to — 10° C, they often
froze and burst the tubes.      In one case, where the tube did not burst, the
solution, in thawing, caused the state of supersaturation to cease. In another
case the frozen solution thawed, and the liquor became supersaturated as
before.    Lowel could not reproduce this last effect, nor explain why the
thawing should lead to the formation of the ten-atom salt.        But as he did
not know the conditions of clean and unclean, he was constantly looking
out for some catalytic action in the sides of his vessels to explain the many

anomalous cases that occurred to him consequent on the use          of vessels not
chemically clean.
   Among the numerous writers on the subject of supersaturation, I know
of none that has noticed the formation of the second modified hydrate of
sodic sulphate except M. Viollette, who, in a " Mémoire sur la Sursatura-
     " contained in the ' Annales

to the formation of another hydrate, " qtii cristallise] difficilement en forme
de choux-fleurs."

        Received April 18, 1871*.
    1 . In performing   some experiments on recently slaughtered animals,
for the elucidation of a subject which I was then engaged in investigating,
I was struck with the remarkable arched tension of the diaphragm, a con
dition which    continued  unabated until air was admitted into the pleural
spaces, and then it became flaccid and descended. This altered condition was
attended by collapse of the lungs, which receded from the thoracic walls,
and occupied a much smaller space than previously.
   2. In order to measure the quantity of air expelled from the lungs in
the preceding experiment, and to ascertain how far the collapse of the
lungs and the altered condition of the diaphragm were dependent on each
other, the following experiment was performed.                The trachea of a sheep,
immediately after death, was exposed in the neck, divided, and tied over a
glass tube, which     was put in communication with a graduated receiver
placed under water, and guarded by a stopcock.                   The pleura; were then
opened, and as air entered the diaphragm became flaccid ; but the lungs
remained unchanged in position and form. The stopcock was then opened,
and a rush of air, displacing the water in the receiver, was accompanied
by collapse of the lungs.      The quantity of air thus forcibly expelled was
from ten to twelve cubic inches.
   3. The interpretation of this experiment is —
    (a) That the passive tension of the diaphragm                 is due to the atmo
spheric pressure on its abdominal           surface, which is not counterbalanced
by   a corresponding   pressure on the opposite or thoracic surface,            until air
is admitted into the pleurre.
    (b) That the lungs retain their supplemental air by virtue of this tense
condition of the diaphragm, the elasticity of the former being resisted by
the tension of the latter.
    (c) That the contractility      of the lungs, tending to the expulsion of the
supplemental air, removes the atmospheric pressure from the upper sur
face of the diaphragm, and thus produces and maintains its arched form
and tense condition.
    (rf) That as soon as the pressure on the inner and outer surfaces of the
lungs was equalized, by the admission of air into the pleurae, their con
tractility forced out the supplemental air ; and the quantity thus expelled
                 * Bond Mny   2.ri,  1P7I.  See nbetract, vol. \\x. p. 486.

              Mr. Le Gros dark      on the Mechanism     of Respiration.      123
   may    be accepted as an approximate      measure of the elasticity of these
  organs.
      (e) That the diaphragm was rendered flaccid by the admission of air
   into the pleurae, independently of the collapse of the lungs.
      4. Thus there exists a constant antagonism between the atmospheric
  pressure on the interior of the lungs and their elastic and contractile pro
  perties, tending to the expulsion of the air they contain ; and this expul
  sive power is limited by the resisting tension of the diaphragm.         These
  several conditions   arc in no degree influenced by the direct admission of
  air into the abdominal cavity ; for the trachea being treated as in the
  former experiment before the abdomen was opened, and an aperture being
  then made into the peritoneum, the abdominal walls rose as air rushed in,
 but no air was expelled from the lungs. The expansion of the abdomen
 under these circumstances is especially remarkable in oxen when turned
 on their back, and is probably in great measure due to the position favour
 ing the expansion of the lower costal region.
     5. In the recognition of the above facts, I think that the extremely
 tense condition of the diaphragm has not received the notice which its
 practical importance deserves.      Independently     of being the agency by
 which    the  supplemental air is retained   in the  lungs, the resistance thus
 offered limits the encroachment of the abdominal viscera on the thoracic
 cavity ; and by this same property, combined with the broad and insepa
 rable attachment of the central tendinous expansion to the fibrous peri
 cardium, the heart is preserved from being impeded in its movements in
 the various stages of respiration.
     That the tension in question fulfils these functions is exemplified patho
 logically as well as physiologically.      It would indeed be impossible,
 without giving due weight to this property of the diaphragm, to account
 for the trifling interference, comparatively speaking, that pregnancy, or
 the presence of large ovarian tumours or ascitic accumulations, exercises
 over the mechanism of respiration ; and it would appear still more sur
prising that the sudden removal of such distension, and with it the pres
sure on the diaphragm, is not attended by more serious consequences.         Yet
 the respiratory mechanism is scarcely     influenced   appreciably even by the
 sudden collapse of an enormous ovarian cyst ; and this is accounted for by
 the passive tension of the diaphragm, which alike resists encroachment
from below and refuses the solicitation to descend which the removal of
the pressure would seem to offer.
     6. In the action of the diaphragm this tension is an essential condition,
in order that there may be no waste of power, but that its earliest con
traction may be accompanied, at once and simultaneously, by the entrance
of the tidal air into the lungs  ; and it would seem probable that, for ordi
nary expiration,    the suspension of its contraction and consequent return
to its normal state of arched tension is alone sufficient.
     7. But further considerations present themselves in reviewing this pro-
                                                                   l2

perty, in association with the attachments of the diaphragm, and the
relations of other muscles credited severally with functions in both inspi
ration and expiration.
   8. The thoracic parietes, both osseous          and cartilaginous, are movable,
admitting of   an increase or diminution        in the circumference of the chest ;
and the diaphragm is attached, by its circumference, to the chest-walls.
As the force by which the tensely arched diaphragm is rendered plane is
necessarily considerable, it may be asked, does the contraction of this
muscle under any circumstances draw in the ribs ? and why does it not
do so always ?     Ibelieve the answer to the first inquiry to be, that it
does, under some circumstances, draw in the ribs ; and the explanation of
the second must be sought in a consideration of the agency of other
muscles engaged in inspiration, to which attention will be presently
directed.
  9.  The property of the diaphragm under consideration — its passive ten
sion — is engaged in restoring the equilibrium of rest after a deep expira
tion.    The supplemental air is expelled from the lungs chiefly by the
action of the abdominal muscles, the circumference of the chest undergoing
no appreciable change except at its lower part, where it is directly acted
on by these muscles.   When they are relaxed, and the lower costal region
again expands, the diaphragm asserts its passive influence, by drawing in so
much air as the counter-resistance of the contractility of the lung-tissue
will permit.
   10. But this agency is somewhat more complex than would appear
from the above statement.     The passive tension of the diaphragm is such
that it would probably be sufficient to resist the efforts of the abdominal
muscles to force it upwards, without the cooperation of another cause,
which is the altered condition of the chest- walls. The lower ribs are per
ceptibly drawn inwards, as stated, when the supplemental air is expelled
from the lungs ; and, as a necessary consequence, the horizontal portion of
the diaphragm is relaxed, and thus placed in a condition which permits of
its being forced upwards, so as to compress the lungs.
    11. But the deepest inspiration is also attended by hollowing or draw
ing in of the epigastrium ; and the increasing circumference of the lowest
costal region, which is limited as compared with the upper,        almost   'js
arrested before the act of forced inspiration has attained its maximum            ;
and the rise in the abdomen      likewise suspended before this climax
                                    is                                            is
reached.     These conditions   are      due,
                                            I    apprehend, to the combined effect
of atmospheric pressure on the relaxed abdominal walls, concurrently with
the extreme contraction of the diaphragm, overcoming the resistance of
the intercostal muscles, and drawing in the lower ribs.
   12. As exemplifying, in      remarkable and interesting way, the fore
                                a
going observations,    may mention the case of
                       I                             patient recently an in
                                                         a
mate  of St. Thomas's Hospital, in whom there was fracture, with dis
placement of the sixth cervical vertebra, by which the cord was compressed.

              Mr. Le Gros Clark on         the  Mechanism of Respiration.         125
 He   survived the injury less than three days, and there was complete para
 lysis of motion and loss of sensation below a line level with the nipples ;
 the movement of the arms            was also impaired.    "The   walls of the chest,
 across and below the nipples, were retracted at each inspiration." I quote
 the words of the Hospital Registrar; but I repeatedly proved this, and
 demonstrated         the fact to others, by placing around the chest, just over
 the nipples, a tape, which became relaxed at each inspiration, to the ex
 tent of at least half an inch.           The inspirations were short and sudden
the expirations prolonged, and latterly intermittent.            This is not the only
instance in which I have observed this phenomenon under similar con
ditions.
    The following case has more recently come under my observation, and
 I  give it according to the report of Mr. Anderson, the Surgical Regis
 trar of the hospital : — " F. F., aged 58, a bricklayer, was admitted into
 St. Thomas's Hospital in February 1871, having fallen from a consider
 able height, and struck some projecting object in his descent ; he remained
incapable of movement, though perfectly sensible.             The lower limbs were
 paralyzed, and the movements of the upper extremities were impaired ; and
 he complained of great pain shooting from the neck into the upper extre
 mities.     In breathing, the whole chest was very perceptibly drawn in du
 ring inspiration, and the abdomen became more prominent than is normal.
The chest was slightly raised as a whole, and the sterno-mastoids were
seen to act strongly.           The lower ribs were not drawn downwards, but
appeared      to   be   pulled directly inwards, or inwards and slightly upwards.
In expiration the chest-walls appeared to relax, as if from the cessation of
some contracting influence.           The respiration, as a whole, was jerking, but
not increased in frequency.           Subsequently the chest appeared to act uni
laterally,   as  if from unequal    action  of the two sides of the diaphragm, the
ribs on the left side being drawn inwards during inspiration, whilst the right
half of the thorax was thrust outwards passively. He survived the accident
about sixty hours        ; and the cord was found crushed between the fifth and
sixth cervical vertebrae,       which were fractured."
    This peculiarity       in the diaphragmatic breathing must be due, in the
main,    if not entirely, to the suspension of the intercostal action, whereby
the ribs are left at liberty to be acted upon, and thus drawn in by the
contraction of the diaphragm.
    13.   I would remark, as bearing upon the foregoing observations and
those   I am about to make, that in the unfettered adult body, in the erect or
sitting posture, the sphere of respiratory movements, as seen and mea
sured, is chiefly limited to the region which is bounded above by a hori
zontal line extending outwards from the lower extremity to the sternum,
and below by a similar line extending from the umbilicus to the anterior
spine   of either ilium. In the recumbent posture, when the abdominal
muscles are relaxed, the movement extends lower over the abdomen.                Yet
the measurements are by no means commensurate              with the apparent   move

menfs.     The deeply notched form of the chest below, with its movable
elastic boundary of cartilage, is well adapted to admit of these necessary
movements of alternate expansion and contraction.
    14. A difference of opinion exists as to the action of the intercostal
muscles, some physiologists assuming that the external and internal sets of
muscles act independently of each other and as antagonists ; others sup
posing that different parts of the same muscle perform diverse functions.
I  am disposed to believe that both these conjectures are incorrect ; and that
Ilaller is right in his opinion, that both   sets of intercostals act as muscles
of inspiration.     They act, in concert with the scaleni, in drawing the ribs
upwards ; they also approximate them, and rotate them on their axes, — a
result which is facilitated by the increasing mobility of each pair of ribs as we
 descend from the first to the last.     The effect of such action is to afford
a fixed circumference from which the horizontal portion of the diaphragm
can    act without drawing the ribs inwards ; at the same time that the
general capacity of the chest is augmented, though its vertical diameter,
so far as the intercostal action is concerned, is shortened ; and the crura of
the diaphragm must also aid importantly in steadying and fixing the central
 tendon during inspiration, and in preserving the pericardium from that
 encroachment to which it would be liable if the central tendon were not
 thus fixed at its back part, and drawn downwards from the chest.
    15. But the action of the intercostal muscles, which has been a subject
 of so much dispute, will repay a more careful examination.
    The posterior portion of the external intercostals, reaching from the
 angles to the tubercles of the ribs, unaccompanied by the internal inter
 costals, has an action similar to that of the levatores costarum, the upper
 of the two ribs   to which each fibre is attached forming a fixed point from
 which the lower rib may be influenced in direction.         The anterior part of
 the internal   intercostals, passing between the costal cartilages unaccom
 panied by the external intercostals, must, from the direction of the fibres
 in relation to the direction of the portion of rib to which they are attached,
 act,  like the posterior portion of the external intercostals, in elevating the
 ribs.    (Here diagrams were employed to illustrate these points.)
    It is hence obvious that the combined influence of these portions of the
 two muscles will be, where the fixed point is taken from the upper of the
 two ribs to which they are attached, to swing the rib in an opposite
 direction upon an imaginary axis drawn through the spinal and sternal
 attachments, taking a true rib as a type.      The entire length of the external
 intercostals will also act with the levatores costarum, and produce the effect,
 in forced inspiration, of raising the anterior end of the rib, and thus thrust
 forward the sternum.
    In the contraction of the decussating portions of        each set of muscles
 simultaneously    with  the others, we  get  the diagonal  of the action of both
 as the result of their joint action, the upper of the two ribs to which each
 pair of musck's is attached being relatively fixed.

            Mr. Le Gros Clark       on the Mechanism     of Respiration.        127
    16.   The summary of the action of both        sets  of muscles may     be thus
 stated  : —
    (1) They increase the transverse diameter of the chest, by raising the
curve of the ribs more nearly to a level with the attachment of the ends.
All   the fibres must assist in this action, but especially the external inter-
costals and the anterior part of the internal intercostals.
    (2) They increase the antero-posterior diameter of the chest by raising
the anterior attachment of the ribs, and with them the sternum, more
nearly to a level with the posterior attachment, thereby also separating
the costal cartilages of the lower true and false ribs, and thus widening the
interval which separates them on either side of the ensiform cartilage. The
posterior fibres of the external intercostals will act with the levatores cos-
tarum and (in forced inspiration) with other indirect agents.
    (3) They assist in rotating the ribs outwards, when they elevate them.
    (4) They fix the thoracic walls. This action is a most important one :
— a, by giving, when needed, a fixed attachment for the various muscles
which are connected to the chest, and which have a double action, accord
ing to the relative mobility of their origin and insertion ; b, by preventing
the diaphragm from drawing in the walls of the chest during ordinary
inspiration ; c, by resisting the atmospheric pressure during inspiration,
by virtue of the tension of the intercostal spaces.
    1 7. The serratus magnus is usually described as a powerful           muscle in
 forced inspiration, when the scapula is fixed ; but from a careful study of
 the direction of its fibres, from observation of its action in deep breathing,
and (so far as the experiment may be depended on) under the influence
of electro-galvanism, I venture to question the correctness of this generally
accepted description.      The direction of the component parts of this broad
muscle would      seem to indicate that none but the lowest digitations can
assist in elevating the ribs or increasing the capacity of the chest ; on the
contrary, the contraction of the upper digitations must rather tend to draw
the ribs downwards, and to aid in expiration.         It is true that extreme ele
vation of the scapula somewhat alters the relations of the origin and inser
tion of this muscle, but not     to such a degree as to impart to   it its assumed
power, even if such elevation were, as it is not, a necessary condition in
forced inspiration.     Further, a careful observation of the well-marked
digitations  of this muscle   in a well-developed and thin person, during the
act of forced inspiration, failed to discover, either tangibly or visibly, any
contraction of their fibres, which was very distinctly marked when the
scapula was moved.        In stimulation of the muscle by electro-galvanism,
though the scapula was freely jerked and moved about, no movement
whatever of the ribs or interference with respiration resulted.              But it
must be admitted that not much importance can be attached to this ex
periment, as the more movable attachment of the muscle would necessarily
yield most readily during its contraction.       Indeed this remark applies to
all experiments of this nature, in which a single muscle is stimulated to

128       Mr. Lc Gros Clark    on (he Mechanism of Respiration.
contract, without reference to the cooperating or antagonistic action of
other muscles.    Such isolated experiments are therefore not only unsatis
factory, but often delusive.

   But the question which I have raised may be discussed a little more iu
 detail.  The inferior angle of the scapula reaches as low as the eighth rib,
while the thorax is in a state of repose after an ordinary inspiration.   The
lowest digitation of the serratus magnus, arising from the extreme end of
 the angle, follows the course of the eighth rib, and is attached to it.
Assuming for a moment the capability of the serratus magnus to act in
inspiration, it would be necessary for this result that the vertebral costa of
 the scapula be drawn back and rigidly fixed by the rhomboids &c. ;        the
 consequent extension of the fibres of the serratus is further enhanced     by
 the expansion of the chest during forced inspiration— a condition   which is
 not consistent with what is observed in other muscles during        a  passive

imitation of their action.                 In other words, the relation of the fibres of this
muscle to the ribs is such, that a passive imitation of the action ascribed to
them is to make tense and not to relax them ; they have to run over a
longer surface — a wider barrel.  But the fact     that the lower angle of the

regards the rest of the muscle.
   It   is   no doubt true that the serratus                  in action during deep inspira
                                                                 is

expiration         also   ;   and the action           in   each instance         is   explained       by    the fact
that this muscle   required to assist the trapezius in rotating outward the
                              is
lower angle of the scapula, and maintaining      in that position, in order to

accommodate the relation of the glenoid cavity to the head of the humerus,
and to afford         a   fixed attachment for the action of the deltoid.                              The chest
is, under these circumstances,  the relatively fixed origin of the serratus,
and the scapula its movable insertion on which      rests.                   it

   (1)    Anecessary condition to the action of this muscle on the thorax                                            is
the relative immobility of the scapula and humerus; but              healthy                      in   a
chest the most powerful inspiratory effort may he made without any such
assistance   and the pectoral fibres may be felt and seen to remain durin^
               ;

the fibres are in action                 but this condition
                                               due to their agency    is                                    in is

the bone.
   (2) The clavicular and upper portion of the sternal fibres may be con
sidered as incapable of raising the ribs, whilst the arm      not elevated                   is                       ;
the lower fibres alone can be supposed to possess this property or power.
Now the lowest fasciculus     not attached to the ribs, but terminates in
                                           is
the aponeurosis of the abdomen by broad fibrous expansion

these arises from the sixth rib and its cartilage, and from the adjacent
portion of the sternum they are inserted into the upper part of the outer

 and consequently cannot materially assist in the inspiratory effort.         we          If
 ascend a step higher, to the fifth rib, it would appear that the pectoral
 fibres will rather resist than assist in the act of inspiration ; still more is
 this the case nearer to the clavicle.

never assumed, even in disease, for the purpose of assisting inspiration.
  19. Indeed the same may be said of the serratus magnus and pectorales
as of the intercostals and other muscles credited with agency in respiration
that their action must be studied in relation to that of other muscles which
have an important influence in modifying or even in determiuuio- their
action  and bearing this in mind, and for the reasons adduced,

very questionable whether any of these muscles can exercise an                     influence
except under special conditions and to a very limited extent, in                   the act of

     21.   The action of   the scalenus anticus,       a   powerful   muscle,     is   essential

for fixing the first rib in inspiration ; and it may be distinctly felt so
acting in a thin neck, during forced inspiration, when the rib into which
it is inserted is raised with the sternum. The scalenus posticus has a
similar action on the second rib. The pectoralis minor, when the coracoid
process is fixed, and some few other unimportant muscles, may assist in the
elevation of the ribs.     In the absence of fixation of the upper or lower ribs,
if   such condition ever exist, it is difficult to resist the conclusion that the
action of the intercostals must necessarily limit the capacity of the chest,
by drawing the ribs towards       each other and rendering the intercostal spaces
 rigid.
     Of the lower ribs, experiment has satisfied me that both the tenth and
eleventh are raised during deep inspiration — the latter in a less degree than
 the former. The intercostal spaces between the tenth and eleventh, and
 between the eleventh and twelfth ribs, are consequently widened consider
 ably. The last rib is probably fixed by the attachment of the quadratus
 lumborum: this rib feels prominent and fixed during deep inspiration;
 whereas, under ordinary circumstances, it is loose and not easily felt.
     With the view of ascertaining the mobility of the sternum, and of com
 paring the antero-posterior and lateral movements of the chest, I procured
 a large pair of callipers, with a fixing screw attached.            I may thus state
 briefly  the result of my   observations  on  healthy   individuals.
     22. There is no perceptible increase in the antero-posterior diameter of
 the chest in ordinary inspiration.          The antero-posterior diameter of the
 chest is augmented perceptibly in forced inspiration at the junction of the
 second rib with the sternum, and but slightly more so at the junction of
 the sixth rib with the sternum.        The mean of the experiments gives about
  § of an inch, the variation being from § to jj between a state of rest and
 that of deep inspiration.       (An explanatory diagram was here shown.)
     The difference between expiration and a state of rest, in either of the
  above measurements, is about the same as between rest and inspiration, the
  latter being somewhat in excess, especially at the lower true ribs.
     The lateral diameter of the chest, in         deep   inspiration, is augmented,
 absolutely as well as relatively, to a greater degree than the antero-poste
 rior, in the proportion of 6 or 7 to 5, opposite the fifth or sixth rib ; but
 the maximum increase appears to be attained at about the eighth rib,
  where the mean is as 10 to 5.
     The movements of the sternum follow             those of the costal cartilages,
 and are dependent on them.            These movements, which occur in forced
 inspiration only, consist in an alternate advance and sinking of the bone,
  which is most marked at its lower extremity.
      23. The first rib is certainly capable of elevation during inspiration, and
 the anterior and middle scalenus muscle performs this office : probably its
  agency is limited, in ordinary inspiration, to fixing the rib.         In forced in
  spiration,  the action  of  the clavicular  portion  of   the stcrno-mastoid  is first
  apparent, and subsequently that of its sternal portion.

132         Mr. Le Gros Clark on the Mechanism of Respiration.
    24.   In ordinary expiration no muscular action is exerted   ;but in extra
ordinary expiration the ribs are drawn down by the abdominal muscles, at
the same time that the abdominal viscera are pressed upwards.          The in-
tercostals assist in this act when the lower ribs are thus fixed.   The levator
ani is an essential auxiliary in forced expiration. I do not attach much value
to the agency of the triangularis sterui and serratus posticus inferior as
muscles of expiration.       I am disposed rather to regard them as agents in
steadying the ribs for the diaphragm, and as antagonists, severally, to the
pectoral and latissimus dorsi muscles, thereby affording them a more fixed
attachment at their origin.

    25. The generally received assertion that there is a marked difference
in the   respiration of the two sexes, t. e. man and woman, confirmed,
apparently, by the observations of Hutchinson on young girls, has always
struck me as very remarkable ; for, whatever hypothesis may be adduced
to favour the relative advantage of such peculiarity, as regards woman,
there certainly is no anatomical difference, either in the natural osseous
conformation of the chest or in the muscular apparatus of respiration, to
account for the predominance of the abdominal type of breathing in the
male, and of the thoracic type in the female.
   It naturally occurs to any one, in contemplating this circumstance, to
attribute something to the peculiar dress of civilized women — the fashion of
compressing the lower part of the chest, which is universal.       There can
be no doubt that   this compression, commenced as it is at a very early
period amongst all classes, long before the development of the skeleton is
completed, must exercise a permanent influence in altering the form of the
chest, and must   thus impart a factitious reality to that which is not
natural.     I
           believe that the early age at which this compression is begun,
even amongst the lower orders, as      Ihave ascertained by inquiry, has
possibly misled so careful an observer as Hutchinson.     I have repeated
his experiments on young boys and girls, but with results at variance with
those which he obtained.   These results may be thus stated.
    26.   In ordinary respiration the upper costal respiratory   movements
are equal in male and female   ;they are increased in both by girding the
abdomen and lower ribs with a roller.     The lower costal movements are
also equal in the two sexes, and are not percep tibly affected by the action
of the roller.
   The difference in the thoracic girth between ordinary         expiration and
inspiration is very slight, indeed scarcely perceptible.
   27. In extraordinary respiration the costal movements, both upper
and lower, are much greater in forced inspiration in the male than in the
female.    The lower costal movements are much interfered with, in both, by
the compression of the abdomen and lower part of the chest, while the
upper costal movements are exaggerated.
   I may add that, in the adult female, there as might be expected,
                                                 is,                         a
striking difference in the relative mobility of the chest and abdomen, when

             Mr. Le Gros Clark           on the Mechanism      of Respiration.          133
the respiratory movements are observed whilst the usual tight dress is
worn, and when the figure is at liberty to expand more naturally on
removal      of the dress.
    28. Moreover,      the form of the bust in the female lends a further aid to
the influence     of dress, by exaggerating the thoracic movements. Thus in
stout women with full bosom, the rise and fall of the chest is much more
apparent      than in those in whom the bosom is spare and ill developed.
This may       be partly accounted for by the greater interference which is due
to the increased compression exerted to reduce the size of the waist by
stout women, but not wholly so. An artificial arrangement on the upper
part of the chest of the male, by which prominence is given to this region,
when the waist is compressed, at once exhibits distinct thoracic movements
 which were not otherwise perceptible.              I am disposed, therefore, to believe
 that the asserted natural difference in the respiration of the two sexes is due
 to the altered form of the chest, consequent on compression, and to the
 habitual confinement of the lower costal region, which necessitates the habit
 of thoracic breathing.          It is to be regretted that experiments to determine
 this question have not       been conducted in some uncivilized community,           which
 has not attained to the cultivated refinement of endeavouring to improve the
 natural symmetry of form at the expense of health and comfort.                    I am not
 aware that any such attempt has yet been made.
     P.S. — Since writing the above,         I have had the opportunity of conversing
 with M. Duchenne, who performed             some experiments with electro-magnetism
 at St. Thomas's      Hospital to demonstrate the action of various muscles.
     He expressed himself strongly respecting the action of the intercostal*
 as   exclusively muscles of inspiration.            This opinion is based partly on
 experiments performed upon decapitated criminals, and partly on clinical
 observations in cases of muscular atrophy.                   Immediately      after death
 M. Duchenne applied            the  stimulus    of an  interrupted    current   to the in
 tercostal muscles, with the result of raising the ribs.               He stated that he
 isolated as far as possible the external from the              internal  set of muscles,
 and found stimulation           of either   set produced     the same     result.    I give
 these statements as       I  received    them, but  I did not witness the experiments
 referred to.
    The following      are the    chief points, either disputed or not previously re
 cognized, which it is       the object of the preceding observations and experi
 ments to establish : —
     1. The normal      state   of the diaphragm, when         at rest, is that  of arched
 tension   ;  and this condition       is due to the elasticity    of the lungs resisting
 the atmospheric pressure on its thoracic surface.
    2. This tension is such that the diaphragm cannot be forced upwards
 whilst the ribs are fixed ; and is exerted in drawing the ribs inwards when
  the intercostal muscles are relaxed.

  134        Mr. Le Gros Clark        on t/ie Mechanism     of Respiration.
     3. The results due to this passive tension are that (a) it retains the sup
 plemental air in the lungs ; (6) it limits the encroachment of the abdo
 minal viscera on the thoracic cavity ; (c) by virtue of the attachment of
 the pericardium to the cordiform tendon, the uniform calibre of this bag is
 secured, and the heart is thus protected from being impeded in its move
 ments during respiration, the crura taking part in maintaining this condi
 tion when the muscle contracts          ; (d) it economizes active power in in
 spiration.
     4. Inspiration.— When the upper ribs are fixed by the scaleni, both sets
 of intercostal muscles act in increasing the transverse diameter of the
 chest, by raising the curve of the ribs and the sternum.
     They rotate the ribs outwards.
     They fix the thoracic walls, and thus antagonize the tendency of the
diaphragm to draw inwards the ribs to which it is attached.                A fixed cir
cumference      is thereby secured,   from   which  the  diaphragm    acts  in altering
its own form ; and this is one of the most important functions of the in
tercostal muscles.
     They   assist  in expiration   when the lowest ribs are fixed         by the ab
dominal muscles.
     5. The scalenus anticus and posticus (especially the former) are auxilia
  ries in inspiration by raising and fixing the first and second ribs, and thus
 rendering them relatively immovable.
     Thus, when the scaleni     act, the intercostal muscles raise the ribs     ; when
 the scaleni are at rest, and the abdominal muscles act, the intercostals de
  press the ribs ; if neither the scaleni nor abdominal muscles were to act,
  the ribs would be approximated at their centre by the action of the inter
 costal muscles.
     6. The pectoralis minor (when the coracoid process is fixed), the lower
costal portion of the pectoralis major, and some other muscles of minor
importance might assist in elevating the ribs; but it is questionable whether
they ever do so in such way as to assist in inspiration.
     7. The serratus magnus has no action in inspiration ; all but its lowest
digitation must draw the ribs downwards,          if  they act on them at all.
    8. The action which the sterno-mastoid          is capable of exerting in inspi
ration is by fixing the first rib through the medium of the clavicle, and by
raising the sternum.       This is not required in health, but may be witnessed
occasionally in disease.
     9. Expiration.   — Ordinary    expiration is accomplished     by the elastic re
siliency    of the lungs,    the tense diaphragm resuming          its arched form
when the muscle ceases to contract : the elasticity of the ribs and ab
dominal parietcs may assist to a limited extent ; after a deep inspiration
this elasticity has a more important share in expiration.             The abdominal
muscles, which, conjointly with the levalor ani, are the agents of forced
expiration, do not act by urging the abdominal viscera against the tense
diaphragm, which would resist the pressure, to the injury of these viscera,

             Mr. Le Gros Clark     on the Mechanism    of Respiration.             135
but ngainst the relaxed diaphragm       — relaxed,   that    is,
                                                    by the abdominal
muscles drawing down the lower ribs, and thus contracting the circum
ference of the lower part of the chest.
   The intercostal muscles also contribute importantly to this result, as the
effect of their contraction    reversed, by the lower ribs being relatively
                              is
fixed during the action of the abdominal muscles. In this way both the
long diameter and circumference of the chest are abridged.
   10. The upper and lower costal movements in both sexes, when entirely
unfettered, are equal, in ordinary inspiration and in the uncontracted
chest.
  The costal movements, both upper and lower,        are much greater    in   forced
inspiration in the   male than in the female.
   In    both, the lower costal movements are much abridged        by
                                                                 compression
of the abdomen and lower part of the     chest, while the upper costal move
ments are exaggerated.

abdomen     due to artificial compression, and to the altered form of the
             is

          By C. Piazzi Smyth, F.R.S., Astronomer Royal for Scotland.
          Received December 13, 1871.
   One great object with the solar-eclipse expeditionists at work to-day in
the far East is to trace spectroscopically the existence of any faint solar
luminous appendage to a further distance from the sun than the brighter
parts of the corona hitherto so identified.
     But       further they cannot go, on account of the large amount of
            much
general atmospheric illumination during every lunar-solar eclipse.     The
matter may, however, be taken up again during a terrestrial solar eclipse,
i. a. an ordinary sunset below the horizon, if the sun be sufficiently far
below to terminate all aerial twilight. Under such circumstances, too, it is
that the zodiacal light, historically called the sun's atmosphere, is occasion
ally seen stretching away to distances of 60, 90, and even more degrees
from the sun.
     Now I have recently been trying to test in this manner an alleged
foreign observation of the zodiacal light's spectrum, but in vain. Some
sort of faint bluing of the dark night sky there certainly was over the
north-western    horizon when the sun was more than 18° vertically below,
and its spectrum I noted at the time, but only as being that of the very
last of the twilight.
   Perhaps it was only that ; but perhaps, also, it may have been the direct
light of some solar appendage approximating to the outer coronal region ;
for, on making up the accompanying plate* of nine observed spectra, and
comparing them with a tabular solar spectrum, a wide distance was mani
fested between the place of maximum light in the solar continuous spec
trum, as given by Fraunhofer, or near wave-length 5620, and in my so-
called residual twilight spectrum, which was wave-length 5300.
     I
     tested, therefore, lately Fraunhofer's value for the solar spectrum in
my own night-apparatus, by darkening its objective to all but extinction
with four thicknesses of linen cloth in the middle of a dull, grey day, and
found for the last visible portion of continuous spectrum wave-length 5 700
nearly ; that       is,
                Fraunhofer's value was confirmed, and my residual-twilight
spectrum left anomalous as regards the ordinary solar spectrum, but re
markably agreeable with the corona spectrum, whose chief line has wave
length 5322, and which spectrum has been shown by Mr. Lockyer to de
crease its number      of lines, and tend to form    faint continuous

vatives were the same as those of the hexane from petroleum ; it must,
however, be stated that the boiling-points of some were a little higher than
those of the petroleum hydrocarbon, and there was also a marked differ
ence observed between the two caproic acids.     That from mannite gave a
well -crystallized barium-salt, whilst that from petroleum could only be
obtained in the amorphous state ; but as the two secondary alcohols

well as that which Zincke obtained from primary octyl alcohol, have the

    En   effet, le spectre de la couronne s'est montré dans mon télescope, non
pas    continu, comme on l'avait trouvé jusqu'ici, mais remarquablement
complexe.        J'y ai constaté  :  les raies brillantes   quoique bien plus faibles
du gaz hydrogène qui forme le principal élément                  des Protubérances et
de la Chromosphère ;
    La   raie brillante verte qui a dejà été signalée aux éclipses de 1869              et
 1 870, et quelques autres plus faibles ;
    Des   raies obscures du spectre solaire ordinaire, notamment celle du
sodium (D).        Ces raies sont bien plus difficiles à apercevoir.
    Ces faits prouvent l'existence de matière dans le voisinage du soleil,
matière     qui se manifeste dans les éclipses totales par des phénomènes
d'émission, d'absorption et de polarisation.
    Mais la discussion des faits nous conduit plus loin encore.
    Outre la matière cosmique, independante du soleil, qui doit exister dans
le voisinage     de cet  astre, les observations        démontrent     l'existence d'une
atmosphère étendue, excessivement rare, à base d'hydrogène, s'étendant
beaucoup au-delà de la Chromosphère et des Protubérances, et s' alimen
tant de la matière même de celles-ci, matière lancée avec tant de violence
à travers la photosphère, ainsi que nous le constatons tous les jours.
    La rareté de cette atmosphère, à une certaine distance de la chromo-
sphère doit être excessive ; son existence n'est donc point en desaccord
avec les observations de quelques passages de comètes près du soleil.

II.   "Experiments concerning the Evolution of Life from Lifeless

    The work already accomplished, and the arguments adduced both in
favour of and contradictory to the theory of spontaneous generation, have
been so frequently under discussion of late, that it is needless to enter on^a
review of them.        Furthermore, the question is one in which verbal argu
ment is of little   value  compared with experimental evidence.
                                                          '
    On June 30th, 18/0, there appeared in ' Nature a paper by Dr. Bastian,
entitled " Facts and Reasonings concerning the heterogeneous evolution of
Living Things ;" the perusal of this, and its continuation, led to the belief
that another interpretation might be put on the results obtained by Schwann,
 Pasteur, and others, not so much by virtue of the arguments made use of,
 as by accounts of experiments given in detail.         The most remarkable case
 was   that   of  Exp.  19,  in which   the  author   gave a drawing of a large
 organized mass obtained from a solution of sodium phosphate and am
 monia tartrate, which had been exposed to a temperature varying between
 146° C. and 153° C. for four hours.           This organism was seen to grow
 within the flask till it attained a certain size, beyond which it did not in
 crease.    Now a fact so distinctly stated as the production of an organism,
 and its development to a considerable size, from a liquid containing nothing
 further than phosphate of soda and tartrate of ammonia, in a flask from which
 the air had been most thoroughly withdrawn, and which, when contain
 ing the liquid and hermetically sealed, had been heated to so high a tem
  perature, was (admitting the conditions and performance of the experiment*
  to be faultless) an absolute proof of the evolution of living matter de novo.
 For my own satisfaction,       I determined to commence a series         of careful
 experiments, in some cases adhering strictly to the conditions of those
  made by Dr. Bastian ; but it was necessary to devise some refinement on
  the mode of examining the liquids experimented on without exposure to
  atmospheric air ; the means for accomplishing this          I  will now describe.
  The most promising plan seemed to be, to open the sealed vessels in an
  atmosphere artificially prepared so as to be free of living matter. Hydrogen
  being fourteen times lighter than common air, may remain in contact with
  it without risk of contamination by floating matter ; indeed Prof. Tyndall'a
  demonstration, by means of a powerful beam of light, that such au atmo
  sphere is free from dust, was sufficient to warrant its use.           The means
  whereby    this fact was  made  of further  practical value  are the following : —
     1st. The experimental tubes in which the infusions and solutions were
  heated were made of ordinary combustion tubing drawn out at the lower
  end, first to a finer tube \ the diameter of the original, and after a space of
  an  inch or so to extreme smallness.         The solution or infusion was then
  made in a flask with distilled water, drawn by a siphon from a carboy

 1872.]            Evolution of Life from Lifeless Matter.                      141
after standing at rest for many hours, the siphon dipping into the middle
of the liquid. The flask was, after the usually careful cleansing that
chemical vessels require, rinsed out with a solution of potassium dichro-
mate mixed with strong sulphuric, acid, then washed out with distilled
water.    A further quantity of distilled water collected in this vessel was
used for the solution.     The experimental tube, with the lower end drawn out
but open, was cleansed with acid dichromate, and afterwards with hot distilled
water.    The fine point was open, in order to let the liquids run through,
otherwise   a drop    might have collected in its capillary portion, and, not
being dislodged, would have interfered with the experiment.               This tube
then, best described by fig. 1, had the fine end sealed up, and the liquid to
be experimented on ponred in        till it about half-filled the tube. The upper
part was then drawn       out, so as to serve a purpose yet to be named, and
also in such  a manner that it could be adapted to the Sprengel exhauster ;
after this operation it had the form of fig. 2.           It was then fitted to the
Sprengel by means of a tube shown in fig. 3, which admitted of connexion
by means of two Sprengel joints, the one over the experimental tube being
made air-tight with water.        The reason for water being used was this :
had there    been  a leak,     water would     have entered    the tube, and so no
damage would have resulted ; but had it been mercury or glycerine, the
tube would necessarily have been rejected. The use of the bulb on the
connecting-piece was to catch the water which boiled or distilled over
during the exhausting process. After complete exhaustion, recognized by
the clicking of the falling mercury, a blowpipe-flame was cautiously applied
to the fine tube  till it fused thoroughly, and it was then drawn away from
the other portion. What was so far accomplished was the sealing of a
solution or infusion in a vacuous tube of the annexed form (fig. 4). The

142                           Mr. W. N. Hartley     on the                [Feb. 8,
tubes thus prepared were heated in an air-bath, consisting of horizontal iron
pipes surrounded by two iron jackets.          The tubes lying horizontally were
not in contact with the liquid on the upper part ; so, after being heated in
the one direction      for a period, at Prof. Tyndall's suggestion they were
turned over and      heated   anew, so as to bring every part of the tube into
contact with the heated liquid.         These tubes had generally a bead of glass
fused to one side, so that if the tube were heated with the bead uppermost,
it had to      be turned    over and heated again, the bead being downwards.
Generally four tubes were heated at a time ; and one of these was soon after
cooling opened to allow access of air, in order to observe whether any
change occurred        differing   from any that might take place in the sealed
tubes.
    2nd. Apparatus for examining the contents microscopically           out of con
 tact with air. — This consisted of a bell-jar closed at the top with a bung,
 and supported on a tripod ; this bell-jar was kept filled with hydrogen by
 means of a self-regulating apparatus continually passing a gentle stream
 of  gas into the upper part      of the jar by means of a glass tube. The bung
 was bored    with  an eccentric hole   ; through this passed the tube containing
 the liquid for examination ; the end of the tube-passed very little below half
 way down the bell-jar.         Under this was a small tripod, on which rested a
 glass plate to be used as a stage for the microscope slips.        The tube then
 being   in  situ, over   the  upper point   was tightly slipped a piece of non-
 vulcanized india-rubber tube connected with a constant hydrogen gene
 rator.    It was not deemed advisable to make use of coal-gas, because, had
 any lifeless organism been found in a tube, it might have been objected
 that a trace of benzole or naphthalene vapour or other impurity had been
 fatal to the experiment.        On the india-rubber tube were two burette clips ;
  now, by breaking the fine point within the india-rubber         (a scratch with a

1872.]                  Evolution of Life from Lifeless Matter.                        143
file being previously made upon it), hydrogen flows into the vacuous tube.
Both clips are now closed, and by means of forceps, the hand being be
neath the bell-jar, the lower end of the tube is broken off. No liquid, how
ever, escapes, because the internal pressure is not much in excess of that of
the atmosphere. The condition of things now can be explained only by the
aid of a drawing (fig. 5) : the whole arrangement consists of a pipette con
taining the experimental liquid above and below, which is an atmosphere
of hydrogen ; each drop of liquid expelled is received on a slip of glass in
such an atmosphere.   A drop of liquid is deposited by squeezing the space
of india-rubber          the two clips, that clip nearest the bell-jar being
                    between
open ; before removing   the   pressure, it is again closed, and the partial
vacuum made by compressing the india-rubber is filled up by allowing gas
to flow in from the apparatus.    This precaution prevents the possibility of
the atmosphere of the bell-jar bubbling up into the tube after a little fluid
has been discharged.
  3rd. Treatment      the glass slips. — These are heated in an air-bath to
                          of
about 200° C, taken out while hot with forceps, and placed on the stage
in the hydrogen to cool, and kept there till wanted.
  4th. The glass covers. — These     are washed in the acid-dichromate      solu
tion, then in distilled water, and finally in alcohol, and, being picked up by
a pair of peculiar forceps, are heated over an argand burner till very hot ;
they are then held in the glass vessel full of gas till cool enough to use. The
forceps I devised (fig. 6) have points of watch-spring steel, so that a thin
glass cover may be firmly gripped without breakage.          They are made by
cutting a small pair of crucible tongs an inch or so before the part where they
bend at right angles ; they have then two pieces of thin brass rivetted on,
which are bent at right angles an inch or so from their ends ; the points are

 slightly acidified with tartaric acid.        It was found that iu no case should
 filtering   be resorted    to  if possible, as the finest Swedish      paper transfers
  myriads of its fibres to the liquid.        Paper of nitro-cellulose (that is to say,
 Swedish filter-paper treated with a mixture of sulphuric and nitric acids) is
 disintegrated to a less extent than ordinary paper ; and it is possible that,
 for special purposes, it might be of service in filtering a liquid so as to
 render it clear of fine particles, though no filtration will thoroughly clear
 a liquid.      With proper care, however, filtration is unnecessary when deal
 ing   with  solutions   of definite salts.
     On July loth, 1870, a tube was half•filled with the above 5 per cent.
 solution of the mixed salts, and exhausted by the Sprengel.                 On trying
 whether it acted as a water-hammer on the following day the tube was split
 into fragments.        The tubes require very careful handling, as the pointed
 ends give way readily.
     July  1 6th,  1870. — Three other tubes were sealed up with the same liquid,
 the exhaustion in each case being perfect.            The glass was heated to red
 ness before introducing the liquid.          After heating to 1 50° C. for four hours
 (during a few minutes the temperature accidentally rose to 180°), the tubes
 in a perpendicular position were placed at rest on a shelf, where the tem
 perature was about 25° C.
     Exp. I. The liquid, at first clear, after the lapse of three days had depo
sited flocculi.     On October 7th one of the tubes was opened in the apparatus,
 and with the care already described. The gelatinous matter, on examination
 by a microscope magnifying 400 diameters, showed no signs of organization
 or structure of any kind.         A small quantity was collected on a very small
 Swedish filter, and removed by means of a small platinum spatula.                   On
heating    it  did  not char,  and  was therefore  inorganic  matter  ; the usual blow
pipe tests showed it to be silica.          The disodic phosphate had attacked the
glass ; the silica deposited on standing, and hence the jelly-like mass. The
remainder of the liquid was examined, but no trace of an organism could be
detected.       This tube had been kept exactly 84 days, during which time its
temperature ranged between 1 8° and 25° C.
     On July 21st, 1870, three other tubes containing freshly prepared am
monium tartrate and sodium phosphate were sealed up, the liquid being
simply boiled to expel air; these were heated to 110°C. for three hours.
Range of temperature 18° to 25° C.
     Exp. II. No. 1 was opened October 7th, and examined with the same
microscopic power.          No living organism, and no trace of organic matter
even, beyond a cotton-fibre and one or two small patches of indefinite and
shapeless matter, which came from the solid residue of the liquid adhering
to the glass within the capillary tube being charred in the act of sealing up.
Several drops of liquid were examined at the lower point, the centre, and
the surface, with the above results in the first case, but in the latter portions
the liquid was absolutely clear.          This tube had been kept 78 days.

life was discernible.     Time kept 78 days. Heated to 110°C.
     Exp. IV. Tube containing phosphate of soda and tartrate of ammonia,
perfectly exhausted. Sealed on August 6th, 1870. Heated to 140° C. for
four hours.       Opened October 8th.
     Seven drops of liquid were taken from the tube, but no trace of living
 matter was discernible.       The first drop contained a cotton-fibre and a small
 brown mass, identical in nature with that before mentioned.             On October
 1 2th a renewed examination was made with a higher power,
                                                                    J inch, by Ross,
 kindly lent by Mr. Savory, which, with the eyepiece used before, gave an
 enlargement of about 600 diameters.           A diligent search revealed nothing
 beyond what was before noticed.            The contents of the tube were then
 allowed to run into a flask cleansed first with acid bichromate and then
 rinsed twice or thrice with hot distilled water, and finally dried in an air-
 bath.       The flask and its contents were closed against dust of a coarse kind,
 which, though not floating in the air, might have fallen into the liquid.
  By inverting a small beaker over its mouth, it was allowed to remain with
  the unopened tubes at a temperature of 25° C.            On November 3rd a small
  fungoid growth was noticed in the liquid, and on November 7th this had
  increased to | inch in diameter.       It proved to be a mass of Pencillium with
  abundance of mycelium-filaments          interlaced.     The fellow tube, sealed
  on August 6th and unopened, had nothing in it that the eye, aided by a
  lens and a powerful light, could detect.        Several other tubes were prepared,
  but no further examination was made with the microscope.                In no case,
  however (and some of the tubes had been sealed nearly six months),             was
  any sign of life perceptible.
       Unfortunately a very serious illness for some time prevented the con
   tinuance of my experiments. This work was done in the chemical laboratory
   of the Royal Institution. I cannot, therefore, omit giving my best thanks
   to Dr. Odling, and also to Prof. Tyndall, for their kindly interest and
   advice.

                             Modification of Experiments.
      In the renewed examination of liquids kept some time in sealed tubes,
   commenced in July 1871, a slight modification in the original method of
   proceeding was used. A bell-jar was chosen, the upper mouth of which
   was ground perfectly flat at the edge.        Instead of inserting a bung with a
   hole in it to receive the tubes, a metal disk, with a wide metal tube placed
   eccentrically and projecting half an inch, was luted on to the mouth of the
   jar by means of grease, or, better still, what is known in pharmacy as
   restate eeratum. The glass sealed tube was then slipped into an india-rubber
   conical stopper, or rather ring*; for the thickness of it was so slight that
      * These things are mode and sold for the purpose of fixing the taps into beer-
    barrels.

    a tube     of any         size could      be made to   fit   it,   either       by   the india-rubber
    stretching when the tube happened to be large, or by binding with a piece
    of copper wire when     fitted loosely.
                                    it      The pipette was scratched with                              a
    file at each end, and over the upper one was slipped piece of india-rubber a
 tube, attached to  tube of glass about inch

 clip, and the extremity of the tube enclosed                         by

 than     drop or two of the liquid escaping.

thought    better   not to  place  the flasks  or tubes  in water, because  the aqueous

prepared subsequently.           It is at any rate satisfactory to know that it was
lifeless, and the only thing of the kind met with. It is impossible to get glass
apparatus quite clean by means of hot water ; those in the habit of making
organic analyses are acquainted with the large amount of dirt which can be
swept out of a tube by a plug of filter-paper or cotton•wool, after washing
with abundance of boiling water.
                              Experimental Results.
 The whole      of the  tubes, an   account    of  which here follows, were kept for
        sixteen weeks at a temperature of 30° to 34° C. during the daytime,
         and not lower than 20° C. at night.               A fluctuating temperature is
        considered by Dr. Bastian to be favourable to evolutional changes*.
        From the month of February till the time of examination the tempera
         ture would never      be lower    than    16°  C,    and was never higher than
         30° C.
     A. A solution containing about           4 per cent.     of a mixture  of sodium di
  phosphate and ammonic tartrate, and having a neutral reaction, was placed
  in three tubes, which were exhausted with a Sprengel, sealed up, and heated
  for three hours to 150° C.         Prepared on July I6th, 1870.
      No. 1 . No trace of any organized matter discovered ; nothing but a little
  silica dissolved out of the glass.        Opened October 18th, 1870. Time kept
  three months.
      No.   2.  Examined    July   17th, 1871.       Kept over a year. No living or
  ganism found.        In this tube the animalcule already mentioned was met
   with. The liquid was turbid with silica.
      No. 3. Examined September 2nd, 1871.                   Kept a year and six weeks.
   Nothing found.        The silica makes these tubes troublesome to examine, ou
   account of the capillary point tending to become stopped.
      B. Tube prepared July 15th, 1870.                Solution of salts, as in preceding
   experiments.      Air  expelled by boiling     for  ten  minutes.    Heated to 130° C.
   Kept    one year and two months.       Examined September 12th, 1871. Vacuum
   good.     Nothing noticeable     seen.
      C. Same solution, but with decidedly acid reaction.                Prepared August
   8th, 1870. Opened July 17th, 1871. Kept ten months and twenty-five days.
   No trace of any organism ; many drops of liquid absolutely free from any
   thing whatever. The lower end of this tube was a little too large, so that,
   in spite of the upper end being closed, the liquid would drop out.               It was
   caught in a little glass vessel placed in the bell-jar, and drops were re
   moved as required by dipping the point of the tube in and touching the
   glass slide.
      D. October 10th, 1870.          A   strong infusion was made by pouring warm
   distilled water over finely shred turnips, and allowing to digest for some
   time.     The liquid was filtered twice through the finest Swedish paper, and

allowed to stand for some hours, when a portion was siphoned off, placed
in tubes completely exhausted with a Sprengel pump, and sealed up. The
tubes were heated to 120°C. for three hours.             The tube marked T, and
called the     " test-tube
                            "  in  these  and all the following experiments, was
treated in just the same way as the others, and heated at the same time to
ascertain whether a high temperature had any prejudicial effect on the de
velopment of life.
    No. 1. Opened July 14th, 1871.              Kept nine months and one week.
Vacuum perfect.         Liquid perfectly clear ; flavour and smell like that of
fresh infusion.       No change had taken place.
    No. 2. Opened July 15th, 1871.              Kept nine months and eight days.
Vacuum perfect.          Liquid quite fresh in smell and flavour, and clear in
appearance.        Quite unchanged.

Vacuum perfect.           Liquid perfectly fresh in smell and flavour, clear in
 appearance.       Quite unchanged.
    No. 4, T. Opened October 12th. On 19th, in a space of seven days, the
 liquid had become turbid. On October 31st it was crowded with white
 matter, and had a very offensive smell.          The microscope showed masses of
 Tbru/a-cells. The magnify ing-power used was 400 diameters.
    The original solution, which had been kept covered by an inverted
 beaker over the mouth of the flask, was turbid six days after its prepara
 tion. As turbidity was noticed in the solution, which had been sealed in
 vacuo and heated to 120° C, in less than seven days (the tube being
 opened at night and examined in the morning) after exposure to the air, we
 see that heating had no interference         with the experiment.
    E.   October 12th, 1870.        Sodium phosphate and ammonic tartrate.     So
 lution containing 3 to 4 per cent. of the mixed salts. Completely exhausted
 with a Sprengel pump.           Heated three hours to 130° C.
    No. 1. Examined August 24th, 1871. Kept ten months and two weeks.
 Vacuum perfect. Many drops of liquid free from any thing. Quite unal

    No. 2.   Air expelled by boiling. Vacuum good. Opened July 19th, 1871.
 Kept   nine months.        Remarkably little solid matter seen : no organism met
 with.
    No. 3, T. Opened October 18th, 1870. Exposed to the air twenty days.
 Not examined till November 7th. Five masses the size of peas were seen
 floating on the liquid ; they proved to consist of mucor, with fructification.
     F. October 18th, 1870. Urine boiled and filtered from mucus.            Each
 tube exhausted with the Sprengel.             Heated to 1 30° C. for three hours.
 After heating, what is believed to be a trace of phosphate of lime sepa

     No.  1.   In February     1871 the liquid was perfectly clear and seemingly
 unaltered   ;  when   next   examined   the point of the tube was found to have
 been broken and the liquid had been lost.           Kept about fourteen weeks.

     No. 2. Opened August 29th, 1871. Kept over ten months and a half.
 Nothing unusual was seen in the liquid ; it smelt perfectly fresh, and looked
 quite bright and clear.
     No. 3. Opened July 19th, 1871. Kept nearly nine months.                The liquid
 was quite fresh and clear.         There were seen two or three minute bodies, too
 small for any definite observation to be made concerning their form. They
 had apparently an irregular rotatory slow motion, which continued ; and
 careful observation led me to conclude it was only the Brownian move
 ment.       This conclusion was afterwards confirmed.          See F' 3.
     No. 4, T. Opened October 19th, 1870. Both Torula and mucors were
 discovered in abundance after three weeks' exposure to the air.
Liquids which, after prolonged preservation in sealed tubes, were exposed
         to air filtered through cotton-wool, kept at a temperature o/30°-34°C.
        during the daytime, and not below 24° C. at night.
     D'. No. 1. Examined on July 21st, and again September 7th, 1871. —
The liquid was quite unchanged.              Nothing found in it after a period of
 fifty-two days.
     No. 2. Examined        August 22nd and September 8th.           No trace of any
organism.          Quite unaltered.   Kept fifty-four days.
     No. 3. As the first sign of any change occurring in the solution is tur
bidity, this tube was not submitted to microscopical examination.                   On
September 8th it was still perfectly clear to the eye, apparently quite un
altered after more than a month.
     E'. No. 2. Opened July 19th, examined September 13th,                1871, after a
 period of two months.          Quite unaltered.
     F'. Examined after exposure to air for five weeks, from July 19th to
August 23rd, 1871.
     No. 3. The liquid smelt quite fresh, and was unaltered in appearance.
Only two of the minute particles previously mentioned were seen : they
were most certainly lifeless, and also for the most part motionless ; one was
seen to move with a current in the liquid, but the rotatory motions before
noticed did not occur.         A  most attentive examination for a length of time
was devoted to these bodies ; in size they could not have been larger than
0-00002 inch.         The conclusion  as to their being lifeless was borue out by the
fact that their small number (only five were seen) had not increased, though
under favourable circumstances for reproduction, even after a period of five
weeks.
    No. 2. Sept.       13.  Liquid quite unaltered.      Kept nine weeks.
Liquids which, after prolonged keeping without development of life, were
        afterwards exposed to ordinary air at a temperature ranging between
        24° C. and 34° C.       Any pipette or glass rod placed in these liquids
        had immediately before been heated to at least 200° C.

The liquid was very turbid, and smelt very offensive ; it swarmed with

1872.]             Evolution of Life from Lifeless Matter.                       151
vibriones and   some excessively small bodies, all in rapid motion.           An im
mense number of minute bodies, 0'000025 in length, consisting of two
cells, which are believed to be Torula in an early stage, besides one or two
full-sized Torula-cells, were noticed. On July 2 1st an immense quantity of
Torula and some fibrous growth, most probably fungus or conferva, ap
peared in addition to the other minute organisms.            The liquid was boiled
violently for  a few minutes, but not longer,        as the   liquid frothed much.
The vibriones remained      as lively as ever.
   No. 2. Examined August 1st. Nothing observed ; liquid unchanged.
August 22nd the liquid had evaporated to some extent. A thick coating
of Mucor* and Torula covered the syrupy solution.               Kept seventeen days
without alteration ; total time exposed to air more than five weeks.
   No. 3. Opened August 24th.          On August 27th the liquid was observed
to have a very slight sediment ; later on a downy growth was observed ad
hering to the side of the flask.       On the following day, August 28th, the
liquid, which had become very turbid, was examined. It contained im
mense quantities of the undeveloped Torula.             None of these bodies were
seen to move.      Reexamined September 1st; the tuft of down proved to
be conferva. On September 4th the liquid was a mass of Torula. The con-
fervoid growth had increased very little ; there was a quantity of proto
plasmic, perhaps germinal, matter distributed through the liquid, which
was invisible in many parts until stained with carmine.
   E". No. 1 . On August 28th, after three days' exposure to air, some
specks of white matter were noticed adhering to the sides of the little
beaker-glass in which the liquid was placed. On removing and examining
them with the microscope, they seemed to consist of spores of fungi ger
minating.
   No. 2. Examined      July   29th, 1871.     Exposed to the air ten days.        A
small mass, like a tuft of down, was observed with the unaided eye ; it proved
to be a collection of mycelium-filaments,          and Mucor with fructification.
Reexamined August 22nd.           A mass of green conferva covered the liquid,
and both Torula and Mucor were present.
   F". No. 2. This liquid was examined on September 2nd, 1871, after barely
four days' exposure to the air. There were many bodies such as I have
described as undeveloped Torula (Exp. D", No. 1).                 On September 4th
there   were  many   sarcinaj   to be  seen, besides vibriones and other very
minute bodies, in the greatest state of activity.          Some of them seemed to
attach themselves by one end to a point, and swing themselves round and
round at   a great speed  ;  they did not measure more than 0'00005 inch in          •
length.   There were seen some "figure-of-eight" particles in rapid motion ;
they differed from the minute Torulce by being less oval in form, and capable
of moving rapidly.
   No. 3. The quantity of liquid was very small.            On August 23rd it had
become very turbid ; instead of examining it with the microscope, an addi-

  It may doubtless appear to some        that my particular mode of experi
menting  involves the introduction of needless complications, that others have
obtained the same results without the use of such apparatus ; but the in
correctness of this will be admitted when I say that       was not wholly pre     I
pared for such a result, and the necessity of being guarded, of being safe,
indeed, from every possibility of error, is absolute. Had living things been
discovered, that the experimental method and apparatus was a matter of
the first importance would have been evident, inasmuch as it excluded all
possibility of atmospheric contamination of the experimental liquids during
examination.     In a word, it was necessary to be prepared for any result,
and be guarded on every side. The foregoing description records all the
experiments         I   have made with the view of obtaining                             the information     I
sought.    It   will     be noticed        that the evidence afforded is perfectly                     con
cordant.
    The appearances described in Exp. 20*, by Dr. Bastian, are, with the
exception of the fungus-spores and bicellular bodies, exactly what one
sees in silica.  Having ascertained the fact that phosphate of soda, and
especially when not neutralized with acid, attacks glass tubes at a tempe
rature of 150° C, and as in this case sodic phosphate and ammonic carbo
nate were heated for four hours at 146° C. to 153° C, I examined the
silica deposited from my own tubes, and observed the gelatinous matter
resembling such to be met with in solutions containing infusoria : there
were two or three transparent spherules also which I believe to be water
enclosed in silica ; they are often seen in pectized silica.    As for the
matter becoming stained by magenta, that is no evidence of its nature, this
property being shared by silicaf . It may further be remarked that magenta
would be precipitated on addition to such a solution by the alkaline phos
phate and carbonate : those parts more deeply stained than the others
would be those where rosaniline was precipitated ; it would be impossible
to use a salt of rosaniline for the purpose successfully.  The nature of the
solution, too, is such that no life will appear in                    it,
                                                     even on exposure to the
air.  An alkaline solution of phosphate of soda and an ammonia salt was
kept ten months open to the air, yet no change took place, while several
other portions were kept for    shorter period at
                                            a      temperature of 24° to  a
34° C. with like result.

 process, but also why others, and particularly M. Pasteur, have obtained
 results leading to directly an opposite conclusion .              These arguments are not
 drawn from experimental evidence ; they do not therefore fall within the
 bounds of this discussion            ; but I would      point out that, in one case, not
 only do Dr. Bastian's own experiments deny the truth of a most important
 assumption of the evolutionists, but also at the same time my own experi
 ence proves the contrary.              He says* : — " The disruptive agency of heat is
 fairly enough supposed by the evolutionists to destroy some of the more
 mobile combinations in each solution — to break up more or less com
 pletely, in fact, those very complex organic products whose molecular in
 stability is looked upon as one of the conditions essential to the evolutional
 changes which are supposed to take place."                   Before granting such a sup
 position, it would be necessary to know, first, what are " the very com
plex organic products " of such peculiar " molecular instability
                                                                                   "  existing
in a solution of tartrate of ammonia, sodic phosphate, acetate of ammonia,
 oxalate of ammonia, in a solution of sugar and calcined yeast, in turnip in
 fusion, or any other putrescible liquid.               My experiments show that there
is no such disruptive agency in a high temperature, that it does not influ
ence the "more mobile combinations," either in solutions of organic salts
or vegetable infusions ; for the "test-tubes" T were precisely the same as
the others of the series, contents identical, heated at the same time to the
 same temperature, in fact taken from among them indiscriminately, the
 only difference being that one was exposed to the air and the others were
not. Besides, there is in addition the evidence afforded by the tubes
classed under D", E", and              F" ; yet we find the changes occurred in them
as readily as in the unheated original solutions.                Dr. Bastian recordsf the
development of organisms in a liquid heated as high as 153° C. ; yet the
assumed " disruptive agency of heat" is supposed to have influenced the
 results of Schwann and Pasteur at a temperature of 100° C. ! His experi
 ence is contradictory to his own theory, and at the same time to the
experiments of others, to which his theory raises objection.
     It has long been established by Pasteur, Payen, and other experimenters,
that a temperature of less than 130° C. is insufficient to destroy all trace
 of life if the germs or           spores   are not immersed    in  a liquid ;  this is a fact
 admitted on all sides         J. In    that case  it is not difficult to understand how,
in the experiments of Dr. Child and Prof. 'Wyman, organisms have been
found in liquids        to which air only      which had passed through red-hot pipes
was admitted.           The former took a bulb with two narrow necks or tubes,
and containing the experimental liquid ; one tube was connected by a cork
boiled in water with a red-hot porcelain tube filled with pumice, and con
 nected with a gas-holder ; the other tube dipped into sulphuric acid : the

through the apparatus till the liquid and flask were cool.

bulb is quite cool, the necks are sealed by means of a lamp."                In Wyman's
experiments       an apparatus  of much     the same kind   was  used    ; but  the liquids
in four     cases were boiled for from five to ten minutes         in a Papin's digester
under     a  pressure of from  two  to five  atmospheres,  or at  a  temperature of 120°
to 150°C. Large flasks of 500 cub. centims., and even 850cub.centims. capa
 city were used, containing 1 7cub. centims. to 50 cub. centims,or thereabouts,
 of solution, so that in some cases only -^ of their capacity was occupied ;
 the air admitted was passed through red-hot iron pipes filled with iron
 wires.      There is a similarity between these two sets of experiments ; the
 flasks were not entirely in contact with the hot liquid.              We see also, from
 the few words quoted from the description of Child's experiments, that a
 sufficient space intervened between the red-hot tube and the bulb to allow
 of the heated air becoming cool before it entered the glass bulb ; it cannot
 be said, therefore, that the entering air was so hot as to destroy whatever
 living thing might be attached to the glass. The precautions taken, then,
 were not sufficient to render the experiments trustworthy, more particularly
 in the case of Wyman's work, because there he had an immensely large
 surface untouched by fluid, and naturally he obtained more results in favour
 of the view of evolution than any other experimenter.                Bastian's own ex
 periments      are open  to  the  same    objection*;   in  fact   it  seems that much,
 work has been rendered faulty by this neglect of bringing every part of
 the interior surface of the containing vessels in contact with the heated
 liquid. We have positive proof that such is the case when, as Bastian
 himself states, "it has long been known that a boiled fluid extremely
 prone to change will not yield infusoriarif the vessel in which it is con
 tained is filled with the fluid ;" the commercial method of preparing cooked
 meat depends upon this to a great extent.             With respect to the power of
 vibrioses to resist the destructive action of heat,         I  at one time felt sure,
 from experiments on hay infusion and decomposing turnip infusion, that
 they were capable of living after being boiled.             This hasty conviction at
 the moment of observation arose from the fact that the movement of these
bodies was the same before and after boiling, and at the same time unlike
any example of the Brownian movement with which                    I   was familiar;    but
 there is no evidence that they were really living in the first case ;                 it is
 only a presumption.
     A strong infusion of hay was made with lukewarm water, filtered twice
through Swedish paper, and examined under the microscope ; it swarmed
with life, especially in the form of bacteria, mostly in rapid motion ; some
of these were excessively small, less than 0'00005 inch in length. The
liquid was boiled violently for fifteen minutes until two thirds had been
evaporated away ; a drop placed under the microscope showed that most of
    * It is worthy of remark that in two out of the four eases in which Wynian boated
liquids at a temperature over 100° C, no organisms were found.

  the living bacteria had been killed, or were, at any rate, motionless.
  Careful observation, however, showed the minute vibriones to be as lively
 as ever; they curled and twisted, and dived out of focus just as when alive.
 The same fact was noticed in a turnip infusion.      Pasteur proved that the
 germs   of vibriones  in  milk were not killed till the liquid was heated to
  110° C*    I fancy that the recent experiments of Dr. Crace•Calvertf lead
 him to fix the fatal temperature at too high a rate (between 150° and
 200° C), supposing the vibriones to be immersed in the liquid ; but if any
 of them be left adhering to the glass tube, possibly not. The fact that hay
 infusion contains, besides such multitudes of living things, great quantities
 oforganic debris, led to the conclusion that no safe experiments could be
 made with such a liquid.              If
                              a liquid be boiled in a flask and sealed up, it
 depends very much upon the nature of the liquid whether life will bedeveloped
 in it : thus, if we take a most carefully prepared saline or sugar solution, the
water used being particularly pure, and the salts dissolved and recrystallized
with all possible care, the chances are that nothing will come of it; but                                   if,
on the other hand,      liquid swarming with life be chosen, the conditions
                           a
will be most favourable for depositing living things on the sides of the
vessel, where they will be out of reach of the boiling liquid, and, getting
washed off into the liquid when cool, will there multiply. On this account,
the use of hay infusion in particular has led to erroneous deductions, from
faulty experiments.    To any one who will make strong infusion of hay   a
with lukewarm water, and examine      with the microscope,
                                                   it          will, am sure,       it       I
be simply inconceivable how any appearance of accurate evidence can be de
rived from such fluid, particularly when the liquid
                     a                                      not heated above   is
the boiling-point.
      It
     must be allowed that Pasteur's experiments prove that when ferment
able liquids were protected from matter floating in the air, fermentation
would not take      place.      Now the first evidence     of fermentation in,

mical composition, or, more particularly, the chemical constitution of the

invariable yet tremendous changes in such very simple substances, and to

has been satisfactorily answered, ordinary reason would assign to them the
possession of life, for their properties are the properties possessed by none

how are we to account for the action of various antiseptics?                        In the
Report to the Cattle-Plague          Commissioners       "  On   Disinfection  and   Disin
fectants," by Dr. Angus Smith, an account is given(p. 10) of the action of
a number of essential oils, such as oil of bitter almonds, oil of mustard,
amylic alcohol, cresylic and carbolic acids, and ether, the vapour of which
was diffused in air surrounding pieces of meat.                Many substances had the
property     of   preserving    the  meat   for   a  great    length   of time, especially
amylic alcohol and oil-of-bitter-almonds            chloroform ; and carbonic tetra
chloride    also  shares  this  property.    If  these    nitrogenous particles are not
living things, how are we to account for the action of the substances ? It
cannot be a chemical         action, because    these substances are chemically in
active.     In  some cases the less      active colytic agents having diffused away
out of the bottle, mould formed on the meat, or putrefaction commenced ;
and this always happened on that part nearest the cork, showing that
particles causing the change came in with air after the preservative agent
had escaped.        That these colytic agents were fatal to the growth of mould,
or the spread of putrefaction, was ascertained by placing mouldy paste under
a bell, the atmosphere        of which contained      a small quantity     of the vapour.
    It  has been doubted lately whether          carbolic    acid has the power of de
stroying germs, whether, in fact, Prof. Lister's surgical treatment depends
upon this power.         The experiments which have given rise to the question
tell us only that when carbolic acid is added to a putrescible liquid it is not
preserved.       There is nothing new in this. " The phenylic and cresylic
alcohols, which experience has shown to be generally, so active in the pre
vention of putrefaction, are not sufficiently constant when a large quantity
of water is present" *. When in          a state   of vapour very greatly diluted with
air, we find them preventing organic growths and putrefaction in an extra
ordinary     manner.      In order to preserve liquids, corrosive sublimate, sul
phate of copper, and chloride of zinc are the most efficacious substances.
    If  those particles which are the origin of life are themselves lifeless, they
could not influence the nature of the organisms developed ; in that case
different solutions would give rise to different organisms, and, conversely, the
same solution would yield the same form of life.                 But we do not find this
to be the case ; for in the same infusion of turnip in Experiment D" 1 and
D"    3 occur on exposure to the air at different times different forms              of life.
In    the one case minute vibriones          and masses        of TorK/a-cells   occurred,
whereas in the other confervoid           growth and some minute motionless or
ganisms which had not previously been observed were the most noticeable
forms.      With different portions of a solution of alkaline phosphates and
tartrates, in one case we got a fungoid and in the other an algoid form of
life.     Were it not for the great preponderance of sound experimental evi
dence to the contrary,       it would be easier to believe the theory that life was
evolved de novo.        It is the crude idea which a superficial observer of everv-
day phenomena would entertain ; the popular error that maggots are bred

 out of corruption    illustrates this.     The theory involves the discovery of     a
 new property of matter, the property that certain compounds (undefined
 nitrogenous particles in the atmosphere) must have of decomposing mole
 cules of other substances with which they are in contact, and building out of
 their constituent atoms substances of a much more complicated nature, with
 out the exertion of external forces ; even beyond this, they must be capable
 of arranging those compounds into definite forms. In the course of nature
 complex substances do not increase but simplify their molecular complexity.
 By oxidation vegetable products are resolved into carbonic acid and water :
 we find no tendency in these oxides of carbon and hydrogen to become re
 duced to such products as sugar, starch, or cellulose ; nay, much further,
 we know no process by which such transformation might be effected, still
less are we acquainted with any internal forces which can mould them into
cells with functions       to perform.      On this account      a very great deal of
thoroughly sound experimental evidence is necessary to establish the doc
trine of evolution of life de novo. But, so far as our present knowledge
 guides us, whether we term it spontaneous generation, abiogenesis, or arche-
biosis, the process by which living things spring from lifeless matter must
be said to be only ideal.
    Note. — In describing certain organisms as mueors, those thecasporous
fungi are meant of which Ascophora mucedo is the type ; they are described
by Pasteur as mucedinees ; and he seems to include in this description Pe-
 nicillium, which is basidiosporous *. Mueors he classes as those vegetable
 organisms which take the form generally on the surface of a liquid of a thin
pellicle with   a more or less fatty or gelatinous appearance.           Such matter
 I have noticed accompanying         conferva.       The fungus in chains found in
urine is identical with that         supposed by Pasteur        f  to cause  the pro
 duction of carbonate of ammonia from urea ; while those small cellules
without a nucleus, which I surmise, for a reason already stated, to be
Torula in an early stage, he believes to be specifically different J. With
regard to filters of nitrocellulose, I some time since wished to modify
ordinary filters so as to make them more easily combustible in the crucible
when used for quantitative analysis.              This I tried by dipping them in
strong nitric acid, washing in water, and finally in ammonia. As far as my
recollection goes, I obtained a denser kind of paper, which answered the
purpose very well.        On endeavouring recently to make this variety of filter-
paper,   I met  with  the   same difficulty which Prof. Bloxam tells me some
years ago he encountered when attempting the same object, namely, the
parchmentizing of the paper, so as to render it waterproof.                     I

not used the proper strength of acid necessary, or else my former experience
rested on the formation        of nitrate of ammonia within the fibres of the
paper.

       taining an Investigation of the Attraction of a Galvanic Coil on
       a small magnetic mass.      By James Stuart, Esq., M.A., Fel
       low of Trinity College, Cambridge.        Received   January 6, 1872.
                                   (Abstract.)
  The author, after adverting to some imperfect experiments made by
Coulomb in the last century, describes the apparatus which he had himself
used. He employed a bar-magnet 14 inches in length, placed in one series
with its   edge towards  the small compass on which its directive power was
estimated,      and in another series with its flat side towards the small
compass; also a galvanic coil 13-4 inches in length, animated by a battery
of three cells, and the same coil with the insertion of a soft iron coil. In
the field of experiment the earth's magnetism was sensibly neutralized by
external large magnets.   The direction of the needle of the small compass
was estimated by eye.    The magnitude of the directive force was found by
observing the position taken by the needle when the poles of a horseshoe-
magnet were placed in a definite position above it : for the measure of the
force of the galvanic coil without core, a very small magnet was used in
the same manner ; its power was found to be about j^u that of the
norseshoe-magnet.     The circle on which the deflections were observed was
graduated to cotangents, which gave immediately the measure of the force
of the large magnet or coil, &c. In each case, observations were taken
in 30 stations in one oval ring surrounding the magnet &e., and in 38
stations   inanother oval ring surrounding     it at a greater distance.
Omitting  notice of the measures in general, the  following specific points
are remarked : —
  At a constant distance from the steel, the greatest force exerted       by a
magnet is not the longitudinal force at the end, but the transversal      force
near the end.       In going round the magnet there   are   six maxima and six
minima of force.
   The law of attraction of the core of a galvanic coil is not very different
from that of a magnet.
   The force produced by the core within the coil is very much greater
than that produced by the coil alone.      In some positions of the small
compass it is about forty times as great, and in some about 1 70 limes as
great.
   The law of force at different parts of the coil differs greatly from that at
corresponding parts of the magnet or core.       In the coil it is, proportion
ally, far greater at the end, and its direction is different. Near the end   of
the magnet or core the directions of force converge to a point within        it,

distant from the end by about -jL part of its length.         Near the end of the
coil, the directions of force converge to a point as exactly as possible at the
centre of the end of the coil.
   The author then describes the graphic process by which he has resolved
the entire magnetic forces into constituent parts in the directions longitu
dinal and transversal to the magnet at every station, and gives tabular
statements of the magnitudes of those constituent parts.           A comparison is
made with the results of an assumed law, but no satisfactory agreement is
obtained.
    An Appendix is subjoined, containing       an investigation   by James Stuart,
Esq., of the theoretical     attraction of a galvanic coil upon a small mass of
magnetism, and a tabular comparison of the numerical values obtained from
this investigation with the numerical values found by experiment.               The
agreement is satisfactory.

     The following communications were              read   :   —
I. " On     the Induction  of Electric Currents in an Infinite Plane
        Sheet of uniform conductivity." By Prof. J. Clerk Maxwell,
        F.R.S. Received January 10, 1872.
     1. 'When, on account   of the motion or the change of strength of any
magnet    or electromagnet, a change takes place in the magnetic field, elec
tromotive forces are called into play, and, if the material in which they
act is a conductor, electric currents are produced. This is the phenomenon
of the induction of electric currents, discovered by Faraday.
   I propose to investigate the case in which the conducting substance is in
the form of a thin stratum or sheet, bounded by parallel planes, and of
indefinite extent. A system of magnets or electromagnets is supposed to
exist on the positive side of this sheet, and to vary in any way by changing
its position or its intensity.  We have to determine the nature of the cur
rents induced in the sheet, and their magnetic effect at any point, and, in
particular, their reaction on the electromagnetic system which gave rise to
them.      The induced currents        are   due,    partly to the direct action of the
external system, and partly to their mutual inductive              action ; so that the
problem appears, at first sight, somewhat difficult.
   2. The result of the investigation, however, may he presented in a re
markably simple form, by the aid of the principle of images which was
first applied to problems in electricity and hydrokinetics by Sir W. Thomson.
The essential part of this principle         is,
                                           that we conceive the state of things
on the positive  side of   certain
                             a     closed or infinite surface (which      really    is
caused by actions having their seat on that surface) to be due to an ima
ginary system on the negative side of the surface, which,          existed, and
                                                                         if   it
if the action of the surface were abolished, would give rise to the actual
state of things in the space on the positive side of the surface.
   The state of things on the positive side of the surface      expressed by
                                                                         is               a
mathematical function, which         different in form from that which ex
                                       is

that which would be due to the existence,         on the negative side, of a certain
system which is called the Image.
   The image, therefore, is what we should arrive at by producing, as it
were, the mathematical function as far as it will go ; just as, in optics, the
virtual image is found by producing the rays, in straight lines, backwards
from the place where their direction has been altered by reflexion or re
fraction.
   3. The position of the image of a point in a plane surface is found by
drawing a perpendicular from the point to the surface and producing it to
an equal distance on the other side of the surface.         If the image is of the
same sign as the point, as     it is in hydrokinetics   when the surface is a rigid
plane, it is called a positive image.         If it is of the opposite sign, as in
statical electricity, when the surface is a conductor, it is called a negative
image.     The image of a conducting circuit is reckoned positive when the
electric   current    flows in   the corresponding directions through corre
sponding parts of the object and the image. The image is reckoned nega
tive when the direction of the current is reversed.
    In  the case of the plane conducting sheet, the imaginary system on the
negative side of the sheet is not the simple image, positive or negative,
of the real magnet or electromagnet on the positive side, but consists
of a moving train of         images,   the nature of which we now proceed          to
define.
    4. Let the electric resistance of a rectangular portion of the      sheet whose
 length is a, and whose breadth is 2-«, be R.
    R  is to be measured on the electromagnetic system, and is therefore a
 velocity, the value of which is independent of the magnitude of the line a.

 cube, and   if c is the thickness   of the sheet, then  R=  —    ; and if <r denotes

 a number of equal intervals, each equal to St.
 The smaller we take      these intervals   the more
 accurate will be the definition of the train of
 images which we shall now describe.
     6. At a given time t, let a positive image
 of the magnet or electromagnet be formed
 on the negative side of the sheet.                                      i  © ©

     After      an interval        it, that is to say, at the time t+it, let    a negative
 image, equal in magnitude and opposite in sign to this positive image, be
 formed in the original position of the positive image, and let it then begin
 to move along the normal, after the positive image, with the velocity R.
 The interval of time between the arrival of these images at any point will
 be it, and the distance between corresponding points will be ~R.it.
    7. Leaving this pair of images to pursue their endless journey, let us
 attend to the real magnet, or electromagnet, as it is at the time t + it.  At
 this instant let a new positive image   be   formed  of the magnet in its new
position,  and  let this image also travel in  the direction of the normal with
the velocity R, and be followed after an interval of time it by a corre
sponding negative image.       Let these operations be repeated at equal in
tervals of time, each of these intervals being equal to it.
    8. Thus at any given instant there will be a train or trail of images,
beginning with a single positive image, and followed by an endless succes
sion of pairs of images.       This trail, when once formed, continues un
changeable in form and intensity, and moves as a whole away from the
conducting sheet with the constant velocity R.
    9. If we now suppose the interval of time it to be diminished without
limit, and the train to be extended without limit in the negative direction,
so as to include all the images which have been formed in all past time,
the magnetic effect of this imaginary train at any point on the positive
side of the conducting sheet will be identical with that of the electric
currents which actually exist in the sheet.
   Before proceeding to prove this statement, let us take notice of the form
which it assumes in certain cases.
     10.Let us suppose the real system to be             an electromagnet, and    that its
intensity, originally zero, suddenly becomes            I,
                                                and then remains constant.
At this instant a positive image is formed, which begins to travel along the
normal with velocity R. After an interval it another positive image is
formed ; but at the same instant a second negative image is formed at the
same place,   which exactly neutralizes its effect.     Hence the result          is,
                                                                               that
a  single positive image  travels  by itself along  the  normal   with velocity R.
The magnetic effect of this image on the positive side of the sheet        is
                                                                        equivalent
to that of the currents of induction actually existing in the sheet, and the
diminution of this effect, as the image moves away from the sheet, accurately
represents the effect of the currents of induction, which gradually decay
on account of the resistance of the sheet. After             sufficient time, the

image     so distant that its effects are no longer sensible on the positive
           is
side of the sheet.            If
                        the current of the electromagnet be now broken,
there will be no more images but the last negative image of the train will
                                         ;
be left unneutralized, and will move away from the sheet with velocity R.
The currents in the sheet will therefore be of the same magnitude as those
which followed the excitement of the electromagnet, but               in   the opposite
direction.

     1 1.   It
           appears from this that, when the electromagnet is increasing in
intensity, it will be acted on by a repulsive force from the sheet, and when
its intensity is diminishing, it will be attracted towards the sheet.
   It also appears that if any system of currents is produced in the sheet
and then left to itself, the effect of the decay of the currents, as observed at
a point on the positive side of the sheet, will be the same as if the sheet,
with its currents remaining constant, had been carried away in the negative
direction with velocity R.
   12.      If
           a magnetic pole of strength m is brought from an infinite distance
along a normal to the sheet with a uniform velocity v towards the sheet,
it will be repelled with a force
                                             m*        v
where    z is the distance from the sheet at the given instant.
     This formula will not apply to the case of the pole moving away from
the sheet, because in that case we must take account of the currents
which are excited when the pole begins to move, which it does when near
the sheet.
     13.    If
            the magnetic pole moves in a straight line parallel to the sheet,
with uniform velocity v, it will be acted on by a force in the opposite direc
tion to its motion, and equal to

   Besides this retarding force,            it    is   acted on             by   a   force repelling        it   from
the sheet, equal to

              pole moves uniformly                 in   a     circle, the trail           is   in the form of       a
helix, and the calculation of its effect                    is    more difficult         ;     it   is   easy,   how
ever, to see that, besides the retarding force and the repelling force, there
isalso    force towards the centre of the circle.

ducting system or the inducing system be in motion, provided the relative
motion       is   the same.      Hence the results already given are directly appli
cable to the caseof Arago's rotating disk, provided the induced currents
are not sensibly affected by the limitation arising from the edge of the
disk.  These will introduce other sets of images, which we shall not now

   1 7. If the conductivity of the sheet were infinite,                                   or its resistance zero,
R      would be zero.                         The   images,        once formed, would remain stationary, and
all except the last formed positive image would be neutralized.      Hence
the trail would be reduced to a single positive image, and the sheet would

   25. This, then, is a solution of the problem. Any other solution must
differ from this by a system of closed currents, depending on the initial
state of the sheet, not due to any external cause, and which therefore
must decay rapidly. Hence, siuce we                 assume    an eternity   of past time,
this is the only solution of the problem.
   This solution      expresses   P,         due to the action of the induced
                                       a function
current, in terms of      P0', and through this of P0, a function of the same
kind due     to the    external magnetic system.    By differentiating P and
P,, with respect to e, we obtain the magnetic potential, and by differentiating
them with respect to t, we obtain, by equation (10), the current-func
tion.     Hence the relation between P &xv\ P0, as expressed by equa
tion (16), is similar to the relation between the external system and its
trail of images as expressed in the description of these images in the
first part of this paper (§§ 6, 7, 8, 9), which is simply an explanation of
the meaning of equation (16) combined wi'.h the definition of P0' in § 24.
                        Note to the preceding Paper.
   At the time when this paper          was written,    I   was not able to refer to two
papers by Prof. Felici, in Tortolini's 'Annali di Scienze' for 1853 and
1854, in which he discusses the induction of currents in solid homogeneous
conductors  and in a plane conducting sheet, and to two papers by E.
                                                                '       '
Jochmann in Crelle's Journal for 1864, and one in Poggendorff's Annalen
for 1864, on the currents induced in a rotating conductor by a magnet.
   Neither of these writers have attempted to take into account the induc
tive action of the currents on each other, though both have recognized
the existence of such an action, and given equations expressing it. M.
Felici considers the case of a magnetic pole placed almost in contact with
a rotating disk. E. Jochmann solves the case in which the pole is at a
finite distance from the plane of the disk.     He has also drawn the forms
of  the  current-lines and of the equipotential lines, in the case of a single
pole, and in the case of two poles of opposite name at equal distances
from the axis of the disk, but on opposite sides of              it,
                                                          and has pointed out
why the current-lines     are not, as Mattencci        at first supposed, perpendicular
to the equipotential lines, which he traced experimentally.
I    am not aware that the principle of images, as described in the paper
presented to the Royal Society, has been previously applied to the phe
nomena  of induced currents, or that the problem of the induction                       of

  currents in an infinite plane sheet has been solved, taking into account the
  mutual induction of these currents, so as to make the solution applicable
  to a sheet of any degree of conductivity.
     The statement in equation (10), that the motion of a magnetic system
  does not produce differences of potential in the infinite sheet, may appear
 somewhat strange, since we know that currents maybe collected by electrodes
 touching     the sheet at different points.          These currents, however, depend
  entirely on the inductive action          on  the part of the circuit not included in
 the sheet ; for if the whole circuit lies in the plane of the sheet, but is so
 arranged as not to interfere with the uniform conductivity of the sheet, there
 will be no difference of potential in any part of the circuit.           This is pointed
 out by Felici, who shows that when the currents are induced by the instan
 taneous magnetization of a magnet, these currents are not accompanied with
 differences of potential in different parts of the sheet.
     When the sheet is itself in motion, it appears, from art. 600 of my
           '
 treatise On Electricity and Magnetism,' that the electric potential of any
 point, as measured by means of the electrodes of a fixed circuit, is

    Menschutkin has described this acid under the name of oxybenzuramic
 acid ; but I have satisfied myself that it is identical with the uramidobenzoic
acid obtained by the two first-mentioned processes.
    I will not here recapitulate the properties of this acid, which are described
in my former papers on the subject, and in that of Menschutkin, who has
also considered        the constitution   of the compound.         The uramidobenzoic
acid is particularly remarkable for the great number of derivatives it is
capable of yielding, being surpassed by but few organic compounds in this
respect.       It is my intention in this communication to describe several of
these derivatives.
              Action     of strong Nitric Acid on    Uramidobenzoic Acid.
    When uramidobenzoic acid, deprived of its water of crystallization, is
gradually introduced into well-cooled fuming nitric acid that has been freed
from nitrous acid, it is dissolved in large quantities, and without any evo
lution of gas. The solution, when nearly saturated, is allowed to stand for
about one hour, and then poured into a large quantity of water, taking care
to avoid rise of temperature.           By this means an abundant yellowish-white
crystalline precipitate        is obtained, having strongly marked acid proper
ties.   It  is soluble in alcohol, and easily so in ether, even in the cold, crys
tallizing therefrom in yellowish-white needles which have the composition
 C, He N4 07. In spite of their appearance, however, they are by no means
 homogeneous, consisting, as I have ascertained, of three different acids, all

Although           I have
                not yet been able to completely separate these acids from one

may be considerably increased by allowing the solution to stand for some
hours.   The yellowish-white salt thus obtained appears amorphous to the
unassisted eye, but on careful inspection will be seen to consist of minute
needles.   The acid corresponding to this salt   propose to call a nitroura

hydrochloric acid to the hot aqueous solutions of the latter, the acids
crystallizing out on cooling.
    a nitrouramidobenzoic        acid, C3 H7 (N02) N2 03. — This acid crystallizes
in bright yellow needles or small plates, which are difficultly soluble in hot
water, and but very slightly so in cold water and ether.                 Boiling alcohol
 dissolves it readily. Its salts have the general formula C2 Hr,(NO3)N203,             M',
 and are as a rule soluble with difficulty.
    (i nitrouramidobenzoic      acid, C3 H7 (NO3) N2 03. — This acid crystallizes
 from its hot aqueous solution in very slender bright yellow needles, closely
resembling in appearance its barium salt previously described.                It is nearly
insoluble in cold water, and only very slightly in hot ; by boiling alcohol,
however, it is taken up in considerable quantities.            It is mono-basic like the
a acid.
    y nitrouramidobenzoic        acid,  C3 H7   (N02) N2 03, is obtained in small
yellow    scales, which   are but very     slightly soluble in all neutral solvents.     It
is mono-basic,     and almost all its salts are more readily soluble than the cor
responding     salts of the other isomeric acids        ; moreover it is readily       di
stinguished by the decomposition which it undergoes when boiled with water
for a considerable time.        It is then gradually dissolved, splitting up in the
following manner      : —
           C3H7N,05       +   H20 = C7H0N2O, + CO, +                      NH,
    The compound, C7 H0 N2 04, thus formed is also an acid which will be
 described further on.       The salts of the y nitro-acid likewise suffer a similar
 decomposition when their aqueous solutions are boiled ; and the substance
 mentioned in the footnote on p. 170, as crystallizing in yellowish-red
needles, is the barium salt of the acid C7 H0 N2 04, formed in this way.
            Action of Tin and Hydrochloric Acid on the Isomeric
                            Nitrouramidobenzoic Acids.
    When a nitrouramidobenzoic acid is heated with tin and hydrochloric
 acid, it is reduced in the ordinary way, yielding a amidouramidobenzoic
acid, C0 H„ N, O, = C3 H7 (N H2) N2 03, crystallizing in scales, ordinarily
of a greyish-white colour. It is but slightly soluble in boiling water, still
less so in hot alcohol, and almost insoluble in ether.          Its silver salt is a white
precipitate, having      the formula       C3 H3 N3 03 Ag.       Its hydrochloric-acid
compound,      C3H„N303,HCI, crystallizes in         scales, and is marked by its great
insolubility in hydrochloric      acid, even when very dilute.       When the aqueous
solution of the latter compound          is acted upon    with sodium nitrite, an azo-
cotnpound separates, crystallizing         in  needles,  which are soluble in hydro
chloric acid.

C3 H3 N3 03, M'. Its silver salt is a white crystalline precipitate. This                       new
amido-acid is remarkable for its instability ; boiled with hydrochloric                         acid
or with baryta-water, it is decomposed in the following manner : —

   The new acid, C3 He N2 03, thus obtained forms small white nodules,
which are insoluble in all ordinary neutral solvents.   It combines with am
monia, forming a salt which crystallizes in difficultly soluble long needles.
Its hot ammoniacal solution, when mixed with barium chloride, solidifies
to a pulp of white needles, which, when dried between filter-paper, have
the composition (C3 H5N203)2, Ba + 4H20.          With respect to its consti
tution, I am inclined to regard it as amidobenzoic acid, in which one atom
of hydrogen is replaced by the group [(CO)N] :

   ft nitroamidobenzoic acid is the name by which I have designated the
acid obtained from        /3    dinitrouramidobenzoic       acid by the above-mentioned
reaction.     It is only very slightly soluble in hot water, but rather easily
so in boiling alcohol, from which it crystallizes on cooling in clusters of
yellowish-red glistening needles or small plates.              The dry acid, when gently
heated, sublimes in shining rhombic plates without previously melting.                 Its
barium salt forms bright yellowish-red prisms, often well defined, which are
slightly soluble     even      in boiling water.     Dried between filter-paper they
have the composition (G, H5 N2 04)2, Ba-f 2H20, the water of crystalliza
tion not being entirely expelled below 190° C.

in hot water, but also in alcohol and ether, even in the cold.                 It crystal
lizes in yellow prisms, which            melt, when heated, to a brownish oil ; at a
higher temperature         it    decomposes with slight explosion and evolution of
yellowish vapours.           Its barium salt forms reddish-yellow needles, which
are very easily soluble even in cold water, and when dried between folds
of bibulous paper have the composition (C7 H5 N2 OJ.,, Ba+7H20.

   a diamidobenzoic acid, C,H4(NH2)2O2,                   crystallizes from its solution
in boiling water, in which it is sparingly soluble, in minute but well-de
fined short prisms, which have a greyish tinge.                  It is remarkable for the
extremely sparing        solubility     of its sulphate, C7 H3 N2 02, SH2 04, a com

very sparingly soluble in hot water, although                not so much so as the cor

responding salt of the acid just described.          It is almost entirely deposited
on cooling in white, soft, shining, almost oval-shaped plates.
     y diamidobenzoic acid crystallizes in long yellowish-white needles, whose
solubility closely resembles that of the two other isomeric acids. Its sul
phate forms white six-sided tables or prisms, which, when dried in the air,
have the composition (C7 H8 N203)a, SHa Ot+ l^H.,0 ; they are almost as
insoluble as the corresponding compound of the a diamido-acid.                  When
 the solution of y diamidobenzoic acid in dilute hydrochloric acid is decom
 posed by ferric chloride, a brownish-red semicrystalline precipitate is ob

 more closely investigated.
         Action of Nitrous Acid     on the Isomeric    Diamidobenzoic    Acids.
     In this reaction   a remarkable     difference is observed between the a dia
 midobenzoic      acid on the one hand and ft and y diamidobenzoic acids on
 the other.      When a diamidobenzoic acid is treated with a quantity of warm
 and moderately dilute hydrochloric acid, insufficient to dissolve the whole,
 and on cooling the filtered solution is mixed with one of sodium nitrite, a
 semisolid mass of crystals is formed. These, after separation of the mother-
 liquor, are easily purified by crystallization from hot water, with the ad
 dition of     a small quantity of animal charcoal.          The compound thus ob
 tained    forms  long needles  or small  plates, which    explode when heated in a
 dry state. It is rather easily soluble in hot water, and by long boiling gra
 dually decomposes, giving rise to a brown insoluble amorphous precipitate.
  Curiously enough it does not possess acid properties, being insoluble both
 in ammonia and potassa ; whilst, on the contrary, it combines with the
 mineral     acids, forming well-crystallized salts.       Its hydrochlorate forms
  six-sided plates, which are readily soluble.        Unfortunately   I have not yet
  been able to establish the composition       of this basic compound with cer
  tainty, although from a determination of the gold in its gold salt, which
  crystallizes in dark yellow needles, I believe it to have the composition
  indicated    by the formula CI4H„N, 04.           Its formation, therefore, would
  take place in the following manner : —
           2(CTH,N,OJ          +    NH02       =   C„HiaNs04        +

      It is necessary to mention that this basic compound is not formed when
  sodium nitrite acts upon a diamidobenzoic acid in the presence of free
  hydrochloric acid, instead of in the manner just described.             In this case
  a brisk evolution of nitrogen       takes place, and after some time the yellow
   solution deposits an amorphous reddish-brown acid.
      The behaviour of the two other isomeric diamidobenzoic acids under
  the circumstances      previously mentioned is quite different to that of the
  a diamidobenzoic      acid.   When their solution in dilute hydrochloric acid

 is acted upon by sodium nitrate,- a white crystalline azo-acid immediately
 separates, and that whether the hydrochloric acid is in excess or not.
 The azo-acid thus obtained from the (i diamidobenzoic acid crystallizes
 in short         needles,   which     are soluble with difficulty in hot water, and
 scarcely at       all in cold.       When heated in a dry state it melts and blackens,
 a small portion subliming,  whilst the greatest part is decomposed, leaving
 behind     difficultly
              a         combustible carbonaceous residue.   The composition
 of this azo-acid corresponds with the formula C7 H5 N3 03.   Its barium salt
has the composition             (C7 H4 N3 OJ.^ Ba+4IL,0, and crystallizes in                          very
slender colourless           needles, which dissolve readily in hot water, but                        only
sparingly in cold.
   The azo-acid prepared from the y diamidobenzoic acid, although iso
meric with that just described, differs considerably from     crystallizing in   it,
long hair-like silky needles, which, on drying, shrink  together to   felt•like                 a
mass.   It rather more easily soluble in hot water than the corresponding

with slight explosion.    Its barium salt crystallizes in white needles, which
are rather difficultly soluble in hot water, and very sparingly so in cold.

I may add that both these acids contain water of crystallization, which                                     is
expelled at 100° C, and at the same time call attention to their great
stability, in which respect they differ very remarkably from most other azo-

were obtained by the action of ammonia on the perbromides of the corre

These bodies also form saline compounds with metals, but in their re
actions, as well as in other respects, differ entirely from the azo-acids just
described, rendering         it   certain that they have          a   different constitution         from
them.

                                       temperature.
    When either of the diamidobenzoic acids is submitted to dry distillation
in a retort, it splits up into carbonic acid, which is evolved, and a yellow
oil, which crystallizes in the neck of the retort, thus : —
                      C7H,N202          =     C0H3N2          +    CO,.
    The compound C0 H3 N2, obtained in this manner from the a diamido
benzoic acid, is moderately soluble in hot water, and crystallizes therefrom
in reddish-coloured scales, melting at 140° C. It exhibits the character of
a base, and forms crystalline salts with the mineral acids.                It can readily
be seen that the composition of this base is the same as that of the pheny-
lene diamines described by Dr. Hofmann*, C0 H„ N2=C0 H4 (N H2)2 ; and
its properties leave no doubt that it is identical with one of the latter,
namely, that formed by the action of reducing agents on the nitraniline
prepared from substituted anilides.
    The compound C0 H3 N2i obtained by the dry distillation of ft diamido
benzoic acid, differs not only from the base just described, but also from
the phenylene diamine which Dr. Hofmann obtained by the reduction of
dinitrobenzol.      It  is easily soluble in hot water, and crystallizes therefrom
in white rectangular         four-sided tables or plates, which usually have a
reddish tinge.       It melts at 99° C, and boils at about 252° C. It is like
wise possessed of basic properties, and must be regarded as a new isomeric
modification of phenylene diamine.             The sulphate of this base crystallizes
in pearly    scales,   the composition       of which corresponds to the formula
C0 H, (N H2)2, S H2 04+ 1£H2 O, and which readily part with their water
of crystallization at a temperature a little above 100° C. Its platinum-salt
is precipitated in the form of brownish-red needles.                 When ferric chloride
is added to a solution of this base in hydrochloric acid, ruby-red needles
immediately form, consisting of the hydrochloride of a new base.                      In a
free state the latter       forms bright yellow microscopic needles, which are
almost insoluble      in all neutral solvents.         I have reason to believe that
it  has the formula        C12 H10  N,, and that its method of formation              is as

As one or other of the phenylene diamines just mentioned                       is obtained
when the a or ft diamidobenzoic acid is submitted to dry distillation, I
fully expected that the y diamidobenzoic acid, under the same circum
stances, would give rise to a third phenylene diamine, and that this would
be identical   with that derived from dinitrobenzol.               Strange to say, this is
not the case, the phenylene diamine obtained by the dry distillation of y

    Besides the three isomeric diamidobenzoic acids which              I have described
in the course of this paper,        a fourth acid exists, having the       same compo
sition, namely, the diamidobenzoic acid obtained by Dr.Voit* by reducing
ordinary dinitrobenzoic acid with sulphuretted hydrogen, and which I have
 since further investigated f.        I  propose, at present, to retain for this the
simple    name   diamidobenzoic       acid.    It is distinguished from the other
diamidobenzoic acids, not only by its physical properties, but especially in
not yielding a volatile organic base when submitted to dry distillation,
becoming, on the contrary, completely carbonized with simultaneous
evolution    of ammonia.        With nitrous acid also it behaves differently,
being    converted into   an    insoluble     amorphous    acid of a reddish-brown
colour.
    When it is considered that          each  of the four diamidobenzoic acids at
present known is derived, at least in a certain sense, from ordinary a,
amidobenzoic acid, there is reason to suppose that the acids which are
isomeric with amidobenzoic acid, namely amidodracylic                    acid and an-
thranilic acid, would, under favourable circumstances, give rise to four
new diamido-acids ; so that it is obvious that at least twelve isomeric
diamidobenzoic acids may be conceived to exist.
    In the preceding notice I have confined myself to the consideration                 of
some   of the most important chemical and physical properties of the sub
stances   described ; but I hope to be able to lay before the Society at a
future time some account of their rational constitution, and of the causes
which produce the various isomerisms.

   I. " On   the Contact of Surfaces."         By William Spottiswoode,
            M.A., Treas. R.S.        Received January 18, 1872.
                                    (Abstract.)
   In  a paper published   in the Philosophical Transactions (1870, p. 289),
I  have considered the contact, at a point P, of two curves which are co-
planar sections of two surfaces (U, V) ; and have examined somewhat in
detail the case where one of the curves, viz. the section of V, is a conic. In
the method     there employed, the condition that the point P should be
sextatic, involved the azimuth of the plane of section measured about an
axis passing through P ; and consequently, regarded as an equation in the
azimuth, it showed that the point would be sextactic for certain definite
sections.   It does not, however, follow, if conies having six-pointic contact
with the surface U be drawn in the planes so determined, that a single
quadric surface can be made to pass through them all.          The investigation
therefore of the memoir above quoted was not directly concerned with the
contact   of surfaces,   although it may be considered as dealing with a
problem intermediate to the contact of plane curves and that of surfaces.
   In the present investigation I have considered a point P common to the
two surfaces U and V,       an axis drawn    arbitrarily through P, and a plane
of section passing through the axis and capable of revolution about it.
Proceeding as in the former memoir, and forming the equations for contact
of various degrees, and finally by rendering them independent of the
azimuth, we obtain the conditions for contact for all positions of the
cutting plane about the axis. Such contact is called circumaxal ; and in
particular it is called uniaxal, biaxal, &c., according as it subsists for one,
two, &c. axes.      If it holds for all axes through the point, it is called
superficial contact ; and in the memoir some theorems are established re
lating to the number of sections along which contact of a given degree
must subsist in order to ensure uniaxal contact, as well as to the con
nexion between uniaxal and multiaxal contact.           At the conclusion of § 3
it is shown that the method of plane sections may, in the cases possessing
most interest and importance, be replaced by the more general method of
curved sections.
   In the concluding section       a few general considerations    are given re
lating to the determination of surfaces having superficial contact of various
degrees with given surfaces ; and at the same time I have indicated how
very much the general theory is affected by the particular circumstances of
each case.    The question of a quadric having four-pointic superficial con

tact with a given surface is considered more in detail ; and it is shown how
in general such a quadric degenerates into the tangent plane taken twice.
To this there is apparently an exceptional case, the condition for which is
given and reduced to a comparatively simple form ; but I must admit to
having so left  in the hope of giving
                         it,            fuller discussion of on a future

     The      use   of Mason's wet-bulb            thermometer as  means of hygrometric
                                                                         a
measurement, though                 it   be admitted to be the most practically useful, aud
indeed the only recording instrument for the purpose, has yet this serious
inconvenience, not to say defect, viz. that its indications either cease or
are valueless at temperatures below 32°                       F.
    Iu   a    conversation which the writer had with the Director of the Meteo
rological Office some months ago,   the question arose whether any thing
could be suggested to remedy this inconvenience.
  It was obviously inadmissible to substitute any other fluid for, or to
make any addition to, the water employed for the wet bulb, as then would                      it
cease to be         a   test for the purely hygrometric   capacity of the air. It became
therefore       necessary          to fall back in another direction, and to find some
hygrometric body which should readily and rapidly absorb moisture from
the air, and at the same time afford some means of measuring and re
cording the amount of such absorption.
   Fused chloride of zinc or of calcium seemed promising as very active
agents, absorbing rapidly on their surface, and allowing the readiest pos
sible escape of the fluid hydrate for measurement yet no means presented ;
itself either of accurately measuring, regulating, or maintaining the exact
extent of surface exposed for absorption   nor could the substance itself be
                                                             ;

easily renewed when required, nor, indeed, could either of these substances
be regarded as wholly free from the interference of frost, as the moisture
absorbed     from    the atmosphere at a temperature much below freezing-
point may remain frozen on the surface, and become incapable of con
tinuous measurement.          It seemed essential to the accuracy and practical
utility of any instrument designed for this purpose : —
   1st.   That   a fixed and invariable extent    of surface should at all times   be
exposed for absorption of moisture ;
   2nd. That the apparatus should be simple, inexpensive, and not incon
venient in use ;
   3rd.     That the hygrometric        substance    should be continuously       and
steadily renewable ;      and above all,  if it were  possible,
   4th. That the measurement should be effected thermometrically.
   No solid hygrometric substance seemed capable of meeting these re
quirements ; but all the conditions seemed likely to be fulfilled by the use
of concentrated sulphuric acid. This would admit of being spread in an
exquisitely fine film over the surface of the bulb of a thermometer by
means of a glass capillary siphon, of which one end should rest on the
upper part of the bulb, while the other end dipped into a reservoir of the
acid.     A  continuous supply could be maintained for any required length of
time by suitable arrangements.          The absorption of moisture would neces
sarily   be  attended    by  a  rise in temperature, and this would be propor
tioned to the amount of hygrometric moisture absorbed ; while the hy-
drated acid, having fulfilled its office, would fall in drops from the bulb
into any tube or reservoir placed for the purpose.
   An instrument has        been constructed    by the writer to test this principle,
which has, by the courtesy of the Director of the Meteorological Office,
been under observation for some weeks.
    It consists essentially of three thermometers of similar construction, and
used as a " wet bulb," a " dry bulb," and an " acid bulb," respectively,
placed side by side on a suitable frame, and read together for comparison.
   The experience already gained in the use of this instrument has shown
that, with    a reservoir  of proper construction, the supply of acid may be made
continuous for any required length of time, and that, from the very slight
variations of flow which occur in its action, the supply to the thermometer
will be sensibly equable.
   The length of the siphon, and the size of the capillary bore, together
with the difference of level between the surface of the fluid in the trough of
the reservoir and the point of delivery on the bulb, will determine the rate
of supply of the acid.
    It  is clear that either a too rapid and continuous stream of acid at the
temperature of the air, or a too scanty supply, would diminish the readings ;
yet it is found that practically there may be a pretty wide range of varia
tion in the supply of acid, within which no essential change in the sensibi
lity of the instrument is noticed.

182                    Mr. W. Whitehouse     on a New Hygrometer.          [Feb. 22,
   For a bulb having one square inch of surface one drop per minute is
sufficient, though the time may range from 40 to 100 seconds without in
convenience, the time being noted as the hydrated acid, after having
fulfilled its office, falls drop by drop from the bulb.
   The quantity of acid required at this rate is about 3 fluid ozs. per diem,
or one imperial pint per week, which is procurable of uniform density,
sufficiently pure and free from lead, at a cost of about 2|rf.
   The temperature of the acid in the reservoir is of course that of the
surrounding air ; the elevation of temperature shown by the acid-bulb
thermometer is due to, and seems to be strictly a measure of, the amount
of moisture absorbed by the film of acid spread on the surface of the bulb,
say one square inch, continuously supplied iu its concentrated state, and as
constantly passing off hydrated.
  While, therefore, this instrument          is,   like Mason's, intended to measure
the amount of hygrometric moisture in the air, and to do so thermome-
trically,  yet is, iu its principle and in its operation, essentially of an
               it
opposite character.

atmosphere of perfect saturation, and its action depends upon the amount
of sensible heat absorbed and rendered latent            by
                                                  evaporation of the water

and its action depends upon the amount of latent heat rendered sensible
by the condensation of vapour into water on the surface of the bulb, and
by the combination of this water with the concentrated acid.

                                                                     is

                                                          is
almost embarrassing.
  This may, however, be easily regulated and toned down,            if
                                                                 necessary, to

than those of sulphuric acid.
   The following series of observations, made hourly and otherwise, at in
tervals during the past few weeks, at the Meteorological Office, by the
kindness of the Director, will suffice to show approximately the relations
of the        "acid"
                 and the "wet bulb" respectively.
  They   have been  chiefly actual out-door observations, and have extended
over  considerable range of temperature and atmospheric variations.

the wet and acid-bulb readings, noting the behaviour of each at every part
of the scale, from absolute dryness to saturation, and at temperatures
ranging from 75° or 80° down to 0°.

   The following communications            were read     : —
      I. "On     Putrefaction."         By Dr. F. Crace-Calvert,                F.R.S.
                             Received    February 22, 1872.
                                        (Abstract.)
   This paper     is intimately     connected with      those  I  have   already published
on protoplasmic life and the influence it exerts on putrefaction.
   I  have already shown that when albumen from a new-laid egg is intro
duced into pure distilled water and communication with the atmosphere
prevented, protoplasmic life does not appear. If the same solution, however,
be exposed to the atmosphere for from fifteen to forty-five minutes, minute
globular    bodies appear having an independent motion, which                 I denominate
monads.       The time required varies according            to the time    of the year, the
amount of moisture present in the atmosphere, and the temperature.
   Although M. Pasteur has already noticed the meteorological conditions
which    influence that life, he has not noticed the extraordinary rapidity
with which the fluids        are impregnated, and that this impregnation is pro
portional to the surface exposed.
   On the 18th of May,            1871,  two portions of albumen, measuring 400
grains, were placed, the one in a test-tube having a diameter of                     f  inch,
the other in a test-glass which at the surface of the liquid had a diameter
of  2 inches.     In the tube vibrios appeared after twelve days, whilst in the
glass only five days were required for their development.                     If in place of
pure distilled water the water supplied by the Manchester Corporation
(which is one of the purest waters in England) was used, the time required
for the development of vibrios in a test-tube was only twenty-four hours.
   These experiments prove that the rate of development of vibrio-life is in
fluenced by the extent of surface exposed.
   M. Pasteur has already demonstrated that oxygen is essential to the life
of the Mucedines, but I am not aware that it has been proved that this gas
is necessary to the existence        of vibrio-life.
   In the hope of throwing          some  light on this subject, the following         expe
riments were made        : —
   Into each of five glass bulbs equal volumes of a solution of albumen in
Manchester water were placed, and the first left in contact with the atmo
sphere for twenty-four hours, after which the ends of the tube were herme
tically sealed     about 2 inches on each          side    of the bulb.      After passing
oxygen, hydrogen,          nitrogen, and carbonic acid over the other four solu
tions, the tubes were          also hermetically     sealed.     These    tubes were kept
                                                                              p 2

  186                    Dr. F. Cracc-Calvert on Putrefaction.                 [Feb. 29,
 closed for twenty-seven days, during which it was observed that the albu
 men in the bulb containing oxygen speedily became turbid, then the one
  containing air, while the other three remained clear. After this period the
  tubes were broken and the contents examined.              A  large quantity of vibrio-
  life was found in those containing oxygen and common air, whilst those
  containing nitrogen, carbonic acid, and hydrogen contained very small
 quantities, that with hydrogen the least, — thus provi ng that oxygen is an
 essential element to the production of putrefactive vibrios.
      In further support of this view, I may state that under certain conditions
 these animalcules produce such an amount of carbonic acid and other gases
  as to exclude oxygen to such an extent that their own development and life
  are impaired.
      This  is easily proved by taking         albumen   full of animalcules,    but  not
 emitting any putrid odour, and placing it in test-tubes, closing some and
 leaving others open.           If these tubes are examined after a few weeks, it
 will   be observed that in those left in the air life has much           increased, and
 they emit a very putrid odour ; whilst the life in the closed tubes not only has
 not increased, but appears to be in a dormant condition ; for if the corks
 are removed and the         fluid again comes in contact with the oxygen of the
 air, its activity returns.         The albumen also in the closed tubes does not
 emit any putrid odour.
      M. Pasteur     has also found that oxygen was necessary to the vibrios           of
 putrefaction, although the same gas destroyed those produced in butyric
 fermentation ; but he has not made any experiments to show that the pro
 ducts emitted by such vibrios are prejudicial             to their development,     and
 even to their power        of locomotion.
      Having    stated  above that    liquids exposed to the atmosphere become im
 pregnated with monads,           I  will now try to describe their gradual develop
 ment into vibrios, and their ultimate transformation            into microzyma.
     A few hours     after the  albuminous    fluid becomes impregnated, the monads,
 which have a diameter of about j.jsvbo °f an mch, appear to form
 masses.      Then some of the monads become elongated into vibrios, which,
 though attached to the mass, have an independent motion ; so that as the
 force exerted by the vibrios predominates towards one or another direc
tion, so is the mass moved over the field of the microscope.                As the deve
lopment proceeds, the mass is broken up, and ultimately each vibrio has
an independent existence, and may be seen swimming or rolling about in
the fluid. Their size at this stage is about 5 oiiro of an inch. These,
which     I call  ordinary vibrios, gradually grow into long vibrios, which attain
a length of ^iW of an inch.
     These long vibrios gradually become changed into cells, which I have
called microzyms.          The first process in the transformation is its division
into two independent bodies.              One extremely faint line appears across the
centre of the animalcule, and increases in distinctness until the vibrio ap
pears    like two smaller vibrios joined together.         The separation takes place

  1872.]      Dr. F. Crace-Calvert    on  Prevention of Putrefaction.           187
  and each part acquires     an independent      existence.    These  parts   again
 divide, and the process of subdivision is carried on until they appear to be
  nothing more than cells, which have a swimming-power so great as to pass
  over the field of the microscope with rapidity.
     After twelve or eighteen months all the vibrios disappear and          are re
  placed by microzyms, either in motion or at rest.       If these microzyms are
  placed in a solution of fresh albumen, vibrios are abundantly developed.
  The apparent explanation of this fact is that in the fresh albumen they
  have all the circumstances   favourable    to their growth    and reproduction,
  while the putrid albumen has become so completely modified as to           be  in
 capable of affording them the requisite conditions for reproduction.
     I may also notice that at the same time a deposit has taken place which,
 under the microscope, appears to consist of shoals of small particles of
 matter which have no life.      The solution has now become perfectly clear,
 possesses considerable refractive power, and has lost the property of becom
 ing coagulated by heat.
     The albumen solution does not emit a putrid odour until after the for
 mation of the above-mentioned deposit, and the amount of odour is in direct
 ratio to the number of vibrios present.
     I remarked during the investigation the presence of several other forms
 of animalcules which contribute     to the decomposition and putrefaction of
 proteine substances, the description of which will be found in the original
 memoir.
 II. "On      the  Relative Power of Various Substances in preventing
        Putrefaction and the Development of Protoplasmic and Fungus-
        Life." By Dr. F. Crace-Calvert, F.R.S. Received February
        22, 1872.
                                   (Abstract.)
    To carry out this series of experiments, small test-tubes were thoroughly
cleansed, and heated to dull redness.      Into each was placed 26 grammes of
a solution of albumen containing one part of white of egg to four parts of
pure distilled water, prepared as described in my paper on protoplasmic
life.    To this was added one thousandth, or -026 gramme, of each of the
substances the action of which I desired to study.
    The reasons why I employed one part in a thousand are two-fold. First,
the employment of larger proportions would, in some instances, have coagu
lated the albumen ; secondly, it would have increased the difficulty of ob
serving the relative powers of the most efficacious antiseptics in preventing
the development of the germs of putrefaction or decay.
    A drop was taken from each of the tubes, and examined under a micro
scope having a magnifying-power        of 800 diameters.      This operation was
repeated daily with the contents of each tube for thirty-nine days, and from

188       Dr. F. Crace-Calvert on Prevention of Putrefaction.              [Feb. 29,
time to time for eighty days.            During this time the tubes were kept in a
room the temperature          of which did not vary more than 3 degrees, namely,
from 12-5° C. to 15-5° C.
    In order the better to show the influence of the antiseptics used,            I ex
amined two specimens of the same solution at the same time, one of which
was kept in the laboratory, the other in the open air.
    A  marked difference was observed in the result, the one kept outside
becoming impregnated with animal life in less than half the time re
quired by the other, while as many vibrios were developed in six days iu
the tube kept outside as were developed in thirty days in the tube in the
 laboratory.

    In comparing      the results    stated in the above Table,    the substances
can be classed under four distinct heads, viz.: — those which prevent the de
velopment of protoplasmic and fungus-life ; those which prevent the pro
duction of vibrio-life, but do not prevent the appearance of fungus-life           ;
those which permit the production of vibrio-life, but prevent the appear
ance    of fungus-life  ;  and those which do not prevent the appearance          of
either protoplasmic      or fungus-life.
   The first class contains only two substances, carbolic and cresylic acids.
    In the second class, also, there are only two compounds, chloride of zinc
and bichloride    of mercury.
    In the third    class there are five substances,  lime, sulphate of quinine,
pepper, turpentine,       and prussic  acid.
    In the fourth class is included the remaining twenty-five substances.
    The acids, while not preventing the production of vibrio-life, have a
marked tendency to promote the growth of fungus-life. This is especially
noticeable in the case of sulphuric and acetic acids.
     Alkalies, on the contrary, are not favourable to the production of fuugus-
life,  but promote the development of vibrios.
    The chlorides of zinc and mercury, while completely preventing the de
velopment of animalcules, do not entirely prevent fungus-life ; but I would
 call special attention to the interes'.ing and unexpected results obtained in

  190      Dr. F. Crace-Calvert on Prevention of Putrefaction.          [Feb. 29,
  the cases of chlorine and bleaching-powder.      When used in the proportion
  above stated they do not prevent the production of vibrio-life.        In order
  to do   so, they must be employed in excess ; and I have ascertained, by a
  distinct series of experiments, that large quantities of bleaching-powder are
  necessary.     I found that part of the carbon was converted into carbonic
  acid, and part of the nitrogen was liberated.
     If, however, the bleaching-powder be not in excess, the animal matter
  will still readily enter into putrefaction.    The assumption on which its
  employment as a disinfectant has been based, namely, that the affinity of
  the chlorine for hydrogen is so great as to destroy the germs, is erroneous.
     The next class to which I would call attention is the tar series, where
  neither the carbolic nor the cresylic acid fluids gave any signs of vibrionic
  or fungus-life during the whole eighty days during which the experiments
  were conducted.
     The results obtained with sulphate of quinine, pepper, and turpentine,
 deserve notice.      None of them prevent the development of vibrio-life ; but
 sulphate of quinine and pepper entirely prevent the appearance of fungi.
 This fact, together with the remarkable efficacy of sulphate of quinine in
 intermittent fever, would lead to the supposition that this form of disease
 is due to the introduction into the system of fungus-germs ; and this is
 rendered the more probable, if we bear in mind that these fevers are pre
 valent only in low marshy situations, where vegetable decay abounds, and
 never appear to any extent in dry climates, even in the midst of dense
 populations, where ventilation is bad and putrefaction is rife.
     The results obtained in the   case of charcoal show that it possesses no
 antiseptic properties, but that it prevents the emanation of putrid gases,
 owing to its extraordinary porosity, which condenses the gases, thus bring
 ing them into contact with the oxygen of the atmosphere, which is simul
 taneously condensed.
    The above results have been confirmed by a second series.
    A series of experiments was also undertaken, substituting        gelatine for
albumen, and was continued for forty-seven days.
    Vibrios appeared in two days in the standard gelatine-solution, and bac
 teria after four or five ; and during the whole time of the experiment, life
was far more abundant       than in the albumen-solution.     A  distinct  putrid
smell was emitted after twenty-six days.
    With bleaching-powder it took twenty days for life to appear, instead of
seven, as in the case of albumen ; while at no time during the twenty-seven
days which remained was life abundant.         No putrid odour was emitted ;
but    a mouldy one could be detected on the thirtieth day.
    With chlorine-solution vibrio-life was observed only after forty days    ; no
putrid nor mouldy smell was given off at any time.
    The protosulphate of iron gave, with this solution, results quite different
from those with albumen, in which, it will be remembered, vibrios appeared
in  seven days, and fungi after fifteen  ; whilst with gelatine neither proto

 -1872.]        Dr. F. Crace-Calvert       on  Arresting Putrefaction.            191
 plasmic nor fungus-life        appeared during     the time the experiments     were
 continued.
    Another substance, arsenious acid, also presented a marked difference in
its action in the two solutions ; for although with albumen twenty-two days
elapsed before vibrios were present, and eighteen before fungi, with gelatine
animal life appeared after two days, and at no time did any fungi exist.
The effects of the other substances with gelatine were so similar to those
with albumen, that it is unnecessary to state them here.
III. " On      the Relative        Power of Various       Substances in arresting
       Putrefaction and the Development of Protoplasmic and Fungus-
       Life."      By Dr. F. Crace-Calvert, F.R.S.              Received    February
       22, 1872.
                                        (Abstract.)
    This series of experiments was undertaken as being complementary to
those described in my last paper, and consisted in adding to a solution
of albumen, swarming with microscopic life, one-thousandth part of the sub
stances already enumerated in that paper, and examining the results pro
duced immediately after the addition of the substances, and after one, six,
and sixteen days ; but in this abstract only the results obtained in the first
and last cases will be noticed.
    The solutions    were    placed in test-tubes similar to those described in my
last paper.
    The experiments      were begun on the 20th Sept. 1871,       the solutions being
kept at a temperature of 15°-18° C.
    In the standard solution the amount of life and putrescence increased
during the whole of the time.
   The first   class includes those substances which completely destroyed the
locomotive     power of the vibrios immediately, and completely prevented
their regaining it during the time the experiments were conducted : —
    Cresylio acid.
    The   second class contains those compounds         which nearly destroyed the
locomotive     power    of  all  the vibrios  present  when  added, and afterwards
only one or two could be seen swimming about in each field : —
    Carbolic acid, sulphate of quinine, chloride of zinc, and sulphuric acid.
    The third class are those which acted injuriously on the vibrios on their
addition, leaving only a small number retaining the power of swimming,
but which allowed the vibrios gradually to increase in number, the fluid,
nevertheless, containing less life after sixteen days than the standard putrid
albumen-solution : —
    Picric acid and sulpbo-carbolate of zinc.
    The fourth     class   includes   those substances which    acted  injuriously  at
first, but permitted the vibrios to regain their former locomotive             power,

 so that the    fluid after sixteen days contained as much vibrio-life as the
standard putrid albumen : —
   Chloride of aluminium, sulphurous acid and prussic acid.
   The fifth class contains those compounds which acted injuriously at first,
destroying the locomotive power of most of the vibrios, but which after
wards permitted the vibrios to increase more rapidly than in the standard
albumen-solution : —
   Bleaching-powder, bichloride of mercury, chlorine-solution, caustic soda,
acetic and nitric acids, sulphate of iron, and the sulpho-carbolates of potash
and soda.
   The sixth class contains those compounds which exercised no action on
the animalcules, either at first or after sixteen days : —
   Arsenious acid, common salt, chloride of calcium, chlorate                  of potash,
sulphate of lime, bisulphite       of lime, hyposulphite       of   soda, phosphate of
lime, turpentine, and pepper.
   The seventh class includes those substances which favour the production
of animalcules and promote putrefaction : —
   Lime, charcoal, permanganate of potash, phosphate of soda, and ammonia.

    My     dear Sin, — I      beg herewith     to hand you a statement of the expen
diture of the j£200         I  received in February 1871 from the Government-
Grant Fund for working the Kew heliograph and measuring and reducing
the photographic pictures from February 1st, 1871, to January 30, 1872.
I  enclose the vouchers.
   The work which         I   undertook      to superintend during the last ten years
has   been brought to a close, so far as the observations are concerned.                 It
has,   however, been impossible to keep up the measurements of the sun-
pictures      and their reduction     to the day.          Indeed it will take eighteen
months       to bring these to a close     ;  I  have agreed with Mrs. Whipple (for
merly      Miss Beckley) and Mr.        Loewy to complete this work for a specific
sum    (aEl/0). As the funds placed               at my disposal are exhausted,      I will
defray     this  expense  myself.
    It may be of interest to the Government-Grant Committee to know that,
during the ten years (1862, February, to the end of January 1871), 2778
pictures have been obtained on           1 724 days.
    Since the Kew instrument            was devised and constructed,          I  have been
able,   with the aid of Mr. Dalmeyer, to introduce                 many improvements,
both      in   the   mechanical parts and the optical             portion of the instru
ment    ;   but  I did not think it desirable to interrupt the sun-work to make
any changes in the Kew heliograph.                  Now that the work is completed, I
would recommend that the secondary magnifier should be changed to the
form adopted in the instrument made for the Russian Government, under my
 direction, and now at work at Wilna, by which very much better pictures
are obtained than those procured at Kew.                  The cost of this change would
be   about .£30.

    An outline of the subject of this memoir has already been published in
the Proceedings* in a letter to Dr. Sharpey.                    In a former memoir the
author described the structure of a series of Lepidodendroid stems, appa
rently belonging to different genera and species.                He now describes a very
similar series, but all of which, there is strong reason for believing, belong

200                         Prof. Williamson on the Fossil                     [Mar. 7,
to the same plant,        of which the structure has varied at different stages of
its growth.         The specimens were obtained from some thin fossiliferous
deposits discovered by Mr. G. Grieve of Burntisland, in Fifeshire, where
they occur imbedded in igneous rocks.               The examples vary from the very
youngest, half-developed twigs, not more than ^ of an inch in diameter,
to arborescent stems           having  a circumference     of from two to three feet.
The youngest twigs          are composed    of ordinary parenchyma, and the imper
fectly developed leaves which clothe them externally have the same struc
 ture.     In the interior of the twig there is a single bundle, consisting of
 a limited number of barred vessels.            In the centre of the bundle there can
 always     be   detected   a  small amount   of  primitive cellular tissue, which is a
 rudimentary pith.           As the twig expanded into a branch, this central
 pith enlarged by multiplication of its cells, and the vascular bundle in like
 manner increased in size through a corresponding increase in the number of
 its vessels.      The latter structure thus became converted into the vascular
 cylinder,    so  common      amongst Lepidodendroid plants, in transverse sections
 of which the vessels do not appear arranged in radiating series.               Simulta
 neously     with   these  changes   the  thick  parenchymatous    outer layer becomes
  differentiated.      At first but two layers can be distinguished      —  a thin inner
 one, in which the cells have square ends, and are disposed in irregular
 vertical columns, and a thicker outer one consisting of parenchyma, the
  same as the epidermal layer of the author's preceding memoir.               In a short
 time a third layer was developed between these two.
     When the vascular cylinder had undergone a considerable increase in its
  size and in the number of its vessels, a new element made its appearance.
  An exogenous growth of vessels took place in a cambium layer, which in
  vested the preexisting vascular cylinder.             The author distinguishes the
  latter as the vascular medullary cylinder, and the former as the ligneous
  zone.     The newly added vessels were arranged in radiating laminae, sepa
  rated from each other by small but very distinct medullary rays.                 At an
  earlier stage of growth traces of vascular bundles proceeding from the
  central    cylinder    to the leaves    had been detected.      These are now     verv
  clearly seen to leave the surface of the medullary vascular cylinder where
  it and the ligneous zone are in mutual contact ; hence tangential sections
  of the former exhibit no traces of these bundles, but similar sections of
  the ligneous zone present them at regular intervals               and in quincuneial
  order.     Each bundle passes outwards through the                ligneous zone, im
  bedded in a cellular mass, which          corresponds, alike in its origin and in its
  direction, w.ith the ordinary medullary rays, differing from them only in its
  larger dimensions.          At this stage of growth the plant is obviously iden
  tical with    the  Diploxi/lon of Corda, with the Analathra of Witham, and, so
   far as this internal axis is concerned, with the Sigillaria elegans of Bron-
   gniart.     The peculiar medullary vascular cylinder existing in all these
   plants   is  now shown to be merely the developed vascular bundle of
   ordinary Lycopods,        whilst the exogenous radiating ligneous zone enclosing

  1872.]                     Plants of the Coal-measures.                             201
 that cylinder is an additional        element which       has no counterpart amongst
 the  living forms of this group.
    Though the central compound cellulo-vascular                  axis continued to in
 crease in size with the general growth of the plant, it was always small in
 proportion to the size of the stem.             The chief enlargement of the latter
was due to the growth of the bark, which exhibited three very distinct
layers, — an inner one of cells with square ends, and slightly elongated verti
cally    and arranged in irregular vertical rows, an intermediate one of
prosenchyma, and an outer one of parenchyma.                   These conditions became
yet further modified in old stems.              The exogenous ligneous zone became
very    thick in proportion      to  the medullary vascular cylinder, and the dif
ferences between the layers of the bark became yet more distinct.                   These
differences became the most marked in the prosenchymatous layer ; at its
inner surface the cells are prosenchymatous, but towards its exterior they
become yet more elongated vertically, their ends being almost square,
whilst     numbers    of them of exactly equal length             are arranged    in lines
radiating from within        outwards.      These     oblong cells often pass into a yet
more     elongated    series   with somewhat         thickened walls, which become
almost     vascular,   constituting    a series    of bast-fibres.    In the transverse
sections these prosenchymatous            cells are always arranged, like the vessels
of the ligneous       zone, in radiating lines.         Yet more external is the sub
epidermal parenchyma passing into leaves composed of the same kind
of tissue.      The petioles of the leaves have been long, if not permanently,
retained     in connexion with the stem,         a character   of Corda's genus Loma-
tophloios.
    Where      young twigs branch, the vascular medullary cylinder divides
longitudinally into two parts ; the transverse section of this cylinder now
resembles two horse-shoes pointing in opposite directions.                   The break in
the  continuity of each half of the cylinder occasioned by the division is never
closed     by new vessels belonging to the cylinder ; but when the stem de
velops     exogenously, the cambium-layer,             from   which    the   new growths
originated, has endeavoured to surround                these  openings in the cylinder,
and, by closing      them, once      more to separate the medullary from the cor
tical tissues.      Some beautiful specimens have been obtained, which exhi
bit these new exogenous layers in process of formation.                    The vessels or
the young layers are not half developed.               At first they meander vertically
 through      masses  of  delicate  cellular   tissue  ; but they soon arrange them
 selves   in regular radiating     vessels  and cells, becoming mere outward pro
 longations of the woody wedges and medullary rays of the older part of the
 stem.      At this stage of their growth, the walls of the vessels are deeply
 indented by the contiguous cells, as if the plastic tissues of the former had
 been moulded upon the latter structures.               As the new vessels enlarge, the
 superfluous intervening cells disappear, until each medullary ray finally
 consists of a single vertical pile of from one to a small number of cells,
 arranged     as  in many Coniferae.         The exceptional     cases   are those where

202               On the Fossil Plants of     the Coal-measures.        [Mar. 7,
vascular bundles pass outwards to the leaves ; these bundles have pro
tected the contiguous cells above and below them from the pressure of the
enlarging ligneous vessels and limited their absorption.         Both these and
the smaller ordinary rays pass outwards in horizontal and parallel lines.
The evidences of an exogenous mode of growth afforded by these young,
half-developed layers of wood is clear and decisive.
     The Burntisland deposits are full of fragments of strobili, especially of
torn sporangia and of macrospores. Several fine Lepidostrobi have been ob
tained like those to which the fragments have belonged, and which the
 author believes to have been the fruits of the stems described.       The struc
 ture of these strobili is very clear and of interest ; the primary branches
 from the central axis subdivide, so that each sporangium rests upon a sepa
 rate bract, from the upper surface of which a vertical lamina arises, and,
 extending the entire length of the sporangium, ascends far into its interior,
 where it bifurcates.       The cellular walls of the sporangium blend with the
 bract along each side of the base of this sporangiophore.        The microspores
 occupy the upper part of the Lepidostrobus, and are usually triplospores,
 sometimes tetraspores.         The macrospores occupy the lowermost spo
 rangia, are of large size, and are very remarkable from having their external
 surfaces clothed with numerous projecting caudate appendages, each one of
 which is slightly capitate at its extremity.       So far as the author is aware,
  this is an undescribed form of macrospore.
     Two new forms of Lepidodendron are described from the Oldham beds,
 in one of which the medullary axis attains to an unusually large size, even
  in the young shoots ; whilst the other is remarkable for the magnitude of
  its leaves.   It is obvious that the plant which is the chief subject of the
  memoir is a true example of Corda's genus Biploxylon, so far as its woody
  axis is concerned ; whilst its bark and leaves are those of a Lomatophloioi,
  and its slender twigs are Lepidodendra.          The author also points out the
  probability that the plant had a true Stigmarian root.
      The structure of these fossil types is compared with that of recent
   Lycopodiacece.     The vascular medullary cylinder     is shown to be an aggre
  gation of the foliar vascular bundles, so that the vascular connexion         be
   tween the leaves and the stem is maintained exclusively by means of these
   vessels, which thus correspond most closely with the central vascular axes
   of living Lycopods.       On the other hand, the exogenous layers do not
   communicate     directly  with the leaves   in any way — but are homologous
   with the corresponding layers in the Stigmarian root, in which latter they
   receive the vascular bundles from the rootlets.         The medullary cylinder
   does not enter the roots, but appears to terminate at the base     of the stem,
   though the pith is prolonged through them.            Hence it seems probable
   that the nutritive matters were taken up from the soil by the Stigmarian
   rootlets, that they ascended into the Diploxyloid stem through the exoge
   nous layer, but that, in order to reach the leaves, if conveyed by the vessels
   and not by the cellular tissues, they had to be transferred by endosmosis to

  1872.]       Dr. C. R. A. Wright      on the Opium       Alkaloids.            203
 those of the medullary cylinder.     The bark of the fossil plants is compared
 with those of Lycopodium chamcecyparissus and Selaginella Martensii,
 which two combined represent the former.
    These discoveries necessitate     some changes in generic nomenclature,
 since the several parts of the plant not only represent the three genera
 above mentioned, but also several others.            Meanwhile some other errors
require   correction.    Corda  erroneously defined his genus Diploxylon as
having no medullary rays, and Brongniart relied upon this distinction in
separating Diploxylon from Sigillaria ; but no difference exists between the
ligneous structures of the two genera, so far as Sigillaria is illustrated by
Brongniart's S. elegant. Corda, Brongniart, and King all agree in regard
ing Diploxylon (which is identical with Witham's Anabath.ro) as belonging
to the Gymnospermous Exogeus.           The necessity for abandoning this sepa
ration of the plants in question from the Lycopodiacece, urged in the author's
previous memoir, is now made more obvious than before, the distinctions
upon which the great French botanist relied in his classification being
now shown to be such as mere differences of age can produce. The author
concludes from his own observations that the genera Diploxylon, Ana-
lathra, Lomatophloios, and Leptoxylon must             be united.    Brongniart had
already   brought    into  one generic group       Corda's   genera Lomatophloios,
Leptoxylon, and Calamoxylon, Goppert's genus Pachyphyllum, and Stern
berg's genus Lepidophloios, giving the latter name to the whole.               Hence
no less than six obsolete generic names are disposed of. The author finally
follows Brongniart in adopting the term Lepidophloios, and temporarily
 assigns to the plant described the trivial name of L. brevifolium.              The
 further relations of this genus to more ordinary forms of Lepidodendron
 require further investigation.
    Much credit is due to G. Grieve, Esq., of Burntisland, for the energy
with which he has worked amongst the deposits at Burntisland ; and the
 author acknowledges his great obligations to that gentleman for liberal
 supplies of specimens for examination.

    These two hypothetical bases, X and Y, then serve as the foundations
 of two series of new products expressible by the general formulae : —
                                   4X+nHI+pHaO,
                                   4Y+nHI+pH20.
     In accordance with these views, it might     be anticipated that, on treating
 morphia with hydriodic acid        and  phosphorus, either the same products, or
 at least products belonging to these same series, would ultimately result,
 which is in fact the case.
     The morphia used in these experiments was presented for the purpose
 by Messrs. Macfarlane of Edinburgh, to whom the writer has already been
 so much indebted for similar acts of liberality ; the hydriodic acid was pre
 pared as described in Part III., and contained 50 to 55 per cent, of HI.
     On dissolving morphia by the aid of heat in about four times its weight
  of this acid, a marked brown coloration is visible, indicating the separation
  of iodine ; on adding phosphorus and continuing to heat, this colour ulti
  mately disappears, a colourless syrupy liquid being obtained, which is freed
  from amorphous phosphorus and the phosphorus acids produced during
  the reaction by filtration through asbestos while hot, precipitation by water
  &c, precisely      as in the case    of the similar  codeia products.     On thus
  treating codeia, one or other of three products        appear to be formed, ac
  cording to the temperature employed, viz. : —
                         At 100°              4X + 6HI.
                        Atll0°-115° .. 4X+6HI-2H20.
                         Boiled up   to 130°  4Y + GHI-2H:0.
      In the  case  of morphia,    however, the resulting product is the same at
   whatever of these temperatures the reaction ensues, and has the composition
  4X + 6HI — 2H.jO. Thus the following numbers were obtained after com

the elements of              HI   has been shown to take place, the end product                   having
the composition               Cc3 H3ON4O10,    4HI     ;   as stated   in Part    III.,    however, it is
very difficult to push this reaction to its extreme.  Precisely the same
facts are observable with the above morphia product ; by boiling this with
three hundred times its weight of water for three hours, half the basic
iodine      it contains is eliminated           as    HI,    forming    a   product       which
                                                                                             may be
either      a mixture           of equivalent        quantities      of CM H31 1    N5O,,,, 4HI and
CM Ha0          Nj O10,     4HI, or   a single substance          of the formula
                                        C]MH13lIN4O10,8HI.
If this     latter be the case, the formulae hitherto attributed to the derivatives
from codeia and morphia                 obtained by the action of HI are only half the
true ones            ;   and the formation of this substance may be expressed by the
equations
                 Cls,     H104 14 N3 O20,   SHI =2HI + C130          H,0, I2 Ns Oso,    SHI,

   The following considerations tend to show that this body is a single sub
stance and not a mixture : —

is produced previously to the production of the substance hitherto described
as CM H2o N4 O10, 4HI.     Now it is not probable that in two separate in
stances one compound should split up into mixtures of two bodies of ana
logous though slightly different constitutions, these two being formed in
each case in equivalent quantities.
   2nd. A body which is without doubt a single compound, and which has the
formula Cl3c H153 1 N3 O20, 8HI, has been produced (as will be described in
a subsequent communication) by the simultaneous action of HI and P on
a polymeride of codeia obtained from that base by the action of phosphoric
acid : in physical and chemical properties this product much resembles
the two bodies thus obtained from morphia and codeia products by the
Action of water ; and hence these two bodies probably contain, like                               it,   C
associated with            I   in the base.
     In order to show the resemblance between, or rather the identity of the
codeia and morphia products, the formulae given in Part        have been               III.

     physical character and chemical deportment the derivatives from
morphia obtained as above described are indistinguishable from those of
the same composition obtained from codeia. The physiological experi
ments of Mr. Stocker given in the next section show that no particular
difference is discernible in this respect also ; hence it is concluded that the
codeia products are not merely isomeric, but are identical with the corre
sponding morphia derivatives.
  From the fact that hydriodic acid alone does not eliminate methyl from
codeia in the form of methyl iodide, but causes the separation of free
iodine, it appears more probable that the formation of the compound
CMH91 I2 N4OI0, 4HI, obtained by the action of hydriodic acid in pre
sence        of the phosphorus      on codeia, is brought about in accordance with the

methyl group would place a portion of the molecule in a quasi-nascent
condition, thereby rendering further changes more easy.
   The foregoing experiments, taken into consideration together with those
formerly obtained in conjunction with the late Dr. Matthiessen *, lead to
several noteworthy conclusions and speculations.
   (1) The actions of hydrochloric,           hydrobroraic,  and hydriodic acids on
morphia and codeia are not precisely analogous ; thus the action of HC1
appears to give rise more especially to products derived from non-polyme
rized bases ; e. g., chlorocodide, which regenerates ordinary codeia by the
action of watert•       By the action of HBr, codeia yields not only bases
apparently formed from non-polymerized                 codeia (bromocodide, deoxy-
codeia, deoxymorphia),        but also bases derived from polymerized codeia
and accordingly      containing     at least C73,   and probably Cm (chloro- and
bromotetracodeia) .       Hydriodic     acid,  on the other hand, yields no body
whose formula can be written as containing less carbon than C3, ; and from
the physical characters of the first products of the action and the constitu
tion of their derivatives (many of which contain at least C03 and some ap
parently C130), this proportion of carbon must certainly be doubled and
probably quadrupled.
   Hence HC1 yields single-molecule               derivatives chiefly ;     HBr yields
single-molecule     derivatives,   and   also  polymeride derivatives,      the polyme-
rides containing at least Ccs or C72 (possibly the formulae attributed to
bromotetracodeia and analogous bases may require doubling, as the phy
sical character of the bases and their salts indicate that they belong to the
same rank as the iodine derivatives); HI yields polymeride derivatives only.
   (2) It being assumed that the molecules of codeia and morphia contain
respectively either C,d and C17 or C.,3 and CM (which latter is probably the
case, experiments now in progress indicating that the molecular formulae
of these bases are double those usually ascribed to them), the above expe
riments lead to the conclusion that there exist polymerides of these alka
loids containing C72, C1U                , or CM, C133            , these polymerides
being formed by the action of strong acids, and serving as starting-points
for new series of derivatives.        Experiments to obtain these polymerides in
an unaltered condition are, as has been previously stated, in progress, and
apparently with success.
   This facile disposition to form polymerides is not an unknown feature in
alkaloids, the experiments of Anderson having shown that the pyridine
bases are characterized by this property.          This fact would appear to warrant
the speculation that morphia and codeia contain carbon groups analogous
    * Matthiessen and Wright, Proc. Boy. Soc. vol. xvii. pp. 455, 460     ; and vol. xviii.
p. 83.
   t  Experiments are in progress which appear to show that the action of HC1 on both
codeia and morphia is capable of giving rise, when pushed to an extreme, of bases inso
luble in ether, and of characters similar to chloro- and bromo-tctracodeia, with less ease,
however,  than  HBr.

to, if not identical with, those contained in the pyridine bases ; and, in
fact, experiments now in progress, in conjunction with Herr L. Mayer,
apparently lead to the conclusion that pyridine is obtainable from morphia
derivatives by treatment which, though energetic, is nevertheless far short
of destructive distillation : indeed it may be doubted whether the carbon
groups contained in the pyridine series of bases do not preexist in the bodies
from which these bases are obtained by destructive distillation.
   (3) A comparison between the formulae of the products obtained by the
three hydracids HC1, HBr, and HI shows that while the action of HC1 is
simply to replace OH by CI, or to remove the elements of H3 0 (some
times also replacing CH3 by H), that of HBr is (in addition to the changes
produced by HC1) to cause the addition of hydrogen to that one of the
two resulting products that is derived from the non-polymerized molecule.

    (5) It appears not improbable that codeia and morphia may contain in
 their molecules benzene residues. Schiff has pointed out* that phenols
give colorations with ferric chloride, whereas the corresponding ethers or
anisols do not do so        ; the well-known    distinction   between morphia and
codeia in this respect, therefore, gives some support to the idea that both
may be benzene derivatives.
§ 3. On the Physiological Action          of some of the foregoing Derivatives.
    By   Reginald       Stocker, M.B., Pathologist in St. Mary's Hospital
    Medical School.
    Doses of    1   decigramme of the compound Cm H91 1 N4 O10, 4HI from
codeia, and of the similar compound from morphia, were given to an adult
terrier by the mouth without producing any perceptible effect whatever ;
when the dose        was increased to 3 decigrammes, in each case repeated
defalcation in the course of a few hours was produced, the stools being
more loose than ordinarily and frequently of a dark greenish colour ; no
other symptom was noticeable, and no appreciable difference in the action
of the two compounds was perceptible.
    Doses of 5 decigrammes of the compound CM H^ IaN4O10, 4HI from
each    of these sources were given to the     same dog by the mouth,      with the
result of producing similar repeated            defeecation   in the course of two
or three hours     ; the sole difference discernible between these aud the former
experiments       being   that the effect was produced       somewhat   sooner and
 was   of longer continuance in the latter cases, a result probably pro
duced solely by the larger dose.          No material differences were observed
between the codeia and morphia derivative.
    The same dog was employed throughout, two or three days being
 allowed to intervene between each experiment, so that the animal had
 recovered from the effects        of a former    dose    before the administration
of another.
    It  would hence appear that the derivatives of polymerized C17 Hal NO,
 are less active than those of polymerized C17 H19 N03 ; and also that there
 is no reason for considering the derivatives from codeia as different
from those of morphia,        the corresponding bodies having respectively the
 same quantitative      composition and the same physical, chemical, and phy
siological properties.

       "Further Investigations on Planetary Influence upon Solar
        Activity."     By Warken De La Rue, D.C.L., F.R.S., Balfour
        Stewart, LL.D., F.R.S., and Benjamin Loewy, F.R.A.S. Re
       ceived  January 30, 1872.
    1.  In  a previous    communication    by us to this Society, an Abstract of
which was published in the Proceedings, vol. xiv. p. 59, we showed some

 grounds    for believing that the behaviour of sun-spots with regard to in
 crease and diminution, as they pass across the sun's visible disk, is not
 altogether of an arbitrary nature.       From the information which we then
 had, we were led to think that during a period of several months sun-spots
will on the whole attain their minimum of size nt the centre of the disk ;
 they will then alter their behaviour so as on the whole to diminish during
 the whole time of their passage across the disk ; thirdly, their behaviour
 will be such that they reach a maximum at the centre ; and, lastly, they
 will be found to increase in size during their whole passage across the disk.
 These various types of behaviour appeared to us always to follow one
 another in the above order ; and in a paper printed for private circulation
 in 1866, we discussed the matter at considerable length, after having care
 fully measured the area of each of the groups observed by Carrington, in
order to increase the accuracy of our results.      In this paper we obtained
nineteen or twenty months as the approximate value of the period of re
 currence of the same behaviour.
     2. A recurrence of this kiud is rather a deduction from observations
 more or less probable than an hypothesis ; nevertheless, it appeared to us
to connect itself at once with an hypothesis regarding sun-spot activity.
 " The average size of a spot "                   " would appear to attain its
                                    (we remarked)
maximum on that side of the sun which is turned away from Venus, and
to have its minimum in the neighbourhood of this planet." In venturing a
 remark of this nature, we were aware it might be said " How can a com
paratively small body like one of the planets so far away from the sun
 cause   such enormous disturbances      on the sun's surface as we know sun-
                "    It
 spots to be  ?         ought, however, we think, to be borne in mind that in
 sun-spots we have, as a matter of fact, a set of phenomena curiously re
 stricted to certain solar latitudes, within which, however, they vary ac
 cording to some complicated periodical law, and presenting also periodical
 variations in their frequency of a strangely complicated nature.        Now
 these phenomena must either he caused by something within the sun's
 surface,  or by something without it.       But if we cannot easily imagine
 bodies so distant as the planets to produce such large effects, we have
 equal difficulty in imagining any thing beneath the sun's surface that could
give rise to phenomena of such a complicated periodicity, i Nevertheless,
as we have remarked, sun-spots do exist, and obey complicated laws,
whether they be caused by something within or something without the sun.
Under these circumstances, it does not appear to us unphilosophical to
see whether as a matter of fact the behaviour of sun-spots has any reference
to planetary positions.       There likewise appears to be this advantage in
establishing a connexion of any kind between the behaviour of sun-spots
and the positions of some one prominent planet, that we at once expect a
similar result in the case of another planet of nearly equal prominence, and
are thus led to use our idea as a working hypothesis.
   3. We have now a larger number of observations at our disposal than we

212       Messrs. Warren De La Rue, Stewart, and Loewy                   [Mar. 14,
had in 1866.       We had theu only the groups observed by Carrington, the
positions and areas of all of which we had accurately measured.           We have
now in addition      five  years  of   the Kew   observations,  for each  group of
which the positions and areas have been recorded by us in our previous
communications to this Society, j We have thus altogether observations
extending from the beginning of 1854 to the end of 1860, forming the
series of Carrington ; and observations extending from the beginning of
1 862 to the end of 1 866, forming the Kew series, as far as this is yet reduced.
We have, in fact, altogether a nearly continuous series, beginning a year or
two before one minimum, and extending to the next, and thus embracing
rather more than a whole period.
   We propose in the following pages to discuss the behaviour with regard
to size of the various groups of these two series, as each group passes from
left to right across the sun's visible disk. Unfortunately for this purpose,
a large number of groups has to be rejected ; for, on account of bad weather,
we have frequent blank days, during which the sun cannot be seen, and on
this account    we cannot tell   with sufficient accuracy the behaviour of many
groups as they pass across the disk.          In our catalogue of sun-spot beha
viour we have only retained those groups for which, making the times
abscissae, and the areas ordinates, we had sufficiently      frequent observations
to enable us to construct a reasonably accurate curve exhibiting the area
of the group for each point of its passage across the disk.            From these
curves a Table was then formed denoting the probable area of each non-
rejected group at the following heliographic longitudes (that of the visible
centre of the disk being reckoned as zero) : —
           -630-49o-35o-21o-70+7°                + 2r+350+49o+63o;
in fact giving the area of the group for the ten central days of its progress,
and rejecting those observations that were too near the sun's border on
either side, ou account of the uncertainty of measurement of such observa
tions.   We have succeeded in tabulating in this manner 421 groups of
Carrington's series, and 373 groups of the Kew series up to the end of 1866,
in all 794 groups.       In this catalogue the area is that of the whole spot, in
cluding umbra and penumbra           ; and in measuring these areas a correction
for foreshortening has always been made, as described in a paper which we
presented to this Society, and which constitutes the first series of our re
searches.     These areas are expressed in millionths of the suu's visible
hemisphere.
    4. When we began this present investigation into the behaviour of spots,
we soon found reason to conclude that in the case of sun-spots the usual
formula for foreshortening is not strictly correct.         Perhaps if a sun-spot
were   strictly  a surface-phenomenon,      the usual formula    might be correct,
though even that is doubtful ; for the earth as a planet may not impossibly
affect the behaviour of all spots as they cross the disk, so as to render the
formula    somewhat      inexact.    However    this may be, a spot is probably
always surrounded more or less by faculous matter, forming in many cases

  a sort of cylindrical wall round the spot.           Now the       effect of such a wall
  would be to allow the whole spot to be seen when at or near the centre                of
  the disk, but to hide part    of the spot   as  it approached the border       on either
  side.  A   spot thus affected would therefore appear to be more diminished
  by foreshortening      than the usual formula would indicate ; and we should
 therefore expect,     if this were the case, that, on the whole, and after making
 the usual allowance for foreshortening, spots would nevertheless be found
 deficient  in  area near the borders as compared         with their area at the centre
 of the disk.      As a matter of fact we have something of this kind, as will
 be seen from the following Table, in which we have used the whole body
 of spots forming the catalogue to which we have made allusion.                    In this
 Table the first column denotes the heliocentric longitude from the cpntre
 of the disk reckoned as zero ; the second denotes the united areas at the
 various longitudes of all those groups from both series, the behaviour of
which we have been able to obtain with accuracy ; while the third column
exhibits the residual factor for foreshortening, which will bring the areas of
the second column into equality         with  each other.

    5. From the above Table it appears that the average behaviour of spots,
as  far as can be judged from the information at present attainable, is not
quite symmetrical       as regards the centre    of the disk.        Without attempting
at present to enter into an explanation of this          remarkable      phenomenon, we
may point to it as a confirmation of our view previously stated, that most
spots are accompanied by a wall-shaped surrounding of facula. Observations
show that on the whole the life-history of the facula begins and ends earlier
than that of the spot which it surrounds, and that throughout a gradual
subsidence or dissipation of this elevated mural appendage seems to be taking
place.     But such a diminution of the wall discloses more of the spot itself;
and hence      the spot-areas measured in the eastern           half of the hemisphere
    vol. xx.                                                                   R

might be presumed, ceteris paribus, to be smaller than those observed in
the western half, a fact strikingly demonstrated by the above Table.
    Our present object, however, is not to account for the average behaviour
of spots, but rather to investigate the causes or concomitants of a de
parture from this average behaviour.        We have therefore in all cases made
use of the factors given in the above Table as those which, judging by
the average behaviour, tend to equalize the areas that pass the various lon
gitudes.     We have called this earth-correction, and have limited our dis
cussion to any well-marked behaviour that remains after the earth-correc
tion has been applied.                                                     •
    6.  Let us now divide the whole mass of observations into four portions,
depending upon the position of the planet Venus with reference to the
Earth or point of view. First, let us take each occasion on which the
planet is in the same heliographic longitude as the Earth, that is to say,
when the Earth and Venus are nearly in a line on the same side of the sun.
    Let us use five months' observations for each such occasion, extending
equally on both sides of it ; thus, for instance, if the planet Venus and the
Earth had the same heliocentric longitude on September 30, 1855, we should
make use of sun-spots from the middle of July to the middle of December
of that year as likely to represent any behaviour that might be due to this
particular position of Venus.      Let us do the same for all similar occasions,
and finally add all the spots thus selected together.        We have thus ob
tained a mass of observations which may be supposed to represent any be
haviour due to this position of the planet Venus with reference to the
Earth or point of view.
    Secondly, let us now take each occasion on which Venus is at the same
longitude as the extreme right of the visible disk, that is to say, 90° before
the Earth, and do the same as we did in the previous instance, using five
months' observations for each occasion. ' We shall thus, as before, obtain
a mass    of observations which may be supposed to represent the behaviour
due to a position of Venus 90° before the Earth.       Thirdly, let us obtain in
a  similar  manner a mass   of observations representing the behaviour of sun-
spots for a position of Venus 180° before the Earth, Venus and the Earth
being now at exactly opposite sides of the sun ; and fourthly, let us finally
obtain, in a similar manner, those observations representing the behaviour
of sun-spots when Venus is 270° before the Earth, being now of the same
heliocentric longitude as the extreme left of the visible disk.
    These four series of five months each will in fact split up the whole body
of observations into four equal parts, the synodical revolution of Venus
being nearly twenty months.         The following Table exhibits these series
after the earth-correction has been applied to each ; it also represents each
series reduced so as to     exhibit its characteristic behaviour for an avera"e
size   of spot =1000.

            7.   We may do the same for the planet Mercury as we have done for
        Venus, that is to say, we may split up the whole body of observations into
        four parts, representing the behaviour of sun-spots when Mercury is in the
        same four positions with respect to the Earth as those which are given for
        Yenus in the above Table.              Only in this case we must bear in mind that,
        owing     to  the  eccentricity   of  Mercury's orbit, this planet will sometimes take
        a longer,      and sometimes a shorter time to go from one configuration                        to
        another.        Thus, for instance, we have
                              Mercury = Earth+              0° on March 24, 1854 ;
                              Mercurj =Earth + 90° on May 6, 1854 ;
                        and Mercury = Earth + 180° on May 29, 1854.
        We should therefore take the observations between April 15, 1854, and
         May 18, 1854, as representing the behaviour of sun-spots due to a position
         of Mercury 90° before the Earth, and so on for other cases.                     The following
        Table has been constructed on               this principle, and it may be regarded as ex
        hibiting for Mercury precisely what the above Table exhibited for Venus : —

          9.  If we  now examine the two Tables for the planets Venus and Mercury,
      we shall find in them indications of a behaviour of sun-spots appearing to
      have reference to the positions of these planets, and which seems to be of
      the same nature for both.              This behaviour may be characterized as follows :
      — the    average size of a spot would appear to attain its maximum on that
      side of the sun which is turned away from Venus or from Mercury, and to
      have its minimum in the neighbourhood of Venus or of Mercury.
          10. The apparent behaviour is so decided with regard to Venus, that the
      whole body of observations will bear to be split up into two parts, namely
      Carrington's series and the Kew series, in each of which it is distinctly
      manifest.     The following            treatment will serve    to render    this effect more
      visible to the eye.
          In Table II., column (A) (Venus = Earth + 0°), we have ten final num
      bers denoting the behaviour of a spot of average area = 1000 at ten central
      longitudes as follows: +54 + 42 + 23—4—30 — 61—49 — 25+1+49.
          Let us take the mean of the first and second of these, the mean of the
      second and third, and so on, and we get the following nine numbers : —
                           + 48 + 32+10-17-45-55-37-12                      + 25.
          Performing the        same operation once more, we obtain the            following eight
      numbers, corresponding to the eight central longitudes                  : —

       11.   If we now refer to the Tnble for Jupiter, we find that we cannot
   detect the same kind of behaviour that we did in the case of Venus and
   Mercury.        We cannot say that such a behaviour does not exist with refer
   ence to this planet ; but, if it does, it is to such an extent that the obser
   vations at our disposal have not enabled us to detect it.
       1 2. The following       evidence from a different point of view goes to con
   firm the results we have now obtained.                  We might expect, if there really is
   a behaviour of sun-spots depending upon the position of Venus, and of the
   nature herein stated, that the average area of a spot as it passes the central
   longitude of the disk ought to be greatest when Venus is 180° from the
   earth, and least when Venus and the Earth are together, and the same
    ought to hold for Mercury and for Jupiter, if these planets have any in
    fluence.     Taking the mean of the four central areas as giving the best
    value of the area of a spot as it passes the centre, we have for Venus the
    following results : —
        Mean of four central         areas —
                                  (A)        (B)          (C)         (D)

    and the number of groups for these are as follows                  : —

    hence the mean area of one group             will be —
                                    195       217          307           183
    from which we get (A) =195; mean of (B) and (D)                              = 200; (C) = 307;
    that is to say, A is least, and C is greatest.
       Doing the    same    in the    case  of Mercury,        we get
                  (A) = 204;       mean    of (B) and (D) = 21 7; (C)=246;
   and finally, doing the same           in the case of Jupiter, we get
                 (A) =185;        mean    of (B) and (D) = 207            ;  (C)=282:
   it  thus appears that in all these cases the same order is preserved.
        13. We leave it to others to remark upon the nature and strength of the

 evidence now deduced as to a connexion of some sort between tbe behaviour
 of sun-spots and the positions of the planets Venus and Mercury. We
 think, however, it must be allowed, that the investigation is one of interest
 and importance, and we trust that arrangements may be made for the
 systematic continuance of solar observations in such localities as will ensure
 to us a daily picture of the sun's disk.
    The influence of blank days in diminishing the value of a series of sun-
 observations is very manifest.      We have been able to record the behaviour
 across the sun's disk of 421 groups of Carrington's series out of a total
 number of 885 groups, and we have been able to record the same behaviour
 for 373 out of 544 groups observed at Kew.         Thus, out of a total of 1429
 groups, we have only been able to record the behaviour of 794.           Nor are
 the records which we have obtained so perfect as we could wish, on account
 of blank days, which make interpolations necessary.           It is therefore  of
 much importance for the future of such researches          as the present,   that
 there should be several observing-stations so placed that we may reckon on
 having at least a daily picture of the sun's disk.
    It will  be easily seen that such observations are very different from ex
periments, which may be multiplied ad libitum ; for in this case Nature
 gives us in a year or in ten years a certain amount of information, and no
more, while it depends upon ourselves to make a good use of the informa
tion which she affords.
    It is already universally   acknowledged that we ought to make the best
possible use of the few precious moments of a total eclipse ; but such ob
 servations must necessarily be incomplete unless they are followed up by
the equally important,     if more laborious, task of recording the sun's surface
from day to day.
III. " The      Decomposition of Water by Zinc in conjunction with
       a more Negative Metal."               By J. H. Gladstone, Ph.D.,
       F.R.S., and Alfred Tribe, F.C.S.                Eeceived     February 8,
       1872.
    Pure zinc   is incapable  of decomposing pure water, even at 100° C, but
at a considerably higher temperature it is known to combine with its
oxygen.      Davy exposed pure water for two days to the action of a pile of
silver   and zinc plates, separated only by pasteboard, without obtaining
any hydrogen ; Buff, however, has shown that a very minute trace of gas
can be formed at the ordinary temperature by a pair of zinc and pla
tinum plates.
    During   a series of experiments, of which we have already published an
instalment, it occurred to us to ascertain whether by bringing the two
metals closer together, and so increasing the electrical tension of the liquid,
we could effect the same combination of zinc with oxygen at the ordinary
temperature which takes place without the second metal at a very high

   temperature.       Thin sheets of zinc and copper were hammered together
   and placed in a bottle filled with distilled water.           Small bubbles of gas
   were formed.       The experiment, however, was tried in a more perfect form.
    Some zinc-foil was allowed to remain in a somewhat dilute solution of
   copper    sulphate until its surface was well covered with spongy copper.
   The metals     were thoroughly washed with distilled water, and then they
   were immersed in a bottle of distilled water with a delivery-tube.           Minute
   bubbles of gas quickly made their appearance, which proved to be hy
   drogen, and zinc-oxide was formed.          Two experiments were made quanti
   tatively, the gas being collected and measured at the end of 24 or 48 hours.
   The quantity of gas in cubic centimetres is given in the third and fourth
   columns of the subjoined Table, corrected for temperature and pressure.
   The mean temperature in the second column is simply the mean of the
   maximum and minimum during the period. In experiment A, 33'4 grms.
   of zinc-foil were employed, being 2-6 metres long and 0 05 wide. The
   coils were kept apart by muslin.       In experiment B there was used 1 metre
   of similar foil crumpled up.

      The two experiments have evidently gone on almost pari passu for
  months, the amount of hydrogen evolved gradually diminishing, but show
  ing, at the same time, a certain dependence on the heat of the day.
      Under the microscope the bubbles of gas are seen to form, not on the
  zinc, but among the copper crystals, and sometimes to make their appear
  ance on the glass at some distance off.
      From the position of platinum in the electro-chemical series we antici
 pated that the effect would be still more marked with that metal. in a
 spongy state on the zinc.         It was deposited from the tetrachloride, and,
 of course, thoroughly washed.          There   was only    06  metre of foil, but the
 following quantities of hydrogen were obtained          ; —

    The first action, therefore, was about five times as great as in the case
of the copper, and it diminished more rapidly, doubtless through the zinc
becoming more quickly protected by oxide.
    Lest it might be contended that the free oxygen, usually present in
distilled water, had been the means of starting this action, the experiment
was repeated with water as free from oxygen as could be obtained by boil
ing. One metre of the same zinc-foil, covered with copper, was employed,
and the result was nearly as before, 40 cub. centims. of gas being obtained

taken advantage of to examine the effect of a high temperature.                Without
removing the delivery-tube, the contents of the flask were heated to near
 1 00°  C,  when   1 23'5 cub. centims. of hydrogen were given off in ten minutes.
The apparatus was allowed to cool, with the mouth of the tube under
water, when the production of gas became small again, and after two
                                                                                    days
it was again heated nearly        to the  boiling-point, when it gave off 93-4 cub.
centims. in ten minutes ; after another period of two days it gave 64 . I cub.
centims. and after three days more 132-1 cub. centims. in the first thirty
minutes, 108'4 in the second thirty minutes, 94-3 in the third, and 89-9
in the fourth.
    Iron and lead, under similar circumstances, also decomposed pure water,
and the action of magnesium was greatly increased by conjunction with
copper.      The effect of the more negative metal was the same as would
have been produced by an increase of heat.
    In a practical point of view this experiment may serve as a ready means
of prepnring pure hydrogen ; in a theoretical point of view, its interest
seems to lie in the fact that the dissociation of a binary compound by
means of two metals may take place at infinitesimally                  short distances
when it would not take place where the layer of liquid is enough to offer
resistance to the current, and also in the correlation between this force
and heat*.

    About twelve years have           elapsed    since   I  submitted    to    the Royal So
ciety, partly in conjunction with M.            Cahours, a series of papers* on the re
markable group of phosphorus compounds, the existence of which was first
pointed out by M. Paul Thenard as far back as 18-1G.                        These researches
were devoted to the investigation           of the tertiary and quart ary derivatives
of phosphoretted       hydrogen,       exclusively accessible by the methods then
at our disposal.        The study of the primary and secondary phosphines,
the examination of which promised even more noteworthy results than that
of the bodies then investigated, still remained to be achieved.
    New tasks of life have since that time presented themselves, and                         I have
not been    able   to devote myself         as much      to research     as   in former days.
Nevertheless,    numerous        attempts were made to procure               the primary and
secondary phosphines, which were clearly indicated by theory and partly
even by M. Thenard's early observations.                  For along time, however, these
experiments proved unsuccessful, and it was only in the course of last
summer that I at last discovered an easy method for their production.                              I
may now fairly hope to complete an inquiry, the first part of which the

    I.  Formation of Alcohol Phosphines by        means   of Phosphonium Iodide.
      The starting-point of the new series of researches was a lecture experi
 ment.      Wishing to exhibit to my class the decomposition of phosphoretted
 hydrogen by the spark-current of an induction-coil, I was unable to procure,
  by any of the methods hitherto described, phosphoretted                 hydrogen of
  sufficient purity for this experiment.        I was thus led to select a rather
  unusual substance as a source for phosphoretted hydrogen, viz. the beau
  tiful compound of the latter with hydriodic acid, generally designated as
  phosphonium iodide.        This substance, formerly accessible only with diffi
 culty, may now be easily prepared in any quantity.               If a slow stream of
 water, or better of potash or soda, be allowed, by means of a dropping-tube,
  to flow into a small vessel containing phosphonium iodide, a regular current
  of perfectly pure phosphoretted hydrogen is evolved, which may at once be
 introduced into a eudiometer provided with spark-wires, and be submitted
 to experiment.       With the first spark that passes, a brown cloud of finely
  divided phosphorus appears in the eudiometer, lining gradually the in
 side of the tube.       After the lapse of five minutes, two volumes of phos
 phoretted hydrogen have become expanded into three volumes of pure
 hydrogen gas.
     The facility with which phosphonium iodide is thus seen to split up
 into its constituents, hydriodic acid and phosphoretted hydrogen, led me
 to think that this body might be made available for the preparation of the
 compounds I had so long endeavoured to obtain.                  Two different pro
 cesses suggested themselves, both aiming at a reproduction of 'he con
 ditions under which, as      I have shown now more than twenty years ago*,
the alcohol derivatives of ammonia are readily obtained.             For this purpose
it   was   necessary to disengage phosphoretted hydrogen in the presence of
an alcohol iodide under pressure.         This could be easily accomplished by
submitting      a mixture of an alcohol iodide and phosphonium iodide in
sealed vessels to the action     of an agent (such as water or a metallic       oxide,
zinc oxide for instance), slowly liberating the phosphoretted hydrogen from
the iodide. But this process appeared to be capable of a further simplifica
tion.     Instead of withdrawing the hydriodic acid in the phosphonium iodide
from the reaction by means of water or a metallic oxide, it seemed worth trying
to utilize this acid in the production of the very alcohol iodide to be acted
upon by phosphoretted hydrogen ; and the question arose whether this
result might not be readily attained by decomposing under appropriate
circumstances the phosphonium iodide by the alcohols themselves.
     These several   anticipations have been fully confirmed by experiment.
Both processes yield alcoholic phosphines easily and copiously ; and, re
markably enough, whilst the former (action of alcohol iodide upon phos
phonium iodide) gives rise to the formation of exclusively the primary and
secondary phosphines       I had so long endeavoured to produce, the secondary
process (action of the alcohols upon phosphonium iodide) furnishes only the

tertiary phosphines and the quartary phosphonium compounds previously
known, but which may be much more easily and plentifully obtained by
the new method. Phosphonium iodide has thus become a general agent for
the  production of the alcohol derivatives of phosphoretted hydrogen.
   The formation of the several groups of phosphines by means of phos
phonium iodide is represented by the following equations, in which the
reaction is assumed to be accomplished in the. methyl series : — •

     II. Primary and Secondary Methylic Derivatives of Phosphoretted
                                    Hydrogen.
    Owing to the superior interest attached to the monocarbon compounds,
I  was induced, in the first place, to test the new reactions in the methyl
series.
    Phosphonium iodide, methylic iodide, and zinc oxide act upon one an
other with remarkable facility. Two molecules of each of the iodides anj
one molecule of zinc oxide were found to be appropriate proportions ; the
ordinary zinc-white of commerce may be employed.
    Since it was desirable to procure at once the new compounds in sufficient
quantity for   a thorough  examination, the digestion-tubes received consider
able charges.     If these tubes have a capacity of from 120 to 150 cubic
centims., 70 or 80 grms. of the agents involved in the process may be di
gested without danger.       It is not, however, desirable to pass these limits.
The compound first introduced        is the phosphonium     iodide, then follows
the zinc oxide, which is compressed into a solid layer in order to prevent
the methyl iodide, lastly poured in, rapidly to come in contact with the
phosphonium compound.           In the presence of zinc oxide the two iodides
act upon each other even at the common temperature ; and without the
 precaution just indicated, it would be difficult to draw out and seal the tubes.
 Before being heated, the tubes must be strongly agitated in order to produce
 a thorough   mixture of the three substances.      As regards the digestion, I
 have been often satisfied to work at    the temperature of boiling water; after
 six or eight hours' exposure in a water- bath, the transformation is gene
rally complete.     If the tubes be heated to 150° in an air-bath, not more
 than four hours are required.      On cooling, the digestion-tubes are found to
 contain a white crystalline solid ; they invariably hold a good deal of com
 pressed gas, so that some precaution is necessary in opening them before
 the blowpipe.     The gases generally issue with a loud report and a long

flame   explosions, however, are but rarely met with. The proportions of
        ;
the charge are so selected, that supposing the reaction to be complete, no
other products except methylphosphonium iodide and zinc iodide should be
produced . But the presence of some unchanged phosphonium iodide together
with the escape of its constituents, more especially of phosphoretted hy
drogen, prove at once that compounds more highly methylated must be
formed.               shows, however, that monomethyl- and dimethyl-
                 Experiment
phosphine exclusively are generated.     These two substances are easily
separated from the crude product of the reaction, which, by means of a
bent wire, may be removed in one piece from the tube.
   The separation of monomethylphosphine        and dimethylphosphine    and
the preparation of the two bodies in a state of purity are based upon
the observation that the salts of the former base are easily and thoroughly
decomposed by water, whilst those of dimethylphosphine,       more especially
in the presence of free acid, may be considerably diluted without undergoing
any change, but are immediately decomposed by addition of a fixed alkali.
The crude product of the reaction is therefore consecutively treated with
water and strong alkali, the former disengaging the methylphosphine,
which, being gaseous, is collected in concentrated hydriodic acid, the latter
liberating the dimethylatedphosphine, which, being liquid at the common
temperature, may be readily condensed by an appropriate cooler.     The
two bodies being powerfully acted upon by the oxygen of the air, the
whole process is to be conducted in an apparatus filled with hydrogen.

   Methylphosphine             is a colourless transparent gas     of a most overwhelming
odour.
  Both by cooling and by pressure the gas may be condensed into a colour
less liquid floating upon water, and boiling from platinum at —14° under
a pressure of 0-/585 metre.    The experiment was made with from 60 to
70 grms. of methylphosphine condensed in one operation, the boiling-point
remaining constant till the last drop had distilled.    In studying the be
haviour of the new gas under the influence of increased pressure, I have
availed myself of the beautiful compression-apparatus       constructed by
Gustav          Magnus.      At   0°   1-J   atmosphere was sufficient to start the lique
faction     ;   under   a   pressure of      2
                                             J  atmospheres the gas was perfectly liquid,
its purity being thus satisfactorily established.  At 10° liquefaction com

                                        a

 soda which decomposed the salt.         By observing the volume of the gas dis
 engaged, all the data for fixing        the volume-weight were given.          In this
 manner the number 24-35 was found, the theoretical value being 24.
    Methylphosphine is nearly insoluble in water ; if the water contain air,
part of the    gas disappears,      but only in consequence of oxidation, clearly
indicated by the formation of white clouds.            If the gas stand over water
into which air can penetrate from without, the gas after some time is per
fectly absorbed.        Methylphosphine      gas is rather  soluble in alcohol even
at the ordinary temperature, but more especially at temperatures approach
ing its point of liquefaction ; at 0° one volume of alcohol of 95 per cent, ab
sorbs not less than twenty volumes. At the ordinary temperature ether dis
solves but little   ;  the solveut power increases, however, rapidly by cooling
the liquid.     At   0° one volume of ether is capable of dissolving seventy
volumes of methylphosphine.
    The methylated phosphorus base attracts oxygen with great avidity ; on
mixing the gas with air, white clouds are formed at once ; but detonation
does not take place at the common temperature.               If methylphosphine be
required of absolute purity, the gas must be allowed to escape from the
apparatus     until a small quantity collected over mercury remains perfectly
transparent.      The nature of the more immediate products of oxidation
remains* to be investigated.           When gently heated in contact with air,
methylphosphine         takes fire.   A glowing match, and even a glass rod just
 heated   to  scarcely   visible  redness,  at once inflame the gas.        In contact
 with chlorine     and bromine or nitric vapours, it burns          with   a  brilliant
 flame.
    By its union with acids, methylphosphine          gives rise to a series of well-
 defined salts distinguished by the remarkable property of being decomposed
 by water.     On this property is based the preparation of the body in a state
 of purity.    The salts bleach vegetal colours like chlorine.
    Of  the salts, two only have as yet been more closely examined, the chlor-
 hydrate and the iodhydrate.
    Chlorhydrate. — If a current of methylphosphine gas be conducted into
 strong fuming hydrochloric acid, it is perfectly absorbed ; no crystals,
 however,    are separated     ; but on mixing the two gases, they are at once
 condensed to beautiful, well-formed,       four-sided plates.   In certain reactions
with organic chlorides, which are accomplished in ethereal solution, and
 which I hope to describe more minutely to the Society hereafter, the salt is
 deposited in splendid large four-sided tables, often having a centimetre in
 diameter.      The chlorhydrate is so volatile that it passes over even
 with the vapour of ether. Analysis was performed by the method often
 adopted for demonstrating the composition of sal-ammoniac in lectures.
 By allowing equal volumes of methylphosphine and hydrochloric gases to
 meet over mercury, both entirely disappear with formation of a crystalline
 deposit.    Hence the Bait contains
                              CHCPC1=(CH3)H2P, HCI.

   Iodhydrate. — Of nil the salts of the base, this is the one most readily
obtained ; it separates in bulky crystals when a current of methylphosphine
is passed into the most concentrated iodhydric acid.      If a solution of the
gas  in somewhat  less concentrated iodhydric acid be  mixed  with ether, the
whole liquid solidifies to a mass of iridescent plates.     By washing with
ether, pressing, and sublimation in a current of dry hydrogen, the salt may
be readily obtained in a state of purity.  Analysis led to the formula

   With carbonic acid and sulphuretted hydrogen methylphosphine gas

phosphine, give rise to the formation of new compounds, which will be the
subject of special communication.

still   some discrepancies to be explained, such as the observation

appear to have prevented M. Thenard from pursuing his researches, have
hitherto deterred chemists from entering more thoroughly into the
investigation of this remarkable compound.    By the method described
in this paper, methylphosphine may be readily and abundantly obtained in
a   state   of perfect purity,          so that     its further examination will present no
difficulty.

    The method of preparing         dimethylphosphine     has been already stated.
It is a transparent colourless liquid, which, when protected from the atmo
sphere, may he preserved without change.               It is lighter than water, in
which it is insoluble ; alcohol and ether, on the other hand, dissolve it
with facility. Its boiling-point is 25°.
    Dimethylphosphine is remarkable for the avidity with which it attracts
oxvgen, and which is infinitely superior to that of the monomethylated
base.      In contact with the air, it instantaneously takes fire and burns with
a powerfully luminous phosphorus flame.            If the hydrogen atmosphere in
which it is prepared contain only traces of air, the presence of which is
at once indicated by the formation of white fumes, violent and by no
means dangerless explosions are occasionally experienced in working              with
this compound,      even  if great care be employed.
    Dimethylphosphine        easily unites with acids ; all the salts are exceedingly
soluble. The solution of the chlorhydrate furnishes with platinum per-
chloride a fine crystalline salt. The base also unites with sulphur and
carbon bisulphide.       The compounds thus formed are not yet investigated ;
but it may     even  now   be remarked that they essentially differ from those
produced by trimethylphosphine ; more especially in the deportment of the
two    bases  with carbon bisulphide, a marked discrepancy is observed. Di
methylphosphine in this case produces no crystalline compound similar to
those which are formed by the tertiary phosphines ; so that the absence of
 trimethylphosphine among the products of the action of methyl iodide on
 phosphonium      iodide may be readily demonstrated.
    The inflammability and the low boiling-point of dimethylphosphine
 render it difficult to work with this body except in the midst of winter.
 The examination of its numerous products of decomposition, which pro
 mises to be fruitful in results, is therefore as yet but little advanced.
 Hitherto I have studied somewhat more in detail only the products of
 oxidation of the methyl bases, which I beg leave to describe to the
 Society in a special paper.
            III. Products of Oxidation of the Methylated         Phosphines.
    When determining phosphorus in several substances which in the course
 of the new researches on the phosphines had to be examined, it was found
 that these bodies, and especially the members of the methyl series, resist
 with remarkable energy the action of even the most powerful oxidizing
 agents.
     If  the phosphoretted bodies were heated according to the method of
 Carius, it happened sometimes, especially when the digestion in sealed tubes
 was conducted according to the earlier directions with nitric acid not per

228           Dr. A. W. Hofmann          on the   Phosphorus Bases.       [Mar. 2],
fectly concentrated and at moderate temperatures, that the liquid taken from
the tube and treated in an appropriate manner with magnesian salts gave
no precipitate whatever.       If, on the other hand, strongest fuming nitric
acid be employed at high temperatures, phosphoric acid is certainly formed ;
but only when the reaction takes place at the very extreme temperatures
recommended by Carius * in his more recent paper, is the whole quantity
of phosphorus    made precipitable     by magnesian salts.
   It appeared of interest to submit to a closer examination the products of
oxidation that are formed by the action of nitric acid on the primary and
secondary phosphines at moderate temperatures, more especially since some
of these bodies have probably passed already through the hands of M.
Paul Thenard when engaged in his remarkable but, unfortunately, unfinished
researches on this subject. Experiment showed that nitric acid gives rise to
new acids of great stability and comparatively littlevolatility, and thus avery
simple method of estimating phosphorus in this whole group of compounds
at once suggested itself.     It was only necessary to dissolve the substance
under examination, according to circumstances, either in strong hydrochloric
or in nitric acid, to mix the liquid slowly with fuming nitric acid, to treat the
solution after evaporation with excess of sodium carbonate, and finally to
dry and fuse the mass in a porcelain crucible ; in this way the oxidation
of the phosphorus is easily and perfectly accomplished. All the phosphorus
estimations necessary in these researches have been performed in this
manner.
                      Experiments     in the Methyl Series.
   Monomethylphosphinic      acid.  — In order    to obtain   the product of oxida
tion of methylphosphine in appropriate quantity, a slow stream of the gas
was directed into fuming nitric acid.         It would have been unnecessary in
this case to employ the phosphine gas in a state of purity j it was suffi
cient to make use of the methylphosphine as it is delivered from the crude
product of the action of methyl iodide on phosphonium iodide and zinc oxide
by treatment with water.         This  gas always     contains small quantities of
phosphoretted hydrogen,       which    ignite  in   contact  with the fuming acid,
and easily give rise to small explosions.       As the methylphosphine becomes
purer, these become more seldom and at last quite cease.                 Invariably,
however, in consequence of these detonations, more or less phosphoric acid
is found amongst the products of oxidation.
   To get rid of the nitric acid, the solution is       several times evaporated to
dryness on a water- bath, the residue dissolved in water, and the liquid
boiled with lead oxide for the purpose of separating the phosphoric acid ;
a lead-salt is thus formed which is insoluble in water but dissolves in acetic
acid, leaving an appreciable residue of lead phosphate.             This solution is
freed from lead by means of sulphuretted hydrogen, and from acetic acid by
repeatedly evaporating, when the new body remains as an oily liquid which,
on cooling, solidifies to a crystalline mass resembling            spermaceti.  The

 crystals thus produced, which could not be obtained in distinct forms,         are
 hygroscopic but not deliquescent.         They readily dissolve in water, the   so
 lution restoring litmus red to blue, and possessing, moreover, an agreeable
 sour taste.    They are also soluble in alcohol, less so in ether j the alcoholic
 solution, however, is not precipitated by ether.       The stability of this body
is quite remarkable     ; that it is not altered by fuming   nitric acid is evident
from the manner of its preparation ; but even by repeated evaporation with
aqua regia not the slightest change is produced.
   The new compound melts at 105° C. ; it is volatilized, at least for the
greater part, without decomposition ; when strongly heated, it evolves an
inflammable gas, a small residue of phosphoric acid mixed with more or
less carbon remaining behind.
   Analysis showed that methylphosphine, by treatment with nitric acid,
fixes three atoms of oxygen, the composition of the new body being repre-
lented by the formula
                             CH3P03=(CH3)HaP03.
   The new substance is a well-marked acid ; I will designate it by the
name placed at the head of the paragraph, i. e. monomethytphosphinic acid,
or more briefly methylphosphinic          acid.  It forms two series of salts, the
composition of which is represented by the formula:
                      (CII,)HMPO,         and (CH:I) M, P03.
   The primary (acid) salts are produced by the action of metallic car
 bonates, or by incomplete saturation with the free bases.           For the pre
paration of the secondary (neutral) salts, the acid must be completely satu
rated by the free bases ; they can, however, also be obtained by means of
carbonates, if the latter, as is the case with the alkaline carbonates, are
capable of fixing the carbonic acid which is liberated.
   The primary methylphosphinates have an acid, the secondary salts an
alkaline reaction ; these latter are soluble and only little inclined to crys
tallize.   The ammonium-salts lose ammonia by evaporation, leaving the
acid behind.      Amongst the metallic salts, especially the primary ones,
many are insoluble, or soluble only with difficulty.
   Silver Methylphosphinate.      — If   the acid be saturated with silver oxide
and the solution evaporated to the consistence of a syrup, the primary salt
separates from the solution in beautiful white needles, which, in contact
with water and even with alcohol, are readily converted into the secondary
salt with separation of the free acid.
   The salt obtained by means of silver oxide and purified by washing with
water gave numbers which showed that it consisted of the nearly pure
secondary compound.         In order to obtain this salt quite pure, the solution
of the acid    was  accurately neutralized by ammonia and precipitated by
silver nitrate.    It is a white amorphous precipitate, nearly insoluble in
water, having the composition
                                    CH.Ag-.PO,.
   Lead Methylphosphinate.       —   If an aqueous solution of methylpho3phinic

 230       Dr. A. W. Hofmann         on the  Phosphorus Bases.        [Mar. 21,
 acid be boiled with an insufficient quantity of lead oxide, the primary and
 secondary salt are formed at the same time ; the latter as a white amor
phous heavy powder which collects at the bottom of the hot liquid, the
former crystallizing from the liquid as it cools in beautiful, long, lustrous,
white needles.      On washing with water, the salt is decomposed like the
silver compound, gradually forming the secondary salt and free acid ;
indeed analysis of the washed crystals gave numbers lying between those
required for the primary and secondary salts.        The secondary salt may be
 obtained, however, in a state of purity if the barium-salt presently to be
described be decomposed by lead acetate.          It is a precipitate almost  in
 soluble in water, but soluble in acetic acid j its composition is
         (CH3) Pb POa, or perhaps more correctly (CH3)2 Pb2P206.
    Barium Methylphosphinate          This is obtained by boiling the acid with
barium carbonate, evaporating the solution to the consistence of a syrup,
and precipitating by alcohol.      It is a white powder consisting of micro
scopic needles easily soluble in water.      The aqueous solution, even on slow
evaporation, yields no crystals, but dries to a gummy mass.             Analysis
showed the salt to be the primary compound
                       C2 H8 Ba P2 06
                                       = (CH3)2 H2 Ba   P2 08.
    Methylphosphinic acid has the      same composition as    methylphosphorous
acid, but  it is only necessary to compare the above     statements with what is
known respecting the latter compound in order to see that they constitute
two absolutely different bodies.      Methylphosphorous acid is an uncrystal-
lizable ephemeral compound, being decomposed, even at a gentle heat, into
 phosphorous acid and methyl alcohol ; it cannot possibly be mistaken for the
extremely stable derivative of methylphosphine, which may even be distilled
without undergoing any decomposition.
    Dimethylphosphinic Acid. — By this name I designate an acid which is
produced by the action of nitric acid on the secondary methyl base.            In
preparing this body it is convenient to start from the chlorhydrate of dime-
thylphosphine.       A solution of this salt is readily obtained when the crude
product of the action of phosphonium iodide on methyl iodide, after the ex
pulsion of methylphosphine        by water, is distilled with alkali, the dime-
thylphosphine     thus  disengaged being passed into hydrochloric acid.   If this
solution he mixed with fuming nitric acid, a powerful reaction ensues, causin. p
the liquid to boil, and fumes of nitrous acid copiously to be evolved.         In
order to free the strongly acid solution from nitric acid, it is repeatedly
evaporated with hydrochloric acid, and then heated for some time on the
water-bath to expel as far as possible also this latter acid.       To get rid of
the last traces of hydrochloric acid, the liquid is saturated with silver oxide
and the solution, filtered from the silver chloride, precipitated by sulphu
retted hydrogen.       The solution again evaporated on the water-bath gra
dually solidifies to a white paraffine-like mass of crystals, which, in contact
with the air, are apt to become slightly brown ; they are very soluble in

 1872.]         Dr. A. W. Hofmann        on the  Phosphorus Bases.             231
 water,  alcohol, and ether.    These solutions have a decidedly acid reaction.
 The crystals melt at 76° ; at a higher temperature they are volatilized
 without decomposition;       indeed the distilled product shows the same
 melting-point as the undistilled acid.         Dimethylphosphinic acid is less
suitable for analysis than the mono-compound.               It appeared sufficient
to fix its composition by the examination of the silver-salt.         This analysis
proved the acid to be represented by the formula
                           C3H7PO=(CH3)aHP02.
It is thus   seen that dimethylphosphine,      when treated with nitric acid, fixes
not   three atoms of oxygen, like the monomethylated base, but only two.
Dimethylphosphinic acid forms only one series of salts, having the general
formula
                          02H,MPO1-(CH,)JMPOs.
    Silver Dimethylphosphinate. — This salt is obtained         by saturating the
crude acid still retaining hydrochloric acid with silver oxide, evaporating the
filtered solution, and precipitating the concentrated liquid with absolute
alcohol.     The salt presents itself in the form of fine felted white needles
extremely soluble in water, but very slightly so in ether and absolute
alcohol.     Its composition  is represented by the formula
                         C2H6AgPOa=(CH3)aAgP02.
    Barium Dimethylphosphinate. — By boiling the solution of the pure acid
with an excess of precipitated barium carbonate, a neutral liquid is obtained,
which, when evaporated on the water-bath, dries up to a transparent var
 nish.   In contact with   a hard body this clear varnish becomes      opaque, and
shows inclination to crystallize.     It  is soluble also in alcohol.
     Lead Dimethylphosphinate. — The preparation is conducted in the same
 manner as that of the barium salt, only that oxide instead of carbonate is
 employed.      In its properties it resembles the barium salt : the varnish
 dissolves  in a small quantity of water ; the solution becomes turbid, how
 ever, by the addition of a larger quantity.         Several lead determinations
 showed excess of lead above that contained in the normal dimethylphos
 phinate, a result which cannot surprise if the tendency of lead to form
 basic salts and the absence of all properties warranting the purity of the
compound be considered.
    It is of some interest to compare the behaviour of phosphoretted hydro
 gen under the influence of powerful oxidizing agents with that of its several
 methylated substitution-products.       Phosphoretted hydrogen, on treatment
 with concentrated nitric acid, fixes four atoms of oxygen, becoming con
 verted into iribasic orthophosphoric acid ; methylphosphine similarly treated
 combines with only three atoms of oxygen, forming dibasic methylphos-
 phinic acid.     Under the same conditions dimethylphosphine appropriates
 not more than two atoms, giving rise to monobasic dimethylphosphinic acid.
 Lastly, trimetbylphosphine      fixes but one atom of oxygen, the product of
 the reaction being trimethylphosphine        oxide, observed some years ago by
                                                                      s 2

    IV.   Primary and Secondary Ethylic Derivatives of Phosphoretted
                                    Hydrogen.
  After what has been elicited by the investigation of the methyl compounds,
there could  be but little doubt as to the phenomena to be observed by re
peating the  experiments in the ethyl series. Nevertheless the study of the
ethyl compounds presented an interest of its own. In the first place, it
was desirable experimentally to generalize the new method by applying it
to different groups ; again the properties likely to be possessed by the ethyl-
phosphines, and more particularly their higher boiling-points, appeared to
promise that the experimental difficulties of this inquiry would be materially
diminished by working in the ethyl series.
    The formation of the ethylphosphines by means of ethyl iodide, phospho-
 aium iodide, and zinc oxide takes place with the same facility and precision
as that of the methylated compounds.         The reaction, however, proceeds
but slowly at the temperature of boiling water. Exposure of the tubes to
a temperature between 140° and 150° C. for six or eight hours is sufficient
for the transformation.     The product of the reaction in this case, exactly as
 in that of the methyl series, contains the primary and secondary bases only.
Their separation and preparation in a state of purity is carried out in exactly
 the same manner as that of the corresponding methyl compounds.

are, however, obviously,     in  consequence    of the volatility and oxidability of
the compound, far less persistent. The vapour of ethylphosphine bleaches
cork like chlorine ; very peculiar, too, is its action on caoutchouc, which in
contact with it becomes translucent, losing its elasticity.       Chlorine, bromine,
and nitric acid inflame the compound.             Ethylphosphine combines with
Bulphur    and   carbon  bisulphide, though far less energetically than tri-
ethylphosphine ; nor are the compounds thus produced crystalline, like the
corresponding derivative of triethylphosphine ; as yet they are but im
perfectly studied.
    Like the monomethylated base, ethylphosphine unites with chlor-, brom-,
and iodhydric acids to saline compounds.               The solution of the chlor-
hydrate yields with platinum perchloride a double salt, crystallizing in
fine crimson-red needles, which resemble freshly prepared chromic acid.
The most beautiful salt of ethylphosphine is the iodhydrate.                 It forms
white four-sided tables, which, in a current of hydrogen, may be sublimed
even at the temperature of boiling water.            The aspect of the substance
forcibly recalls that of ordinary sal ammoniac.             Analysis showed       that
this salt possesses the composition assigned to it by theory, viz. : —
                        C,H8PI = (C2H5)H2P.HI.
    The iodhydrate easily dissolves in water, but not without being entirely
 decomposed.      In dry air the crystals of the salt are permanent ; but even
when breathed upon they are altered, the decomposition being indicated
by the powerful odour emanating from the salt, which, when dry, is
perfectly inodorous.     When a crystal is thrown upon water, it is seen to
 disappear with evolution of gas.          Alcohol dissolves the iodhydrate, but
only with partial decomposition ; in ether it is insoluble.            The only sol
vent in which the salt was found to be soluble, though likewise but
sparingly, is concentrated iodhydric acid.          Addition of ether to this solu
tion  causes the salt to separate     in large, well-formed   tables, having often a
length  of  1  centimetre  ;   they are generally very thin, their surface pre

netrating and most persistent, very different from that of ethylphosphine,
distantly resembling that of triethylphosphine.             The diethylated com
pound attracts oxygen with far more energy than the primary base ; and
more than once have I seen this compound bursting into flame on opening
a bottle.   Diethvlphosphine combines with sulphur and carbon bisulphide ;
these combinations, like those of the monoethylated base, are liquids.

     The secondary phosphines readily dissolve in acids. The salts, as far as
  my experience goes, are difficult to crystallize, with the exception of the
  iodhydrate.     The solution of the chlorhydrate gives, with platinum per-
  chloride, a fine platinum salt, crystallizing in orange-red prisms, whicli are,
  however, easily changed.       It is interesting to perceive that the salts of
  diethylphosphine     resist the action of water, whilst those of the mono-
 ethylated base are readily decomposed ; the deportment of the phosphines
 is thus seen to afford an instructive illustration of the increased basicity
 the phosphoretted     molecule acquires with the number of ethyl       groups   it
 has incorporated.
   Products of Oxidation      of the Primary    and Secondary  Ethylphosphines.
    It  is my intention   to study in detail the products of oxidation of ethyl-
and diethylphosphine,        which, according to special circumstances, appear
to vary    to a considerable extent.       Hitherto I have examined only the
terminal compounds.         These are perfectly analogous to the products simi
larly obtained from the methylated bases ; they need not therefore be more
than cursorily mentioned.
    Ethylphosphinic Acid. — Preparation, appearance, and properties of the
body obtained by the action of nitric acid upon ethylphosphine           resemble
in every respect the acid similarly obtained from methylphosphine,            and
described in a previous communication (comp. p. 228).            The ethyl com
pound is likewise exceedingly soluble in water, alcohol, and ether ; it fuses
at 44°, and may be distilled without decomposition.          The formula
                           C2 H7 PO,
                                       = (C, H.) H2 P03
was    fixed by the analysis of a silver-salt.     This salt was formed by satu
rating the free acid partially with silver oxide, and precipitating the con
centrated liquid by alcohol.        It is an amorphous, yellowish powder, in
soluble in water and alcohol, the composition of which is represented by
the formula

    Diethylphosphinic Acid. — On treating diethylphosphine             with nitric
acid, all the phenomena present themselves which are observed in the
corresponding experiment in the methyl series.          The acid produced, how
ever, has been observed as yet in the liquid state only ; it refuses to solidify
even at a temperature of — 25°.         The composition of the acid,
                         C4  H„   PO3  = (C, HS), H P03,
was    established  by the analysis    of a silver compound.      The latter was
obtained by nearly neutralizing the acid by silver oxide and precipitating
the evaporated liquid by alcohol.        The silver diethylphosphinate    contains
                      C4II10AgPO3 = (C2H3)2AgPO2.
The products       of oxidation of the ethylated phosphorus bases are thus
proved to be perfectly analogous to the group of methyl bodies previously
described (p. 232), as seen by glancing at the following Table :—

                              V. Aromatic       Phosphines.
   The well-defined results which the easy and handy use of phosphonium
iodide, as a source of phosphorus compounds, has furnished in the methyl
and ethyl series, and, as I shortly intend to communicate to the Society,
also in the propyl, butyl, and amyl series, very naturally created the wish
of extending these researches also to the aromatic phosphines.                     It ap
peared especially worthy          of interest to study an aniline with phos
phorus in the place of nitrogen, — in other terms, phenyl phosphine and,
indeed, the whole series of phenylated phosphorus bases.                I have instituted
many experiments       in the  hope    of  obtaining   these   bodies,  but as yet with
out success.     Considering the remarkable inactivity of benzol chloride and
analogous benzol compounds under the influence of ammonia, I could
scarcely hope to form phenylphosphine              by acting on phosphonium iodide
with benzol chloride.        Nevertheless the experiment was made; but, al
though    tried   under varying conditions,        I   have not    been   able to observe
the generation of phosphorus bases in this process. The benzol chloride is
reduced to benzol, which itself is then no further changed, even by raising the
temperature, as the interesting researches of M. Baeyer have already proved.
    But  even   the action of phosphonium            iodide on phenol, from which,
looking   at the experience gathered in the methyl and ethyl series, I was
fairly entitled to hope that at least the tertiary and quartary compounds
would emerge, gave rise to changes very different from those anticipated.
The singular phosphorus         bodies generated in this reaction claim further
examination.      New processes, different from those hitherto followed, must
 therefore be devised for the production of phenylphosphine.
    Exactly as in the formation of phenylphosphine,               I have hitherto failed
in that of phosphoretted        toluidine.     On the other hand,        the preparation
of  a phosphorus     base corresponding       to benzylamine     presents no difficulty.
Considering     that   benzyl   chloride    is easily converted into benzylamine by
the action of ammonia         (as the researches of Cannizzaro and Limpricht
have shown),      it could not possibly         be doubted that by causing benzyl

    For the preparation of this body it is not necessary to employ the
 benzyl chloride in its pure state.        It suffices to operate with toluol chlo
rinated whilst hot, which boils between 150° and 180°.                 The substances
acting on one another are employed in the same proportions which, in the
methyl and ethyl series, are known toyield satisfactory results, namely 2 mol.
of benzyl chloride, 2 mol. of phosphonium iodide, and 1 mol. of zinc oxide.
A   digestion   of six hours' duration at 160° is sufficient for the formation of
benzylphosphine.         When the reaction is finished the digestion-tubes con
tain a white mass of crystals, which is generally forced out by the phos-
phoretted      hydrogen escaping when the tubes are opened.                When the
product of the reaction was distilled with the vapour of water, an oily
liquid, heavier than water, possessing an extremely characteristic persis
tent odour, passed over.         This was separated from the water by means of
a separating      funnel, dried by allowing it to stand on caustic potass, and
submitted to fractional distillation in a current of hydrogen.                It com
menced     boiling a few degrees above 100°; the mercury then rose rapidly
to 180°, at which temperature a large quantity of a colourless, powerfully
refractive liquid distilled.      That passing between 180° and 190° was col
lected   apart   from the earlier distillate,     consisting chiefly of toluol (which
is regenerated     from the benzyl chloride by the phosphonium iodide).           The
liquid boiling at 180° is benzylphosphine ; the residue in the retort con
tains dibenzylphosphine       and other products.
    Purified by a second distillation in a current of hydrogen, benzylphosphine
is found to have the constant boiling-point 180°.                In contact with the
air the     aromatic phosphorus         base attracts     oxygen with such avidity
that the thermometer rises to 100° and more, and thick white clouds are
formed.       Benzylphosphine      is insoluble in water, but easily so in alcohol
and ether.      The aromatic phosphorus base shares the characteristic property
of the other primary phosphincs, viz. that of forming a crystallizable iod-
 hydrate.     This is obtained by mixing the phosphine with fuming iodhy-
 dric acid, when it falls as a white and, apparently, amorphous mass. The
 insolubility of the iodine compound presents an easy method of recovering
 any benzylphosphine        that may have passed over in the first distillate
 containing toluol.      The white precipitate of benzylphosphine           iodhydrate
 dissolves   on warming in iodhydric acid, and forms, as the solution cools,
 white   needles, often more than a centimetre long, which, in contact with
 water, are decomposed into the acid and base.                 By washing with dry
 ether and drying in a stream of hydrogen                at 100°, the iodhydrate   may

   easily be obtained in a state of purity for analysis.           In this experiment,
   occasionally, well-formed tables are produced of considerable dimensions
   and great beauty.          The salt has the composition    —
                                C7HI0PI=(C7H7)HaP.HI.
      Benzylphosphine         combines likewise with concentrated chlorhydric and
  bromhydric acids.            I  have not, however, been able to obtain these com
  pounds in crystals.           The chlorhydrate    gives with platinum   perchloride  a
  yellow    insoluble   precipitate.
     Benzylphosphine          is formed according to the equation    —
    2C7 H7    C1+2[H3        P.HIJ    + Zn 0=2[(C7H7)      Ha  P.HI] + Zn   Cla + HaO.
     This equation, however, shows only one phase of the reaction, in which
   at the same time several other substances are formed.

  This compound is found in the liquid remaining in the retort after the
  distillation of benzylphosphine.         By long standing, especially in the presence
 of solid alkali, this fluid solidifies to a soft mass of crystals, which are
 collected on a linen filter, in order to free them, by pressing, as much as
 possible from adhering liquid. The still strongly coloured crystals are
 then dissolved in alcohol and treated with a little animal charcoal.               The
 colourless liquid thus obtained deposits on cooling beautiful white crystals
 of the new compound.               By repeated crystallization from boiling alcohol,
 dibenzylphosphiue          is   obtained in a perfectly pure state.   Thus prepared,
 the phosphine forms large brilliant needles, mostly grouped in stars or glis
 tening tufts, perfectly tasteless and colourless, which are insoluble in water,
 but dissolve, though sparingly, in boiling alcohol.                In ether they are
 nearly insoluble.        The crystals melt at 205° ; at a higher temperature
 they     are  volatilized,     but not without partial decomposition.        With the
 entrance of the second benzyl group, the basic characters, which in the
monobenzylphosphine are still distinctly perceptible, have entirely disap
peared. Dibenzylphosphine does not dissolve in acid, nor have I succeeded
in obtaining a platinum salt. In this respect the aromatic secondary phos
phine essentially differs from the analogous bodies in the ethyl and methyl
series, which are well-marked              bases.   The absence of basic properties
cannot, however, be looked upon as strange, since even in the secondary aro
matic amines we find the tendency to form saline compounds very nearly
effaced.       The difference of dibenzylphosphine            from the corresponding
terms in the methyl             and ethyl series becomes obvious, moreover, by its
behaviour with oxygen ; for whilst dimethyl- and diethylphosphine take
fire on contact with air at the ordinary temperature, oxygen is without
any action, even at an elevated temperature, on the dibenzylated phosphorus

base.     As dibenzylphosphine yields no compounds, I was limited to the
analysis of the body itself.       This analysis led to the formula —
   The formation of dibenzylphosphine           takes place according to the equa
tion —
        2C7HTCl+H,P.HI + ZnO = (C7H,),HP.HI                   + ZuCla+H:iO.
Benzylphosphine        and dibenzylphosphine are not the only phosphoretted
products of the action of benzyl chloride on phosphonium iodide.                 The
mother-liquor of dibenzylphosphine contains yet another phosphorus body.
The idea naturally suggested itself that it might      be tribenzylphosphine   ; but,
notwithstanding many efforts, I have not succeeded in obtaining this com
pound.       The mother-liquor of dibenzylphosphine consists, for the greater
part, of a viscous substance, soluble in alcohol but insoluble in water, which
is precipitated by lead-salts.       This substance tenaciously adheres to a small
quantity     of  a crystallizable  body,  which most probably is no other than
dibenzylphosphine.        All attempts to obtain this glutinous substance (which
appears     to possess   acid properties) in a condition fit for analysis have
hitherto failed.
    In conclusion I may be allowed most warmly to thank Messrs. F. Ho-
brecker and E. Mylius for the untiring perseverance with which they have
(the former in the earlier        stages, the latter more recently)   assisted me in
these researches.

    The    " pellicle "  that forms     on infusions  of organic matter which are
 exposed to the air is composed for the most part of a dense aggregation of
 Bacteria of various sizes and shapes imbedded in a more or less abundant,
 pellucid, gelatinous material.         Very frequently there are also a variable
 number of intermixed Vibriones and more or less characteristic Torulce.
 The Bacteria in this layer are mostly placed vertically to the surface, so
 that an examination of it under the microscope generally reveals the
 appearance of a stratum densely studded with small though tolerably uni
 form granules.        On attempting to remove a portion of this pellicle, it is
 found to constitute a more or less coherent membrane.
     It is now a well-known       fact that when two or more Amoebae chance to
 come into close contact with one another, they may fuse so as to constitute
 a larger individual of the same kind, which afterwards creeps about and
 seizes food as its component parts had previously done.             Such a process
 must be classed under the head of Homogenetic Biocrasis ; for, although

mere fusion, and the product is           similar in kind although necessarily larger
than its components.
    Similar mutual attractions,          however, may he exerted by other living
units when brought into close contact with one another, and the result
may be the formation of an aggregate in which considerable molecular
changes are compelled to take place.             The products resulting from such a
fusion may be quite different from the originally fused units ; whilst they
will differ  at different times according to the precise nature and number of
the units which enter into combination.              Such processes are frequently to
be observed taking place          in various parts of the  " proligerous pellicle."    It
is in this way, in fact, that those phenomena occur which make the name
" proligerous pellicle " suitable for the scum that forms on organic
infusions.      The  processes      themselves come     under the head of Heteroge
netic Biocrasis.
    The first person who actually described the microscopical appearances
characterizing the evolution of higher organisms from the pellicle was M.
Pineau.      This he did in 1845, in a memoir entitled " Recherches sur le
Developpement des Animalcules Infusoires et des Moisissures"*.                      More
precision, however, was given to the subject in 1859, by M. Pouchet, when,
in his ' Heterogenic,' he described the mode of origin of some of the or
ganisms which had formed the objects of Pineau's investigations as well as
of  some different organisms.
    Although     some   of  these observations have not been recorded with all the
 details which     might have been desired, yet I have satisfied myself that
 the statements     made by Pineau and Pouchet are substantially correct. The
 observations of the latter have, moreover, been confirmed by MM. Joly
 and Musset, M. Pennetier, and others.
    Nearly two years       ago   I   described in  '
                                                     Nature'  f the mode of origin of
 certain corpuscular organisms, and of some Fungus-germs, from differen
 tiated portions of the pellicle of hay-infusions.          These observations I have
 since repeatedly confirmed ; and           I now wish to describe other allied pro
 cesses, and    the  means     by   which   I am enabled to obtain, almost at will,
 either animal or vegetal forms from certain embryonal area* which are
produced in the pellicles of similar infusions.
    The characters of the pellicles that form on different hay-infusions of
 the same strength differ notably, according to the temperature of the water
 with which the infusions have been made             ; and, to a less extent, according
to the mean atmospheric temperature to which they are subsequently
exposed.       If the infusion has been prepared with very hot water (140° F.
and upwards), only a thin and somewhat tough pellicle will form, secondary
changes will take place in it very slowly, and they will lead only to the

evolution of products of a certain kind.              When prepared with moderately
hot water (120° F.), or with cold water (60°-7O° F.), the pellicles which
are produced       become     thicker and thicker, and continue for a long time to
be soft and pulpy.           The changes that may take place in a pellicle of the
latter kind are very varied, and they may give rise to a multiplicity of or
ganic forms.
     For  a long time my observations were carried             on upon infusions       made
with hot water, and they were also conducted during the winter months, so
that the secondary changes which I was able to observe in the pellicle were
neither varied nor numerous *. That which is to follow concerning my
own observations has been learned from an investigation of the pellicles
which form on filtered hay infusions prepared both with warm and with
cold water.
     In all   cases, and at whatsoever temperature the infusion may have been
prepared, the earliest change which takes place in the pellicle is such as I
have previously described f.             In certain portions of it (altogether irregular
in size, shape, and distribution) the aggregated Bacteria begin to form
around themselves a certain amount of pellucid gelatinous matter, in which
 they become imbedded. This change may be well seen in pellicles made
with hot water, because such areas continue (more especially when the at
 mospheric      temperature is low) for several days without undergoing much
 alteration.      The Bacteria in them are slightly separated from one another,
 rather larger in size, and irregularly placed with regard to the direction of
 their long axis. Such areas are freely intermixed with other less altered
 portions in which the Bacteria are densely packed, even smaller than na
 tural, and apparently not separated by any pellucid material.                     Any of the
 modified      areas may after a time undergo changes very similar to those
            I described in ' Nature
                                          '
 which                                      as resulting in the production of fungus-
  spores.
      On the other hand, a totally different fate may occasionally await such
 modified areas.         Thus, in .a strong infusion prepared with water at a tem
 perature      of about     120°   F., the pellicle    was   found    to  be abundant     and
  pulpy   ;   and on the second day areas of the kind above described were most
     * During this time    I  was also working at the subject of Archcbiosis, and    I had not
  then ascertained that even in this part of the investigation infusions are more efficacious
  if prepared with moderately hot (120°-1.'30° F.) rather than with very hot water. They
  answer better when made with warm water (at the temperature above named) than with
  cold water, because they can thus be obtained in a more concentrated state. And seeing
  that in this kind of experiment the fluids have afterwards either to be boiled or other
  wise superheated (before or after closure of the flasks), the slight increase in temperature
  during the preparation of     the infusions becomes of less consequence.     But in studying
  Heterogenesis, and with the view of witnessing all the higher changes which may take
  place in a pellicle, the organic infusions or macerations must be made with cold watert
  and subsequently filtered,

 marked and numerous*.            The contained Bacteria very         soon became   notably
 larger   and distinctly       loculated — each      loculus containing two or three
 granules    ; whilst   the jelly-like  material    was  so abundant that every Bacte
 rium t was distinctly isolated from its fellows.                 These particular areas
 were watched for several days, and were not found to have any tendency to
 undergo segmentation, although myriads of Monads had been formed in
 adjacent portions of the pellicle, as well as Fungus-germs which had vege
 tated into mycelial filaments and bore numerous heads of spores similar to
 those of a small variety of Penicillium glaucum.                The Bacteria included
 within these    areas seemed to possess too much inherent vigour to lose              their
own   individuality — a      supposition which was         confirmed by their great in
 crease  in size and subsequent development.               On the fourth and fifth days
many     were   seen which had grown out into minute filaments, resembling
what is commonly regarded as Leptothrix, although they also possessed all
 the characteristics of a miniature fungus-mycelium.
    Thus, then,     we    may have modified        areas  in which the contained units
flourish and grow, whilst still preserving their own individuality ; or we
may have pellucid areas, persisting as such for a certain time, whose units
at last undergo a process         of molecular fusion and regeneration leading to
the production       of  a segmenting embryonal area from which brown              Fungus-
germs are produced J.            And, lastly, there may be pellucid areas which,
almost as soon as they are formed, begin to undergo those changes whereby
 they are converted into true embryonal areas.
    Many variations exist in the character of these areas in different cases,
some of which I will now attempt to describe, as I have lately had an op
portunity of watching all sorts of transitional conditions.
    The pellicle which formed on a filtered maceration of hay during frosty
weather (when the temperature of the room in which the infusion was
 kept was rarely above 55° F., and sometimes rather lower than this) pre
 sented changes of a most instructive character.               On the third and fourth
days the pellicle was still thin, although on microscopical examination all
portions of it were found to be thickly dotted with embryonal areas.
   * The daily atmospheric temperaluro being about 62° P.
   t The corpuscular appearance of some of these bodies was so marked that they might,
perhaps, more appropriately be spoken of as Torulce.
   J During this process the contained Bacteria disappear, and a whitish refractive and
homogeneous     protoplasm is produced in the place of tho jelly and its contained granules.
If we  turn to the account given of the origin of the "germinal membrane" in the ova of
higher animals, we may be struck by the similarity of the phenomena. Muller Bays
                                     — " It appears, indeed, that the germinal membrane is
(Baly's Translation, vol. i. p. 9):
formed by the attraction and aggregation of the globules of the yolk ; but all parts de
veloped in this germinal membrane aro produced by solution of these globules, and con
version of them into a matter inwhich no elementary particles can be distinctly recognized,
and of which the molecules must at any rate be beyond comparison more minuto than the
globules of the yolk aud germinal membrane." The subsequent development of blasto
dermic cells from this mass also agrees closely with what occurs in our embryonal

Nearly all of them were very small ; but a few areas of medium size
were     intermixed*. The smallest were not more than 40'0l) of an inch
in   diameter,       and these separated themselves from the pellicle as single
corpuscles ;       slightly larger areas broke up into two or three corpuscles ;
and others, larger still, into 4-10 corpuscles.                  In most of these small
areas, the corpuscles were formed with scarcely any appreciable alteration
in the refractive index of the matter of which they were composed : this
simply became individualized, so that the corpuscles separated from the
surrounding pellicle and from their fellows, still presenting all the ap
pearance of being portions of the pellicle, and exhibiting from 4-10
altered Bacteria in their interior.                In some cases the products of seg
mentation        soon developed into actual flagellated Monads in a manner pre
sently     to be described        ;  whilst in others they        seemed   to remain for a

 and not others, seems quite impossible to say.            One can only assert the
 fact, and add that these highly refractive ovoid corpuscles were, for the
 most part, more prone to produce Fungus-germs than Monads.                  Many of
 them soon grew out into dissepimented fungus-filaments^ which rapidly as
 sumed the Penicillium mode of growth. The spores, which were abun
 dantly produced in terminal chaplet-like         series, were, however, small,    ho
 mogeneous, spherical, and colourless.
    On several occasions I have seen Monads produced in this way, by direct
 and immediate separation from the pellicle ; though, as M. Pineau had
 stated, on other occasions they ma}' be seen to arise in groups, in which
 they first appear as aggregations of motionless corpuscles.            The solitary
mode of origin is that which has been described by M. Pouchet ; and al
 though the details given by him are not very full, so far as they go they
 are in accordance with my own observations.              M. Pouchet, for instance,
 describes the flagellum as being closely applied to the body, and motionless
for  a time.    This I have also found to be the case. I have, moreover, on
one or two occasions, been able to watch        all the transitions from the mere
motionless corpuscle to     the flagellated  Monad     ; just as, on other occasions,
I  have watched almost similar corpuscles develope into Fungus-germs.
    Sometimes the flagellum is seen attached to corpuscles which still dis
play almost unaltered Bacteria imbedded in their substance : generally,
however, the corpuscles which separate from the pellicle in this compara
tively unaltered condition, undergo certain slow changes before the flagellum
is developed.      The contained Bacteria become more and more indistinct,
whilst the general substance of the corpuscle becomes rather more refrac
tive, so as to produce ordinary protoplasm.              Corpuscles about 3-777" ^n
diameter are often very obscurely granular and quite, motionless.               They
grow, however, and when they have attained the size of xoW' '" diameter
thev frequently begin to exhibit slow undulating alterations in outline, and
tend to assume an ellipsoidal form.       One specimen, -3 3V7" in diameter, was
seen without a flagellum, but slowly alternating         between   the spherical and
ellipsoidal forms.     Suddenly, at one extremity of the ellipsoid, a series of
rapid   contractions  and  protrusions of its substance were observed, and when
they ceased, a motionless filament was seen bent around one side of the
body.     Three minutes afterwards a vacuole appeared for the first time at
the opposite extremity of the ellipsoid.         The corpuscle remained almost
motionless for twenty-five      minutes,  merely exhibiting very slight changes
in outline  ; after thirty minutes the first slow bendings of the flagellum were
seen  ;  and after thirty-five minutes the whole organism began to exhibit
slow semi-rotations, at intervals of a minute or two. After forty minutes the
movements were pronounced and of a starting character, dependent upon
sudden contractions of portions of the body of the organism rather than
upon movements of its flagellum.          After fifty-five minutes, the corpuscle
unfortunately became hidden, owing to its having floated underneath a
portion    of the pellicle.    How far the rapidity of the evolution of           the

 flagellum, and its subsequent movements, were impaired by the glare of
 artificial light to which the organism was subjected, cannot be said.
Certainly, however, the flagellum seems to be thrown out much more
 rapidly in other cases.    Speaking of simple organisms of this kind, Dr. T.
 R. Lewis says*:   — '*
                        Frequently a succession of pseudopodia are seen pro
jected in a wave-like manner, as if lashing the fluid." And, again, of other
similarly active animalcules he says : — " Sometimes one flagellum is seen,
a posterior one, at others an anterior one also, both being retractile at
will ; and another may be darted forth out of any portion of its body."
                                 "
Again, where tailed " zoospores are produced from Algce or from such
Fangi as Acklya and Cystopus, they are also evolved most rapidly —
two hours often sufficing for the entire production of a brood of such
flagellated Monads from the segmentation of a mass of formless pro
toplasm.
  Monads, indeed,                  produced from the "pellicle" in pre
                           are frequently
cisely the same manner as that by which they arise within the terminal
chambers of certain Algee or Fungi — that is to say, they result from the
segmentation of a mass of homogeneous protoplasm t.     The steps of this
process I will now describe.
   An infusion of hay was made with water at a temperature of about 1 20°
F., and maintained at this heat for three hours. After filtration, four or
five ounces of the fluid were poured into a wide-mouthed bottle, and
placed under a small bell-jar.    When the infusion was examined at the ex
piration of three days, it was found to be quite turbid, and covered by a mo
derately thick pellicle.   On removing portions of this and submitting it to
microscopical examination, the fluid around was found to contain multitudes
of very active specimens of Monas lens, having an average length of a3'6o".
The pellicle itself was mostly composed of medium-sized Bacteria, though
here and there were areas, of different dimensions, in which the units had
¦more the appearance of embryo Torulre.      But, contrasting with the very
pale fawn-colour of the evenly granular pellicle, there were numerous areas
of a whitish colour, refractive, and more or less homogeneous. These areas
differed very much in shape and size; some were not more than 1                 0'0

 the   Monads had much increased in            size, some of the larger of them mea
 suring xsVo        m length.      Others had lost their flagellum, and were existing
 in the form of ovoid or rounded corpuscles, which were motionless, though
 still provided with a vacuole, and now also with a solid nucleus about
 i0^0O" in diameter (fig. 3, b, c, d~).             All stages were seen, between the
 ovoid corpuscle ^-jot" in length and a much larger Amoeba of the kind
just described, which was either motionless or else, at intervals, exhibited
slowly evolved and blunt protrusions at its periphery.
     In other specimens the most easy and rapid alternations were seen be
tween the shape and mode of locomotion which pertain to Monads and those
which are characteristic of Amoebae.               Monads which had been previously
in active motion would at times come to a state of rest, develop two or
three vacuoles in their interior, and behave in all respects like an Amoeba,
save for the presence of the now languidly moving flagellum. After remaining
in this state for a variable time, some of them would just as abruptly cease
to    display the amoeboid movements, the extra vacuoles would disappear, the
shape of the Monad would be resumed, and with it the lashing movements
of the flagellum, which again gives rise to the rapidly darting gyrations of
the organism.          Whilst in the amoeboid state the changes in shape were
moderately rapid ; though two or three organisms were watched, one por
 tion of which remained rounded and apparently attached to the glass,
 whilst the opposite extremity threw out and retracted comparatively long
 processes with lightning-like rapidity — some of them being filiform, like the
 ordinary persistent flagellum*.
      On the seventh day thousands of the motionless spheroidal Amoebae
 were seen, which had much increased in size.                 They were now as much as
  TTts in diameter, and displayed one or more vacuoles (fig. 3, d). Each
  one contained a distinct nuclear particle, though there was an almost com
  plete absence of granules, the body substance being quite pellucid.                Some
  organisms of the same        kind,  though rather smaller, contained the ordinary
 granules     in their interior and also exhibited slow amoeboid              movements     ;
  whilst many Monads of the same size and general appearance were seen
  exhibiting amoeboid changes of form, though they had not yet lost their
  almost motionless flagellum.
      On the eighth day there were myriads of active Amccbce around every
  portion of the pellicle which was examined ; they were, in fact, at this pe
  riod, almost as numerous as the Monads.                Great numbers also existed in
  the spherical motionless condition.
      On the ninth day the pellicle began to assume a brownish colour on the
  surface, owing to the enormous development of minute brown fungus-sporesf.
  Portions of the pellicle were also separating and beginning to shrink, whilst

     On the tenth day, similar though more advanced changes were seen. Al
 though the majority of the Amoebce were still active and polymorphic, hun
 dreds of them were becoming encysted, and the different stages of the process
 were quite obvious.      They were these : — The previously spherical Amoebae
 lost their vacuoles, the granules almost wholly disappeared, and the body
 generally became slightly refractive, the nucleus being still visible.       After
 a time the nucleus became invisible, and the whole substance of the organism
 assumed    a homogeneous and      highly refractive appearance — so that when it
was examined a little beyond the focal distance it looked almost like an oil-
globule.      There was a decided condensation, also, of the outer layer of
protoplasm, this being the first trace of the cyst-wall.          Subsequently the
cyst-wall became more and more manifest, whilst the size of the sphere
slightly diminished, and assumed a faintly brownish tinge. From the sur
face of the developing cyst there were a number of very short ray-like pro
jections (fig. 3, g).    In the last stage, whilst the cyst-wall became more
developed and the projections more obvious, the whole exterior envelope
assumed a decidedly brown colour, and the contained protoplasmic mass,

which     had again become less refractive, distinctly separated from the
 cyst-  wall *.
     As the virtues of this infusion seemed to be getting exhausted, on the
same (tenth) day I transferred a portion of the pellicle to the surface of a
 new weak infusion of hay, which had been previously boiled.                  On the fol
lowing day the Monads           were  found to have increased very much in size,
and so also had many of the Amoebae.                Several large ovoid Monads on
measurement were found to be as much as -rVo"" in length ; they had, in
fact, become nearly twice as long as the largest of those which had existed
in the old infusion.
     Five days afterwards (sixteenth day), when another portion of this
transferred pellicle     was examined, all the Monads          were found to have dis
appeared, with the exception of a few which were in a motionless state, and
were apparently about to be converted into Amoebae.                  These latter organ
isms existed in teeming myriads : a portion of them had become encysted,
whilst of the rest about one half were active, and the others, though not
encysted, were almost motionless and more or less granular.                   On further
examination, it was found that the granular Amoebae (fig. 3, i-nt) were
organisms in a dying state, and that the contained particles were new living
units which gradually developed into Bacteria.                   All the stupes of this
 development were to be seen.            Thus there were a considerable number of
 languid    Amoebae   which    merely displayed a slight increase in the customary
 number of minute particles situated near or around the nucleus. There were
 others in which      these    minute granules, were more numerous ; and others
 still, quite motionless and spherical, which were densely packed with minute
 particles throughout their whole substance — these particles being mo
 tionless and less than yutiuutj" m diameter. In many of such Amoebae a clear
 vacuole was still to be seen.     In other organisms the particles had      become very
 slightly larger, whilst the protoplasmic substance in which they had                been
 produced had become fluid, and the particles were to be seen in active
 movement within the attenuated film constituting the outer layer of the
 old organism whose nucleus was still visible.             When reduced to this con
 dition, trembling     movements of the whole mass were seen, owing to the
 resultant agitations produced by the contained units.              Soon the attenuated
 outer   membrane     gave way,     and,  when   the  contained     units were liberated,
 they at once exhibited very active movements of progression, after the
 fashion of minute Bacteria.          The surrounding fluid was, in fact, crowded
 with similarly minute and active Bacteria, and with others slightly larger,
 which had evidently been produced in this manner.
     Such was the fate that overtook those Amoebae which lived latest in the
    * In the course of the next few days myriads of the Amoeba: had undergone this
 kind of change, which seems to follow quite naturally as soon as the activity of their
 vital processes becomes diminished.      It is the extraordinary molecular activity and
 constant change of shape of the Amoeba which tends to prevent the earlier occurrence
 of this primary differentiation.

solution.      Changes of an unhealthy nature seemed to have been so suddenly-
induced that the organisms did not possess sufficient energy even to undergo
the process of encystment.            Their own molecular movements (those which
pertain to the ordinary life of the Amoeba;) being so languid, other retro
grade changes were initiated, leading to the birth of new particles through
out their substance.         Bacteria, in fact,    were  generated by a most typical
 process of secondary evolution.
     The changes which have been thus observed constitute a very remarkable
 series.    The simplest living units (Bacteria) first swarm in the infusion*;
 these become      aggregated at the surface so as to form a
                                                                    " proligerous pel
 licle," in which embryonal areas gradually appear : as a result of segmenta
 tion in these embryonal areas, specimens of Mono* lens, t,—1^" in diameter,
 more or less suddenly make their appearance ; they increase in size, occa
 sionally assume an amoeboid appearance for a time, and are ultimately
 transformed into real Amoebae.           The transition is effected by the loss of the
 flagellum, the appearance of vacuoles in their interior, and the simultaneous
 manifestation of polymorphism and a creeping mode of progression ; at the
 same time a nuclear corpuscle develops in the interior, and the whole animal
 grows considerably.          At last the Amoebae gradually cease to exhibit their
 characteristic movements, whilst they become more or less spherical and
 motionless.       Ultimately    a firm bounding membrane is produced, and they
 pass into the encysted condition,         in which, although slightly smaller in size,
 they    constitute  spherules ysVo"      'n  diameter.    On the removal of some of
 this pellicle to the surface of a fresh infusion, the Monads and Amoebae
 greatly increased in size ; all the Monads gradually became converted into
 Amcebse, and some of these at first went through the ordinary process of
 encystment, though at last (on account of some more sudden change in the
 fluid) they seemed suddenly to lapse into a morbid state.              They were ap
 parently unable      to encyst    themselves   ; and not being capable of continuing
 as Amoebae,     there sprang up in their interior a teeming progeny of new
  units {Bacteria), the production of which occasioned the final dissolution
  of the organisms in which they were evolved.
     Other changes, however, took place in this same infusion which deserve
  to be chronicled.       On the sixth day there were seen scattered throughout
  those portions of the pellicle intervening between the embryonal areas a
  multitude of solitary spherules, varying in size from mere specks ^o uTmj" 'a
  diameter, or less, to bodies tjJ^ g" in diameter.        They were colourless, quite
  motionless, and appeared to be solid and almost homogeneous masses of
  plasma rather than vesicular bodies (fig. 4, a). There were merely faint indi
  cations of granules in their interior, and no evidence of a differentiated outer
  membrane.      None of them seemed to be undergoing processes of self-division,
     * Although   I do not, in the present communication, touch upon the mode of origin

and each appeared to have grown up in the situation in which it was seen*.
These corpuscles gradually became more numerous, on to the tenth day,
though they underwent no appreciable change except a slight increase in
size. On the eleventh day, in the portion of the pellicle which had been
transferred to the fresh hay-infusion, many of these stationary bodies, like
the Monads and active Amoebae, were found to have increased to such an
extent as to have doubled their transverse measurement.     They had also
developed a distinct nucleus in their interior (of a ring-like character),
vacuoles appeared and disappeared at intervals, and at the same time they ex
hibited slow and slight amoeboid changes in outline (fig. 4, g, h, they were,i);
in fact, now obviously converted into sluggish         Amoebae.    On the seventeenth
day many of them        were recognized in the pellicle,        scattered    amongst the
already-described     encysted Amoebae.They had again become motionless
and slightly contracted in dimensions    whilst their outer layer was con
                                               ;
densed, but not decidedly cyst-like.   Many of the smaller sizes were also
seen.    Seven days afterwards (twenty-fifth day), when another portion of
the transferred pellicle was examined,     was found to be densely studded
                                               it
throughout with thousands of encysted Amoebse, the great majority of
which were of the first variety and were pretty uniform in size and appear
ance.   But interspersed amongst them were       considerable number of the
                                                       a
imperfectly encysted Amcebee, of different sizes (b). Here and there, how
ever, some of them (now mostly about TtLj" in diameter) presented an un
usual appearance. They had assumed faint brown hue throughout their
                                                   a
whole mass, and segmentation had gone on within so as to produce    number         a
of units, whose shape   seemed irregular, owing to their being so densely
packed (c).   Othermasses  were seen in which considerable growth had taken
place — these being nearly twice the size and irregular in outline (d), though
still of  faint brown colour, and composed of
           a                                    mass of densely packed

units, which were held together           by
                                     an almost invisible bounding mem
brane.   And, lastly, in other places small aggregations of brownish
spores were seen (e), which had been liberated by the solution of this
very attenuated membrane — the separate spores being tolerably thick-
walled, bilocular bodies, joVo" in length by y^J^nj'' in breadth.  An
examination        on subsequent days showed many other of the amoeboid
bodies breaking       up in asimilar manner into these brownish, biloculated
Fungus-germs.
  But, strange to      say, brown Fungus-germs         of   an almost similar character
had previously presented themselves on the surface of the original infusion,
although they had arisen in quite     different manner —

similar to what        I have elsewhere represented. An almost invisible and thin
gelatinous       stratum     existed (a kind of formative membrane), in which every
intermediate stage could be detected, between the most minute particle and
a brownish, thick-walled,            biloculated fungus-spore.          The smaller bodies
were colourless, solid -looking, and highly refractive ; and they seemed
much more like mere dead concretions * than living things.                            All were
motionless.          Gradually, however, they became less refractive, grew more
and more vesicular, and at last assumed a faint brown tint.                    Although most
of them remained            as bilocular bodies, others grew and underwent further
segmentation, so as to produce              tri- and quadrilocular       bodies, or   " septate
spores."         During all stages of growth, some of them seemed to undergo an
occasional process of fission. They were watched for many days ; but as the
germs displayed no tendency to develop                t,   some  of them   were immersed      in

   the germs were found to have become more colourless, to have budded and
   multiplied, and in many cases to have formed elegant mycelial filaments,
  such as are represented in fig. 4,f,f.
      These latter observations are interesting in many respects.         It is remark
  able, for instance, that germs of precisely the same appearance should arise
  after such different methods — by origin and growth in a formative mem
  brane in one case, and as the result of the segmentation of a partially en
  cysted Amoeba in another case.           Then, again, it is extremely interesting to
  find that these parental Amoebae had, to all appearances, arisen by a process
  of Archebiosis, although at one stage of their development they were almost
 indistinguishable from other Amoebae seen in the same infusion, which had
  resulted immediately from the transformation of flagellated Monads, and
 mediately as products of a process of segmentation occurring in an em
  bryonal area.        So that whether we have to do with Fungus-germs or with
 Amoebae, their forms are occasionally so intimately associated                with the
 matter from which they have been derived, that similarity may ultimately
 be met with        between organisms whose actual modes of origin have been
 most diverse.
     These     amoeboid     corpuscles which grew up in the midst of the pellicle
 were peculiar in many respects.             In their very early stages it was quite
 impossible      to  say  whether   they  were  going to develop into Fungus-germs
 or into Amoebae ; ultimately, however, they seemed to lean more towards
 the latter mode of development, although the activity which they displayed
in this    phase of their existence was extremely slight. Finally, we find them,
after encystment, undergoing a process of segmentation, by which they give
rise to a colony of brown Fungus-germs, in precisely the same manner as
that by which the Protomyxa of Haeckel gives origin to flagellated Monads
which       subsequently      assume   the characters and mode of locomotion of
Amoebae *. This          evidence, in addition to other facts previously known, tends
to show that the transition from the Amoeba to the Monad, or the reverse,
may be paralleled by a similar interchangeability               between the form and
mode of growth of an Amoeba and that peculiar to a Fungus ; so that either
form may at times result from one and the same living matter when it under
goes internal modifications, with or without being subjected to new condi
tions.       This position is still further strengthened by the facts which I have
now to record.
    *  Just as Amoeba! may arise either by Archebiosis or by segmentation of pre-existing
living matter (in embryonal areas), with or without passing through the Monad phase
of existence, so may Fungus-spores arise by cither of these methods. There is also
much evidence to show that Monads may arise directly by a process of Archebiosis. They
have been found in sealed flasks in which no pellicle was present, even by M. Pasteur;
and in some of my experiments with closed flasks (the details of which have not yot been
published) the Monads that were found must also have had the primary mode of origin.
Some of the new-born specks of living matter which were evolved within one of these
closed   flasks,  previously heated to TiO^-llb" F., seemed to have grown into Fungus-
germs, some into minute Amoeba?, and others into active Monads.

       A   few days after having         made    the infusion, the changes in which have
  just heen described,        I   prepared another with a portion of the same sample
   of hay.       This   second infusion, however, was made with water at a tempe
   rature of 158° F., which was maintained at this heat for two hours. After
   filtration it was placed in a similar vessel, and allowed to stand side by side
   with     the other infusion.         On the third day, embryonal areas of various
   shapes and sizes were seen in the firm pellicle which had formed upon the

   Particles of some kind were obscurely seen within the refractive proto

   number, showed signs of commencing segmentation. This process went on

diminution in the reflectiveness of the separated elements, and their
assumption of a more distinctly vesicular character, whilst they simulta
neously acquired a faint brown colour.                 They were thus converted into
unmistakable Fungus-germs, although they showed very little tendency to
germinate ; and it was not until after repeated examination that -a few of
them were found growing out into filaments such as are represented in the
figure.     Occasionally, in the same pellicle, the embryonal areas broke up
into products of a somewhat different character (fig. 5,g, g"). The segments
were slightly larger, whilst they gradually assumed a deeper brown colour and
a more compound character.              These elements also grew at this stage, and
underwent      processes   of division after the fashion of Lichen-gonidia,          and in
a manner similar to what          I had observed ou a previous occasion*. These
germs also      exhibited   very little tendency to germinate, though on one or
two occasions they were seen to have grown out into short chain-like
filaments, such as are represented in fig. 5 g' .
     During all the period in which the embryonal areas were breaking up
into these corpuscles, which soon assumed the form of brown Fungus-germs,
not a single Monad or Amoeba was to be seen in the solution ; and yet
it had been standing during the whole time side by side with the other
infusion which was prepared at a temperature of 120o-12.io F. Facts of
 this kind have been observed on several other occasions with great con
stancy    ;  so that one may safely state          that Fungus-germs or Monads and
 Amoebae may be procured at will, by simply regulating the amount of heat
 at which the infusion is prepared.            The Monad and the Amceba represent
 more highly animalized modes of existence, which are only able to manifest
 themselves in infusions in which the organic matter has not been too much
 deteriorated by the influence of heat. Such deterioration seems to manifest
 itself by altering the developmental potentialities of the primary forms of
 living matter evolved in the infusion f.
     Experience has shown me that, if an infusion has been heated for a time
 to 212° F., the pellicle which forms on its surface very frequently never
 gives rise to an embryonal area. If the infusion has been prepared at a tem
 perature of 149°-158° F., the embryonal areas which form will give origin

    f  Seeing that tlio Monads and tlio Fungus-germs are produced, not from invisible
 gcrms.but from the segmentation of large embryonal areas, every stago of whose formation
 can be accurately traced, this seems the only possible explanation. If the opponent of Evo
 lution contends, in answer to one set of experiments with heated fluids and closed flasks,
 that Monads arc met with because their germs are capable of resisting a temperature of
 275' P., he cannot now contradict himself by saying that embryonal areas, formed on
                                                                   °
 infusions which have been prepared at a temperature of 158 F., do not yield Monads
 because such a temperature is destructive to their germs.      Neither is it open to him to
  say that Fungus-germs (derived from embryonal areas) do not appear in infusions pre
  pared at 212° F. because such heat is destructive to them, when at the samo time he
  vehemently contends, in answer to other experiments, that similar Fungus-germs arc not
  hindered from developing after exposure to such a temperature, or to others which are
  much higher.

  to Fungus-germs ; whilst in a similar infusion prepared at 1 20°- 130° F.,
  the embryonal areas, which seem at first to be in all respects similar, break
  up into actively-moving Monads.               It remains for us to see what changes
  may    take  place in  the  pellicle  that  forms   on an infusion or maceration pre
  pared with cold water (G0°-70°          F.).
     Before passing to a description of these phenomena, however, I will de
  scribe the mode of origin of the embryos of some organism whose real nature
 is unknown, the final stages of its development not having been traced.
  So far as they were seen, the stages were of a very positive character.
     I have observed these early stages in two different infusions ; but in each
 case, after a certain stage     of development had        been achieved, no further pro
 gress seemed to be made for about two days              ;  and then the pellicle unfortu
 nately broke up and sank to the bottom.                The arrest of development may
 therefore have been due in both cases to some morbid quality of the pellicle
 itself.    These organisms were observed in the middle of the mouth of
 April (1869), in        an infusion    of turnip-leaves, which had been prepared
 fourteen days previously.          All stages of development could be seen in dif
 ferent parts of the pellicle.        The new organism first manifested itself by the
 presence (in a uniformly granular layer) of an aggregation of 8-20 larger
 and more refractive particles ; these were then gradually marked off from
 the surrounding granules by a thin but distinct bounding Hue, whilst the
 contained granules increased in size.           At  a later stage the containing sphere

was seen to have grown larger (fig. 6, c), and the granules had assumed                  a
crescentic arrangement ; whilst on their concave side there was a tolerably
large refractive globule, about -j-j^jjij" in diameter, which exhibited the
 most distinct oscillations and more or less extensive to-and-fro movements
in the otherwise clear central space.               In other specimens this central
spherule had become even larger, and the granules had closed round it
more equally, so as to leave a broad space between the central mass and
the thin walls of the containing sphere (d). The measurements in this stage
were found to be as follows : — containing sphere t;,Vj"> central nuclear-
like body touuu'       > an(l  surrounding mass of granules ^oVo" "* diameter.
Afterwards the central nuclear-like body and the granular mass seemed to
become lighter in colour, — the former still exhibiting its slow oscillating
movements ; whilst the latter had much increased in size, so as more nearly

to fill the delicate cyst in which it was contained. Then the outlines of
the emhryo gradually became more defined; three or four other, rather large
granules appeared in the neighbourhood of the nucleus ; and one crescentic
portion of the embryo-mass presented a smooth, glistening, and homoge
neous appearance.   No later stages were traced ; and though no move
ments of the embryo as a whole were seen (only movements of the nucleus),
there could not be the shadow of a doubt that these bodies represented
organisms of some kind, which were developing, not from ova, but by
means of changes taking place in the very elements of the pellicle itself.
     The intermediate connecting links between Flagellated Monads on the
one hand,    and such Ciliated Infusoria as Paramecium and Kolpoda on
the other, are undoubtedly such forms as those which were included by
Dujardin in his genus Enchelys.   They are scarcely larger than many
Monads ; they possess the same simple structure, having no trace of an
oral aperture, though, like the Monads, they display an internal vacuole,
and like them also they may or may not possess a simple nuclear particle.
They present the same variations in form which are to be met with
amongst Monads ; and they differ from them only by the presence of
vibratile cilia over most of their body, instead of the possession of a
single flagellum.     They are, moreover, not unfrequently met with in large
numbers    in situations in which Monads abound.
   Pineau says he has watched the development of organisms of this kind
in a pellicle which formed on an infusion of isinglass.     The first stages
were altogether similar   to those which     he has described as having taken
place in the evolution of Monas lens*.        Corpuscles were seen to separate
from the embryonic aggregations without a flagellum, though they con
tinued to increase in size, and soon developed a vacuole and nuclear particle
in their interior.  As they enlarged, they gradually assumed an oval form,
though still remaining motionless and devoid of cilia. At last, with very
little further increase in size, cilia were developedf, and the organisms
gradually displayed the appearance and locomotory powers which have
been attributed by Dujardin to the form which he named Enchelys
ovata%.
   The organisms previously mentioned have nearly all been minute ; and
it has therefore been somewhat difficult to trace their early stages. These
difficulties, however, gradually vanish when we come           to the investigation             -

  Although their most remarkahle mode of origin was fully described and
  figured by M. Pouchet more than twelve years ago, yet, unfortunately,
  many of our leading biologists have preferred to repudiate his statements
  and rely upon their own notions concerning credibility and the mode in
  which living matter ought to conduct itself, rather than adequately inves
  tigate the subject for themselves.
     According     to Pouchet,  the stages in the evolution of Paramecium viride
  were as  follows : — The pellicle, which    was at first uniform and evenly gra-

  centration of its granules at tolerably equal distances into small, more or
  less rounded aggregations, which soon became surrounded and defined by a
  clear border, suggestive of a resemblance to the zona pellucida of higher
  animals.     The next change which took place was, that the granules, which
  had been at first more densely aggregated towards the centre, disseminated
  themselves uniformly through the ovum, whilst at the same time the
  simple clear zone thickened into a distinct membrane.            At this stage the
  whole egg appeared       somewhat   lighter  and more    transparent than the sur
  rounding pellicle.       Soon after this, differentiation still proceeding, the
tlnass of enclosed granules gradually became converted into a real embryo,

amongst the granules in some part of the embryo, the alternate contraction
and dilatation of which soon showed that it was the contractile vesicle of
the infusorium.   After a time the embryo began to exhibit movements of
quite a different kind (sudden and irregular), no longer checked, but rather
increased by slight shocks from without.    In one of these sudden plunges
the thin enveloping membrane was ruptured, and there entered into the
aquatic world           a free-swimming            and ciliated infusorial               animalcule having
the characteristics of the species above mentioned.
   Such is the marvellous story ; and the description of other observers is
substantially similar.   In the particular observation of which M. Pouchet
gives the details *, the first rudiments of the eggs began to make their ap
pearance in the pellicle of an infusion of hay on the second day ; on the
third day the ovules were distinctly circumscribed, spherical, and ^i^" in
diameter ; on the fourth day there was no increase of size, the investing
membrane   could scarcely be recognized — although there was a distinct
gyration of the embryo within                     it,
                                   and in those which were most advanced
the contractile vesicle could already be discovered   on the fifth day the     ;
embryos were found to be of the same size, though slightly greenish in
colour, and their movements were more irregular and jerking. At this
stage the animalcule had assumed     pyriform shape, fine cilia could be
                                                         a
seen on some parts of its surface, and the contractile vesicle was most
obvious          in the midst of minute                 and    densely packed greenish               granules.
After   a     few hours more, the buccal cleft, fringed with longer cilia", became
obvious, and also the so-called nucleus in the centre of the body. The
embryos had by this time somewhat increased in size, so that, after an
interval of      few more hours, fully developed specimens of Paramecium
                   a
mride, -j^-j," in diameter, were swimming about in the solution.
  These observations of M. Pouchet have been repeated by him over and
over again.  He has thus seen different forms of Paramecium arise in the
pellicle  and at other times, by steps essentially similar, Kolpodce have
             ;
made their appearance.   The difference between these two forms     indeed                           is
quite trivial and unimportant, and wholly unworthy, even from the old
point of view, of being regarded as generic mark of distinction.

    I have also myself, quite recently, watched with the greatest interest all
the stages of such a process, terminating in the evolution of fine speci
mens of Paramecium, and am most pleased to be able to bear my testimony
to the general accuracy of M. Pouchet's description.                   Up to this period       I
had never seen a single Paramecium or other specimen of the larger ciliated
Infusoria in any of my hay-infusions, these having all been prepared either
with warm or with hot water.                  But about ten days previously, on re
reading M. Pouchet's description of the mode of evolution of these
organisms, it struck me that I had failed to see these phenomena, owing
to my never having made any infusions with cold water.                        I therefore at
once prepared such a maceration, and two or three days afterwards                          wrote
to M. Pouchet on the subject.               In the reply which he was kind enough to
address to me,         he said : — *' Jamais, jamais vous ue renconterez un seul

    On the evening of the day on which I received this letter,                          I  again
examined       the thick pellicle which          had formed on the maceration of hay ;
and, much       to my delight,        I  found it studded with thousands of embryo
Paramecia, whilst others were free and active in the infusion.                           It was,
therefore, a most significant fact that they should have been met with on
 the very first occasion that a cold maceration had been employed^ ; whilst
not a single Paramecium had ever been seen before in any of the many hay-
infusions kept in the same placej, although several of them had even been
 made with water whose temperature was not more than 125°-130° F. —
 and, therefore, not high enough to have killed any embryos which might
 have chanced to preexist in the infusion previously to its filtration.
     The maceration       was at the time covered by a            thick pellicle, which had
 become brown on its upper surface.                Its under layers, however, were still
 soft  and   pulpy.      When    a  small    portion of it was transferred to a micro
 scope-slip, and gently compressed by the covering-glass so as to flatten it
 out into a thinner layer, the granular membrane was observed to be pretty
   * M. Pouchet     has been in the habit of using one part by weight of ordinary dry hay
to about forty parts of water, and then allowing the maceration to stand for two or three
hours before filtering off the clear liquid.
    T Owing to the coldness of the weather (tho daily temperature of the room being
scarcely above CO' F.), they did not make their appearance in tho pellicle till moro than
fourteen days, although with a daily temporature of 7.r); P. they are said by M. Pouchet
to begin to make their appearance on the third or fourth day.            I  had examined the
pellicle of my maceration from time to time during the fir9t week, but did not look at
it subsequently for several days — not, in fact, until the day on which          I  received  II.
Pouchet's   letter.   During  the  first week  the pellicle had become  very  thick  and pulpy,
but, tho weather being rat her colder at this time, it was principally giving birth to various
kinds of Fungus-germs.

the extreme distinctness with which almost all the phenomena described

such objects before one.
    The only difficulty was to make out exactly what was the nature of the
first change by which the egg-like body became differentiated from the
surrounding substance of the pellicle.                I laboured under some disadvan
tages from having to examine an old and                  somewhat opaque pellicle ; but
after the most careful and repeated observations with reference to this
point, I have been led to adopt an opinion slightly different from that of
M.      Pouchet.          Instead    of small concentrations      of granules occurring
which gradually increased in size and at               last became enclosed by a bound
ing membrane, it seemed to me that the differentiation took place after a
                                                                      " embryonal area      "
manner essentially similar to that by which an ordinary
is formed*.           The small embryos did not appear to represent the earlier
stages of large embryos ; and it seemed rather that spherical masses of the
pellicle of different sizes began to undergo molecular changes, which termi
 nated in the production of Paramecia of a correspondingly different bulk.

262                    Prof. H. C. Bastian on Heterogenetic                    [Mar. 21,
Just    as  in the previously      described embryonal areas masses of different
sizes began to exhibit signs of change, so also here spherical portions of the
pellicle, differing within the limits above mentioned, began to undergo
other heterogenetic changes.           This was first indicated by an increased re-
fractiveness     of  the  area  (especially when seen a little beyond the focal
distance) ; and almost simultaneously a condensation of its outer layer
appeared to take place, whereby the outline became sharply and evenly de
fined*. At this stage an actual membrane was scarcely appreciable, and the
substance of the embryo (when examined at the right focal distance)
scarcely differed in appearance from the granular pellicle of which it pre
viously formed part.
     So far as it could be ascertained, the individual embryos did not increase
in size, although they went through the following series of developmental
changes.       The contained matter became rather more refractive, and the
number of granules within diminished considerably, whilst new particles
after a time seemed gradually to appear in what was now a mass of con
tractile protoplasm.         These new particles were at first sparingly scattered,
 though as they were evolved they continued to grow into biscuit-shaped
bodies, which sometimes attained the size of yy^ijxr"'                     All sizes were
 distinguishable ; and many of them moved slowly amongst one another,
owing to the irregular contractions of the semifluid protoplasm in which
 they were imbedded. Gradually the number of homogeneous biscuit-shaped
 particles increased, and at last a large vacuole slowly appeared in some
 portion of the embryo (fig. 8, b) ; it lasted for about half a minute, disappear
 ed, and then, after a similar interval, slowly reappeared. Much irregularity,
 however, was observed in this respect.             The next change that occurred was
 the complete separation of the embryo from the cyst which it filled, and
 the commencement of slow axial rotations.                   These rotations gradually
 became     more rapid, though they were not always in one direction.                  The
  embryo     became    more  and  more     densely  filled with  the large biscuit-shaped
 particles (c) ; and at last the presence of cilia could be distinctly recognized
  on one portion of the revolving embryo.              Then, as M. Pouchet stated, the
  movements grew more and more irregular and impulsive, so that after a time
  the thin wall of the cyst was ruptured, and the embryo emerged as a
  ciliated and somewhat pear-shaped             sac  provided    with a large contractile
  vesicle at its posterior extremity.
      Sometimes the embryo-mass at an early stage of its evolution divided
  into two or four bodies, each of which developed within the cyst into a
  perfect embryo ; and- in place of exhibiting a regular rotation, they rolled
  and tumbled over one another in the most irregular manner.                    On one oc
  casion I saw a cyst containing two embryos and four spherical Monads
  about t^o" in diameter, the latter having apparently resulted from the
     * The first, changes seem to take place rather rapidly,
                                                              judging from the great diffi
  culty of recognizing the earlier stages.   It was almost impossible to find an area which
  was not already bounded by a delicate outer layer.

fission   of some smaller portion of the embryo-mass.               Sometimes it was the
largest embryos which were observed to undergo this process of fission,
though the phenomenon was by no means confined to them *.
     On emerging from the cyst, all the embryos, although differing somewhat
in size, were of the same shape.            This closely corresponded with the de
scription given     of Paramecium     kolpoda    in Pritchard's ' Infusoria,' namely :
—"      Ovate, slightly compressed ; ends obtuse, the anterior attenuated
and slightly bent like a hook."           Cilia existed over the whole body, though
they were largest and most numerous about the anterior extremity.                        No
trace    of an actual buccal cleft could be detected ; and (except in the posterior
portion of the body, where a large and very persistent vacuole was situated)
the organism was everywhere densely packed with the large, homogeneous,
biscuit-shaped particles. For many days these most active Infusoria seemed
to undergo little change, though afterwards the number of the contained
particles gradually began to diminish, whilst the body became more and
more      regularly ovoid, and a faint appearance of longitudinal striation
manifested itself, more especially over its anterior half.              At the same time
a very faint and almost imperceptible mass (" nucleus") began to appear
near the centre of the organism ; and when examined with a magnify
ing power of 16/0 diameters,          a lateral aperture    (mouth)    -j^W     m diameter
 was seen, which was fringed by short active cilia, arranged like the spokes
 of a wheel. These peculiarities correspond very closely with those of an
 embryo Nassula. Very many were seen with similar characters ; and mul
 titudes existed in all conditions       intermediate     between    this  stage and that
 of the simpler organism which first          emerged from the cyst.            No further
 stages,    however,   could  be watched,    as  at this  time  some   change took place
 in the infusion which proved fatal to all the free Infusoria and also to the
 multitudes     of embryos which were at the time developing in the pellicle ;
 these became more minutely granular and opaque, their movements ceased,
 and the cyst-wall grew thicker.            This phase of development disappeared,
 therefore, almost as suddenly and mysteriously as it had appeared.                     The
 cysts were examined from time to time for many weeks afterwards, but they
 seemed     to undergo no    further change     f.
      It will, of course,  be seen that the phenomena           which    I have described
     * Partial desiccation has a strong tendency to induce such fission, as   I found by the
 frequency with which it occurred when the water had in great part evaporated from
 specimens placed in a developmental chamber.        Fission of PeniciUium~GlamentB     (into
 conidia), and also of encysted Euglena, have several times been seen under similar cir
 cumstances.
     t In a maceration which was subsequently made during very cold weather, when the
 temperature of the room, even during the day, was rarely higher than 53° F., large
 Amoeba:, visible to the naked eye, some of which were -j-j^" in diameter, were produced
  from the pulpy under portions of tho pellicle.       They formed great masses of living
  granular jelly of the simplest description — too large to move as a whole, though fluxes
  of portions of their semifluid body-substance were continually taking place in different
  directions.
                                                                             TJ 2

 as taking place       in the " proligerous pellicle" may be watched by all who
are conversant with such methods of investigation.              We do not require to
 call in the aid of the chemist ; we need exercise no special precautions ; the
changes in the pellicle are of such a kind that they can be readily appre
ciated by any skilled microscopist.
    Just as      I   have supposed that living matter itself comes into being
by virtue of combinations and rearrangements taking place amongst in
 visible colloidal molecules*, so now does the study of the changes in the
 "           "
   pellicle      absolutely demonstrate the fact that the visible new-born units
 of living matter behave in the manner which I have attributed to the in
 visible colloidal molecules.        The living units combine, they undergo mole
cular rearrangements, and the result of such a process of heterogenetic bio-
crasis is the appearance of larger and more complex organisms ; just as the
result of the combination and rearrangement between the colloidal mole
cules was the appearance of primordial aggregates of living matter.               Liv
ing matter is formed, therefore, after a process which is essentially similar
to the mode by which higher organisms are derived from lower organisms
in the pellicle on an organic infusion.          All the steps in the latter process
can be watched ; it is one of synthesis        —  a merging of lower individualities
into a higher individuality.          And although such a process has been pre
viously almost ignored in the world of living matter, it is no less real than
when it takes place amongst the simpler elements of not-living matter. In
both cases the phenomena are essentially dependent upon the "properties"
or " inherent tendencies
                                " of the matter which
                                                         displays them.

268               Dr. A. Dupre on the Elimination of Alcohol.
"On        the   Elimination      of Alcohol."         By A. Duprb, Ph.D., Lec
       turer on Chemistry at Westminster Hospital.                       Communicated
       by William OdliKg, M.B., F.R.S. Received November 16,
        1871*.
   Previous to the year 1860 it was the generally received opinion that the
greater portion of any alcohol taken was oxidized in the system, and only a
small fraction eliminated unaltered.            In that year, however, Messrs. Perrin
and Lallemand          published an elaborate memoir on the subject, in which
they maintained that all, or at least nearly all, the alcohol taken is elimi
nated unaltered.          This opinion was soon very generally adopted, notwith
standing      the   fact  that Messrs. Perrin and Lallemand never succeeded in
recovering, from the excretions, more than a very small fraction of the
alcohol consumed, although very large doses were frequently given. How
ever, the missing alcohol was easily accounted for as loss, occasioned by its
ready volatility.
    Soon after Dr. Anstie          took up the subject, and, on the strength of
numerous qualitative experiments, arrived at the conclusion, which he was
the first to publish in this country, that the originally received opinion
was    correct, viz. that     a small portion only of any alcohol taken is elimi
nated      unaltered.      After this, Dr. Thudichum and the author in this
country, and Ichulinus abroad, undertook a number of quantitative experi
ments which proved that a minute fraction only of the alcohol taken is
eliminated      through the kidneys.           Owing to these researches,           general
opinion gradually        reverted  to  the original  notion.
    Quite recently, however, Drs. Parkes and Wollowicz have published
several valuable memoirs on the action of brandy, alcohol, and wine on the
human body, in which they adopt, at least partially, the views of Messrs.
Perrin and Lallemand.            But here also no quantitative results are given
which will account, even approximately, for the amount of alcohol supposed
to be eliminated.          Drs. Parkes and Wollowicz believe that the elimination
of alcohol may        go on for  5 or 6 days after the last dose of alcohol has been
taken    ;  and they express the opinion that Dr. Anstie and the author, by
assuming that elimination practically ceases after 24 hours, had considerably
underestimated the amount actually eliminated.                 The author has thereby
been induced once more to investigate this subject.
   Assuming,       then, for the sake of argument, that all the alcohol is elimi
nated, and that such elimination            takes 10 daysf, it would follow that if a
certain quantity of alcohol be taken daily, the amount eliminated would
increase from day to day until, from the 10th day onward, the quantity

   t This    seems the very utmost   limit that can be conceded.   In the numerous experi
ments of Dr. Bencc Jones       and the author, on the passage of substances into and out of
the tissues, it was found that the elimination of lithium, for example, was complete in
5 to 6 days, while all elimination of quinine ceased after 2 days.       In neither case did
any of the substance remain behind.

                    Dr. A. Dupre       on the   Elimination    of Alcohol.              269
eliminated      daily would equal the daily consumption ; in other words, the
quantities     which    would be eliminated, if this theory were correct, might be
measured by ounces instead of by grains, and ev.en the most ordinary pro
cesses    of analysis could not fail       to yield   considerable quantities of alcohol.
The argument loses nothing               in force if it be contended that elimination
lasts longer than 10 days ; for, however long it may last, if the alcohol diet
is continued, a time must come when elimination and consumption would
be equal.        Obviously, however, there is a tolerably narrow limit given to
the time during which elimination can be presumed to last ; for the alcohol,
if not eliminated, must accumulate in the body, and would speedily rise to
a proportion totally incompatible with life itself.                The experiments re
corded      in the following      pages    were    guided  by the foregoing     considera
tions.
    Analytical processes employed. — Since, in the experiments of Messrs.
Perrin and Lallemand, the alcohol not recovered is accounted for as loss,
 the author has thought it of importance to give the analytical processes
employed in greater detail than might otherwise be considered_necessary.
 It will thus be shown how much of the alcohol present can be recovered,
and how much may reasonably be accounted for as loss. Alcohol is elimi
nated through four channels, — kidneys, lungs, skin, and bowel.
    Examination of the Urine. — The urine to be examined is rendered
slightly acid by dilute sulphuric acid ; some tannin is added to prevent
frothing, and about ^ of it is distilled over. This first distillate is now
 made slightly alkaline by caustic potash or soda, and redistilled ; this
second     distillate is once more acidified by sulphuric acid, and again distilled,
¦^ being
              driven over each time.           If  these three distillations reduce the
amount of liquid to about 20 cub. centims., it may at once be submitted to
 oxidation.       If, however, the amount of urine employed was so large that
 this third distillate amounts to much more than 20 cub. centims., the re
 distillation   must be repeated until the quantity is brought down to 20 cub.
centims.       Less    than three distillations should, however, in no case be
made.        All distillations should, moreover,        be conducted with an apparatus
in which      both retort and receiver are connected air-tight with the con
denser, the receiver being furnished with a safety-tube closed by a globule
of mercury.          The final distillate is now put into a small assay flask, a
suitable amount of bichromate solution is added, the flask is closed by a well-
fitting caoutchouc-stopper tied down, and heated for one hour in a water-
 bath.     The flask is then taken out, cooled, opened, and the                  excess  of
 bichromate left is reduced by zinc.              (The bichromate solution is made by
 dissolving     147   grammes of potassium bichromate in water, adding 200
grammes of strong sulphuric acid, and making up the solution to 1400
cub. centims.         Ten cub. centims. of this solution will oxidize nearly 0'2
gramme alcohol into acetic acid.              After a little practice, it is easy to judge
 by  the   colour   of the  liquid  in  the  flask  whether or no sufficient bichromate
had been added.)           When all the bichromate        is reduced, the green solution

270                 Dr. A. Dupre   on the   Elimination of Alcohol.
is transferred to a small retort, some sulphuric acid is added, and the acetic
acid present is distilled over.       To do so effectually, the distillation is con
tinued almost to dryness, some water is then added to the residue, and the
distillation    resumed   ; this is repeated three times, The distillation may
be conducted over an Argand burner, and sometimes it is advisable to
place pieces of tobacco-pipe into the retort to avoid bumping.               In the
distillate the acetic acid is now estimated by a standard solution of deci-
normal soda, I cub. centim. of which neutralizes 0'006 grm. acetic acid,
and indicates therefore 0-0046 grm. of alcohol.           If ordinary care has been
used, no trace of sulphuric acid will be present in the distillate ; but if the
distillation has been carried too far, so that the residue in the retort has
become      dry, traces of sulphuric acid may have passed into the distillate.
 In such case the acidity of the distillate is carefully estimated, and the
 neutral solution is evaporated to dryness on a water-bath.          To the dry re
 sidue an amount of deci- normal sulphuric acid is added slightly in excess of
 the quantity of deci- normal soda used, and the resulting solution is once more
 evaporated on the water-bath.            During this second evaporation all the
 acetic acid is driven off.      The acidity of the residue is now determined as
 before, and will be found equal only to the excess of deci- normal acid taken,
 in  case nothing but acetic acid (or other volatile acid) was present in the
 distillate.     If, however, any sulphuric acid had passed over, the acidity of
 this residue will be found greater than the excess of deci- normal acid added,
 and this surplus is the measure of the sulphuric acid contained in the dis
 tillate.    If   this then is subtracted from the total acidity originally found,
 the rest will be the acetic acid.       If  an appreciable amount of volatile acid
 is present, which to a great extent may be judged of by the colour of the
  bichromate solution after the heating, the disturbing effect of any sulphuric
  acid having passed over may also be neutralized in the following manner.
  The distillate is accurately divided into two equal parts ; the acidity of the
  one half is estimated directly, the other half is evaporated on a water-
  bath, and the acidity of the residue left is determined.            The difference
  between these two determinations will give the volatile acid present in one
  half of the distillate.      Lastly, the acetic acid may be estimated by neu
  tralizing   the distillate   by pure barium carbonate, filtering, washing, &c,
  evaporating the solution to dryness, and weighing the barium acetate left.
  The above process yields accurate results, even with very small quantities
  of aleohol   ; thus in two check experiments the amount of alcohol taken was
  0"1    and 0-025 gramme, the acetic acid obtained neutralized 20* 1 cub.
  centims. and 5\5 cub. centims. of deci- normal soda, corresponding re
  spectively to 0"0924 and 0'0253 gramme of alcohol.
      Examination of Breath. — By help of         a suitable mouthpiece the breath
  is blown, through a wide tube containing chloride of calcium, into a bag
  placed between light-pressure boards (such a bag as is used in the ad
  ministration of laughing-gas, and holding from 4 to 5 cubic feet).            From
  this bag it passes into a flask containing water, thence into a Liebig's con

denser in connexion with a receiver, and finally escapes into the air.                  The
                                                —
experiment is conducted as follows : The hag being empty, the water in the
flask is heated to boiling, and the breath is blown into the apparatus for a
quarter to half an hour. The breath is first deprived of most of its moisture
by the chloride of calcium, and next enters the bag dry, or nearly so. From
the bag it passes, at considerably reduced speed, through the flask, where
it becomes mixed with          steam,   into the condenser.        In this last the steam is
condensed, and with it the greater part of the alcohol vapours present.
The alcohol will therefore be found in the distilled water collected in the
receiver.       When the breath has been blown into the apparatus during the
desired length of time, the blowing is discontinued, the tube is closed by a
clamp,       and the air collected         in   the   bag is allowed to pass gradually
through the retort and condenser.                The chloride of calcium is now dissolved
in water, the solution is added to the distillate               collected, and the alcohol
therein      contained is estimated by repeated distillations, oxidation, &c, as
described in the case of urine.             If it is desired to blow for a greater length
 of time than half an hour, it is necessary, with a bag of the above size, to blow
 it up twice, each time of course allowing all the air collected to pass out
 through the retort and condenser. At first it is difficult to keep up the
 ordinary rate of respiration while blowing               into the bag ; but with a little
 practice     this becomes    easy,   and   a  bag  holding   about 4 cubic feet will then
 suffice for half an hour's breathing.              At the end of this time about 4 cubic
 feet of air should be in the bag, while 2 cubic feet have passed through the
  apparatus ; the bag will then take one hour more to become empty.                     The
  bag has thus to serve            both   as   a  reservoir  and  regulator, reducing the
  velocity of the air-current to about one third.                 The desired velocity is
  readily obtained by a proper adjustment of                the  weights on the pressure-
  boards.      The boiling of the water in the flask is regulated so as to give about
  half  a litre distilled water for every       12 cubic feet of air passing through. The
  breath     was blown      through     the apparatus for half an hour.             The fol
  lowing quantitative experiments, made under precisely the same condi
  tions as the experiments with the breath, will serve to show that the greater
  part   of the alcohol carried by the air            is condensed with      the steam.    A
  given quantity        of alcohol   was    evaporated in a current of air, which was
  afterwards passed through the apparatus at the same speed as the breath.
  In the distillate obtained, the alcohol was estimated as described. The
  amount of air taken was            12 cubic feet,     equivalent to about one hour's
  breathing, and necessitated the filling of the bag twice.
      First experiment. — Amount of alcohol evaporated 0'004 gramme ;
  acetic acid obtained neutralized U'67 cub. centim. d. n. soda, equivalent to
  0031 gramme alcohol.
      Second experiment. — Amount of alcohol evaporated 0*008 grm. ; acetic
   acid obtained neutralized T25 cub. centim. d. n. soda, equivalent to
  0-0058 grm. alcohol.
      Third experiment. — Amount of alcohol evaporated 0-0415 grm.                   ; acetii

 acid   obtained neutralized     6-05    cub. centim.    d. n.  soda,   equivalent   to
 002/8 grm. alcohol.
     In the first two experiments     f, in the last  | of the alcohol contained in
 the 12 cubic feet of air was recovered in the distillate.         In a blank experi
 ment, in which      air only was blown through         the apparatus, no trace of
 volatile acid was obtained.
     Examination    of Alvine   Discharges.   — These    are stirred   up with water,
 the mixture is distilled    &c,  and the alcohol in the final distillate      is esti
 mated as described.       In the experiments recorded in the following Tables,
 the alvine discharges were not examined, previous experiments having con
 vinced the author that, even in cases where very large quantities of brandy
 are taken for some length of time, the amount of alcohol eliminated by the
 bowel is extremely small.
    Examination of Cutaneous Exudations. — No attempt was made to esti
 mate the amount of alcohol eliminated by the skin.              Qualitatively, how
 ever, the fact that traces    of alcohol   are thus eliminated may be shown as
 follows  : — Part of   the body is enclosed for several hours in an air-tight
covering ;    at the end of that time the perspiration collected is washed off
with clean water, the distillate from which         is then tested   with bichromate
and strong sulphuric acid.        Dr. Anstie has made numerous experiments in
this manner, which show conclusively that the amount so eliminated is
always extremely minute.         The actual amount eliminated might perhaps
be estimated,     with tolerable exactness, by enclosing an ascertained fraction
of the entire surface of the body in an air-tight bag, through which a
current of dry air is passed.        In this air the alcohol is then determined
exactly as in the case of the breath.
    By means of the method just described, two series of experiments on the
elimination of alcohol were made, and, for the sake of absolute certainty, the
author conducted them in his own person.
    First Series. — Having first abstained absolutely, for a space of 10 days,
from all alcoholic drinks or other articles of food containing alcohol, the
urine was collected on the 11th day, and the breath blown through the
apparatus for half an hour.        On the 12th day, and on each of the twelve
succeeding days,     112   cub. centims. of brandy* were taken daily (28 cub.
centims. at     1 p.m., 56 cub. centims. at      6  p.m., and 28 cub. centims. at
11   p.m.).    The urine was collected between the hours of 3 p.m. one day
and 3 p.m. the following day, on 1st, 6th, and 12th day of the brandy diet,
and 4 p.m. on the same above-mentioned days.                 Lastly, the urine was
collected during the 5 days following the cessation of the brandy diet.           The
analytical results obtained are arranged in the following Table.

brandy (same brandy as in previous experiments).        Urine collected for
every 3 hours up to the 12th, from the 12th to the 24lh hour, and during
the next succeeding 2 days.   The breath was passed through the apparatus,
for ten minutes at a time, in every half hour during the first 9 hours, and
during I hour (between 2 and 4 p.m.) on the 2 days following. The re

   An examination of Table      shows that, even after 10 days' total absti

                                     the kidneys, and apparently also in the
breath, which, when distilled                       volatile acid (the acid
                                       and oxidized, yields              a
has the smell of acetic acid).    An opportunity was therefore taken to
examine the urine of gentleman, teetotaler, who had only once in his life,
                          a                    a
and that two years previously, taken some spirituous liquor.    On treating
this urine in the usual manner, for the detection and estimation of alcohols,
an amount      of volatile acid       was      obtained from        day's urine which neu
                                                                     1
tralized 0-5 cub. centim. deci- normal soda.                   The experiment was twice re
peated with different days' urine with the same result.   The smell of the
volatile acid in this case also was that of acetic acid. We must therefore
look upon this substance, whatever                   it   may be, which yields the volatile
acid as  normal constituent of urine.
           a                                              The elimination of alcohol must,
then, be considered at an end as soon as the proportion                      of volatile acid     ob
tained sinks to the normal amount.
   Leaving, then, the nature of this substance out of consideration for the
present, we arrive at the following conclusions —              :
   1st. The amount of alcohol eliminated per day does not increase with the
continuance of the alcohol diet   therefore all the alcohol consumed daily
                                           ;
must of necessity be disposed of daily   and as   certainly
                                                     ;        not eliminated
                                                                it             is
within that time,   must be destroyed in the system.
                     it
      2nd. The elimination        of alcohol following         a     dose or doses   of alcohol      is
completed 24 hours after the last dose has been taken.
      3rd. The amount of alcohol            eliminated, in both breath and urine,               is   a
minute fraction only of the amount of alcohol taken*.
  A  consideration of Table II. leads substantially to the same conclusions.
Here, single dose having been taken, elimination had ceased to be per-
          a

     Quite recentlyI   have examined the urine of a woman Buffering from ascites, who
at the time of the experiment took 12 ounces of brandy (38 per cent, by weight of absolute
alcohol) daily, and had done so during a period of six weeks.    Two days' urine yielded
00366 grm. of acetic acid, equivalent to 002806 grm., or 0'44 grain alcohol.

ceptible ; that  the amount of volatile acid yielded on oxidation had sunk
                          is,
to the normal amount     hours after the dose had been taken.

portion of alcohol eliminated in this second experiment, although still
small,    is,
          however, considerably higher than     was    the first itbut thisin               ;        is
most likely owing to the different conditions under which the experiment
was made.      The two ounces of brandy were taken within          very short               a
space  of time  and early in the morning,  no other food  being  taken  at the
same time.    In consequence of this, the brandy had considerable diuretic   a
effect during the first few hours, within which, as will be seen, more than
l^j of the total proportion was eliminated.
   It has been shown in the foregoing that urine, even after                           days of total

abstinence,         when treated as for the estimation                     of alcohol, yields some
volatile acid which,as judged     the smell,        by

riment having shown that    at least the greater part of this substance passed
over with the first portions of distillate,  somewhat larger quantity of the

same urine was obtained and examined.           The total quantity employed
amounted to 180 ounces, being the greater part of 10 days' urine.           To
avoid   decomposition, the daily portion of urine was at once acidified
slightly, and   of  J-distilled this distillate was rendered alkaline and re
                                it             ;

                                               8
fied, and again distilled.   This third portion was now twice distilled over
freshly ignited animal   charcoal,  after which the distillations were repeated
until the quantity of liquid was reduced to 10 cub. centims., care being
taken that never less than  was driven over.  All the distillations were,

moreover, conducted with the usual precautions of having the receiver
closed     by   a   mercury valve.              These    10 cub. centims. showed the following
properties      :   —

 0-0192   grm. barium salt; this barium salt, on decomposition with sul

 Another portion readily gave the emerald-green reaction with bichromate
 and strong sulphuric acid, and finally they readily gave the iodoform test,
 viz. when treated with iodine and an alkali,   yellow glittering precipitate
                                                                  a

 six-sided      plates, sometimes                  single, sometimes   united        into   stars in the
 manner of snow-crystals.

readily gave the iodoform test, as well as the green reaction, with bichromate
and strong sulphuric acid.
  It appears, therefore, that     substancea     found in the urine after six
                                                              is
weeks' total abstinence, and even after an abstinence of two year?, which
gives the reactions ordinarily employed for the detection of small quan
tities of alcohol. Since      impossible to assume that any elimination of
                                 it   is
alcohol, due to alcohol which has been taken, could go on for     period of             a
six weeks, not to speak of two years, we must conclude that this substance
              constituent of human urine, or at least may be obtained from
         normal
it is
    a
  by distillation with dilute acid &c.   At first the author inclined to the
belief that this substance     actually ethylic alcohol, although the very-
                                      is
small quantities dealt with did not allow of its separation.   The final dis
tillate obtained       is,
                   however, evidently   mixture     and a would therefore be
                                                                    ;       it
unsafe to rely solely on the above test as   sufficient demonstration of the
                                                            a
presence     of alcohol, more particularly               as the proportion        of alcohol,   as cal
culated from the specific gravity, differs widely from that derived from the
vapour-tension, and neither agree with the proportion as calculated from the
amount of acetic acid obtained by oxidation. Moreover, the distillate yields
the iodoform test far more readily than would correspond to its alcoholic
strength as calculated          by
                            any of the above processes, and the appearance
of the precipitate also differs somewhat from that produced in pure dilute
alcohol.  However, while still engaged in the examination of this sub
stance,     the author learned that            M. Lieben,       to whom we owe the introduc

tion of the iodoform test, had already discovered the presence of a volatile
substance in human urine, as well as in that of various animals, which
gives the iodoform test. Working on larger quantities of urine, he has
arrived at the conclusion   that this substance is not alcohol.       M. Lieben
also has failed to isolate and identify the substance, owing to the very
small quantity present in the urine ; he thinks, however, that it may be
one of the odoriferous constituents of the urine. According to the author's
experience this cannot, however, be the case, since, first, the quantity of
substance yielding the iodoform does not seem to be diminished by distil
lation over animal charcoal, whereas the urinous odour is thus almost
entirely removed ; secondly, the urinous odour of the distillate, in case no
animal charcoal was used, is not destroyed by heating with the bichromate
solution,  which nevertheless produces acetic acid ; thirdly, a somewhat
similar substance seems present in the breath. It might be, however, that
the substance giving the iodoform test and that yielding the acetic acid
are two different compounds      ; this must    be left  to future researches  to
decide.
   In  conclusion, it may not  be uninteresting   to point out that the quantity
of substance which yields the acetic acid apparently falls below the normal
proportion just after the effect of a dose or doses of alcohol has passed
off; after which it gradually rises again to the normal standard. A some

     The following communications          were read   : —
 I. "   Contributions       to    the   History of the        Opium Alkaloids." —
        Part V. By C. R. A. Wright, D.Sc, Lecturer on Chemistry
        in St. Mary's Hospital Medical School.                     Communicated by-
        Prof. G. G. Stokes, Sec. R. S. Received March 9, 1872.
                         § 1.   On the Polymerides       of Codeia.
     In Part IV. of     these researches    reasons   have been adduced for the fol
 lowing general conclusions, viz. that codeia and morphia are capable of
 forming polymerides (with the elimination of methyl in the case of codeia in
 some instances), which yield derivatives containing certainly not less than
 C6„ and probably not less than C1M (C72 and C1M in the case of those codeia
 derivatives where methyl has not been eliminated).                Experiments now in
 progress tend to show that the formulee of codeia and morphia are really
 double of those formerly ascribed to these bases, t. e. are C39 H42 N2 0„ and
 C3< H38 N2 O0 respectively, the proof of which is (as will be shown in a sub
 sequent communication) that the first products of the action of hydrochloric
 acid on these bases appear to contain chlorine and carbon in the proportions
 C30   and CI,   C34   and  CI respectively, instead of       C19  and CI,     C17 and  CI.
 It  might be anticipated, therefore, that intermediate polymerides might be
 formed containing respectively : —

    Tetramorphia.     .  C139HlB2N8021            C114 II163 N„  021  . .  Tetracodeia.
    In the  case  of codeia   these anticipations   have been verified.
    In order to obtain        these   supposed polymerides before their further
alteration by secondary reactions, the action of acids other than the
 hydracids was examined.            Acetic acid seemed a probable agent for this
purpose ; but no appreciable quantity of any thing different from ordinary
codeia was obtained after sixty-four hours' digestion at 100° of one part of
this base with three parts of glacial acetic acid.            On precipitation of the
product by Na2 C03 in large excess, extraction with ether, and agitation
 of the ethereal extract with H CI, a crystalline mass was obtained which
 developed a smell of acetic acid on standing in contact with a slight excess
of H CI   ; but on analysis this'gave numbers agreeing with those required for
codeia hydrochlorate, and from it nothing different from codeia could be
obtained ; probably therefore only a trace of acetyl-codeia was formed.
    The action of phosphoric acid, however, was found to lead to the desired
result without the formation of bye-products beyond colouring-matters
formed by the high temperature employed ; by heating codeia with 3 parts
of glacial phosphoric acid and 5 of water for several hours at 100°, no per

 ceptible change is produced.      The same result follows on boiling for twelve
hours (boiling-point 105°) with an inverted condenser attached to prevent
loss of water by evaporation ; but if the boiling-point be allowed to rise
slowly from evaporation, the mixture being very gently boiled in a long-
necked flask, the product gradually acquires the power of giving an imme
diate amorphous precipitate with Nna C03 ; no large amount of new sub
stances are, however, formed until the boiling-point has risen to about 200°,
beyond which point the evaporation cannot safely be pushed.             The viscid
chestnut-coloured liquid, while still hot, is dissolved in boiling water and
allowed to cool ; nothing separates on cooling : when cold, the liquid is
nearly neutralized by caustic soda, and then precipitated with Na, C03 ;
the precipitate is collected on filters, drained from mother-liquors, dissolved
in weak H CI, and reprecipitated by Na2 C03, to get rid of traces of unal
tered codeia mechanically retained ; finally, the drained precipitate is ex
hausted with ether.     The ethereal solution yields on agitation with H CI a
crystalline hydrochlorate, which may be purified by solution in water,
fractional precipitation with Na2 C03, and repetition of the ether process,
and finally by recrystallization of the resulting hydrochlorate.
   The portion of the first Na3 C03 precipitate insoluble in ether    is dissolved
in   H CI,  and fractionally precipitated by Na2 C03, to remove colouring-
matters as much as possible : the last precipitate, after thorough washing
and drying, forms a light buff-coloured amorphous powder that does not
soften at 100° when perfectly dry, but clots to a resinous mass if heated in
the water-bath while still moist ; it is soluble in alcohol, is precipitated from
this solution on addition of ether, and yields salts that have no vestige of
crystalline characters.
   Both the crystalline      and the non-crystalline hydrochlorates yield on
analysis numbers identical with those required for codeia hydrochlorate ;
for the reasons developed in the subsequent sections, they are regarded as
respectively di- and tetracodeia.
   The filtrate from the original Na2 COs precipitate contains much un
altered codeia ; by extracting with ether and agitation of the extract with
excess   of phosphoric-acid    solution,  a mixture  of phosphates is obtained,
from which    a further quantity   of  each polymeride is obtainable by simply
boiling down the liquid till the boiling-point reaches 200°.
    The hydrochlorate of tetracodeia obtained as above described forms a
brownish brittle tar, not fusible at 100° when dry; dried at 100° it yields
 the following numbers    : —

    In appearance and most physical properties, tetracodeia and its salts bear
a great resemblance          to chloro- and bromo-tetracodeia          ;   and they further
agree    in that all yield a blood-red colour         on warming with,          silver nitrate
and nitric acid, or with nitric acid alone ; it differs from chloro-tetracodeia
in that the aqueous solution of the hydrochlorate does not precipitate on the
 addition of strong H CI, the salt being apparently as soluble in diluted II CI
 as in water    ;  also the free base does not oxidize so readily.            In all respects
 tetracodeia agrees with the description given by Anderson                    of his   " amor

 phous                    obtained   by the action of sulphuric acid on codeia.
 On comparison with the product obtained by Anderson's process, no essen
 tial differences could be detected between the two substances, except that
 the phosphoric-acid product was somewhat darker in tint, owing no doubt
 to the presence of colouring-matters from the higher temperature employed
 in its production.

 solution formed by the decomposition.
   Dicodeia and its salts do not yield a blood-red               colour with N03 H, only
a  slight orange     tint;    Fes Cl0,    also   SO5IIj +     K., Cr207,    give no colour-
reactions.
   In general properties, and in the fact that the water of crystallization
possessed by the hydrochlorate is lost at 1 00°, dicodeia bears a great re
semblance to the "isomer of codeia" obtained by Drs. Matthiessen and
Armstrong by the action of diluted sulphuric acid on codeia*.                       On com
parison with the product obtained by Armstrong's process, no difference
whatever was discernible provided the hydrochlorate obtained by the action
of sulphuric acid &c. were several times recrystallized.                  The crude hydro
chlorate contains, besides the dicodeia salt, the hydrochlorate of another
polymeride which       differs from dicodeia hydrochlorate              in that it is non
crystalline, drying up to a gummy, extremely hygroscopic and deliquescent
substance ; it yields a blood-red colour with N03 II, and with S04 H2 + K2

soluble  in ether and but little changed by exposure to air.  From these
properties, which seem to be analogous in some respects to dicodeia, in
others to tetracodeia, the base is considered to be intermediate between
these  two polymerides, i. e. to be tricodeia.  The crude hydrochlorate
of dicodeia obtained by Armstrong's process furnished on recrystallization
mother-liquors which, on standing over S04 H2 for several weeks, gradually
deposited crystals, and finally became a crystalline mass wetted with a
viscid non-crystalline liquid : by gentle pressure in filter-paper the liquid
portion was separated from the crystals, which were found to be only
dicodeia hydrochlorate ; and finally the treacly hydrochlorate of tricodeia
was extracted from the papers by water.     On repetition of the treatment
over S04 Ha, no crystals were obtained even after several weeks' standing                        ;

  (a) Tetracodeia. — Tetracodeia hydrochlorate was boiled for six hours
with a large excess of strong HC1 ; no perceptible evolution of methyl
chloride took place ; and on examining the resulting product no change
was found in the ratio of carbon to chlorine.  Hence no substitution of
CI for OH had taken place, and apparently no action at all had ensued.

exhausted with ether,   viscid non-crystalline hydrochlorate was obtained on

similarity observed between this product and "apocodeia" made by Mat-

the action of zinc chloride on codeia is a mixture of bodies of general for
mula (C18 Nl9 N02)„, raHCl, in which the derivative where »=6 greatly
predominates : experiments on the action of zinc chloride on morphia now
in progress in conjunction with Herr L. Mayer indicate that mixtures are

    The physical properties of this substance are almost identical with those
of the bodies of analogous constitution (containing C130) formerly obtained
from both codeia and morphia (Part IV.). Carbonate of sodium throws down
 a precipitate almost insoluble in ether, showing that polymerization to the
tetra series has taken place ; agitated with a large bulk of ether, this preci
pitate furnishes an extract which, on agitation with dilute nitric acid and boil
ing with AgN03 and N03 H of the nitrate thus obtained, yields a precipi
tate of Agl, showing that iodine is contained in the precipitated base.
The substance itself, boiled with AgN03 and HN03, produces a deep
 orange-colour, intermediate in tint between the blood-red produced by the
 derivatives of polymerized       C17 Hls N03, and the          deep yellow of those of

during the polymerization to dicodeia and to tetracodeia, and furnishes
another proof of the conclusion come to in Part IV.       that the addition                §    2,

         § 4. Action  of Sulphuric Addon      Codeia and its Polymerides.
     The results detailed in the previous      sections show that the action      of
 sulphuric     acid on codeia is to polymerize it with the formation of di-,
 tri-, and tetracodeia, the substances obtained by Armstrong and by An
 derson by this means being identical with the first and last of these bases.
 It  appears probable that tetracodeia may be formed by the further poly
 merization of dicodeia, whereas it would seem as though tricodeia were
 not likely to be obtained from dicodeia ; on the other hand, it is pos
 sible that tetracodeia is directly produced from codeia, and that it could not
 be formed from dicodeia.       To settle this point, pure dicodeia was heated
 to very gentle ebullition with sulphuric acid diluted with its own bulk
of water for five hours, the operation being conducted in a long-necked
 flask,   so that  no appreciable concentration by evaporation took place.
 At   the end of this time the dicodeia was wholly converted into a base, of
which ether dissolved only traces, and hence no tricodeia was formed.
After precipitation by NaaC03 and drying, the free base was dissolved
in alcohol and fractionally precipitated by ether. If the alcoholic solu
tion be nearly free from water, the ether throws down solid amorphous
flakes ; but if 10 or more per cent, of water be present, the ether precipi
tate is a tarry fluid containing water, alcohol, and the base.            Flakes of
tetracodeia were thus obtained identical in all respects with that obtained
by the action of phosphoric acid ; a trace of some product of the further
action    of sulphuric   acid appeared to be present, however, as the free
base turned slightly green on drying, without, however, absorbing so much
oxygen as to make any appreciable difference in its composition.            Dried at
100°, 0-221 grm. gave 0-583       C02 and 0142        H20.

    If the  action of sulphuric acid be pushed further than this point, a smell
of SO, is perceptible, and the product obtained rapidly oxidizes on preci
pitation by Na3 C03 and exposure to air.              Nothing fit for analysis was
obtained    from  the product, which   probably    is  formed by the dehydration,
oxidation, and possibly demethylization       of tetracodeia.
  § 5.   On the Physiological     Action of the foregoing Polymerides.          By
    Reginald StoCker, M.B., Pathologist           in St. Mary's Hospital Medical
    School.
    An aqueous solution of the hydrochlorate of codeia and its polymerides
was in each case employed, being subcutaneously injected into adult cats (a

dog being also employed in a few experiments), quantities equivalent to O'l
grm. of the anhydrous salt being used in each experiment.                Four cats were
employed,     several   trials  being  made    with    each  animal,   and three or four
days being allowed to intervene between each experiment, so that the effects
of one dose had entirely passed away and the animal entirely recovered
before the administration         of another dose.         The main results observed
were as follow    :—
    Codeia. — Four experiments.          In  each instance     dilated pupils ; cerebral
congestion     (determined by ophthalmoscopic             examination), and much in
creased reflex excitability (epileptic convulsions in one case) ; salivation and
purging in two cases ; vomiting not produced in any case.
    IHcodeia. — Two experiments. In each instance vomiting ; fundus of eye
not congested ; pupil dilated in one case.
    Another experiment with a dog (full-grown she-terrier) produced sali
vation and purging without vomiting ; no cerebral congestion.
    Tricodeia. — Three experiments.           In each case salivation (profuse) and
dilated pupils ; no cerebral congestion ; in one case slight excitement, in
the others purging and depression : vomiting produced in one of these two
latter instances, micturation in the other.
     Tetracodeia.  — Four      experiments.       In each case profuse salivation,
micturation, and depression ; dilated pupils in three instances, and lachry-
 mation in two ; in one case vomiting and purging, in another increased
reflex excitability with an occasional convulsion (cat was weak and not in
 good condition) ; slight hypnotism in two cases.
     In two experiments with the dog, salivation and depression only were
 produced.
     From  these results    it would appear that codeia produces cerebral con
 gestion and increased reflex excitability without vomiting ; whilst di- and
 tetracodeia produce profuse salivation and some depression, with vomiting in
 several instances, no evidence of cerebral congestion and but little of in
 creased reflex excitability     being noticeable.
                                    § 6. Conclusions.
     The foregoing results suggest the probability of other bases being
 capable of forming similar polymerides.                 In anticipation of this result
 experiments are in progress         with  morphia.
     Hesse  has   shown*      that  by  the  action of HC1 on thebaine there are
 produced two isomerides of that base, one forming crystalline salts, one
 amorphous salts      ;  not improbably      these   are   respectively dithebaine     andl0.

This final discussion will contain the determination of the astronomical
elements of the sun on the basis of photographic observations          and this    ;
work, they anticipate, will not only settle the question of rotation for   con           a

have only recently been brought under the consideration of scientific men.

       F.C.S.      Received March 14, 1872.
   In our experiments                        copper and nitrate of silver in
                               on the action between
solution, we frequently noticed that the tips of the silver crystals became
red, as though coated with    thin layer of metallic copper.

under which       occurred.
                 it         We found that      took place only when theit
nitrate of silver was exhausted, and only on those silver crystals which
remained in metallic connexion with the copper.   We found, too, that the
cupreous coating formed most readily where air had the freest access, and,
in fact, that   would not form at all in vessels from which oxygen was
                 it
excluded, nor on those white crystals which were far below the surface of
the liquid, though they might be in immediate contact with the copper
plate.   When an inverted jar was filled with nitrate-of-copper solution and
silver crystals resting on branches of copper, and the liquid was displaced
by oxygen gas,      was found that the tips of the crystals became red, and
                   it

1872.]              Action of Oxygen on Copper Nitrate.                       291
the solution gradually filled the jar again by the absorption of the gas. In
the same way the oxygen was absorbed from air, or from its mixtures with
hydrogen or carbonic anhydride.
    This action was further studied by employing plates of the two metals
instead of copper covered with silver crystals.         When the two plates, con
nected by a wire, were partially immersed        in  an ordinary aqueous solution
of copper nitrate, it   was found that a    slight yellowish deposit  made its ap
pearance speedily all over the silver plate, and went on increasing for a day
or two, while at the air-line there was a thicker deposit, which gradually
grew and extended itself a little below the surface.         This deposit changed
from yellowish     to red, and under the microscope presented a distinctly
crystalline appearance.
    Thinking that this slight crust all over the silver plate was due to air
dissolved in the solution itself, we took advantage of the reaction to pre
pare copper nitrate absolutely free from dissolved oxygen.           An ordinary
 solution of the salt mixed with some silver nitrate was placed in a narrow
 cylinder, with a long piece of copper-foil arranged somewhat spirally, so
 as to retain the deposited silver on its surface, and allowed to rest for twenty-
 four hours.     The solution thus obtained was exposed to the action of the
 conjoined copper and silver plates ; but even after some hours there was no
 dimming of the lustre of the silver plate, except at the air-line, which was
 sharply defined.    The same solution, shaken for some time in the air, pro
 duced a yellowish deposit on the white metal in three minutes.
    The colour and general appearance of this crust, together with its forma
 tion only where oxygen can be absorbed, showed that it was not metallic
 copper, but the suboxide.      This was further proved by the action of dilute
 sulphuric acid, which resolves it at once into red metallic copper and
 copper sulphate.     There is also another curious reaction, which can only
 be properly observed under a microscope.         "When treated with a solution of
 silver nitrate, this cupreous deposit does not give the ordinary crystals of
 the white metal ; in fact it is only slowly acted upon ; but presently there
 shoot forth thin threads of silver, which ran through the liquid, often
 twisting at sharp angles, while the yellowish crystals change to black.
 This also was found to be a property of the suboxide of copper.
    This deposition of oxide on the silver is accompanied by a corresponding
 solution of copper from the other plate.         Thus, in an experiment made
 with nitrate-of-copper solution that had been exposed to air, and which
 was allowed to continue for four days, there was found        : —
                       Gain of silver plate 0'016 grm.
                       Loss of copper plate 0-015 grm.
    The copper necessary for the production of 0*016 grm. of suboxide would
 be a little above 0-014 grm.
    The wire connecting the two plates in this experiment is capable of de
 flecting a galvanometer.      The current takes place through the fluid from

 292             Messrs. Scott and Galloway        on the Connexion     [Apr. 18
 copper to silver, that is, in the same direction as if the copper had been
 dissolved by an acid and hydrogen evolved on the silver plate.
     If the two plates have their sides parallel, the suboxide is deposited not
 merely on that side of the silver plate which faces the copper, but after
 about a minute on the other side also, showing that in this, as in other
 cases, the lines of force curve round.
     It became interesting  to consider what started this electric current.   The
 original observations convinced us that it was not due to the action of oxygen
 on the copper ; but, to make the matter more certain, bright copper and
 silver plates in conjunction were immersed, the copper in a pure, t. e. deoxy-
 genized, solution of nitrate of copper, the silver in an oxygenized solution :
 the two liquids communicated through the diaphragm of a divided cell.
 In half   an hour the silver plate was covered with a reddish film, while not
 a trace of tarnish was perceptible on the copper.             On continuing this
 experiment    for three   hours,   it   was  found   that the  copper plate lost
 0-003 grm., and the silver plate was increased by 0'004 grm.         On cleaning
the plates, and reversing their position, the copper was covered with a film
of oxide, while the silver remained free from cupreous deposit.        We believe
therefore that, through the simultaneous action of the two metals, the
 dissolved salt is put into such a state of tension that oxygen brings about a
chemical change which otherwise would be impossible, and that this change
is initiated in close proximity to the more negative metal.
    Though we have examined only this particular reaction, we have satis
fied ourselves that it is not an isolated fact.         Each of the elements con
cerned may be replaced by others : thus, the sulphate may be substituted
for the nitrate of copper, or platinum may be used instead of silver;
chlorine may take the place of oxygen, with the production of the sub-
chloride instead of the suboxide;       and zinc may be employed as the positive
metal, with zinc chloride as the salt in solution, in which case copper may
be taken as the negative metal, and on its surface will form a deposit of
oxide of zinc.

        By Robert II. Scott, M.A., F.R.S., and William Galloway,
        Esq., Mining Engineer.         Received   March 19, 1872.
    The   gas commonly called
                                  " Fire-damp,"     to the mixture of which with

 especially in the shallower mines, where the tension of the gas is not great
 and the fissures are open. On the other hand, the effect of a given quan
 tity of gas in rendering the air of a mine explosive must depend on the
 supply of pure air to the workings.
     It has long been observed that when the barometer, after having stood
 at a high level for a time, begins to fall more or less rapidly, the accumu
 lations of foul air and gas in the goaves and fissures of a mine emit part
 of their contents into the ventilating-currents       which flow past them.
     It is also well known that as the very existence of these currents de
 pends, in almost every case, on the difference of temperature between two
 columns of air, those in the downcast and upcast shaft respectively, any
 increase in the temperature of the external air, from which the downcast
shaft receives its supply, must necessarily render the circulation under
ground more sluggish.
    It is therefore obvious that the tendency to explosion will be increased
when the ordinary causes which lead to the fouling of the air in a mine,
 such as falls of roofs and leakages in the air-courses, are assisted from
without by the meteorological phenomena we have just mentioned ; and
 several investigators have compiled lists of explosions, in order to compare
them with the meteorological observations which have been recorded prior
 to and at the time of the accidents.
    At the Meeting of the British Association at Glasgow in 1855, Mr. T.
 Dobson, B. A., read a paper " On the Relation between Explosions in Coal
mines and Revolving Storms," which is printed entire among the Reports.
The reasoning in this paper is to a great extent based upon a diagram
given by Mr. J. Dickinson, Inspector for the North and East Lancashire
 District, in his Report for 1852, which shows the daily march of the
barometer during that year at Manchester, and the explosions which oc
curred in his district during the year.
    Mr. Dickinson, in his Report for 1866, gives a diagram showing a con
tinuous barogram recorded at Manchester for one week (December 8-1 5th,
 1866), characterized by a remarkable barometrical depression. Between
the 10th and 13th of December 463 lives were lost in six different explo
sions, the two accidents at the      "Oaks" Colliery causing 361 deaths.
    In the 'Transactions of the North of England Institute of Mining
Engineers' (vol. xix.) diagrams are given showing the meteorological re
cords from the Observatories of Kew and Glasgow for 1868 and 1869, and
the explosions reported during those years.            No discussion is given, but
the diagrams have been carefully compiled by the secretary, Mr. Bunning,
and we have extracted the list of explosions for 1868 from this paper.
    Lastly, in the 'Journal of the Austrian Meteorological Society' for
February 1872, Herr F. M. Simmersbach * has published a paper on the
   * "TJeber   den Einfluss meteorologiecher  Vorgange auf die Luftcirculation unter

subject   of the present communication,      but it does  not call for special
notice.
   Mr. Dobson's    is the most elaborate discussion  of the subject which has
yet appeared, and we must devote a few words to it.
   One of the diagrams in his paper exhibits 491 explosions in five-day
periods, and from it the author concludes that the annual march of the
curve coincides with the march of temperature, with a relative maximum
occurring in the autumn, which he attributes to the frequency of serious
storms at that time of the year.
    To this we can only say that the maximum and minimum of annual
temperature do not occur at the precise epochs named by Mr. Dobson,
and that the last quarter of the year cannot be considered as preeminently
stormy, at least not more so than such a month as the January (1872)
which has just passed.
    In order to test this question of periodicity, we have collected from the
 Reports of the Inspectors of Mines all the recorded explosions for the last
twenty years. These explosions are only the fatal ones, and include a few
accidents due to suffocation by "choke-damp," or carbonic-acid gas.       We
consider that we may fairly count such accidents as due to causes closely
related to those which produce explosions of " fire-damp."
    We plotted the whole of     these explosions in two decennial periods for
 the seventy-three intervals of five days each, and found that the curves
 hardly showed any agreement with each other, so that no confirmation
 was obtained for     Mr. Dobson's alleged periodicity.    The curve for the
 entire period of twenty years, including 1369 accidents, was also con
 structed, and all that is worth notice about it is that the number of acci
 dents is somewhat greater in October than in other months. The absolute
 maximum falls at the end of January, and the absolute minimum in the
 middle of September.
    From   a comparison  of the two decennial curves we learn that the number
 of fatal accidents has    decreased  from 768 in the former (1851-1860) to
 601 in the latter period   (1861-1870), notwithstanding the great augmen
 tation of the output of coal during the time in question.
     We do not consider it worth while to reproduce these curves.
     At this juncture there is one matter which deserves attention, viz. that
 the number of serious accidents, involving the loss of ten or more lives,
 has very materially increased during the last five years.      The number of
 such explosions during the years 1851-1855 (inclusive) was 13; 1856-
  1860, 15; 1861-1865, 12; and 1866-1870, 21.            On this matter we do
 not offer any opinion, but it seems to us desirable to place the figures on
 record.
     For the purposes of the present paper we have taken the continuous
 records furnished by the Observatory of Stonyhurst, one of the seven
 established by the Meteorological Committee.        These records exist from
 the 1st of January 1 868, and the curves for the years 1869 and 18/0 have

1872.]          between Explosions in Collieries and Weather.                295
been published in the Quarterly Weather Report.            Stonyhurst has been
selected inasmuch as from its situation, near Preston, it is more central as
regards the coal-districts than any of the other observatories.
     In the case of certain accidents, more especially in the South-Wales and
Scotch districts, the records from Falmouth or Glasgow respectively
might possibly throw more light on the matter, but we have thought it
hardly worth while to complicate the diagrams by introducing them.
     The curves for barometrical pressure and for temperature have been
plotted from the daily maxima and minima registered for the years 1868,
1869, and 1870.        The curves have not been actually reduced from the
photographic     records, as the horizontal scale has been so much compressed ;
but they afford a fairly correct representation of the march of the pheno
mena, and for the last two years they can be compared, if necessary, witli
the Quarterly Weather Report.
     One serious disturbing cause interferes with the value of these curves,
arising from the weekly suspension of work in the collieries, and in many
instances of ventilation,    too, on Sundays.    The influence of this was elimi
nated in the former investigation,      when we were seeking for periodicity, as
we dealt with as many as twenty years.
     The dates of the fatal explosions are all given in the Inspector's Annual
Reports, those of the non-fatal explosions for 1868 have been taken from
Mr. Bunning's paper. For the facts relating to the years 1869 and 1870
we are indebted to the kindness of the Inspectors, who have almost without
 exception responded to our application by furnishing all the information
 which it was in their power to give.
     The occurrences have all been entered to their proper dates, and the
 districts in which they were reported have been noted.           Fatal accidents
 are marked by a bar.
      We have marked by special symbols all the explosions which appear to
 us to be connected with sudden changes in atmospherical pressure or with
 abnormally high temperature ; a few of the occurrences may possibly be
 attributable to the conjoint action of these two causes.
      Mr. Dobson, writing at a time when all our serious barometrical oscilla
 tions were imagined to be connected with true cyclones, considered that,
 as in the front of such an advancing storm the barometer is falling and the
 temperature rising, he was justified in putting down the liability to ex
 plosion as a phenomenon of the anterior segment of such a storm.              He
 does not, however, give a continuous record of weather so that we can see
 how many storms were unaccompanied by explosions.              There can be no
 doubt of the coincidence of certain serious explosions with severe storms ;
 a notable instance of this will be found on the 8th of October, 1870 ; but
 the explosions do not happen only at the commencement of a barome
  trical depression, but occur also two or three days after the barometer has
  reached its lowest point and is again rising.          We have taken a limit
  of three days.
                                                                    y2

    The   cause  of this prolongation of the dangerous period is that when
fire-damp issues in greater quantity than usual from cavities and fissures
into the workings, and more especially into places where the air is stagnant
and already more or less foul by admixture of gas, the volume of the
explosive portion of this mixture will increase in consequence of the in
creased rapidity of diffusion, or, in other words, the explosive boundary
will extend itself. This extension of the explosive boundary is gradual,
 and in some cases a considerable           time may elapse before the boundary
 has reached its extreme limits and begins again to recede.                     During
 all this period the mine will be in an abnormally dangerous state.
    Meanwhile, although the pressure of the atmosphere rises, and a current
 sets in   backwards*     into the cavities whence the pure gas has just issued,
 yet if the entrance to such a cavity be at a lower level than the highest
 portion of the space occupied by such escaped gas, which rises, owing to
 its low density, it is evident that what is driven back into the cavity will
 be a mixture      of gas and air, and that no portion of the gas which lies
 above the level of the aperture to the cavity can be driven back into it.
  Accordingly a certain volume of this pure gas remains, diffusing itself freely
 and fouling the surrounding air.
     It is evident from these considerations that, in the case of continued un
  steadiness of pressure and repeated violent oscillations of the barometer,
  we need not expect that each of these reductions of pressure will cause the
  efflux of a quantity of gas proportionate to the extent of such reduction.
  If the successive falls of the mercury are of less magnitude than the first,
  or than any previous one in the series, the quantity of gas given off cannot
  possibly be as great on each occasion as if that fall had been preceded by
  a period of high pressure.        If, however, any of the later oscillations be
  more serious than their predecessors, a certain fresh supply of pure gas
  will be given off.     Hence we see that, as a general rule, we do not find a
  succession   of explosions at a time when the barometer is in a state of
  continued violent oscillation.
      Recurring to what     has  already been said about temperature, we would
  here remark that in cold weather the ventilation          of the pits is exceedingly
  active, many collieries being ventilated easily by natural means without any
  extraneous agency whatever.           In the height of summer, however, it is
  different ; for then the temperature of the air in the downcast shaft is higher,
  and the ventilation       can  only   be kept   up by the help of the furnace.
  In  some cases, then, a sudden rise      of temperature may catch the miner un
  prepared, and where an active current would have remained safe, a sluggish
  one may become foul, and possibly an explosion may occur.
     We shall now proceed to a discnssion              of the facts represented on
  the Plate for the years 1868, 1869, 1870.

                                        1868.
    The first quarter of this year was very exceptionally stormy, in fact
Mr. Buchan, in a paper printed in the ' Atlas Meteorologique ' for 1 868,
states that during the sixty-three       days comprised between the 13th of
January and the 26th of March, as many as twenty-seven distinct storms
passed over the north of Europe. We attribute thirty accidents which
occurred     during this period to barometrical   causes.
    The first serious depression occurred on the 1 Sth of January, when three
explosions were recorded, with a fourth on the 20th ; the barometer re
mained     unsteady for some days and reached a very low level on February 1,
where     we find four explosions close to each other.       The disturbances of
pressure of the 7th and 1 9th of February caused, the former two, the latter
three explosions, as did also that of March 1 1th.
    In April the temperature began to rise to a considerable height during
the day, so that the amount of daily range was large ; and so we attribute
two explosions        to this cause.    The serious storm of April 21st was
accompanied       by five accidents.
    A   period of warm weather set in in May ; and we attribute the batch of
accidents between the 15th and 20th to temperature, and similarly those at
the beginning of June and July.         Occasionally accidents referable to tem
perature     are also reported up to the middle of September.
    After that date     we find two months which were comparatively      free from
explosions, and also from serious storms.          The first great disturbance of
pressure which succeeded was on the 22nd of November, and it resulted in
six explosions,     extending over a period of four days.
    The atmosphere was nearly      as much disturbed in December as in January,
and we count        thirteen accidents as due to oscillations of the barometer.
The most serious group was that of five, which accompanied the heavy
storm of December 21st.
    In all we have in 1868 154 explosions (44 of them fatal), and of these
72 seem to be due to changes of pressure, 4 1 to rise of temperature, while
4 1 appear to us to be more or less independent of either of these agencies.
                                        1869.
    The first two depressions of the year, those of January 8th and January
 15th, were each accompanied by explosions, and on the 27th a period of
 prolonged violent disturbance set in.          Two very marked barometrical
 oscillations passed over all our stations, bringing with them heavy equato
 rial storms on January 28th and February 1st. Seven explosions are re
 corded between        the 2/th and 29th, while the oscillation of the first only
 caused one.      Pressure was very low during the first half of February, the
 lowest reading being recorded on the 8th, with one explosion, followed by
 three others on the next three days.
     The storm of February 12th, which was very destructive to shipping in
 the Channel, was not marked by any colliery accidents, as the oscillation of

298             Messrs. Scott and Galloway on       the Connexion      [Apr. 18,
the barometer, unusually violent though it was, did not extend beyond the
southern stations, and was very transient in its character.
    At the end of February the weather was again much disturbed, the
barograms reaching their lowest points on the 1st of March, when we find
two explosions.      Two more followed on the 1 1 th, while the depression of
the 17th caused three.         Slight disturbances, accompanied by one or two
explosions, occurred up to April 4th.
    A sudden period of warm weather appears on the 10th of         April, the five-
 day mean for the period from April 1 1th to April 1 5th, at Stonyhurst and
 Glasgow, being nearly 10° warmer than those which preceded and followed
it ; so that we consider ourselves justified in referring seven of the explosions
during this period to temperature.
    Another oscillation of the barometer occurred on the 16 th, which was
most serious in the north of England, and we find three explosions.            The
batch of four accidents on the 26th and 27th of April we refer to tempe
rature.    From this till the 7th of June we find only one accident referable
to atmospherical causes ; but on that day, as well as on the 24th and the
2nd of July, we find several explosions coincident with great warmth of the
weather.
    The storm of June 15th     seems to have caused four explosions.     The  1 7th
of July was a very hot day, and so were the days immediately succeeding
it ; and we find six explosions close to each other, the last, that on July 21st,
being the
            " Haydock "     accident, which cost fifty-nine lives.
    The first serious disturbance of pressure in the autumn was on Sep
tember 1 1th, when a heavy gale swept up the Channel ; and we find at this
time a batch of accidents, which we attribute to barometrical causes.
    On the 16th of October we had another serious disturbance, and seven
explosions occurred within four days.        The depression of the 29th caused
three, and after that date there was nothing to call for special remark till
the 21st of November.        On this day a most extensive and sudden diminu
tion of pressure was observed, the account of which, as given in the Quarterly
Weather Report, is as follows : —
    "The actual fall of the barometer,         within twenty-four     hours,    had
exceeded 0-9 in. over the entire district, stretching from Dover to Valencia,
and from L'Orient to Shields.        The superficial extent of this area is about
                             '
200,000 square miles."
    This oscillation  wfts marked by four accidents.
    At  the beginning of December the barometer ranged very high ; but
from the 13th to the 18th a period of violent oscillation is observed, the
absolute minimum for the year being recorded in Scotland.            Between the
13th and 15th seven explosions are registered, five of which were in the
Scotch coal-fields.
    The year closed with a fall of the barometer, and three accidents in the
North-Staffordshire district.
    On the whole, we have in J 869 192 explosions (47 of which were fatal);

] 872.]         between  Explosions in Collieries and Weather.              299
92 of them we attribute to oscillations of the barometer, 34 to temperature,
while 66 are left unaccounted for by either agency.
                                      1870.
    The storm of January 8th     caused two explosions, and the depression    of
the 14th was followed by two others.       The barometer then remained un
usually high    from  the  16th to the 25th  ; and as soon as it began to give
way, we have three explosions on the 27th, and two more to correspond
with the barometrical minimum on the 31st.
    The barometer at most stations read below 29-5 ins. during the first ten
days of February, and we find seven accidents between the 4th and 9th ;
these were followed by as many more within the next few days, with a
high barometer and cold weather, which are therefore not referred by us
to either deficiency of pressure or a high temperature.      One of these cost
thirty lives.
    Pressure was very unsteady and low at the end of February, and eight
accidents occurred between the 21st and 26th       ; another somewhat similar
series is observable in the second week in March.
    On the 5th of April the daily range of the thermometer was considerahle,
 22° at Stonyhurst     and 26° at Kew j and we refer two explosions to this
 cause.
    The sudden outbreak of hot weather on the 16th, and the high tempe
 rature of 71°p7 at Stonyhurst on the 20th of May, account for two explo
 sions in the adjoining coal-field on that day, with a third in the west of
 Scotland.
    The weather was very hot from the 3rd to the 8th of June, and we find
 three explosions on the 4th, and one each on the 6th and 8th; then follow
 three, which we trace to the fall of the barometer. June 1 9th to the 22nd
 were also very hot days, especially in the centre and south  of England  ;  and
 of the six accidents reported at this time two were in the southern and
 central coal-fields.
    In the months of July and August we have connected various explosions
 with the high temperature then prevailing.       A period of serious disturb
 ance existed from the 1st to the 1 1th of September, and we have eight ex
 plosions, and four more on the 13th. At the end of the month the weather
 became very warm, and we find six explosions close to each other.
     The month of October     was peculiarly  stormy, and the first fall of the
  barometer occurred on the 7th and 8th ; on the latter day we have five
 explosions; another sudden depression on the 12th was followed by three.
  The oscillations of the 16th and 19th had but little influence ; but on the
  23rd the barometer again fell very low, and we find six explosions in three
  days.
     The next serious group of accidents was about the 20th of November,
  when we find several recorded simultaneously with a low state of the baro
 meter. The mercury then rose and continued very high for some days ;

300               Messrs. Scott and Galloway on the Connexion                   [Apr. 18,
but on the      1 1 th   of December   a serious fall is observed, and two accidents
occurred next day.   The explosions which appear at the end of the year
do not seem to be referable to pressure.
  On the whole, we find in 1 870 1 79 explosions (67 of them fatal), of which
92 are due to the state  of the barometer, 43 to the temperature, while 44
remain  unaccounted  for  by either of these agencies.
   As a general summary, we consider that out of 525 explosions recorded
in the three years, 49 per cent, may be reasonably connected with dis
turbance of the barometer, 22 per cent, with abnormally high tempera
ture, while 29 per cent, are not traceable to atmospherical agency.
  [Since handing in the paper, we have received the statistics of non-fatal
explosions in the mines of Yorkshire during the years 1869 and 1870.
  In 1869 there were eight occurrences, of which we attribute four to the
state     of the barometer,   one to temperature, while three are unaccounted         for.
     In   1870 there were seventeen         occurrences, of which we attribute six to
the state of the barometer, four to temperature, while seven are unac
counted for.
   These figures raise the total number of accidents to 550, but do not ma
terially alter the percentages given in the text.  The facts have been in
serted in the diagrams.       — April      13, 1872.]
     It
     may not be out of place to discuss briefly the manner in which an in
creased supply of gas or a diminished supply of air brought about by any
of the causes just alluded to, leads to a fouling of the ventilating-current
in its    passage through the workings         ;   and also how the comparative purity
or foulness of the ventilating-current              affects the condition of the air in
places adjoining its course.
     The   gas flows from the fissures       of the coal and stone either into    a venti
lating-current, by which it is carried out of the mine, as when it escapes at
the face of a long-wall working or bratticed bord, or from the sides of an
air-course ; or, secondly, it flows into a quiet atmosphere, such as that in
goaves and cavities in the roof whence stone has fallen, in unbratticed bords,
or in recesses between pack-walls in long-wall workings.       In any of these
latter cases it diffuses itself into the surrounding air, and an accumulation
of   a more or less explosive character is generated.
  As long as the average quantity of air is circulating in the mine and the
quantity of gas which escapes into the workings is not suddenly increased,
we may take it for granted that little danger exists ; for the districts of the
mine in which explosive mixtures are to be met with are clearly defined and
well known, so that precautions can be taken to prevent ignition.
   As soon as these conditions are in any way changed       e.,   the supply
                                                                    (i.    if
of air be diminished in quantity or deteriorated in quality               by
                                                                an increased
escape of gas), explosive mixtures may make their appearance in places
where no danger had previously existed.
  It may be assumed that         ventilating-current consists of pure air
                                       a

when it starts from  the end of the in-take air-course   on its passage
through  the workings, and that for every equal space it travels between
the in-take and return air-course it receives an equal quantity of gas.
Thus when it arrives at the return air-course it consists of a mixture
of air and fire-damp, whose constitution depends on the quantity of air
passing through the workings, on the rate at which gas escapes into                                           it,
and on the distance             between the in-take and return air-course.
   It    is   therefore          either the supply of air be diminished or
                             evident that   if
the supply of gas increased, the resulting mixture will be rendered more
explosive, not only in the return air-course, but also at every point of the
passage between the in-take and return air-course.
   If,
     then, from any causes the mixture shall have reached the firing-point
when    enters the return air-course
          it                            any aggravation of these causes

would make the firing-point to travel backwards through the workings
towards the in-take air-course.      In this manner the ventilating-current
may itself become explosive in some parts of its course.     Again, although
the ventilating-current itself may never become explosive, its gradual fouling
may cause explosive mixtures to be generated in certain places, such as
unbratticed  bords, recesses between pack-walls, and cavities in the roof in
the following manner (all other cases may be, more or less directly, re
ferred to these) —       :

which is filled down to the level d                 e   with      a mixture   of air and   gas.   Gas
may flow into such a cavity from a fissure in the sides, or from any lower
part of the seam along the roof and under the edge at a.
  In fig. 2, d b c rj is an unbratticed bord, receiving gas from the face b c,
filled with a similar mixture down to d                      e. The space occupied by the foul
air is shaded in each case              ;   and   e/is   a   plane in that space which is chosen
arbitrarily.
   The plane d e, which bounds the lowest part of the accumulation, is
level, and here the mixture contains the least proportion of fire-damp ; the
impurity of the air increases with the height, and the foulest atmosphere is
found at b, the highest point of the cavity.
   If any gas flows into the cavity a corresponding volume of the contents
of the cavity is displaced and escapes into the ventilating-current.
   Diffusion is also constantly going on ; and as the result of this process is
to produce below the plane cd a. mixture lighter than the ventilating-
current, this mixture rises along the roof and is carried away at C (fig. 1),
d(fig.2).
   Gas is therefore constantly being removed from the cavity, partly by
displacement, partly by diffusion, and its quantity is exactly equal to that
entering the cavity.
  If, now, the ventilating-current become fouled in any of the ways we
have described, the space below the plane c d will be filled with the same
mixture as that in the ventilating-current itself.

ef     be less       foul, and therefore          heavier than that which           now forms the
ventilating-current, the volume of air &c. in the space defe will be
displaced, and no further escape of gas can take place from either ac
cumulation until the whole of the contents above the line c d are more
foul than the mixture below c d. As soon as this condition is fulfilled,
diffusion and displacement will go on.
   In order, however, that the rate of diffusion may be the same as
before, the specific gravity of the whole mass must be reduced, for the
square roots of the specific gravities of the mixtures above and below
the plane cd must bear the same ratio to each other that they did
before the current became fouled.    This reduction of the specific gravity
is,in other words, increased foulness of the air.
   If, then, the mixture in the space     bf was previously near the firing-

cause           to approach     nearer to that point, and so eventually an explo
sive       mixture       may be generated in   cavity while the ventilating-current

                                    a
after the ventilating-current has become purer.
      It   follows, then, that      if      an explosive mixture has been formed             in places

and     under   conditions      similar to those we      have described, some      time,
possibly    several   days, must elapse after the causes which have led to its
formation have disappeared before the contents of such a cavity shall have
been rendered innocuous again.
   We do not propose to treat specially of sudden "eruptions" of gas.
Such occurrences, at least of any serious magnitude, are very rare. When
they do take place in collieries where naked lights are used, the gas
takes fire at the nearest such light, and at most one or two men are
injured.     If  safety-lamps are employed, the gas may pass those which
are in good order and travel on until it meets a defective lamp, when the
¦whole   explodes.
    A few words on the subject of the dependence of ventilation                 on tem
perature above ground may not be undesirable.
    When the temperature of the air at the surface is less than that in the
mine, the phenomenon called Natural Ventilation ensues.                   The colder air
which descends the downcast shaft is heated nearly to the temperature of
the workings on its passage through the air-courses and along the working
faces, and when       it reaches the upcast shaft it has a temperature which is
nearly    constant    if the workings are extensive.         The temperature of the
workings increases with their depth from the surface : thus, speaking
generally, it is 55° at 50 fathoms, 60° at 100, 65° at 150, 70° at 200, and
so   on*.     Now, natural ventilation ceases when the temperature                at the
surface is the same as that in the workings, and, moreover, as the               tempe
rature at the surface rises above that point there is an increasing resistance
to artificial ventilation.
    The amount of the force which produces natural ventilation is still fur
ther modified by the changes in the hygrometric state of the atmosphere.
    For instance, if the tension of aqueous vapour in the air is less than
 that due to the temperature, water will be evaporated in a wet downcast
shaft, and the air will not be able to rise in temperature as it descends,
and may be actually much colder at the bottom than at the top of the
 shaft.    These considerations will show why shallow mines are much less
easily ventilated, and also much more affected by surface temperature
than deep ones.         Whatever be the artificial means adopted for producing
ventilation at any mine, the quantity of air passing through the workings
must vary with every variation of the natural force, unless the artificial
power be changed at the same time.              It follows, therefore, that if there be
no means for ascertaining what is the actual quantity of air supplied to
the workings at every instantt, a slight decrease, sufficient to bring the
colliery   into a dangerous state,        may take place without being noticed.
   * Report of the Commissioners appointed to inquire into several matters relating to
 Coal, 1871, vol. i. p. vii, and Heport A, p. 86.
   t The Select Committees on Accidents in Mines, 1835 and 1852, were aware of this,
and were anxious to introduce instruments whereby         a constant check might be kept
over the ventilation.

304               Messrs. Scott and Galloway on the Connexion                  [Apr. 18,
The first intimation in such          a case is the   fouling of the currents ; the arti
ficial power may then be increased and the crisis passed without accident,
but if an explosion takes place there is no trace of its cause discoverable.
     One example of an explosion which happened under these circumstances
may not be out of place.             It occurred in winter. The temperature of the
air rose    for  two   days   in  succession    to a higher point than it had reached
for a considerable time before. On the second day, when natural venti
lation would cease in many shallow mines and become sluggish in deeper
ones, an explosion took place by which many men were killed.
     After the accident the Inspector for the district visited the mine ; he
 described     it  as having      strong natural ventilation, and looked upon the
 explosion as a mystery.           It so happens, however, that for more than three
 months afterwards the temperature at the surface only reached the point
 which was observed          on the day of the explosion on two occasions — once
 at midnight       three days after the accident, and once ou the thirty-second
 day after it.       It is therefore very improbable that the Inspector saw the
 mine in at all the same state of ventilation as that which had prevailed at
 the time of the explosion, and hence his description of the phenomena.
 This explosion and some others like it are marked by triangles on our
 diagrams.
     There    are   two groups of accidents during the year 1870, one between
 the 10th and 14th of February, the other at the end of December, both
 of which occurred when the temperature                  was  abnormally low, and the
 atmospherical pressure high and steady.                One of these accidents (that on
 February 14th in South Wales, whereby thirty men were killed) was
 traced to the escape of gas from a forty-acre goaf, in which it had been
 most injudiciously pent up until it attained so great a tension that it forced
 its way through the barriers into one of the air-courses, where it was
 ignited.
     The others      are probably ascribable to the so-called       "sharpness" of the
 fire when ventilation is very active. Under ordinary circumstances, in the
 lower parts of small accumulations of explosive mixtures, there is a stratum
 of air containing less gas than is requisite to make it explosive ; and when
 the miner slowly raises his candle into this stratum, shading all the flame
 excepting the very top with his hand, he is warned, by the increasing size
 of the " cap
                   "
                       (the blue flame of the gas seen on the top of the candle-
  flame), that there is an explosive mixture above.                 When the air in the
  mine becomes very pure            this  stratum disappears in many cases ; there is
  no longer a space between the pure air, in which fire-damp cannot be di
  stinguished, and the explosive mixture above, and the gas is then called
  " sharp,"    because    it ignites without warning when a candle is raised into it.
      It appears to us, in conclusion, that the evidence we submit fairly jus-
    be s£i\e

Jarrow in 1839, where mines have been filled with gas during stormy
weather, and explosions have been prevented."
     Whether, therefore, the barometer falls or the temperature rises it is
absolutely necessary to keep a most careful watch over the amount of air
passing through the workings, in order to prevent the formation of dan
gerous accumulations of explosive mixtures of air and fire-damp in all
 mines in which the margin between danger and safety is very small.
      In a letter to the South-Shields Committee in 1843, George Stephenson
 said, referring to explosions, " Generally speaking, there has been some
fault in the ventilation of the mines when accidents have occurred."                      A
 similar opinion was expressed by most of the gentlemen who were consulted
 when at the beginning of the year 1868 the Meteorological Committee
 proposed to send telegraphic intelligence of storms to colliery proprietors.
      The one cry, whether we look to security against explosion, or to afford
 ing to miners an atmosphere which is respirable without injury to health,
 is more air.

      The explosions which are apparently not caused by either agency are shown by

   The author, referring    to a former   communication,  in which the osteolo-
gical and dental characters of the existing kinds of Wombat were applied
in the determination of the fossil remains of extinct species resembling the
living ones in size, proceeds in the present paper to give the evidences
which have reached him of species of Phascolomys, formerly existing in
Australia, exceeding in size any that are now known to live there.
   The extinct species so reconstructed are described in the order in which
they progressively predominate in bulk over the existing Wombats.           They
are referred to Phascolomys medius, Phascolomys magnus, and Phascolomys
gigas.
   The characters of   these species are shown, not only by the size    of ascer
tained adult and aged individuals, but by modifications of shape         of both
upper and lower jaws, and by differences of shape and of relative propor
tion of certain teeth.    Fossils exemplifying a moderate and seemingly de
terminate range of variety in different individuals and probably different
sexes are noticed, and the evidences of some of these varieties of the
largest extinct species are figured.
   In his concluding remarks the author notices that, in the case of the
genus Phascolomys, as in that of other genera of which an adequate number
of fossil evidences have been acquired, the number of species which have
passed away exceeds that      of the known living  ones.
   Of the latter the growth of knowledge has      been rapid and comparatively
recent, and all the species adhere to the size compatible with the burrow
ing habits of the first observed Wombat {Phascolomys fossor, Wagner).
But   a like habit and power of concealment cannot safely     be ascribed to the
larger extinct Wombats.
                               " If," remarks the author, "we knew the Hare
only by fossil remains, we should err in attributing to it the underground
retreat and way of life of the Rabbit."
   The evidence adduced in the present paper shows that all the larger
kinds of Wombat have perished.          The author, in reference to the cause of
extirpation, refers to his remarks on the conditions affecting the contest for
existence, as applied to the larger extinct wingless birds of New Zealand,
 and observes that the comparatively diminutive representative of Binornis,
viz. the Apteryx, escapes pursuit and observation by being able to avail
itself, like the small existing Wombats, of an underground retreat.          The
 paper concludes with reference to the bearings of its subject on other
 generalities.

    This paper contains the following contributions to Formal Logic : —
     Statement of the Problem of Deductive Logic, with a classification of
its   cases.
     Method of solution for three principal cases, of which the second has
not been hitherto formally considered.
     New notation and calculus of logical relations.
     New system of diagrams, adapted for typography, and coextensive with
the system of notation for cases of composition.
     Purely logical solution of all the problems within the scope of Boole's
system, with complete results, and without his mathematical analogies or
hazardous theories, with a proof that his primary and secondary proposi
tions only partially, and not, as he assumes, wholly obey the same laws.
     Fusion of Hamilton's judgments and De Morgan's propositions, as part
 of one system of assertions.
     Exhaustive analysis of the syllogism.
     Re-cast of the theory and notation of De Morgan's numerically definite
 assertions, as the general case of the logic of composition, and a legitimate
 application of algebra to logic.
     Direct passage from the purely logical formulae of consistency to the
 mathematical formula? of Boole's system of probabilities.
     The above contributions are believed to be entirely original, and are
 given with the least possible restatement of former theories ; but, for con
 venience, frequent reference has been made to Boole, De Morgan, Thom
 son as representing Hamilton, Ueberweg, and Jevons.               Boole and De
 Morgan have been constantly before my mind, and whatever is common to
 this paper and their works must be credited to them.         Jevons first led my
 thoughts in this direction, but all resemblance between us is entirely
 superficial.
     The problem of deductive logic as here conceived is : — Given any asser
  tions, to determine precisely what they affirm, precisely what they deny,
 and precisely what they leave in doubt, separately and jointly.
      Assertions have respect to Coexistence or Succession, or both.
      Coexistence generates :
      Composition, arising from the coexistence of different attributes in the
  same thing, and the coexistence     of the same attribute in different things ;

or subjectively, in the same aggregate ;
    Consistency, arising from the coexistence of different events affirmed by
different assertions.
   Succession generates : Logical inference, Sequence in Space, in Time,
and in Action.
   Mixed cases    arise from combining assertions     of different kinds.
   Composition,    combination,     and consistency only are considered in the
present paper.      Composition     constitutes the primary, and consistency the
secondary propositions of Boole.          Combination has not been distinctly re
cognized in logical works, but is constantly implied in Boole's and De
Morgan's treatments of Composition, whereby its real character has been
overlooked.     Logical Inference is partially considered in the treatment of
Composition, Combination, and Consistency.             Sequence in Space, Time,
and Action is not treated at all.
   Thomson's, De Morgan's, and Boole's notations are carefully interpreted.
Particular attention is paid to Boole's results for Consistency, and the
nature of the error which he committed in accommodating those results to
Composition, together with the value of his accommodated results, is
exactly determined.       The ascertainment of these errors by a fundamental
reconsideration of the bases of the relations of Composition and Con
sistency, and a purely logical method of obtaining precise results, forms
the distinctive   character, as   it  was  the special object, of the present in
vestigation.

       netism, with a    period of 26| days." By George Biddell Airy,
       Astronomer Royal.         Received March 26, 1872.
                                      '
   In  a paper   published in the       Proceedings of the Imperial Academy of
Sciences of   Vienna,'  vol. lxiv.,  Dr.  Karl Hornstein has exhibited the results
of   a series  of observations which appeared to show that the earth's
magnetism undergoes a periodical change in successive periods of 2(>i
days, which might with great plausibility be referred to the rotation of
the sun.
   It appeared to me that the deductions from the magnetic observations
made at the Royal Observatory of Greenwich, and which are printed
                    '
annually in the Greenwich Observations,' or in the detached copies of
'
  Results   of Magnetical and Meteorological Observations made at the
Royal Observatory of Greenwich,' would afford good materials for testing
the accuracy of this law, as applicable to a series of years.           The mean
results of the measured hourly ordinates         of the  terrestrial magnetic ele
ments are given for every day, and it is certain that there has been no
change of adjustments of the declination and horizontal-force instruments
in the course of each year. For the horizontal-force instrument the tem

perature of the room has been maintained in a generally equable state, and
in later years it has been remarkably uniform.
   It is easy to see that an error of a single day, or of a large fraction of a
day, in the beginning of each period, is of no importance, provided that
the errors are not permitted to accumulate. It was allowable, therefore, to
take successive periods of 26, 26, 27, 26, 26, 27, &c. days ; and in
instances when a single day was omitted, or even two days, no sensible
error would be introduced by interpolating between the numbers for the
days immediately preceding and following the omitted days.
  The years selected for this examination were 1850, 1851,              1852,   1868,
1809,    1870; and the beginning of the first period in each year after the
first was thus found  : — Fourteen periods of
                                              26} days each amount to 368 jj
days.     For convenience after completion of the annual winter adjustments,
the first period in 1850 was made to commence on January 17 ; therefore
the first period in 1851 was commenced on January 21, and that in 1852
on January 25.      Similarly, the first periods in 1868, 1869, 1870 com
menced on January 1, 4, and 8 respectively ; and the beginnings in the
three later years are not unconnected with those in the three earlier years :
for, from 1852, January 25, to 1868, January 1, are 5820 days, and 221
periods of  26-} days each are 58 1 9f days ; but as the years are widely
separated, and  a small error of period would produce a large discordance,
it has appeared best to exhibit the results of the two three-years' groups
separately.
  Some periods, in which there were unusually large interruptions, or which
were partly occupied with experiments, were omitted entirely.      The fol
lowing is a complete list of periods omitted :— In 1850, that beginning with
December 24 for horizontal force ; in 1851, that beginning with March 14
 or western declination, and those beginning with March 14, June 28, July
24, for horizontal force; in 1852, those beginning with February 20, May 9,

23 for declination, and January 1, January 27, February 23, and De

       ments, India  Department.       Received April 25, 1872.
   On the 28th of February, 1867,      I  had the honour of submitting to the
inspection of the Royal Society a Transit-Instrument and a Zenith-Sector
made for the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India, to be used re
spectively for the determination of longitude and latitude on that work.
These were one instalment of the following list of geodesical and astronomical
instruments which the Secretary of State for India deputed me to design
and superintend   under construction   :—

318              Lieut.-Col. A. Strange on a new Theodolite              [May 2,
   The Zenith-Sector was, shortly after its exhibition to the Society, for
warded to its destination, as have been more recently the other Zenith -
 Sector, one of the 5 -feet Transit-Instruments, the two 12-inch Vertical
Circles, the two Galvanic Chronographs, and the three Astronomical Clocks.
Of these, the first forwarded Zenith-Sector alone has been used in actual
field-operations.    It has been employed during two seasons in determining
latitudes in Southern India, by Capt. J. Herschel, R.E., F.R.S., of the
 Great Trigonometrical Survey.      One of my main objects in designing the
instrument, which is entirely unlike any of its class, was to qualify it for
more rapid observing than had hitherto been possible.          In this respect it
has been successful.      Capt. Herschel reports that he can observe with it a
series of stars differing only five minutes of time in Right Ascension.
Each star     is observed twice in reversed positions   of the  telescope  at the
same culmination,     in the manner prescribed by the Astronomer Royal for
the Zenith-Sector designed by him for the British Ordnance Survey.
Each of these two reversed observations involves two settings of the
telescope   in altitude, four microscoped, two level, and one micrometer
reading.     To admit of all these operations being performed within five
minutes of time with the deliberation requisite for observations aiming at
fractions of a second, demands not only convenience of instrumental con
struction, but the greatest system and efficiency in the observatory ar
rangements, and a very high order of skill on the part of the observer.
    In the latest Report on the Survey, that for 18/0-71 by Major Mont-
gomerie,   R.E., Officiating Superintendent, that officer  states that  "Captain
 HerschePs further experience with the Zenith-Sector has on the whole con
firmed his first impressions as to its excellence." Captain Herschel reports
on an anomaly in the level readings, amounting, as I understand through
private sources, to about 0"'3, the cause of which he has not yet been able
to detect.     It may possibly, as he suggests, be partly due to the rigidity
of the instrument as a whole not being absolute.       I am myself inclined to
suspect that imperfections in the levels themselves may in some measure
contribute to the observed discrepancies.       The levels have been reported,
and are known to me, as deficient both in uniformity of run and in sensi
bility;   they are certainly not on a par with the graduation, which is
superb, or with the optical power of the telescope and microscopes.          The
accuracy of the instrument is thus limited by that of the levels, which are
its weakest member.       I may here state incidentally that I have not been
able to procure levels in England which come up to the standard now re
quired, and I must therefore have recourse to foreign makers, who have
paid more attention to these adjuncts than, as it seems, it is worth the
while of our English artists to do.
   Comparing the facility of working the Zenith-Sector           and the former
Astronomical Circles,      Captain Herschel says   :—
                                                      " The Sectors     are com
petent to turn out at least double the amount of work      of  the same order,"
adding,
          " at this rate two or three years' work would equal in amount the

  1872.]            for the Indian Trigonometrical Survey.                   319
 whole results up to the date of the arrival of the Sectors ; and ten years (a
  comparatively short period for which to arrange a system of observation on
  a matter of this magnitude) will see us in a position to look back on the
 arrival of the Sectors as on the commencement of a new era."
    I  now pass to the Great Theodolite, which I do myself the honour this
 evening to expose to the scrutiny of the Royal Society.      A brief history of
 the design of this instrument may here with propriety he recorded.
    There are at present at the disposal of the India Survey Department
 two instruments of the same order as the one under consideration, namely,
 Theodolites    having Horizontal Circles 3 feet in diameter, the largest
 dimension hitherto employed, — hence the term Great Theodolite.          There
 are, I believe, not more than four in existence of that size — one by Rams-
 den, with which the greater part of the principal triangulation of Great
 Britain  was executed, the two     Indian instruments, and the  one now before
 the Society.
    Of the two Indian instruments,      one was made by Messrs. Troughton and
 Simms about forty -five years ago, its Horizontal Circle bearing divisions cut
 by the hand of the celebrated Edward Troughton himself.          The other was
 constructed and divided in India by the late Henry Barrow, then attached
 as instrument-maker to the Survey, its design being the work of the late
 Sir George Everest, then Surveyor-General of India. There are also in
 use  with the Department several theodolites of 2-feet diameter, and of
 course many of smaller sizes.
    The principles of construction, the advantages, and the defects of all
 these instruments were a constant theme of discussion to the officers of the
 Department, who being accustomed, according to the excellent system of
the Great Trigonometrical       Survey of India, to take every observation
personally,   have  thereby  at all  times been led to display the most critical
fastidiousness in every thing relating to the apparatus with which use has
made them perfectly familiar.
    Sir Andrew Scott Waugh, R.E., F.R.S., then Surveyor-General of
India, having collected all the experience of his officers, including of course
his own, gathered during many years of actual work in the field, combined
the whole into a " Project and Specification of a new Great Theodolite,"
which in 1855 he placed in my hands for the purpose of guiding me in the
preparation of a design, with working drawings and a fully detailed speci
fication.    The project in question fixes all the general principles intended
to be kept in view, and is ample for that purpose ; but it enters into very
few details, merely pointing out what is required, without definitely stating
how it is to be attained, and it contains no drawings whatever, and only
three or four slight diagrams.          The part I had taken in the previous
discussions had supplied me with a knowledge of the desiderata not actu
ally described, knowledge which of course was also in great measure de
rived from the fact that  I had worked for five years with Troughton's Great
Theodolite, and subsequently with other excellent instruments.
                                                                2a2

320             Lieut.-Col. A. Strange   on a new Theodolite        [May 2,
  At the time the task of executing this design was entrusted to me, I
was commanding a party of the Great Trigonometrical Survey engaged in
carrying a chain of principal triangles along the eastern coast of the
Peninsula, a work known as the " Coast Series."      I at once, during such
leisure as I could snatch from these primary duties, began the design ; but
I  soon found that it was quite impossible to do justice to so difficult a
task whilst the mind and time were engrossed by matters of more pressing
urgency, and of at least equal difficulty and importance.    Short and
broken periods did not admit of the continuity of thought and attention
that were indispensable, and the work made very slow progress, besides
needing constant revision iu consequence of oversights and omissions
caused by such desultory application.  This will be understood, by any
one who has gone     through the same process, when       Imention that the
conception  I  had formed of my task was that I should execute, in the
most minute detail, working drawings to scale of every part of this com
plex structure, in plan, section, and elevation, accompanied not only by an
ample written descripton of every part, but also an explanation of the
grounds on which the numerous novelties introduced had been adopted ;
so that when the whole was in the maker's hands, he need do little more
than reproduce the drawings in metal by simple measurement, turning to
the specification in alt cases of doubt. The intention was that the whole
should be sent home to be executed without any personal superintendence
by the designer.
    In April 1857, being at work in the Goomsoor Hills, a notoriously
unhealthy tract, I was struck down by jungle-fever, being nearly the last
of my camp of about 200 followers, only one of whom escaped, to succumb
to that dreadful malady.    A few months afterwards I was sent, under
medical advice, to the Neilgherry Mountains for the recovery of my health ;
this gave me the leisure requisite for my design, which otherwise    I
                                                                     might
never have enjoyed.    For several months I did little else but work at my
drawings, which    I
                   now offer to the notice of the Society.     One of these
alone, the complete vertical section, occupied me nearly incessantly about
three months, involving as it did the reconsideration of every other draw
ing in order to render the whole consistent.
   At the expiration of my leave on medical certificate, the design, though
very far advanced, was not complete ; I had to lay it aside to resume my
ordinary field duties on the Coast Series triangulation.   In 1869, on my
promotion   to a  regimental majority, I quitted the  Survey in accordance
with the regulations of the service, and, after twenty -six years' continuous
residence in India, returned to England.     Feeling a natural reluctance to
leave the completion of my design to other hands, and, indeed, doubting
whether any one unacquainted with my views could have completed it
satisfactorily, I took it with me, hoping to finish it,
                                                      as  I ultimately did, at
home, after my retirement from the army.
  In 1862 was directed oy the Secretary of State for India to superin

1872.]               for   the Indian     Trigonometrical Survey.                              321
tend the carrying out          of this   design    and   that     of   the other    instruments
already enumerated.
   It is now ten years since the work was placed in the hands of Messrs.
Troughton and Simms — a long period certainly. The delay has arisen
from several causes — from the removal of the factory of that firm to
Charlton, from the necessity for various modifications and some experi
ments, particularly on aluminium bronze as the material for some portions
of the instrument, from the time occupied in the designing, supervising,
and testing the other numerous and important instruments which      have                   I
enumerated, and, finally, from the time which my duty of superintending
the whole scientificinstrument supply of India necessarily occupies.
     I                    a full description of the instrument.
         cannot here attempt                                    I trust that
such a description may at some future time be executed by myself, or by
some officer of the Survey Department ; but, for my own part, the leisure
necessary for such an undertaking, although all the necessary materials                         are
at hand,     is denied me at present.
     I   will, however,   indicate   some of those           salient   features which may be
rendered intelligible without illustrative figures.
   The principal dimensions are as follows : —

  The Stand has three massive mahogany legs, braced together with hori
zontal and oblique bars of wrought iron, wooden braces having been found,
 in  great hygrometrical changes, to impart nzimuthal        disturbance.                       I
 believe this to be the first stand for such instruments in which the means
for levelling approximately are completely worked out.    Within each leg,
divided vertically for that purpose,          long very substantial square-

  322              Lieut.-Col. A. Strange    on a new Theodolite         [May 2,
  three inverted radial grooves formed in the lower surface of a massive cast-
 iron circle, which is thus supported hy the three elevating screws without
  being attached to them, and which is therefore able to accommodate itself
 to expansional changes without restraint.        The upper surface of the cast-
  iron circle is turned flat and true, and receives the three feet of the instru
 ment.      It has three lateral screws   for centering the instrument over the
 station-mark,    as   in existing large theodolites ; it has also three rollers,
 capable of being pressed upwards by strong spiral springs thrown in and
 out of action by a cammed lever, this arrangement, already in use else
 where, being intended to facilitate the setting of the horizontal zero.
      The Feet-screws. — These are, as usual, three in number ; no part of
 such instruments has been so entirely neglected as this.             Whilst the
 Circles, Micrometers, and Levels indicated fractions of a second of arc, the
 foot-screw remained so coarse and primitive in form that the due levelling
 of the instrument was a matter of tedious difficulty, accomplished after all
 by a sort of adroitness helped by accident.
     The first desideratum was that all clamping of the foot-screw after ad
justment should be rendered unnecessary, since no clamping arrangement
 hitherto tried could be used without disturbing the level after adjustment.
 What was wanted, therefore, was that no azimuthal deviation of the mass
 of the instrument should ensue from an undamped foot-screw, however
 loose.
     The idea,   as  it presented itself to my mind, was that the effect which
 would be produced by vertical expansion of the end of the tribrach should
 be imitated if possible.      After much thought I realized this idea by a very
simple contrivance,
 the principle         of
 which    the annexed
 diagram will make
 plain. The tribrach
 arm is slit horizon
 tally near its lower
surface. This leaves
a kind of long flat
tongue of metal, which, being of considerable width, has great horizontal
rigidity, but, being comparatively thin, is easily bent vertically. The outer
end of the tongue rests on the stand ; the foot-screw passes through the
solid upper part of the tribrach, but not through the lower tongue.
     It is evident that when the screw is turned inwards with the screwing-
motion, the solid end of the tribrach will be raised, the slit being widened
by the vertical yielding of the tongue, and vice versd. But since the end of the
screwdoes not rest on the stand, but on an intermediate plate or tongue, which
is act-.ally a portion of the tribrach itself, it is clear that if a lateral force
be applied to the tribrach, no motion      will be caused thereby, however loose
the screw may be, so long as that force is less than the lateral rigidity of

the plate or tongue. The lateral force generated by turning the instru
ment in azimuth, when taking observations, is greatly within this limit.
This arrangement may be found useful in other cases.      It is perfectly
successful ; but it is only available where a moderate range of vertical
movement is needed.                  In the present instance,              as the stand on which         the
instrument        is supported         is always first made sensibly level, the vertical
range of the foot-screw               need not be more than -^hu °^ an mcn > Dm- *n
practice this is capable of being extended, without                                  fear of injury to the
parts, to about    of an inch.
                        -fa
   In the actual construction, the tongue           described as formed by
                                                                 above
slitting the tribrach, is, in fact, separate plate, similar in plan to the
                                                    a
tribrach, and firmly bolted to the centre of the instrument.
   The        second desideratum in the feet-screws was delicacy and certainty                            of
action   this
          ;    attained
                 I                    by
                            applying to them        clamp and tangent-screw
                                                                       a
arrangement very similar in principle to that sometimes applied to circles.
Although the feet-screws themselves are very coarse, having about eight
threads only per inch, the arrangement     such that one entire revolution of
                                                            is
the slow-motion tangent-screw alters the level only one second of arc. Hence
the foot-screw, though coarse and strong enough to bear the great weight
imposed on        it,
                  for the first time in keeping, in point of refinement, with
                        is
the most delicate parts of the instrument.
   The Horizontal   Circle and its Micrometers. —The disposition of these
most important parts has been the subject of much controversy.        Two
arrangements   are  possible: —     that called "the flying-circle" plan,
                                (1)
in which the microscopes are immovably attached to the basis of the in
strument, the circle revolving with the telescope; and (2) "the flying-
micrometer" plan, in which the circle          fixed and the micrometers
                                                                 is
revolve.  The question was carefully considered, and the balance of advan
tages appearing to be in favour of the second plan, that was prescribed in
the project, and has been adopted.                      I   have no doubt as to its superiority
for instruments of this kind.

   The Guard Circle.               — This   addition was made               to another instrument        by
Sir A. S. Wnugh, late Surveyor-General,    some time before the present de

both cases  quite independently.   It consists  of   second horizontal circle,

protects the working circle from accidental injury      (2)   tends to distri    ;      it

    Relieving Apparatus. — The moving parts of the instrument, namely,
 the pillars and their foundation-plate, the vertical-axis socket and hori
 zontal-microscope arms, the telescope and the vertical circle, with its ad
juncts, constitute a very ponderous mass, weighing 284 lbs.* If the whole
 of this great weight were allowed to bear on the flange of the vertical axis,
 the friction would be so great as almost to cause cohesion.                    To obviate
 this in similar cases, as in that of Troughton's Great Theodolite, internal
 rollers were introduced, pressed upwards by means of spiral springs against
 the lower surface of the moving mass.              But this arrangement was imper
 fectly  carried  out in  Troughton's      instrument    ; and it is clear that at that
 time the action of such an antifrictional apparatus was not fully understood.
 There were three soft brass rollers with central holes revolving on axes fixed
 immovably      in a circular ring, which        ring was pressed upwards by three
 spiral springs.
     The late Sir George Everest, in his work on the ' Measurement of the
 Meridional Arc of India,' p. cvii, states that when the instrument was first
 received   "  angles   taken with      it could not      be   depended on to within
 50 seconds of the     truth," — a   defect which was found to be mainly attribu
 table to the inequality of tension of the three spiral springs, which exerted
 forces respectively in the proportions 8, 1 1, 15.                            I
                                                              Shortly after joined the
 Survey Department,         I, with the consent of its head, made a new set of
 rollers myself, the axes of which were fixed to them, instead of to the frame,
 the axes revolving in Y bearings.           This improved the levelling of the in
 strument ; hut it was not possible, with every care, to maintain perfect
 equality of tension of the three springs           ; and this part of the instrument
 always caused anxiety.
     The arrangement adopted for the present instrument is as follows : — The
 three rollers are of lnrger diameter than before, and they are of steel, finished
 with extreme care.         They do not support the weight on their axes at all,
 but on their circumferences, precisely as is now customary with heavy
  revolving observatory-domes.          The friction is therefore no longer of the
 rubbing, but of the rolling kind.            The three rollers are connected, as in
 domes, by a light ring, which performs no function but that of keeping them
 equidistant.     Means are also provided for restricting the path of the rollers
 to a circle perfectly concentric with the axis of motion of the instrument.
 Finally, the rollers are pressed upwards by no less than forty, instead of
  only three, spiral springs, by which multiplication               a generally uniform
 tension is much more easily maintained, the mean tension of each spring
                * This lias been recently- increased to 209 lbs. by additions.

   The proper amount of relief has been a question much discussed.          Sir
George Everest,   in his work above quoted *, fixes              it,

at
 |    of the whole moving mass. This cannot be accepted as general rule,       a
because,    if
             the mass were very great,     of its amount might be sufficient to
                                                  J

                                   angles
be too free.     I          first make the relieving force nearly equal the
                       therefore
weight of the moving mass.        Then    try the levelling of the instrument.

came to was that, however             a     spring might be applied, its tension ought to
be constant and invariable.                 Hitherto this had not been the case, an ordi
nary external antagonizing spiral spring having been used, the compression
of which was continually being varied       the action of the tangent-screw.

to act, which was fatal to the observation.   And the evil was brought home

                                                                       "
                            principle, namely                             principle, some
times used in machinery to prevent loss of motion.                 The block into which
the tangent-screw is tapped is divided transversely," and the two halves
are forced asunder, and therefore against the contrary sides of the screw-
threads, by four internal spiral springs.             The tension of these springs is
necessarily      constant,   and  therefore   not  subject to the disturbance and slow
recovery of elastic force unavoidable in an external spring.                    Means are
supplied    for   regulating    the  tension   of  the  four  springs,   which  must be a
little in excess of the force necessary to move the revolving mass, without
taking the parts to pieces.           This arrangement      I believe  to be on the whole
satisfactory.
    Bubble-trier. — Experiments have constantly to be made to determine
the angular value of the scales of levels of such instruments.                     Hitherto
there have been no conveniences for this purpose.                 I have supplied a frame
attachable at will to the telescope, on which the level under experiment can
be laid,   in order to compare its         scale  with the angular indications       of the
vertical circle.
    Bearing of the Transit- Axis pivots. — Hitherto these have always been
capable of adjustment in order to level the axis : but to this two objec
tions exist    : — first,  there is always ground for fearing lest the adjustable
parts should be left loose, in which case, owing to their distance from the
centre of motion, they would be disturbed by the momentum generated in
rotating     the instrument        in azimuth (since this would alter the relation
between the telescope and the horizontal circle, observed angles would be
vitiated to the extent of such disturbance) ; secondly, adjustable bearings
must necessarily support the pivots at points and not surfaces, and con
sequently tend to wear them into grooves.
    For these reasons the bearings are immovably fixed and finally adjusted
by the maker by grinding.               They are also of what is known as the seg
mental form, first introduced,           I   believe, by the Astronomer Royal when
 designing the great Greenwich Transit-Circle, a form which supports the
pivot throughout its length and over a considerable surface, and which has
been found at Greenwich to wear the pivots so equally that no sensible
 change in their form in the course of many years has been detected.                    Still
the application of the non-adjusting principle to a large portable instrument
must be considered as an experiment.                 Should the horizontality of the
transit-axis undergo, as it may, a gradual change, the officers of the Survey
will have to restore the adjustment by means of the grinder supplied with
 the instrument, an operation, no doubt, of some delicacy, even in the
hands of an experienced mechanic,                but which,   I trust, nothing    but acci
dental violence to the parts will ever render necessary.

      Level Mountings. — The mode in which the levels are mounted was con
trived by me, at the request of Sir Andrew Scott Waugb, then Surveyor-
General of India ; and                I
                         made the first example with my own hands, in
about 1853, for Troughton's Great Theodolite. The same arrangement has
since been applied to many other large instruments in India.      Being rather
a matter of detail,         I
                     shall here only say that its object is to remove, as much
as possible, all restraint from the glass spirit-level, which should be allowed
to adapt itself to changes of temperature with perfect freedom.         The level
is also encased   in  an external glass cylindrical    cover, to protect it from
sudden currents of air tending to alter rapidly the temperature of the parts.
I  believe that these principles were first applied by the Astronomer Royal
to the Greenwich     Altazimuth ; but the details in my plan are somewhat
different, and, as      I
                      venture to think, more complete.    The appliances for
adjusting the level in my plan are, I believe, new in their arrangement ; my
main object in devising them was to obviate strains, without introducing
risk of shake, and to improve delicacy of action.
   Material. — Whilst the instrument was under construction I became
acquainted, at the Great Exhibition of 1862, with aluminium bronze, an
alloy of 90 parts of copper with 10 parts of aluminium.       Its properties
seemed to be exactly those required for the material of such an instrument.
With                  arising from the fact that no national establishment
           some difficulty,
exists in England for such purposes, I got some experiments made on the
alloy (partly by the makers, partly by the kindness of Mr. John Anderson,
C.E., of the Woolwich Gun Factories *), which showed that the rigidity of
the alloy might be taken at three times that of ordinary gun-metal.     This
being the most important property for my purpose, I determined on using
it,and on reducing the thicknesses, not the depths, of all the lower parts
of my design. This would still leave such parts twice as rigid as       con             if
structed of the previous dimensions in gun-metal.
   Accordingly the elevating screws of the stand and their bearings, the tri
brach, horizontal       circle, vertical-axis  socket, horizontal-microscope arms,
and foundation-plate         carrying the pillars are of aluminium bronze.     The
remaining parts,         having much less weight to bear, are of the usual
materials, gun-metal            and yellow brass, which are more easily worked than
the bronze.
    Probable performance of the Instrument. — The trials                   I   have as yet made
of the instrument lead                to the conclusion that   it   is   subject to no essential
defect,and that the objects sought in its construction have been to great                a
extent attained.  Actual work in the field, submitted to all the elaborate
verifications indispensable in modern geodesy, can, however, alone ascertain
its character    and this must be
                 ;                    work of years.

to such a point for the purpose of guarding against undue expectations
and of disclaiming excessive pretensions. The work that has been executed
in India is of such a character, as attested by an enormous accumulation
of results treated with absolute rigour, that, as respects some branches of
it,
 I    do not shrink from saying that improvement       scarcely possible.is In
respect to horizontal angles, the most important of all its branches, au
elaborate investigation by Colonel Walker, R.E., F.R.S., the present head* of
the Survey, shows that the probable error of such angles, deduced impar
tially from    vast mass of materials, lies between + 0"-28 and + 0"-20,
                a
according as the circumstances are more or less favourable *.     believe that        I
residual errors of that small amount contain hardly any instrumental or
observational element, but that they are chiefly due to atmospheric                              dis
turbances, which no instrumental perfection can control.
      As to vertical      the test of direct levelling compared with trigono
                       angles,
metrical levelling, applied to    distance of 2700 miles, shows
                                          a                         difference          a
between the results of these two independent methods averaging 7"3 inches
per 100 mile3, or TJ„ of an inch per mile.                        There       seems   little room for
instrumental improvement here.
      In
      respect to astronomically determined azimuths,      hope the present  I
instrument will give improved results, on account of the superior steadiness
of level which think
                  I       possesses.

   For the determination of astronomical latitudes  has more powerful andit
more complete vertical appliances than any former theodolite, and should                    it

secting in a line P Q.         If we suppose one bone A B to be fixed and the
other bone A' B' to be movable, and that the contraction of the muscle
compels the bone A'B' to revolve round PQ as an axis of rotation, it is
required to find the conditions necessary in order that the work done by
the contraction of the muscle shall be a maximum.                     I shall in this note
discuss only the case in which the bones A B,               A' B' lie in the   same plane.
In this case I have succeeded in demonstrating               the following propositions
in the case of maximum work : —
    1. The axis of rotation            PQ must be formed by the intersection of
rectangular planes passing through A B and A' B'.
    2. The quadrilateral muscle ABA'B' must be inscribable in a circle.
    If it be true (as I believe it is) that the muscles, bones, and joints of all
vertebrate animals are so related to each other as to produce in all cases
the maximum amount of work possible with a given weight of muscle, then
the second proposition affords us a severe test of the truth or falsehood of
 my postulate.      If the muscle be circumscribable by a circle, it follows, from
 Ptolemy's     theorem,     that its sides -and diagonals must fulfil the following
condition    : —
                                         ai + crf=e/j
where a,    b are one     pair of opposite sides and c, d the other pair, and e,
arc the diagonals of the quadrilateral.
                                                                                         f
    The pectineus muscle of many animals forms a plane quadrilateral when
 in its position of maximum extension of fibres, and therefore furnishes us
 with   a favourable test.       In the freshly dissected animal it is easy to mea
 sure with accuracy the lengths of the six lines in question, and so test the
 truth of the postulate.
    I  have thus obtained the following results          : —

       Haughton, F.R.S., M.D. Dubl, D.C.L. Oxon., Fellow of Tri
       nity College, Dublin.        Received April 3, 1872.
    Let us suppose two     bones,  AB     and A' B', not lying in the same plane,
connected by muscular fibres ;       and through these bones let us draw any two
planes intersecting in a line P Q      ;  if the  bone   AB    be fixed and the bone
A' B'   be movable and compelled to turn round              the line  P Q regarded as
an axis of rotation, it is required to find the conditions necessary in order
that the work done by the contraction of the muscle shall be a maximum.
   A muscle such as is here imagined will form a skew surface, and no
two of its fibres will intersect in space.        I have succeeded in demonstrating
the following propositions in the case of maximum work : —
    1. The axis of rotation PQ must be formed by the intersection of rect
angular planes passing through A B and A' B'.
   2. A certain hyperboloid of one sheet may be drawn passing through
the bones A B and A' B'; and the axis of maximum work is a generator of
this hyperboloid belonging to the group different from that to which             AB
and A' B' belong.
   3.  The generator which is the axis of rotation of maximum work is
found by the solution of a biquadratic equation.
   4. In the muscles which are found in nature, the root of the biquadratic
which fixes the axis of maximum work is always nearly equal to zero.
   5. If there be n fibres in the skew muscle, we can draw a certain line
O O', joining two points on A B and A' B' (or A B and A' B' produced),
such that a single fibre acting in the line O O', with n times the force of a

 1872.]              Elementary Principles       in Animal Mechanics.                   331
 fibre   of   the original muscle,      will produce   the game      mechanical    effect as
the whole       skew muscle.
     fi. When the equivalent       fibre O 0' is drawn,     it is always fouud to be so
placed in relation to the axis of rotation as to produce             the maximum work
possible.
     7.  Two generators can be assigned on the locus hyperboloid, dividing
the surface       into two regions ; in one of these regions each generator is an
axis    of stable equilibrium, and in the other region each generator is an
axis    of unstable equilibrium     ;  the generators   separating    the two regions are
 axes    of neutral equilibrium.          The axis of maximum work is a unique
 axis lying in the middle of the region of unstable equilibrium.
    8. Every skew muscle is a supplemental             contrivance for the purpose of
 procuring a line of force joining points O and O' already occupied by other
 structures, so that it would be impossible to apply the force directly.
    Let 1 1' be the shortest line joining A B and A' B', and take this line for
axis of z, and the lines bisecting the angles between A B and A' B' for axes
of x and y, the origin being placed at the point           of bisection of   1 1'.
    The equation of the locus hyperboloid is
                            fy-wVHO-m'x^-O-o                                             (i)
where     m   is the tangent of half the angle between the bones,            c is  half the
line 1 1'.

     Skew muscles are only employed in nature as a supplemental contri
  vance  ; and they differ from all other muscles in this respect, that whereas
  the equivalent fihre of any other muscle always coincides with some real
  fibre of the actual muscle, the equivalent fibre of the skew muscle does
  not coincide with any actual fibre, but, on the contrary, may lie completely
  outside the muscle.       Hence the skew muscle is used to produce an addi
  tional force along O O', where the points O and O' are already occupied
  for other purposes ; and in producing this force along O O' portions of bone
  A B, A' B' at a distance, and not occupied for other purposes, are made

The Table just given shows that in the employment of these supplemental
muscles they are always so arranged as to work to the maximum advantage.
  Thus the action of skew muscles, which, on a hasty examination, would
be pronounced to be imperfections, furnishes another proof of my postulate.

     The general optical arrangements here used                           are known.            Particular     cases
of the phenomena resulting from it have             described by Fresnel and

by Airy ;       and more have doubtless been observed by others. The main
part of the apparatus consists, so far as polarization is concerned, of the
ordinary polarizer P, analyzer A, and crystal plate to be examined, C.
To this are added two quarter-undulation plates of mica, Q, Q,, one of
which, Q, is placed below and the other, Q1( above the crystal C. Let i, a,
b,j be the angles between the principal sections of P, Q, C, Q,, A, taken two
and two together in the order written, all the angles being considered to be
of the same sign when measured in the same direction — say, positive with
that of a clock-hand.   Then, if 0 be the retardation produced in any ray,
whose wave-length is X, by the crystal C, the intensity of the ordinary
image at any point is given (Verdet, 'Lemons d'Optique Physique,' tomeii.

                                                                        if
with this arrangement the analyzer be turned in one direction, the distor
tion of the rings from     circular to an oval form will take place in vertical

analyzer be turned in the opposite sense, the distortion of the rings will
likewise be reversed.  This process, therefore, will give method of distin                   a

tally verified by applying the method to the series   of mica plates crossed in
different   groups    so as to show the transition from the biaxal to the uni
axal condition.      In   the case      of   biaxal crystals,            however, the readiest method
of making the experiment             is         rings near the centre of the

field where the lemniscate loops meet, and to notice whether, on turning
the analyzer in  given direction, the rings appear to stream in towards one

  The pure methylic alcohol                  used       in   these experiments was prepared from
rectified wood-spirit according to a process .of E. Th. Chapman, being a
modified chloride-of-calcium process as originally recommended by Sir
Robert Kane. The anhydrous alcohol obtained had a specific gravity of
•813/1 at 10° C.            ;   it boiled   at a temperature              of   58Q,6       C. under   a pressure
of 757'4 millims., had               of 58-325.between the temperatures

When oxidized with excess of bichromate and sulphuric acid, it yielded
nothing but carbonic acid and water.

    This is estimated by mixing the alcohol and water, in the required pro
 portion, in an annular vessel similar to the one used for the estimation of
the specific heat, and observing the elevation of temperature produced in
 the water of a calorimeter in which the annular vessel is immersed.                     The
 units of heat evolved in the formation of 5 grms. of each mixture were thus

    The mixtures were boiled in a flask connected with a condenser, by
which the vapours are condensed and made to run back into the flask ; the
composition of the mixture is thus kept as uniform as possible.
   The cold liquid running back is prevented from disturbing the boiling
by having to pass down a tube placed inside the flask, in which it becomes
heated nearly to boiling before it flows into the boiling mixture.                       The
following Table gives the results, the barometer standing at 757"4 millims.

   All  relations    pointed    out in the former paper as existing between the
various properties        of  mixtures of ethylic alcohol and water find their
parallel in the mixtures now under consideration.                    Certain sets of pro
perties   come    to a maximum deviation            from the calculated       mean  at the
same strength      ;  in some cases the values found are always below, in others
always above the calculated mean ; and in both mixtures the rate of expan
sion shows the same singular peculiarity, viz. of being for certain mixtures
below, for others above the mean. In this, as in the previous mixture, the
specific heat and the heat evolved during mixture not only come to a
maximum deviation from the mean in mixtures of the same strength, but
all mixtures evolving the          same    amount of heat during their formation
possess a specific heat elevated to the same amount above the mean ; and,
moreover, the numerical relation between these two values is the same for
mixtures of every degree of strength.               Hence, if the heat evolved in the
formation of     5 grms. of any of the mixtures be divided by 7'9, the eleva
tion of the specific heat of this particular mixture above its calculated
mean value is obtained.              Between the boiling-point and the capillary
attraction a somewhat similar relation            is found.    If   in this case the ob
served depression of the capillarity of any mixture below its calculated
mean value be divided by 1'9 (the capillarity of pure water taken as 100),
the depression of the boiling-point of this mixture below the mean is
obtained.
   It  has been pointed out above that an intimate relation exists between
the heat evolved during the formation of a mixture and its specific heat.
A   closer study of this relation has led the author to the following con
clusions, which seem not only to hold good for the two mixtures now
under consideration, but to be of very general application ; they may be
formulated as follows.

    Relation     existing between the specific heat of mixtures and the heat
evolved during their formation : —
    1 . The difference between the number of heat-units               evolved during the
mixing of given weights of two substances,                at the temperatures t and t'
respectively,     is  equal    to the  difference    between   the number of heat-units
required to raise the mixture, and that required to raise the two constituents
taken separately, from the lower to the higher temperature.                  Or let U and
U'   be the units     of heat evolved by mixing x and y at the temperatures t
and t' respectively, S, S', and S" the specific heac of the mixture z and its
constituents x aud y respectively, then
                 U~U' = .*    . S (t-t)~{x      . S' (t-f) +y S" (t-f)h
    2.  If more units     of heat    are evolved at the    higher than at the lower tem
perature, the specific heat of the resulting mixture will be below the
calculated mean ; on the other hand, the specific heat of the mixture will
be above the calculated mean, if the greater number of heat-units be
 evolved at the lower temperature*.
    3. The absorption of a lesser number of heat-units will be of course
equivalent to the evolution of a greater number, while the absorption of
a greater number         will be equivalent to the evolution of a smaller number of
heat-units.
    A   series  of Tnbles      are next given showing        that the following mixtures,
namely, ethylic alcohol and water, methylic alcohol and water, prussic acid
and water, ethylic alcohol and bisulphide of carbon, aqueous solutions of
potassium chloride, sodium chloride, potassium nitrate, and potassium
hydrate, conform to proposition 2, and all, except the mixture of ethylic
alcohol and bisulphide of carbon, also conform as closely as can be ex
pected with proposition 1.                Perfect agreement is only possible if the
specific heat of each constituent, as well as that of the mixture, has been
 accurately determined between the two temperatures for which the heat
 evolved on mixing has been estimated ; and this has not, in the majority of
 cases, been done as yet.
    The author next points out that,          at first sight, the above observations may
 be explained by assuming           that a difference in the chemical constitution of
 the mixture is produced           by a change of temperaturef.          In some cases a
 rise in temperature may produce a certain amount of decomposition or
 dissociation, while a fall would be accompanied by recombination ; the
 apparent specific heat of the mixture would thereby become raised.                     In
 some other cases the reverse may happen, and the specific heat of the
 mixture would fall below the mean.                   This supposition seems, however,
 incompatible with the observed rate of expansion of mixtures, both of
 ethylic and methylic alcohol and water.                In these the rate of expansion
 is in some of the mixtures below the mean, indicating apparently that a
 more intimate union takes place on heating, in others the rate of expansion
        * This relation had already been suggested by Berthclot.
        f  Tliis has already been pointed out by Pfuundler, as well   as by Marignac.

is above the mean, indicating dissociation.  The specific beat of these
mixtures does not, however, show any corresponding alterations.
  The author finally shows that if these propositions should prove to be
an expositionof a general law, they will enable us to calculate the specific
heat of one constituent of a mixture or solution, if we know the specific
heat of the other constituent, the specific heat of the mixture, and the
heat evolved or absorbed at two different temperatures between which
these specific heats have been estimated.   It may thus be possible to com
pare the specific heat of liquid and solid substances when both are placed
under similar conditions, and relations may be discovered which at present
are masked       in   consequence    of the difference in the physical conditions of
the substances to be compared.

      was stated by one of us in Part II. * that when a drop of a liquid is
     It
deposited on the surface of a supersaturated saline solution, it will do one
of three things : — (1) mingle with the solution without any nuclear action ;
(2) spread out into a film with powerful nuclear action ; or (3) assume the
form of a lens, without any separation of salt.  It was further stated that
when a liquid forms a film or a lens, it does so according to the general
proposition, that if a drop of a liquid B, with the surface-tension b, be
placed on the surface of another liquid A, with the surface-tension a, the
drop will spread into a film, if a >b + c (c being the tension of the common
surface of the liquids A and B) ; but                on the contrary, a=<
                                                    if,                            theb   +

drop will remain in the form of lens.             Hence       spread on A, A will not

portions, chas no value.   The spreading of the drop may also be interfered
with by   the superficial viscosity of the solution, or the greater or less
difficulty in displacing the superficial molecules.
     It    was also stated that     ifa greasy smear be made upon the clean interior
surface of      a   flask above     the solution, and the flask be inclined so as to
bring   portion of the solution against such smear, the liquid does one of
           a

                          it
the smear without loss of tension, in which case the smear has no nuclear
action  or (2) as soon as the solution reaches the smear its edge flattens
           ;
and becomes ragged, in which case the smear         nuclear and the salt
                                                                    is

   It was further stated that when a leos of oil is resting on the surface of

                                         it
succeeded in explaining    number of obscure phenomena on the principle
                                a
of surface-tension    that that force, properly handled, would suffice to
                       *,
account for most,     not all, the varied phenomena of supersaturation.
                      if                                                      Ac
cording to this view,  whatever    tends  greatly  to lower  the surface-tension
of supersaturated saline solution, causes
     a                                            separation of salt, and at once

puts an end to the condition of supersaturation.
     In   order to test this view,   a large number of experiments have been per
formed by one of us during           the last six months, consisting of repetitions
of former experiments or of new ones suggested by one or both of us. All
these experiments have been performed in the open air at Highgate, near
London, the object being to avoid all possible miscarriage from the effects
of floating dust in the air of       a   room.    It
                                           had been suggested that some of
the former results as to the action of films might have been vitiated from
this source and although this does not appear to have been the case, yet
               ;
it   with much satisfaction that the experimenter refers to the greater faci
     is
lity and certainty with which experiments of this kind are conducted in
the open air, as compared with those made in       room.   a In the open air           a
gentle wind  would  sometimes  blow  over  the mouths   of the flasks, sufficient
to produce    low musical note, without any nuclear action, unless
               a                                                           speck

                                                                    ;
order   to prevent evaporation, the flasks were kept covered with watch-
glasses or small beakers, except when performing an experiment.
   The salt used in the following experiments was sulphate of soda, in large
crystals, not effloresced, one of three strengths being adopted as circum
stances required, and which will be indicated when necessary, namely,   part     1
of salt to  of water,

glasses     or beakers, and carried on     tray into the open air.

 344      Messrs. C. Tomlinson and G. Van der Mcnsbrugghc                     [May 1G,
     The points     to which this experimental     inquiry tended arc included in
 the four following propositions —    :
     I. That    a supersaturated saline solution     contained in a catharized flask
 will remain liquid so long as its free surface, or the surface in contact with
 the sides of the flask, does not undergo in one or many points a notable
 diminution of surface-tension.
     II. That if we deposit on the surface of a supersaturated saline solution a
 drop of a liquid of feeble tension, it spreads, and crystallization takes place
 immediately or after a short time.
    III.   That while   a  liquid of feeble tension produces crystallization after
 a time more or less short, a liquid of considerable contractile force (such
 as pure water) not acting chemically on the solution, may be brought into
 contact with it without producing change of state.
    IV. That as a liquid of feeble tension produces crystallization, so a solid
 covered more or less with a film of such liquid produces change of state,
 either at once or after a short time.
    But before any conclusions could        be drawn      from the results of experi
ments as to the relation between the surface-tension of liquids and the
 state  of supersaturation in saline solutions, it was necessary to measure
 the surface-tension of the solutions of Glauber's salt operated on.                Ac
 cordingly     the following    data were   determined,     first, for  a solution con
 taining   1  part of salt to  1 of water, and, secondly, for a solution containing
 2 parts of salt to      1   of water. The diameter of the capillary tube was
 1-598 millim.*
        Specific gravity of the solution 1 salt to      1  water at 17° C. = 1-198.
        The capillary height 1 1 millims.
        The specific gravity of the other solution = 1-289.
        The capillary height 8- 7 millims.
                                                                 '
    These data give, according to the formula          t =           (iu which t is the
 tension,   h  the height, d the density, and r the radius of the tube), for the
 superficial tensions of the solutions in question, not a greater value than
from 4 to 5 2.
    If  the states of supersaturation of saline solutions depend on the main
tenance of surface-tension, according to the first proposition, any force or
 substance that produces a notable diminution of such tension will cause the
 state  of supersaturation to cease.
    Such a force is heat, while such substances            as camphor, benzoic acid,
 &c. have a marked effect in lowering the superficial tension of water, and
in doing so undergo those remarkable gyrations which are so well known.
    And first with respect to heat, applied, not so as to affect the whole
solution, but locally, so as to raise the temperature at one part or point of
the surface, while the other parts remained at the temperature of the
atmosphere.

1872.]               on Supersaturated     Saline Solutions.                 345
   Experiment 1. Four flasks, each about half full of a supersaturated
solution of Glauber's salt (2 salt to 1 water), were exposed to a tempera
ture of 32° F. for an hour. A red-hot poker was then passed down the
neck of each flask, and in two of them the hot metal was brought into
contact with the surface of the solution so as to raise a volume of vapour.
There was no separation of salt in any one case.
   Experiment 2. A solution containing a considerable mass of the seven-
atom salt at the bottom of the flask was moved over the flame of a spirit-
lamp in a line from the bottom of the flask to the neck, so as to heat one
part only of the flask.      The only effect was to convert a portion of the
surface of the seven-atom salt into the anhydrous ; but there was no
crystallization. After some hours the anhydrous portion had again taken
up its water of crystallization.
   Experiment 3. A solution of 2 salt to 1 water that had been in the
open air during twenty-four hours was uncovered, and water nearly boiling
was dropped upon it. A slight cloudiness came over the solution, but
there was no crystallization.
   Next day a very weak solution       of Glauber's salt nearly boiling was
dropped upon the surface with no nuclear action.
  Experiment 4. An eight-ounce globular flask had the globe filled with
a solution of 2 salt to 1 water. Solutions of two different strengths, namely
1 salt to 1 water, and 3 salt to   1 water, at a nearly boiling temperature,
¦weredropped upon     it,but with no nuclear action.
  Experiment 5.      A solution of 1   salt to water had filtered into
                                                  1                          it   a
nearly boiling solution of  3  salt to 1water. The drops descended to the
bottom of the flask in beautiful rolling rings, but there was no nuclear
action.
   Experiment   6.   The neck of  a   flask was inclined over the flame of        a
spirit-lamp, so as to boil the upper part of the solution, while the lower
part remained cold. Water was driven off in vapour, so as to leave       acrust
of salt in the neck. This, when the flask was left to itself, gradually ab
sorbed moisture and trickled down, and was also washed down into the
solution  ; but there was no nuclear action either from this or from the heat.
   These experiments on the action of heat lead to the conclusion that,
however much   it   may diminish the superficial tension of the solutions,    it
does not apparently disturb the state of supersaturation.      This result may
be explained with reference to the feeble tension of the solution = 4), and
                                                                    (
to the fact that heat locally applied does not greatly diminish it. Moreover,
heat tends to oppose crystallization by increasing the solubility.
  Numerous experiments were tried as to the action of newly sublimed
camphor and benzoic acid on the solutions.     The flasks containing these
bodies floating on the solutions were plugged with cotton- wool and kept for
some months, during which time they were repeatedly shaken         but there
                                                                    ;
was no separation of salt.     The camphor and benzoic acid formed weak
solutions with the supersaturated solutions   ;   but the tension of camphorated

 water being =4,5, and that of an aqueous solution of benzoic acid falling
 within the limits 4 and 5-2, the difference in tension is too small to produce
 a rupture     of equilibrium.       The same remark applies to a solution of soap
 and     of bicarbonate of soda, which had no nuclear action.
     Action of Vapours. — It has been shown by recent researches that the
  presence of vapours in the air of a room, even in minute quantity, has a
 marked influence in lowering the tension of water and other liquids, so as
 to account for the discordant values of various careful measurements of the
  capillary heights of such liquids.         As to the nuclear action of the vapours
 of certain volatile liquids upon supersaturated saline solutions, many obser
 vations had been made by one of us, leading to the conclusion that such
  vapours are strongly nuclear when they become condensed into the form of
 films on the surface of the solutions, as when the latter is of a lower tem
 perature than the former.           In order to ascertain whether vapours, as such,
 that is, without forming films, have any nuclear action, the following ex
 periments were contrived.           The vapour was presented to the surface of the
 solution by means of a bit of spouge tied to the end of a glass rod, wetted
 with the volatile liquid and carefully passed down the neck of each flask,
 so as to avoid touching the side, and bringing the sponge close upon the
 surface to avoid touching that also*.          The sponge was held over the solution
  several    minutes, then carefully withdrawn and the flasks covered, leaving
 the interior charged with vapour.           The liquids used were ether, absolute
 alcohol, chloroform, bisulphide of carbon, wood-spirit, and benzole.                 The
 solutions were of all three strengths, and the temperature from 40° to 47° F.
 After many hours and even days the flasks had a strong odour of the
 vapours in question, but there was no separation of salt.
     Vapour of camphor was also tried in the following manner              : —
    Experiment 1. A quantity of camphor was placed in a small retort, the
 beak of which, made chemically clean by being heated in the flame of a
 spirit-lamp, was passed into a flask containing a solution of 2 parts salt
 to   1  of water.    The camphor in the belly of the retort was then boiled so
 as to produce a powerful jet of vapour upon the surface of the solution.
 The camphor condensed upon such surface in the form of a fine white
 powder without any nuclear action.
     In this case a portion of the vapour of camphor or of the powder would
 dissolve in the solution without producing in it a notable diminution of
 surface-tension.       The    same remark applies to the other vapours, to the
 action of solid camphor and benzoic acid, of heat, &c.
    So also, as stated in Part II., glycerine mingles with the solution without
 any nuclear action.         Now the surface-tension of glycerine =4*2 ; so that it
 can have no effect in lowering the surface-tension          of a solution = 4, and   does
    *   In a few cases tlio wet sponge did touch the solution fur an instant, so as to tale
 up a small portion, which immediately crystallized upon tho sponge; but the crystalli
 zation thus produced, not being in contact with the solution, the latter retained its
^liquid state.

 1872.]                  on Supersaturated Saline Solutions.                               347
not sufficiently lower the tension           of a solution    = 5-2   to produce a rupture
of equilibrium.
    It was also stated that bisulphide of carbon              t=3'3     to 3-5, and chloro-
form=2'98        to 3-12, formed lenses on the surface of the solution,              and that
on   gently agitating the flask they fell to the bottom, where they remained
permanently        without any nuclear action.              Creosote=3 behaves in the
same manner.          Now, in any one of these cases, the tension t-\-c must be
greater than 4-5, and hence there can be no separation of the salt.
    We now pass on to consider the second proposition, namely, that if on
the surface of a supersaturated saline solution there be deposited a drop
of a liquid of feeble tension, the drop spreads and crystallization is deter
mined.      Now it is shown in Part II. that drops of ether, of alcohol, and
of similar volatile liquids, as well as of certain oils, both volatile and fixed,
spread over the surface of the solutions and act as powerful nuclei.                        On
the surface-tension theory, a liquid such as ether,of which the tension= 1 -88,
or alcohol =2*5, or wood-naphtha = 2*1 1, or oil of lavender =2-9, must
spread on the surface of a supersaturated            solution of Glauber's salt of which
the surface-tension       is as high as from 4 to 5'2.           This is true in a large
number      of   cases that have been observed, and so far the phenomena are
consistent     with the theory ; but there are cases in which liquids of low
tension, such as oil of turpentine=2-2 to 2'4, and some varieties of castor-
oil=2-5, do not form films, but well-shaped lenses, and remain as such
during many hours and even days.                Quincke seems to have met with cases
of this sort in his elaborate inquiry on the capillary phenomena of the
common       surface   of two liquids*    ; and he endeavours      to account for these ex
ceptions    to the general law by the statement that            if a lens-shaped drop of a
liquid 2 (of low tension) remain on the free surface of a liquid 1 (of much
higher tension) without spreading itself out, then it is certain that in most,
and probable that in all cases the free surface of liquid 1 is rendered impure
by a thin layer of a foreign liquid 3.            Now in experiments on supersaturated
saline solutions,     the flasks, the filtering-apparatus,      and the solutions must be,
as already     explained by one      of us,  chemically    clean ; so that in boiling and
filtering a solution into clean flasks in which it is boiled up again, covered
over, and left to cool in the open air of the country, it is difficult to imagine
the existence of such a film as M. Quincke refers to. Moreover, did such a
film exist, the solution in cooling would probably become solid under its action.
Indeed this sometimes happens in the case of flasks that have been already
used in experiments on the nuclear action of oils ; for, however carefully
they are cleansed, it may happen that one or two out of a dozen may not
 be quite clean, so that, in the cooling of a boiling solution, a film detached
from the walls of the flask may spread over the surface with nuclear action.
In   order,   if possible,   to prevent the formation        of such   a  film, the following
experiment      was made : —

 34-8     Messrs. G. Tomlinson and         G..  Van der Mensbrugghe         [May 16,
 with the addition of a bit of caustic potash, was boiled and filtered into four
 clean flasks.    When cold, a drop of castor-oil was deposited upon the
 surface of each of the solutions. It flattened at first, but soon recovered the
 lenticular form.     There was no nuclear action during an hour. On gently
 shaking the Aasks, the oil was diffused through the solution without nuclear
 action.
    In an  experiment described in Part II. fragments of stearine were scraped
 into a solution with immediate nuclear action.          In such a case, the stearine
 furnished the film-forming material that produced the solidification of the
 solution.    The solution was boiled with the stearine in it; and in cooling
 the stearine formed into solid disks without nuclear action, although the
 flask was frequently shaken.         In this case the boiling solution had sapo
nified or otherwise removed the film-forming matter, or, in other words,
 had made the stearine chemically clean.
    There is also a difficulty in the case of oil of turpentine, as in the following
 experiment   : —
    Experiment 9. A drop of an old but clear and bright oil of turpentine
was deposited on the surface of a solution containing 2 parts of salt to
 1 of water.    The drop flashed out into a film, and the solution imme
 diately became solid.      The turpentine was now distilled, and a drop of the
 distillate was deposited on a similar solution, when it formed a well-shaped
lens with no nuclear action, although the flasks were left out during several
 days.
    Now the tension of the old oil first       used is =22,   and had the effect    of
distillation been greatly to exalt the tension, the experiment would have
been intelligible according to the theory ; but on measuring it the tension
was found to be only 2-4.
    A   somewhat similar     case is given     in Part II., in which   an  old oil  of
bitter almonds was strongly nuclear, while the same oil freshly distilled had
no such action, but became converted into benzoic acid, still without any
separation of salt.       After  some days, to prove    that the solution    was  still
supersaturated, it was touched with an unclean wire and              it immediately
became solid.
    Still, however, there are such a large number of cases in which oils and
other liquids spread upon the surface of the solutions with nuclear action as to
justify the labour bestowed upon the theory by one of us during the last
six months.      Many of these cases arc stated in Part II. ; but a few of them
may be repeated here for the sake of comparing the action of such liquids
upon solutions of different strengths, which was not done before.
    If we take a number of oils, the tension of which varies from about 2-5
to 3-5, a drop of any one of them, according to the theory, ougln to spread
on the surface of a solution where < = 5,2, and not in all cases spread on

castor-oil formed a lens with no nuclear action.
   Experiment 1 1. Three of the above solidified solutions were heated over
a lamp, boiled and covered over.      The oil collected on the surface in in
numerable small disks.      Next morning one of the solutions was found
crystallized, and the other two became solid on gently agitating the flasks.
   In this case as the solutions cooled down or were gently agitated the
disks spread out into films with nuclear action.
   Experiment 12. A solution of 3 parts salt to 1 of water was filtered
into twelve flasks, when a drop of each of the following oils deposited on
the   surfaces of the solutions became lenticular without any separation
of  salt, viz. pale seal-oil, olive- oil, rape, castor•oil, croton-oil, niger, sperm,
and cotton-seed oil.
   So far this result is in accordance with the theory.

spread out into films with powerful nuclear action.            Linseed- and castor-
oil formed lenses with no such action.
   Now it must be remarked that on the day when Exp. 1 2 was made the
weather was dull, damp, and cloudy, and during the time of Exp. 13 the
weather was bright and clear.    Some years ago it was a matter of frequent
observation to one of us, that the formation of cohesion-figures on the sur-
fac3 of water was much more rapid and decisive, with altogether finer and
sharper results, in bright weather as compared with dull, damp, wet, or
foggy weather.     The same remark applies to the motions of camphor
on water, and to those curious phenomena known as " camphor-cur
rents" and "camphor-pulsations"*.       In the production of all these phe
nomena,         as has been shown         by one of   usf,   surface-tension   plays   a   most
important part ;        and    such tension      in dull foggy weather pro
                                                  is lowered
bably by  the condensation of the vapour  of volatile  matters contained in
the atmosphere. A drop of a liquid under such conditions may not spread
on the surface of water or of mercury, the latter being especially liable to
such influences ; whereas on a bright day such surfaces are particularly
active, and experiments succeed which some hours or days before failed to
produce the results expected.
   Then, again, as pointed out by one of us in Part II., the viscosity of the
surface, or of the drop of liquid placed upon      may greatly interfere with

sequence of the presence of ozone and other matters in the air, which may
somewhat disturb the results expected to be obtained from the action of
surface-tension.
     It   was stated       in Part    II.      that when an oil &c. assumes                    the lenticular
form, the solution may be agitated so as to break up the lens into    mul                                  a
titude of globules, and give the solution the appearance of an emulsion.
In such case the tensions of the two liquids are of nearly the same value

solidification of the solution.  Now taking the tension of the solution at
5*2, and that            of oil of olives at         3*7, and the tension at the surface                  of   sepa

equal to the tension of the solution, and the spreading on the surface ought
to be impossible, unless fine clear weather, absolutely clean vessels and so
lutions, and the absence of surface-viscosity concur to increase the surface-
tension of the solution.  At the surface of separation of the solution and
of the glass, spreading may be possible in the case of certain oils without
these      concurring        circumstances.                Suppose   drop or

the surface, there           is
                             a    diminution           of tension     at the surface       of the solution
in contact with the oil           ;   but in such            a   case the tension        isnot sufficiently
lowered at one point as to render molecular equilibrium                                  impossible at this
point, and so break up the whole system of supersaturation.   But                                          if      the

differently according                as    they alter the tension of the liquid freely exposed
to the air, or the tension of the liquid in contact                    with the glass, which is
not of the same value.
   With      respect to Proposition                III.
                                         there is no difficulty. A liquid of con
siderable      contractile force, such as pure water, produces no separation of
salt in a solution of less contractile
                                    force. This explains a number of cases
described     in           of us submitted to the Society in July last*, in
                    a note by one
which solutions exposed for hours together to heavy rain did not crystal
lize, unless the rain brought down a speck of soot or some unclean body
that lowered      the surface-tension     of the solution. Indeed we know of no
liquid of superior tensile force to that of the solution, and not acting che
mically upon           it,
                     that has any influence in producing crystallization.
    Proposition    IV.  also agrees with the phenomena.            A glass rod or other
solid, more or less smeared with             film of a   liquid  of  low tension, when
                                                                       a

spect   to  supersaturated    saline  solutions.        the  solid beIfmade  chemically
clean,  it  may be plunged into the solution without altering its tension, and
hence there        no separation of salt.       And here        may be remarked that
                                                                              it

and distant flights which are performed by certain species of birds in
search of food or in their migrations to different localities.
    For us it is difficult to form a clear conception of the power of sight
possessed by birds if we only use our own faculties in this respect as the
standard of comparison ; by which          I  mean to imply that the mind must
be prepared for the consideration of the phenomena referred to by observ
ing in detail numerous important differences in the structure of the eye,
which     combine to facilitate     a conception     of ideas otherwise beyond the
reasonable limits to which even imagination might extend.
    This field of inquiry will long engage the attention of the naturalist and
 anatomist   ;  indeed   it may be said to be inexhaustible ; and I feel con
siderable hesitation in offering a contribution insignificantly small to the
 elucidation of a subject of such magnitude.
    We may acquire some idea of the sight of the bird by comparing the
 dimensions of the eye with those of the brain or the optic lobes ; and by
 arranging the measurements thus obtained, and referring them to some
 fixed standard, we may estimate the relative and individual powers of
 vision enjoyed by different species.         In illustration of this we have an in
 stance, in the case of one of the      birds  which I propose to describe minutely
 in this communication,         in which the     eye is actually considerably larger
 than in the human species; and we have a still more striking example, con
 sidering the size of the bird, in the Goura coronata.
     Again, if we regard the eye as an optical instrument, we may estimate
 its efficiency by examining the internal structures on which the formation
 and perception of the image depend, — such as the size and coefficient of
 refraction of the lens, the extent and character of the retina, and particu
 larly those differences of minute structures which have relation to suscep
 tibility to light, by which the night-flying birds are distinguished from the
 day-flyers.       Nor does the inquiry into the effects of domestication upon
 the sight appear less interesting.
     It is only to point out the various ways in which we may deal with this
  subject that I have mentioned these different lines of research, and in order
  that it may be understood that I have not overlooked their importance.
  It is to one particular property of the eye that my own observations have
  been chiefly directed, namely, the power of accommodation for distance ;
  and  I  shall endeavour to show that in birds great range of vision depends
  upon   the  development and character of the ciliary muscle, to which all are
  agreed that the power of adjustment is to be attributed.
     It is chiefly, then, a comparison of the ciliary muscle in different birds
  to which   I   invite attention, assuming the perfection of the sight to depend
  on this power of accommodation, and that again on the character of the
  muscle.      Let me first mention the general opinion entertained by those
  who are best acquainted with the habits of that class of bird* which
  astonish us by the rapidity and duration of their flights, namely the
  pigeons, in regard to the means by which they accomplish them.               In his

  1872.J            Dr. R.    J.   Lee on   the Sense   of Sight in Birds.         353
  interesting work on this subject Mr. Tegetmeier gives his reasons for con
  cluding that
                    " Homing," as it is termed in the Antwerp pigeon, is not the
  result of    " instinct,"  but of    " observation."     These pigeons require to be
  trained stage by stage, or they are certain to be lost.            The best of them
  refuse to fly in a fog or       in the  dark.    They crave in new localities some
  known landmark          ; and hence their       gradually increasing gyrations, until
  having descried        some    familiar   object, they recollect their route and fly
  straight ahead.        The objection that no pigeon can possibly see for two
  hundred miles ahead is met by the details of aeronautic experience. Mr.
  Glaisher, half a mile aloft in air, could embrace in his " bird's-eye
 view" the course of the Thames from the Nore to Richmond ; and Mr.
  Wheelwright, though puzzled to account for the flying pigeons " homing"
 across seas (as from London to Antwerp), which can offer no landmark,
 is disposed to attribute their power of doing so to their habit of soaring
 round, circling, and beating about until, sooner or later, they can descry
 their familiar guide-posts.
     My own observations entirely support Mr. Tegetmeier's conclusions.
 This part of my subject is one of general interest, and I trust that I
 shall be pardoned for attempting to alleviate the tediousness of anatomical
 details by this digression.
     It must     clearly be understood that perfection of sight for very near ob
jects    is as  important as very extensive range, and that the chief function of
 the ciliary muscle is to adjust the sight for the former rather than for the
 latter.     When the eye is at rest (that is to say, when the muscle is relaxed)
 vision of very distant objects is permitted ; and it is when the distance is
 diminished to a very few inches, and in small species of birds to consider
 ably less than an inch, that the action of the muscle is exerted.
     The exact functions performed by the ciliary muscle in all those verte-
 brata in which it exists are still undecided ; but it is not difficult to reconcile
 the accounts which have been given by different anatomists of its structure,
 if we are aware of the fact that the muscle does not possess the same
 characters in all classes of animals ; indeed that it is not precisely the same
 in those that are very nearly allied, so that it is important, particularly in
the case of birds,      as  will be seen, to mention the species under consideration.
     It  may be stated generally that in birds it is developed in a remarkable
degree ; in fish it is entirely wanting ; in the mammalia it varies directly in
proportion to the powers of sight possessed by the species, except in the
feline class       and in those animals which enjoy the power of nocturnal
vision, and in which the ciliary muscle is peculiarly large and differently
developed from the same structure in other mammals.
    The three specimens which are to be described belong to the Eagle Owl,
 the Egyptian Vulture, and the Buzzard.                They were brought from Egypt
by a gentleman who shot the birds himself, and removed the eyes while
in the fresh state, preserving them in spirit of wine till he sent them
to me.

354              Dr. R.    J.  Lee  on the Sense     of Sight in Birds.      [May 16,
    The   eye    of the Eagle Owl presents in the most striking degree the
peculiar characters of the class to which it belongs.              The first of these
are its shape and size, too well known to require description,              adapted as
they are to the very shallow cavities of the orbits.
    In the Egyptian Vulture the pyramidal shape of the             eye is less remark
able, and a slight approach is observable           in it to the spherical  globe.  Iu
the Buzzard this is still more marked, and the eye resembles as much the
 eye of the Pigeon as it does that of the Eagle Owl.
     In examination of specimens which have been preserved in spirit, it is
necessary     to restore the pliancy of the tissues of the ciliary muscle by
allowing them to remain in water for some days ; and I may observe that
as this condition must be obtained in order to make satisfactory prepara
tions, the method of using solutions of chromic acid or the bichromate of
potash to enable the anatomist to make sections is not to be recommended,
if the   object be to ascertain the dimensions of the muscle and the elasticity
of the ligament, which will be presently described. It need hardly be
 stated that the best mode of treating the eye is to freeze it and then make
sections.
    The strong plates of bone which exist in the sclerotic of birds preserve
the shape of the eye sufficiently well to allow of the dimensions being
ascertained after it has been preserved in spirit.
    In the Eagle Owl the dimensions           are as follow   : —
                                                                             in.

    The shape of the lens does not appear to be altered by the action of
alcohol   ; but the size is diminished, and the measurements just stated are
less than they would be found to be            if the lens had been perfectly fresh.
    The   eye  is first to  be  divided  into  equal halves by cutting through the
sclerotic, choroid, cornea, and iris. We may regard the sclerotic as a
hollow case enclosing a sphere, of which the choroid is the proper cover
ing, and which sphere is attached to its case by tissues of highly elastic
and muscular properties, by which a certain amount of movement is capable
of being effected in the parts on which the formation of the image depends.
 It is to be observed, however, that the posterior surface of the choroid is kept
in close apposition with the inner and posterior surface of the sclerotic, so
that movement of the anterior parts is not communicated to that part on
which the optic nerve is expanded.              Iu the eye of the Eagle Owl these
conditions are obtained in the following manner.
    The whole of the posterior surface of the choroid which corresponds to
the optic disk is kept in close apposition to the sclerotic by the direct
attachment of the circumference of the part immediately beneath the

  1872.]         Dr. R.  J. Lee  on the Sense   of Sight in Birds.           355
  margin of the retina ; it is also fixed where the nerve passes through the
 sclerotic, while delicate fibres from the choroid keep it in its position at
 other points.
    The anterior part of the choroid, on the contrary, is not in contact with
 the sclerotic, as the ciliary muscle and the structure I have termed the pos
 terior elastic ligament intervene.
    This division of the choroid is not artificial, but is clearly defined by a
 difference of structure.       The posterior part is but slightly vascular, is
 not elastic, is of considerable tenuity, and has greater resemblance in its
general characters to the choroid of fish than to that of the mammalia.
    The anterior portion is covered on its internal surface by the ciliary
 processes, which extend to the angle of curvature of the posterior part of
 the eye.    The tissue of this part of the choroid is of peculiar character ; it
is dense, strong, and inelastic, and appears to be composed of delicate
fibrous tissue. The combination of these characters enables it to preserve
 its symmetrical shape, and ensure to some degree the preservation of the
structures within it.      It possesses a rigidity which may be compared to
 that of ordinary writing-paper, and is of about the same thickness.        The
 anterior part of the choroid is attached to the sclerotic by another struc
 ture — a system of fine elastic fibres which pass from the corneal margin of
the sclerotic to the line of union between the iris and the choroid, and for
which I proposed the name of anterior elastic filaments.        Between the an
 terior elastic filaments and the posterior elastic ligament (a distance in the
 eye of the Eagle Owl of nearly five eighths of an inch) is interposed the
 ciliary muscle. The body of the muscle is attached to the line of union
of the sclerotic and cornea, so that it may be said to arise from the anterior
angle of curvature.      The greater part of the posterior portion of the muscle
is of delicate tendinous structure ; its line of insertion into the choroid is
the same as, but on the opposite side of, the line of insertion of the pos
terior elastic ligament.      The breadth of the latter structure is about one
eighth    of  an inch,  while  the length of the anterior elastic filaments is
nearly the same.       Thus, passing from before backwards, we have the an
terior elastic filaments, the body of the ciliary muscle, its long delicate
tendinous portion, and lastly the posterior elastic ligament.        To exhibit
the structures satisfactorily,   the best  plan is to make a section of the cho
roid and sclerotic of one sixteenth of an inch in thickness, and after fixing
the two ends of the section on a layer of cork with needles, to dissect the
muscle under water or alcohol — a very simple process if a magnifying-glass
of an inch focus is employed.       It is only necessary to draw the iris gently
away from the sclerotic so as to extend the anterior elastic filaments, fixing
it with a needle, and then to do the same with the choroid, taking care to
hold that membrane at a point posterior to the line of insertion of the pos
terior elastic ligament.
    The length of the ciliary muscle is about three eighths of an inch. I have
attempted to preserve sections made in this way in Canada balsam, but

  have found that rupture of the ligament usually takes place, I presume from
 its tenacity being destroyed by the action of the fluid.     It is on that part
 of the choroid which lies between its two lines of attachment, on its in
 ternal surface, that the ciliary processes are developed, and to the anterior
 part of those processes that the crystalline lens is attached.       Contraction
 of the ciliary muscle, it is reasonable to suppose, would produce a change in
 the position of the lens, and would take place when the object to which
 the sight was directed was close to the eye — that is to say, the muscle is
 employed in accommodation for short range of vision.           The position of
 rest is restored by the posterior elastic ligament, which acts in direct       op
 position to the muscle.
     The  eye of the Vulture is smaller than that of the Owl, is not         so de
 cidedly pyramidal in shape, and may be placed between the latter and the
 eye  of the Buzzard.      The chief difference, however, between them is in
 the greater degree of concavity which the posterior portion of the sclerotic
 assumes   ; so that in the Owl the retina lies on a flatter surface than in the
 Buzzard, while in that respect the Vulture is between the two.
    The dimensions of the eye of the Vulture are as follow : —

    With regard to the anterior elastic filaments and the posterior elastic

    In order to ascertain the mechanical effect produced by the ciliary
muscle, the simple experiment may be performed of applying traction, by-
means of a pair of forceps, on the choroid, the dissection being arranged
and fixed as I have described.         It will readily be seen that the elastic
ligament acts in direct opposition to the muscle, and in the living eye has
the power of restoring the parts to the condition of rest.
    The ciliary muscle is composed of striated fibre of very distinct character.

  It  varies, as is seen in the three examples described, in length and amount
  of muscular      tissue.     The tendon in the Owl is long and the body of the
  muscle    short ; but in the other species, as in most birds, the muscular
  fibres extend to a great length, if not entirely from the origin to the in
  sertion of the muscle.           These minute differences should be pointed out in
  detail in the case of each species of bird.
      The elastic ligament is composed of very delicate elastic tissue, the micro
  scopical character of which is well defined.
      On the peculiar nature of the anterior elastic filaments I beg to postpone
  any decided opinion.
      With    regard to the nerves which          supply the ciliary muscle and the iris,
  I  have   no particular remarks           to offer, as   the description    which I gave
  some years ago of the ganglia and plexuses on the ciliary nerves in the
  eye of the Pheasant will apply generally to all birds.                   Whether the con
  traction of the iris and the accommodation of the sight be voluntary or
  involuntary actions on the part of birds we cannot say positively ; I am in
  clined to believe that the latter is the case.
      For the sake of convenience, and to render any further researches on
  the dimensions of the different parts of the eye in other species of birds
  symmetrical with those contained in this communication, I have arranged
  the principal facts in the following tabulated form : —

      From the above Table we may draw the following conclusions : — that in
i
  the Eagle Owl        the range of vision is small, the power of accommodation
   very rapid ; in the Vulture range of vision is great, the power of accom

modation      considerable, but slower than in the Owl       ;   in the Buzzard   the
range of vision is greater still, and the power of accommodation capable of
being readily and extensively exercised.
   These conclusions, I think, will be found to accord with the observations
of those who have had opportunities of making themselves acquainted with
the habits of the birds during life.
   It   has been usual for those who have          devoted much attention    to   the
physiology of vision to propose some original and independent explanation
of the means by which accommodation for distance is effected, if their
researches have been attended with the observation of any previously un
known facts connected with the subject, either experimental or anatomical.
It appears to me that as yet we have not sufficient data to afford a per
fectly satisfactory explanation of that remarkable property possessed by
the eye, partly on account of the difficulty of ascertaining the exact func
tions of different structures, and particularly by reason of the very various
conditions which the same structures assume in various species of verte
brate animals.   The line of investigation which is pointed out in this com
munication it is by no means certain will assist in the solution of the pro
blem of the means by which adjustment for distance is effected ; but I am
inclined to think that we have not yet exhausted all the resources which
careful anatomical inquiry places at our command, and that when a suf
ficient number of details have been collected, the subject will be in a more
suitable state for the application of optical laws than it is at present.
Supplement, containing         a  Description of the Eye in Rhea americana,
        Phcenicopterus      antiquorum, and Aptenodytes Humboldtii.     Re
        ceived   April   27, 1872.
   In the American Ostrich the         eye is large, and the structures concerned
in the adjustment for distance are well developed.    In the Ostrich (Stru-
thio camelut)  the observation  was first made  by  Sir P. Crampton of the
existence of the ciliary muscle ; and as the views of physiologists regarding
the mechanical functions of the muscle in the accommodation of sight were
various, while numerous inquiries were made very soon after the publication
of this                 fact,
           new anatomical          I
                                 am gratified in having the opportunity    of
pointing out the  cause of the discrepancies in opinion which have continued
to the present time.
  The description which Crampton lias given is correct so far as it goes,
but it was limited to that part of the ciliary muscle which forms the thickest
portion of       it,
                 that    to say, the dense part which lies closest to the
                          is
margin of the cornea.     The tendon of the muscle and its insertion into
the choroid       were not observed     by
                                       Crampton, and the structure termed
the posterior elastic ligament was overlooked.    It can thus be explained
how    was
      it    that the deflection of the margin of the cornea and consequent

 change in its curvature       were advanced     as the means  by which accommoda
 tion was effected.
    The eye of Rhea americana appears to be very similar to that of Struthio
 camelus, though not quite so large.            The globe is of irregular shape, and
 bulges out both laterally       and   vertically ; its diameter in the former direc
 tion is an inch    and   two  thirds,  in the latter an inch and a half, and antero-
 posteriorly  an   inch   and  one  third.
    The sclerotic is not particularly thick, and contains but slightly deve
loped osseous structure.         The crystalline lens is about half an inch in its
lateral diameter, and one'third of an inch in its antero-posterior          diameter.
The ciliary muscle is large and strong, the body thick, and the fibres
 diminishing in size as they become tendinous near their insertion ; its length
is  y\  inch.
    The   anterior   and posterior elastic ligaments are each about -fa inch in
length,    though    it is to be understood that their elasticity is so great that
they might be stretched to a considerably greater length.
    In the first part of this communication I expressed some doubt regarding
the microscopical character of the anterior elastic ligaments ; indeed the
term ligament was not applied             to them, as they did not possess the same
distinct character as the posterior elastic ligament.
    In all the species of birds which have come under my observation, the
microscopical character of the last-mentioned structure was the same.                In
the Rhea the anterior elastic filaments are distinctly composed of the same
kind of elastic fibres ; their colour is a light-grey ; they coil up very readily
when torn from one another with needles ; they are to some extent covered
with fine granular or spongy tissue, which at first conceals their elastic
character ; they are continuous and of equal diameter from their origin to
their insertion, and are united more closely than in most birds, so that the
filamentous character so clearly seen in the Owls is not observed.
    A  more complete investigation into the anatomy of this part of the sub
ject allows of the conclusion that the anterior elastic filaments are composed
of cellular and elastic tissue combined in different proportions, and that
the differences in their strength, elasticity, and appearance depend on the
collection of the filaments into fibres of varying sizes, or their approxima
tion so as to form a continuous suspensory band between the iris and the
cornea.
    The iris in this bird is not composed entirely of muscular fibres as in
manv other genera, but is soft and spongy in its general character, and
more like the iris in mammalia than in birds.
    As it is desirable to limit myself to those particular structures which are
concerned in the accommodation             of the eye for distance, deferring for the
present certain general conclusions which fresh observations are required
to confirm, I shall leave to the consideration of the naturalist the subjoined
facts arranged in a tabulated form, and which appear to me to be applicable
to the explanation of the habits of the birds by anatomical           peculiarities.

 The Bakerian Lecture was delivered by William Kitchen
        Parker, F.R.S., " On the Structure and Development of the
        Skull of the Salmon {Salmo salar, L.)." The following is an
        Abstract.
     A  few years ago Mr. Waterhouse Hawkins put into my hands some
 newly hatched salmon and also three of the first summer.                           Seeing their
 fitness for embryological research and the interest attaching to the formation
 of an osseous fish, I applied to my friends Messrs. Frank Buckland and
 Henry Lee, and these gentlemen most liberally supplied me with a large
number of unhatched embryos aud of the
                                                          " fry " of this large fish.
     My last subject, the frog, being fairly out of hand, I set myself last
summer to this newer and more easy task, — more easy by far, for the
translucency of the young salmon contrasts most favourably with the
obscurity of the embryo frog.
    I found that the two types at the time of hatching did not start fairly,
but that the salmon had hastened to finish its fourth staye before emerging
from the egg ; this, however, is partly in consequence of the difference of
the envelope in which the embryos are contained ; for in the salmon this
is a leathery "chorion," and in the frog a mere gelatinous bleb.
    Moreover, it soon became apparent that these two " Ichthyopsidans" are

in nowise near akin to each other.          In  the very first stage, where there is an
essential agreement,       in one important particular they greatly        disagree ; for
the embryo       of the salmon has two arches in front of its mouth, while the
tadpole has but one ; there is also an additional gill•arch in the osseous
fish.
    In   the earliest stage of the salmon worked          out by me    I  found a much
more distinct condition         of  the parts than in frogs at the same stage ; the
 differentiation    of  the latter is obscure as compared        with the fish, and this
not merely because        of  the quantity of pigmentum        nigrum   in the tissues of
 the former.
    Then, in addition to other causes of obscuration, the mouth of the tad
pole is strangely modified in harmony with its "suctorial" character and
 affinities (showing a remarkable affinity to the mouth of a lamprey), so that
 a whole system of cartilages has to be eliminated             from the lips before the
 mouth (proper) can be understood.             The labial system is slightly and slowly
 developed in the salmon, and its mouth is thus much more in harmony with
 that   of the embryo reptile or bird than with that of the tadpole.
     After the simple stage is passed, the development of the facial arches is
 very different in the two types, — as different, indeed, as in any two possible
 examples that could be given in the whole vertebrate group.
     The facial arches behind the mouth now undergo segmentation ; first the
 hyoid, and then the mandibular.            The hyoid is cloven from top to bottom,
 and also has a single distal piece separated off.
     At this stage we get an explanation of what is seen in certain rays, where
 the hyoid suspensorium is permanently double ; and also ascertain that this
 second postoral arch, which retains the anterior piece in relation to the
 skull    as  the great   "hyomandibular"         pier, does not need the saw of the
 transcendentalist     to put it into proper relation to its surroundings.       Nature's
 invisible wedge has done what was needed, and the supposed double rib
 turns out to      be  half   a visceral  arch.     On the whole, this second stage is
 extremely
                " Plagiostomous,"      for the details of which I must refer to the
 main paper.
     While in the egg the head of the embryo is flattened, and so twisted
 that one of the eyes (it may be the left or the right) looks upwards towards
 the "chorion," the other having a visceral direction.
     The facial bars, at first having all a simple sigmoid form, rapidly change
 towards the time of hatching, and, when the head gets free, the cerebral
 vesicles    speedily swell, taking on the form so familiar to the embrvologist :
 and the head now gains the " mesocephalic flexure."
     After this an approach is made to the Teleostean type of structure ;
 but this is not done at a stride. The intermediate condition is thoroughly
 " Ganoid," and, happily, comes in to explain the related structures of the
 older and newer "Orders."              I am not aware that any stage of the heart
 or of the intestines shows either the many valves of the "aortic bulb" or
 the intestinal spiral valve       : this must    be seen to ; yet  if these never show

themselves in the     "fry"   of the osseous   fish, their absence does not affect
the general skeletal morphology.
    The salmon amongst fishes, like the fowl amongst birds, never attains to
the greatest degree of special class-modification ; it remains suulypical,
with    a dentigerous  maxillary, a ductus pneumaticus, a very chondrosteus
state of the skull, and a very heterocercal tail.
    Yet, from an ichthyological point of view, this fish is an immense height
above the Sharks and Bays, and is far in advance, as a fish, of the whole
group of
            " Ganoids."
    The results of the gradational study of the fish-forms by the zoologist,
and of their secular study by the palaeontologist, are both in harmony with
morphological facts. Although the light obtained is but as the first streak
of dawn, yet it is a pleasant light, and quite sufficient to show each kind of
worker where and how to renew his own special toil.
    I cannot close this brief abstract without remarking that my researches
in these, the highest types of animals, seem to me to be in perfect accord
ance    with the results obtained by long study of the very lowest, the
Rhizopods — namely, that they both yield increasing evidence in favour
of the doctrine of Evolution.
    Researches of this kind show what the life-processes can accomplish in
the history of one individual animal, and also that the morphological steps
and stages are not arbitrary, but take place in a manner in accordance with
all that has of late been revealed to us of the gradation of types in the ages
that are past.

I. " On     Ammonia in the Urine in Health and Disease."                  By C.
       Meymott Tidy, M.B., Joint Lecturer on Chemistry and Medical
       Jurisprudence at the London Hospital;                 and W. Bathurst
       Woodman, M.D., Joint Lecturer on Physiology, and Assistant
       Physician to the London Hospital. Communicated byT. Blizard
       Curling, President of the Royal Medical andChirurgical Society.
       Received   April   16, 1872.
                                   (Abstract.)
    The authors refer    to the researches   of Andrews, Clark, Neubauer     and
Vogel, and others on the presence of ammonia as a constant constituent
of healthy urine, Neubauer regarding 10-8 grains per diem as the average
normal excretion.      After numerous experiments, the authors regard this
quantity as excessive, and suggest some reasons for this discrepancy.
    The method adopted by the authors is as follows : —
    The freshly passed urine is to be first diluted with a given bulk of dis
tilled water, sufficient to destroy all apparent colour, a known quantity
of the urine being taken in each case. To these is to be added an excess

of Nessler's solution, and then compared with the tint-depth produced by
known quantities of ammonia in a similar bulk of liquid treated with the
same solution.         The trace of ammonia in the water itself must be always
allowed for. The external temperature in the observations was always
about 62°.
   They regard      60 oz. as the normal daily excretion      of urine in adults.
                                 I. Ammonia in Health.
   In   50 cases the average quantity       of ammonia
              =0-0825 gr. in        1000 grs.   = 2-1656 grs. per diem.
   The    10 highest cases gave an average       of
                 0-1620 gr. per 1000 grs.=4-2525 grs. per diem.
    The   10 lowest cases gave an average of
                   0-0252 gr. per 1000 grs.=0-6615 gr. per diem.
    The   mean   of  these 20 cases gives
                   0-0936 gr. per 1000 grs. = 2-457 grs. per diem.
   The authors conclude that the average daily excretion of ammonia in
health amounts to rather less than 2-5 grs. in 24 hours.
    These results are modified by : —
    1st, age. The amount of ammonia was largest under the age of 35 years,
to the extent of a little over one third.
    2nd, sex, but very slightly (?).
   3rd, food.      The amount of ammonia after meals was nearly double that
excreted before meals.           Their experiments seem to prove that a large
proportion    of  the   urinary ammonia is derived from the food ingested ; con
firmed by other experiments.
   4th, atmospheric conditions.           The authors consider that the excretion
of ammonia by the kidneys is governed by a similar law to that which
regulates the formation of dews.
   5th, exercise increases the excretion of ammonia.
                               II.  Ammonia in Disease.
    Before dealing with special diseases, the authors examined the influence
 of some general conditions both of the urine and the patients.
    A, colour of the urine. (Vogel's colour-scale was adopted.) From No. 1
to No. 7 the ammonia rises in proportion to colour (jaundice and hasma-
 turia being excluded).         True also, to a great extent, of normal urine.
    B, specific gravity of the urine.        The general rule is that the excretion
of ammonia keeps pace with the specific gravity.
   C, pulse.      The lowest quantities were met with when the pulse was
rapid, the highest average           being met with   when the pulse was      nearly
normal.
   D, respirations.        It appears that the amount of ammonia decreases
with accelerated respirations.
   E, temperature (axillary). The largest excretion per 1000 grains is

 364         On Ammonia in t/ie Urine in Health and Disease.             [May 30,
 found with nearly normal temperatures ; but when the total quantity of
 urine is estimated, it is seen that such normal temperatures (as in diabetes)
 go with increased ammonia.
    F, condition of skin. The largest excretion occurred when the skin waa
 moist.
    G, condition   of tongue.     Excretion largest with moist tongue.
    H, condition of     bowels.     Ammonia was slightly in excess when the
 bowels were open.
    I, diet. Even in various diseases        the amount of ammonia was very
 much larger when the diet was full and included stimulants.
    K,  medicines.    Only acids and alkalies contrasted.       The amount      was
 nearly double in the case of acids.
                                III. Special Diseases.
    A, acute rheumatism.         In  nineteen    observations  ammonia    equalled
 0-0C84 gr. per 1000 grs.
                              = 1*7955 gr. per diem.
 Considerably   less than normal.
    B, erysipelas.     In ten observations
           NH3=0-0402 gr. per         1000 grs. = 1-0552 gr. per diem.
Very much under health.
   C, diabetes. In seven observations, with            an average  of 240   oz.  of
urine per diem,
           NH3=0-0348 gr. per 1000 grs.=3"G54 grs. per diem.
Considerably in excess of healthy urine.
   D, smallpox.      In eleven cases
           NH3=0-0G27 gr. per         1000 grs.
   E, enteric fever. In eleven cases
           NH3=00543 gr. per 1000 grs.
   F, typhus fever. In two cases
           NH,=    0-0435 gr. per 1000 grs.
   N.B. — The results of B, D, E, and F, considering that the amount of
urine will be nearer 25 oz. than        GO oz.  per diem, show that the amount
of ammonia excreted in these diseases is actually less than one fourth that
of health.
   G, cancer (verified by jwst mortem examinations).             In five observa
tions
          NII3=0-0918 gr. per 1000 grs. = 2-4097 grs. per diem.
   II, heart disease (chiefly valvular). In ten cases
          NH3=0-0927 gr. per 1000 grs. =2-4334 grs. per diem.
   I, chronic alcoholism. In four observations
          NII3 = 0-1065 gr. per 1000 grs. = 2-795G grs. per diem,
N.B. — G, II,   I  show ammonia very nearly normal, as might be expected.
   K,  chorea.    In six observations

vast decrease in the amount of ammonia.          Eight cases gave an average of

   In two cases it was entirely absent, the only          cases  of entire  absence
known to the authors.
   The authors refrain from   any generalization.      The total number of cases
upon    which observations were   made   exceeded    200.
II.   "Examination of the Gases occluded in Meteoric Iron from
       Augusta Co., Virginia."         By J. W. Mallet, Ph.D., M.D., Pro
       fessor of Analytical and Applied Chemistry, University of Vir
       ginia.   Communicated by K. Mallet, C.E.                    Received April
       23, 1872.
   The investigation by Graham of the gases given off by meteoric iron
from    Lenarto, in Hungary, when heated in a vacuum produced by a
Sprengel pump, excited much interest at the time of publication*,                 but
does not seem     to have  been   followed   up by any      similar examination    of
other meteorites.    I have made use of pieces of the iron found about
three years ago in Augusta Co., Virginia, the description and analysis of
which were published by me in the ' American Journal of Science for
                                                                                '
July 1871, in order to repeat the experiment of Graham, and ascertain
whether similar results to his would be obtained.              A large part of the
 work of the extraction and analysis of the gaseous contents of this iron has
 been done by two of the students in my laboratory, Mr. F. P. Dunnington,
 of Baltimore, and Mr. J. B. Adger, of South Carolina, to whom I am much
indebted for their assistance.
    Two preliminary experiments were made, — the first with some shavings
from the cutting of the iron upon a planing-machine ; the second with a
solid piece of the metal planed to smooth, clean surfaces, and quite free

  from any crust or scale.         The shavings were subjected to the purification
  practised by Graham, namely, washing with a hot solution of potassic
  hydrate, followed by washing with distilled water and thorough drying.
  The solid strip of iron was not so treated, care having been taken to use no
  oil upon the tool employed in cutting it. Both specimens gave off gas
  readily  when heated       in the Sprengel vacuum, the amount in each case
  being larger in proportion       to the bulk of the iron than in the experiment of
  Graham    ; and analysis showed that the same gases were present as those
  found by him, with the addition of carbonic anhydride in not inconsiderable
  amount.
     The final experiment was made as follows, with great care, and with all
  precautions which could be thought of to avoid error.
     A pnrallelopiped of iron was cut upon a planing-machine from the
  largest of the three masses found (that spoken of as No. 1* in the paper
  above referred to), the work being done with special care, to avoid the
  least trace of grease being derived from the machine.
     Not only was the cutting-tool itself made red-hot in the blacksmith's fire,
  hardened in clean water, and tempered and ground without contact with
  any thing greasy, but every part of the machine-bed, set-screws, and frame,
  from which     any risk was to be feared, was carefully cleansed, and paper
  used to cover the whole of the iron, except where actually borne upon by
  the tool.    The piece of iron measured about 75 millims. long, 16 millims.
  wide, and 12 millims. thick.           It was cut from as solid   a portion of the
  mass as could be found, and was quite bright upon the surface and free
  from crust, though traces of a very minute crack or fissure were barely
  perceptible at one end. The piece weighed 124-589 grammes ; and as the
  specific gravity of the iron had been found to be 7'853, the volume was
   15'87 cub. centims.       A new and perfectly clean porcelain tube, with sound
  glaze, was   used,   heated     by a small upright fire-clay furnace with good
  draught, through holes in the opposite sides of which the tube was passed.
  The fuel was charcoal, in pieces a little larger than a walnut.               The
  Sprengl      pump had a fall-tube of about P34 metre long ; its connexions
   were made with great care, and were protected by outer casings of india-

rine.  A plate of glass floating on the mercury in the funnel at top served
to prevent the risk of air being carried down, as the metal was gently
poured on through another and smaller funnel with narrow aperture.
  A   good vacuum having been obtained in the cold, lighted charcoal was
placed in the furnace, and gas very soon began to come off.
   It was determined to analyze separately that collected at the beginning,

  It will   be seen that the greater part cameoff within the first two hours
and a half ; but the process lasted fourteen hour* and a half, and was not
entirely over at the end even of this time.   The heat had been gradually
raised from dull redness to something nearly approaching whiteness at the
end of the time ; and when the experiment was stopped very small but still
perceptible traces of gas were still coming off, though their appearance
was  immediately arrested whenever the temperature was allowed to fall
but a little below the high point which had been reached.
  The piece of iron taken out from the tube when it had become quite cold
was found glazed by a thin film of fused phosphide of iron and nickel
(Schreibersite), thickest on the edge which had been lowest, this phosphide
having oozed out from the mass at the very high temperature used.
  The tubes used   to collect the gas during the first portion of the time
occupied in the experiment were found slightly moistened on the inside,
and the moisture, which had a distinctly acid reaction, was proved to
contain hydrochloric acid, this having no doubt been derived from the
chlorine existing in the iron in combination with that metal and with nickel.

   Other  gases were     tested  for, but none could be found          ;  no free oxygen
could be detected, nor any compound of carbon and hydrogen.
    From these figures it appears that hydrogen maintains about the same
proportion to the other gases in A and B, but diminishes largely in C,
that carbonic oxide increases in amount in B              as   compared with A, but re
mains about the same in relative amount in C, that carbonic anhydride
diminishes throughout the whole continuance of the experiment, and that
nitrogen falls off in B as compared with A, but largely increases again
in C.
    Contrasting the results with those of Graham, and noticing first the total
rolume of gas obtained from the iron, it becomes necessary to rednce this
volume to the same standards of pressure and temperature employed by
him.     In the paper read before the Royal Society, as reported in its ' Pro
ceedings,'  I  find no statement in regard to such standards; but, supposing
it probable that the barometer at 30 inches and thermometer at 60° F.
 were referred to, I have calculated the volume of gas obtained in all from
 1 5-87 cub. centims. of iron as equivalent under these conditions of pressure
 and temperature to 5040 cub. centims., or 3- 1 7 times the volume of the
 metal.    This   is a somewhat larger quantity         than that of Graham, namely
 2-85 times the volume of the Lenarto iron used ; but the time of heating
 was longer in the experiment now described, and the temperature attained
 probably much higher.
    As  to the nature and relative amount        of the constituent      gases, the results
 differ very noticeably from those of Graham, as is evident when the
 figures of the two analyses are placed side by side : —

would     deny to the Virginia specimen the right to be classed amongst
meteoric masses, with which, however, all its other physical and chemical
characteristics agree most fully.
    It is to be noted that the analysis of the gases from the Lenarto iron was
not made with the whole of the gaseous matter collected : the first portion,
amounting to about 32-5 per cent, of all collected, was used for merely
qualitative examination ; the second portion, 57"6 percent., was that fully
analyzed     ; while no mention is made of the disposition of the remaining
third portion of 9-9 per cent. ; and it is stated that the iron was not fully
exhausted at the end of two hours and thirty-five minutes, for which time
only the experiment was continued.                In my own experiment it appears
probable that      the amount    of  hydrogen (and with it the total volume of gas)
has been slightly diminished by its union with chlorine of metallic chlorides
to form the minute quantity of hydrochloric acid observed in the faint film
of moisture on the sides of the first tubes ; and probably also this moisture
itself may have been caused by the partial reduction, by means of hy
drogen, of carbonic auhydride to carbonic oxide.                   Although it might be
assumed, especially in view of the strong tendency of iron to take up and
 " occlude " carbonic oxide, that this gas had been the original form in which
 the gaseous carbon compounds obtained existed in the iron, and that it had
 in part broken up at the temperature of the experiment into carbon (re
 maining united with the iron) and carbonic anhydride (which escaped as
 gas), yet, in view of the steady decrease in the quantity of this latter gas
 collected as the experiment proceeded and the temperature became higher,
 and bearing in mind the ready decomposition it undergoes in contact with
 ignited iron, it seems more likely that a larger amount of carbon originally
 existed in the iron in this higher state of oxidation than appears from the
 figures of the analysis.        Although the proportion of hydrogen found is so
  much less in the Virginia than in the Lenarto iron, it yet represents for the
  former about 1 14 times the volume of the iron itself, whereas common ter
                     -
  restrial iron occludes but about •42--46 of its own volume under ordinary
  pressure.
      I am quite satisfied, from the condition           of the    masses of iron as they
  came    into my hands, and       especially from the character of the crust, that
  the metal has not been subjected to any heating in a blacksmith's fire or
  otherwise by human hands since it was found, as has sometimes happened
  to similar specimens in the endeavour to discover their nature, or to make
  use   of them.
      Whether or not this analysis be considered as furnishing presumptive
  evidence of the Virginia iron having come to our earth from a different
  atmosphere to that of which the Lenarto meteorite brought us a sample*,
  the result differs so far from that of our sole previously recorded determi-
     * Some of   the observations of Secchi and Huggins seem to render it probable that
   carbon may play an important part in Bome regions of the universe, though the results
   on this head are not as full or satisfactory as those in reference to hydrogen.

    The   ear     well known, one of the most complicated organs of the
                 is,   it   is
body, consisting of the external, middle, and internal sections, the two
former being concerned in collecting and conducting sounds or vibrations,
while the duty of the internal portion consists in receiving, localizing, and
clearly distinguishing  them.    It    simply with this last function of the

                I
and use of the cochlea, so far as its task of distinguishing the various
sounds     is   concerned.            This cochlea,       it   must be borne in mind, consists          of
a spiral canal, in form and shape very similar to the inside of snail-shell.             a
From the axis of this spiral, there proceeds horizontally     plate of bone,       a
the lamina spiralis, almost dividing this canal into two from this plate,      ;
again, there extend two membranes, the membrane of Reissner and the
lamina spiralis membranacea, as far as the walls of the canal, thus sepa
rating   into three minor canals.
          it
   Between the layers of the membranous spiral lamina are situated the
so-called Rods of Corti. These were first discovered and described by the
Marquis de Corti and although since then many observers have studied
                             ;
the subject, yet scarcely two investigators are agreed as to their exact
form.
   Deiters has published the results of two investigations,  which the form        in
of the rods   differently described
                 is                    Kolliker, Henle, and others appear to
                                                     ;
agree with Deiters's later view, and most of our text-books have copied
their drawings.    Recent writers, such as Dr. A. Bottcher, Waldeyer, &c,
give varying drawings, some of which are nearer the true form of the rods
than that of Deiters, while others exhibit them all kinds of extraordinary
                                                                         in
shapes.
    In   a general view          of the rods from             above, they appear        similar    to two
rows  of pianoforte-hammers, rather than like the keys of that instru
ment, to which they have been likened.  In lateral view, these two rows
                                                                     a
of rods are seen sloping towards each other, like the rafters of gabled                       a
roof.     The rods consist of             a   shaft and two enlarged extremities, but the
two rows differ considerably in form                   the inner rods are attached
                                                          ;                          their        by

lower extremities to the membrana basilaris at its junction with the lower
lip of the limbus, and just external to the spot where the nerve-filaments
emerge ; they are directed outwards and upwards, with a slight undula
tion to meet the outer rods.     The lower extremity      is enlarged and rounded,
gradually   tapering to the shaft, which is cylindrical       ; the upper extremity
is somewhat cuboid in form, but the outer surface is deeply concave, and
the upper lip of the concavity is prolonged into a process.
    The outer rods are attached    to the membrana      basilaris by a broad base,
which also gradually tapers to      a  cylindrical shaft.    Their upper extremity
is less cuboid in form, and presents a convex internal surface, which arti
culates with the corresponding concavity in the inner rods just mentioned ;
from the outer and upper part there extends outwards a slender process.
    One of the most important features with regard to these rods is their
relative length.     Most authors state that there is very little difference in
the length of the two rods ; in this, however, they are much mistaken ; for
not only   do the two sets    of rods differ in this respect, but the length of
each varies  according to its position on the cochlea. Thus, at the base, the
outer rods are   as  nearly as possible equal in length to the inner ; but pro
ceeding upwards, both rows increase in length with great regularity,
although not in the same ratio, the outer increasing with much greater
rapidity, so that near the apex they are twice the length of the inner.
    It was  generally supposed, a priori, that these rods were graduated so
as to distinguish   the most minute variation of tone, but no one until now
has been able to demonstrate this.
    The rods, therefore, vary in length from about t-^j to -j^o °^ an i|ich.
The number of rods in each row is not the same, there being about three
of the inner to two of the outer ; and, according to calculation, there are
about 5200 inner rods and 3500 outer in the whole cochlea.
    Most authors, with the exception of Deiters, describe nuclei situated in
various parts of these rods, principally in the lower extremities ; but al
though seen from above this appears to be the case, on closer observation
these so-called nuclei of the rods are found to be nothing more than the
nuclei of cells surrounding them.
    The arrangement     of the  nerves.  —The    cochlear nerve-fibres    from the
portio mollis pass up the modiolus, and turn off at the lamina spiralis.
Just at this junction we find in the bone itself a ganglion, from which the
 fibres proceed outward.      Immediately before the end of the lower lip of
 the limbus, the nerve-filaments pierce its upper surface, and appear close
to the base   of the inner row of rods ; concerning the termination of these
nerve-filaments little is really known.
    Corti and most other authors considered this system of rods to be the
 essential portion of the cochlea ; they supposed that the rods received the
vibrations   conducted to them, and being set in motion, so affected the
nerves   as to cause the brain to appreciate the various sounds.              Later
 German writers have attributed       the appreciation of the various vibrations

372               Lieut.-Col, A. Strange on a new Theodolite
to certain delicate cells which         are attached    to the under   surface of the
membrana       reticularis.      From this   circumstance     alone it appears very
evident that these investigators had not suspected, much less discovered,
the fact that the rods are most exquisitely graduated, for otherwise they
could    surely never have doubted that so beautiful and suitable an appa
ratus   could   have any other ostensible purpose than that of appreciating
the various sounds.           I consider, indeed, that the cochlea represents a
musical instrument,        similar in nature to a harp or musical box, the strings
of the    one   and the teeth of the other being represented by the rods of
Cortj.     The spiral bony lamina is simply a sounding-board ; around the
rods are placed the various nerve-cells and nerve-fibres, and from these
cells the impressions are conveyed by the fibres to the brain itself.
    It is possible, therefore, to trace very completely the course of sounds
 or vibrations    from a musical instrument or any other source to the brain,
 through    the  medium     of the ear. First the vibrations are caught and col
 lected   by the auricle, and transmitted through the external meatus to
 the drum of the ear, next across the middle to the internal ear.            Here the
 sound is appreciated, merely as a sound, by the vestibule ; the direction is
 discovered by means of the semicircular canals ; but to distinguish the
 note of the sound, it must pass on to the cochlea.              The vibration there
 fore passes through the fluid of the cochlea and strikes the lamina spiralis,
 which intensifies and transmits the vibration to the system of rods. There
 is doubtless a rod not only for each tone or semitone, but even for much
 more minute subdivisions of the same          ; so that every sound causes its own
  particular rod to vibrate, and this rod vibrating, causes         the nerve-cells in
 connexion with it to send a nerve-current to the brain.
     In conclusion,   I  feel  it my duty to mention that I am greatly indebted
 to Professor Rutherford, of King's College, for suggesting the investigations
  which   led to these results, as also for much valuable advice while pro
  secuting them in his laboratory at King's College.

   The heaviest package (4) packed in field order will be, — instrument
 235 lbs. + case (f) 157 lbs. : total 392 lbs. This is less by about 100 lbs.,
according to my recollection, than the heaviest package of Troughton's
 Great Theodolite, long in use with the Indian Survey, and with which I
myself worked for five years in a country parts of which were extremely
rugged and mountainous.         Expense apart, the portability of an instrument
is of course defined by the weight of its heaviest portion.
   Nevertheless the instrument     is considerably heavier than I should wish.
There are three ways of diminishing this inconvenience : — first, by di
minished dimensions ; second, by mode of construction ; third, by choice
of materials.     I will say a few words on each.
   When the designing of this instrument was placed in my hands by Sir
Andrew Waugh, the late Surveyor-General of India, he left the question
to my decision whether the Horizontal Circle (which governs the whole)
should be 30 or 36 inches in diameter.        With my five years' experience of
the larger size, and with ample experience of smaller ones, I deliberately
preferred and adopted the larger, and am responsible for that decision.         1
believe myself to be in the minority on this question ; but can only say
that, if I had to use the instrument myself, I should still prefer the larger
size, attaching, as I do, great importance to the greater optical power and
the superior stability which are secured by it : for these I would myself
willingly sacrifice convenience to a great extent.
   By
        " mode of construction," I mean particularly the degree in which the
main parts are cast in single masses.      That principle, when the design was
commenced, had been notably illustrated by the present Astronomer Royal
and President of this Society; in the new instruments designed by him for
the Royal Observatory and now in use there.         Like many others, I was at
the time fascinated by it ; but I am now disposed to think that this prin
ciple has been carried too far in my own design under notice.         Discretion
is requisite in applying even an unquestionable principle.          And   I   now
   vol. xx.                                                       2 E

think that it     is not   judicious to apply the
                                             same method to a portable as to
a fixed instrument ;  to do so  introduces the difficulty of carriage, and this
must result in curtailing size, and with it power.      Casting in masses pro
fesses to diminish or eliminate the strains and tensions supposed to be in
cident to building up the structure with separate pieces. Whatever may
have beeu the case some years ago, I am disposed to believe that this
superiority is now much less marked than it used to be,     indeed,        if,
                                                                      exists                it
at all at present.  Self-acting shaping-tools have been brought to such
perfection, that the fitting of contiguous surfaces to each other can now be
made practically absolute, to the exclusion of those strains which imperfect
fitting must of course formerly             have introduced.      Nor must       it   be forgotten
that even casting in masses does not exclude irregular strains, and that the
more unequal in thickness the different parts of mass are, the more such
                                                                a
strains are to be apprehended.    Let any one cast even so symmetrical                               a
thing   as ring, say
             a       feet in diameter and
                           3               inches thick, divide
                                                      3            into two            it
halves, and afterwards attempt to fix these halves together     he will find      ;
them infallibly distorted.    Every one who has turned large irregularly
shaped masses of metal in very accurate lathe, knows that every cut of the
                                   a
tool alters the general form of the mass. In the instrument under discus
sion, the principle in question has,  now believe, been carried too far
                                              I                                                  ;   it
has greatly increased weight, whilst             I   doubt whether         it    has diminished
unequal tensions.
    As to choice of materials,   have already mentioned that the use of
                                       I
aluminium                tended
                 bronze has     materially to diminish weight.      am of              I
opinion, however, that steel can now be employed for such         purpose              a
almost exclusively, since at the present day    can be cast and worked as
                                                           it
readily as brass, though of course at rather greater expense, owing to its
hardness.    The various shaping-machines and drill-slotting machines
give  almost unlimited control over the forms that may be given to the
solid masses, while sheet-steel    now an article of ordinary commerce
                                            is
available for the tubular parts.   The nickelyzing process, now extensively
employed in America, and becoming every day better known and appre
ciated here, effectually preserves steel from oxidation.
    Practical surveyors        are alive to the question        of facility in dismantling,
packing,     and setting up so large an instrument              as this.   I     am able to give
some data on this head. After exhibiting the instrument to the Society at
Burlington House, Piccadilly,  had to be removed to my Observatory in
                                        it
Belvedere Road, Lambeth        was taken to pieces, packed, loaded on
                                   ;   it                                                            a
van, conveyed to its destination, and again set up in the Observatory
ready for adjustment and use in three hours.     should mention that the
                                                             I
passages     through       which   the various     parts    had to be carried from the
Meeting-room       to the cases in the outer        hall              dim,

that the distance from Burlington House, about      mile, was traversed at
                                                                 If
a foot's pace, in order that the men might be at hand in case of accidents,
and that ten ordinary labourers of the India Store Department, with                              my
assistant and myself, were employed in the operation.

 I.  " On   the Spectrum       of the Great Nebula in Orion, and on the

        William    Huggins,      LL.D.,    D.C.L.,   F.R.S.   Received   May 2,
        1872.
    In my early observations of the spectrum presented by the gaseous
 nebulae, the  spectroscope with which I determined the coincidence of two
 of the bright lines respectively with a line of nitrogen and a line of hy
 drogen was   of insufficient  dispersive  power to show whether    the brightest
    vol. xx.                                                        2 F

380                            Dr. W. Huggins on        the                 [June 13,
nebular line      was   double, as is the case with the corresponding            line of
nitrogen.                                . .
    Subsequently     I  took  some'  pains to determine this important point          by-
using a spectroscope       of greater dispersive power.       I found, however, that
the light furnished by the telescope of eight inches aperture, to which the
spectroscope was attached, was too feeble, even in the case of the brightest
nebulae, to give the line with sufficient distinctness when a narrow slit
¦was used.     The results of this later examination are given in a paper I had
the honour of presenting to the Royal Society in 1868.                I there say* : —
" I expected that I might discover a duplicity in the line in the nebula cor
responding to the two component lines of the line of nitrogen, but I was not
able, after long and careful scrutiny, to see the line double.          The line in the
nebula was narrower than the double line of nitrogen ; this latter line may
have appeared broader in consequence of irradiation, as it was much brighter
than the line in the nebula."            When the spark was placed before the
object-glass of the telescope, the light was so much weakened that one
line only was visible in the spectroscope.          " This line was the one which
agrees in position with the line in the nebula, so that under these circum
stances the spectrum of nitrogen appeared precisely similar to the spectra
of those nebulas of which the light is apparently monochromatic.                    This
resemblance was made more complete by the faintness of the line ; from
which cause it appeared narrower, and the separate existence of its two
components could no longer be detected. When the line was observed
 simultaneously with that in the nebula, it was found to appear but a very
little broader than that line." I also remark : — " The double line in the
 nitrogen-spectrum does not consist of sharply defined lines, but each com
 ponent is nebulous, and remains of a greater width than the image of the
 slit.   The breadth of these lines appears to be connected with the condi
 tions of tension and temperature of the gas.          Pluckerf states that when an
 induction-spark of great heating-power is employed, the lines expand so as
 to unite and form an undivided band.           Even when the duplicity exists, the
 eye ceases to have the power to distinguish the component lines, if the in
 tensity of the light be greatly diminished." I state further : —
                                                                            " incline
                                                                               I
 to the belief that    it [the line in the nebula] is not double."
     One of the first investigations which      I proposed to myself when, by the
 kindness of the Royal Society, I had at my command a much more powerful
 telescope, was the determination of the true character of the bright line in
 the spectra of the nebulas which is apparently coincident with that of
 nitrogen.      From various circumstances, chiefly connected with the altera
 tions and adjustments of new instruments,           I was not able      to accomplish
 this task satisfactorily until within the last few months.

 apparatus with which the observations in this paper were made.                  In the
 former paper, to which      I have already referred,     I  gave   some   reasons*  to
 show that the ordinary method of comparison, by reflecting light into the
spectroscope by means of a small prism placed before one half of the slit,
is not satisfactory for very delicate observations unless certain precau
tions are taken.     I then describe an arrangement for this purpose, which,
with one or two modifications, is adopted in the collimator constructed for
use with the Royal Society's telescope.          I  give the description    from that
paperf : —
    " The following     arrangement for admitting the light from the spark
appeared to me to be free from the objections which have been referred to,
and to be in all respects adapted to meet the requirements of the case.
 In place of the small prism, two pieces of silvered glass were securely fixed
before the slit at an angle of 45°.       In a direction at right angles to that of
the slit, an opening of about -^ inch was left between the pieces of glass
for the   passage   of the pencils from the object-glass.           By means of this
arrangement the spectrum of a star is seen accompanied by two spectra of
comparison, one appearing above and the other below it.                As the reflect
ing surfaces are about 0-5 inch from the slit, and the rays from the spark
are divergent, the light reflected from the pieces of glass will have en
croached upon the pencils from the object-glass by the time they reach the
slit, and the upper and lower spectra of comparison will appear to overlap
 to a small extent the spectrum formed by the light from the object-glass.
This condition of things is of great         assistance   to the eye    in forming a
judgment as to the absolute coincidence or otherwise of lines. For the
 purpose of avoiding some inconveniences which would arise from glass of the
 ordinary thickness, pieces of the thin glass used for the covers of micro
 scopic objects were carefully selected, and these were silvered by floating
                                                      "
them upon the surface of a silvering solution.          In order to ensure that the
 induction-spark   should always preserve the same position relatively to the
 mirror,  a piece of sheet gutta percha    was fixed above the silvered glass ; in
 the plate of gutta percha, at the proper place, a small hole was made of
 about -jL inch in diameter. The ebonite clamp containing the electrodes is so
 fixed as to permit the point of separation of these to be adjusted exactly
 over the small hole in the gutta percha.         The adjustment of the parts of
 the apparatus was made by closing the end of the adapting-tube, by which
 the apparatus is attached to the telescope, with a diaphragm with a small
central hole, before which a spirit-lamp was placed.           When the lines from
the induction-spark, in the two spectra of comparison, were seen to overlap
exactly, for a short distance, the lines of sodium from the light of the
lamp, the adjustment was considered perfect. The accuracy of adjustment
has been confirmed by the exact coincidence of the three lines of mag
nesium with the component lines of b in the spectrum of the moon."

382                           Dr. W. Huggins on the                           [June 13,
plate polished on both surfaces for the pieces of silvered glass. The oppo
site side of the silver plate to that from which the terrestrial light is re
flected to the slit reflects the images formed by the object-glass to the side
of the tube where      a suitable eyepiece   is fixed.    This arrangement forms a
very convenient finder, for it is easy to cause        the image of the star to dis
appear in the hole in the silver plate.        When this is the case, the line of
light formed by the star falls on the slit, and its spectrum is visible in the
spectroscope. This collimator is so constructed that, by means of a coupling-
screw, any one of three spectroscopes can be conveniently attached to it.
    This apparatus performs admirably ; but it seemed to me desirable, for
observations of great delicacy, to be able to dispense with reflection, and to
place the source of the light for comparison directly before the slit.              For
merly     I  accomplished    this   object by placing    the  spark    or  vacuum-tube
before the object-glass of the telescope. The great length of the present
telescope renders this method inconvenient ; but a more important ob
jection arises from the great diminution of the light when the spark is
 removed to a distance of     15  feet from the slit.   I  therefore resolved to place
the spark or vacuum-tube within the              telescope at a moderate distance
from the slit. For this purpose holes were drilled in the tube opposite to
each other, at a distance of 2 feet 6 inches within the principal focus.
Before these holes short tubes were fixed with screws ; in these tubes slide
suitable holders     for carrying electrodes or vacuum-tubes.              The spark is
 thus brought at once nearly into the axis of the telescope.               The final ad
justment    is  made  in the  following   manner   : — A  bright  star  is  brought into
 the centre of the field of an ordinary eyepiece ; the eyepiece is then
 pushed within the focus, when the wires or vacuum-tube can be seen across
 the circle of light formed by the star out of focus.         The place of discharge
 between the electrodes, or the middle of the capillary part of the vacuum-
 tube, is then brought into the centre of the circle of light. The vacuum-
 tubes are covered with black paper, with the exception of a space about a
 ^ inch long
               in the middle of the capillary part ; through this small uncovered
 space the light passes to reach the slit.
    The accuracy of both methods of comparison, that by reflection and
 that by the spark within the tube, was tested by the comparison of the
 three bright lines of magnesium and the double line of sodium with the
 Fraunhofer lines b and D in the spectrum of the moon. I greatly prefer
 the latter method, because it is free from several delicate adjustments
 which are necessary when the light is reflected and which are liable to be
 accidentally displaced.
    Spectroscope A is furnished with a single prism of dense glass with a
 refracting angle of 59° 42', giving 5° 0' from A to H.
    Spectroscope B has two compound prisms of Mr. Grubb's construction,
 which move automatically to positions of minimum deviation for the dif
ferent parts of the spectrum.          Each prism gives about 9° C for minimum
deviation from     A  to II.

    First line. — With         spectroscope B and eyepiece 1 and 2, the slit being
 made very narrow,          this line was seen to be very narrow, of a width cor
responding     to the slit, and defined at both edges, and undoubtedly not
double.      The line of nitrogen when compared with it appeared double,
aud each component nebulous and broader than the line of the nebula.
This latter line was seen on several nights to be apparently coincident with
the middle of the less refrangible line of the double line of nitrogen.
This observation was on one night confirmed by observation with the more
powerful spectroscope           U.
    The   question    suggests      itself whether, under any conditions of pressure
and temperature,        the double line of the nitrogen•spectrum           becomes single;
and    further,   if   this should be found to           be  the case, whether       the line
becomes single by the fading out of its more refrangible component, or in
what other way the single line of the nebula comes to occupy the position
in the spectrum, not of the middle of the double line of nitrogen, but that
 of the less refangible        of the lines.
    I stated in my former paper that when for any reason the light from the
luminous nitrogen          is greatly reduced       in intensity, the double line under
consideration     is the last to disappear, and consequently a state of things
may be found in which the light of nitrogen is sensibly monochromatic
when examined with a narrow slitf.                  Under these circumstances the line
of nitrogen appears narrower, and the separate components can be detected
with difficulty, if at all.
    I stated also that the breadth of the component lines appears to be con
nected with the conditions of density and temperature of the gas.                     As was
to be expected      from theoretical       considerations,   the   lines  become narrower
and less nebulous        as the pressure      is diminished.     My    observations   of this
change    seemed to show that the diminution of the breadth                    of the lines
takes place chiefly       at the outer sides of the lines ; so that in the light from
very   rarefied  gas    the    double line is narrower, but the space of separation

between the components is not as much wider as would be the case if the
lines had decreased equally in width on the sides towards each other.
    When the pressure of the gas is reduced to about 15 inches of mercury,
the line-spectrum fades out to give place to Pliicker's spectrum of the
first order.    During this process     a state of things occurs when, for reasons
already stated, the spectrum becomes sensibly monochromatic when viewed
 with a narrow slit and a spectroscope of several prisms.              The line is
 narrower but remains double, and has the characters described in the
 preceding paragraph.
     As the pressure is diminished, the double line fades out entirely, and the
 spectrum of the second order gives place to the spectrum of the first order.
 When, however, the pressure becomes exceedingly small, from 0*1 inch to
 0-05 inch,    or less, of mercury,     there is a condition of the discharge     in
 which the line again appears, while the other lines remain very faint.
 Under these conditions I have always been able, though with some diffi
 culty, on account of the faint light when the necessary dispersive power
 (spectroscope B with second or third eyepiece) and a narrow slit are
 used, to see the line to be double, but it is narrower than when the gas is
 more dense, and may be easily mistaken for a single line.          I have not yet
 been able to find a condition of luminous nitrogen in which the line has
 the same characters as those presented by the line in the nebula, where it
 is single and of the width of the slit.
     Upon the whole     I am still inclined    to regard the line in the nebula as
 probably due to nitrogen.
     If this should be found       to be the case, and that the nebular line has
  originally the refrangibility of the middle of the double line of nitrogen,
 then we should     have evidence that the nebula is moving from the earth.
  The amount of displacement of the nebular line from the middle of the
  double line of nitrogen corresponds to a velocity of 55 miles per second from
  the earth.    At the time of observation the part of the earth's orbital
  motion, which was from the nebula, was 14'9 miles per second.               From
  the remaining 40 miles per second would have to be deducted the probable
  motion from the nebula due to the motion of the solar system in space.
  This estimation of the possible motion of the nebula can be regarded as only
  approximate.
     If the want of accordance of the line in the nebula with the middle      of the
  double line of nitrogen be due to a recession of the nebula in the line of
  sight, there should be a corresponding displacement of the third line as
  compared with that of hydrogen.           For reasons which will be found in a
  subsequent paragraph,     I   have  not been able to make this comparison with
  the necessary accuracy.
     In my former paper*      I  gave reasons against supposing so large a motion
  in the nebula   ;  these  were based on the circumstance that the nebular
  line falls upon the double nitrogen line, which the present observations

single and not coincident with the middle of the

Three sets of measures give for this line a

would show that the line agrees nearly in posi
tion with a strong line of iron.              At present    I
am not able to suggest to what substance this
line belongs.

     These lines are very narrow and are defined ;

         § 2. On the Motions          of some Stars towards or from the Earth.
     In the early part of 1868           I had the honour      of presenting to the Royal
 Society some observations on a small change of refrangibility which I had
 observed in a line in the spectrum of Sirius as compared with a line of
hydrogen, from which it appeared that the star was moving from the earth
with     a velocity of about twenty-five miles per second,                 if  the probable
 advance of the sun in space be taken into account *.
     It  is only within the last few months that            I  have found myself in pos
 session     of the necessary instrumental means to resume this inquiry, and
 since this time the prevalence of bad weather has left but few nights suffi
ciently fine for these delicate observations.
     Some time was occupied in obtaining a perfectly trustworthy method of
 comparison of the spectra of stars with those of terrestrial substances, and
 it was not      until  I   had arranged the spark within the tube, as described at
 the beginning         of this note, that      I felt confidence in the results of my
observations.
     It  may be well to state some circumstances                connected with these com-

 observation have been partially anticipated, a reference may be made to an ingenious
 paper in the Philosophical Transactions for 1783, vol. lxxiv., by the Bev. John Michel!,
 entitled " On tho means of discovering the Distance, Magnitude, &c. of the Fixed
Slnrs, in consequence of the Diminution of the Velocity of their Light." The author
suggests     that by the use of a prism " we might be able to discover diminutions in the
velocity of light    as perhaps a hundredth, a two hundredth, a five hundredth, or even a
thousandth part of the whole."         But he then goes on to reason on the production of this
diminished velocity by the attraction produced on the material particles of light by the
matter of the stars, and that the diminutions stated above would be "occasioned by
spheres whose diameter shoidd be to the sun, provided they were of the same density,
in tho several proportions of 70, 50, 30, and 22 to     1 respectively."

parisons which necessarily make the numerical estimations given further on
less accurate than I could wish.   Even when spectroscope C, containing
four compound prisms, and a magnify ing-power of 16 diameters are used,
the amount of the change of refrangibility to be observed appears very
small.   The probable error of these estimations is therefore large, as a shift
corresponding to five miles per second (about ^ of the distance of Dl to
D2), or even a somewhat greater velocity, could not he certainly observed.
The difficulty arising from the apparent smallness of the change of refran
gibility is greatly increased by some other circumstances.  The star's light
is faint when a narrow slit is used, and the lines, except on very fine nights,
cannot be steadily seen, in consequence of the movements in our atmosphere.
Further, when the slit is narrow, the clock's motion is not uniform enough
to keep the spectrum steadily in view ; for these reasons I found it neces
sary to adopt the method of estimation by comparing the shift with a wire
of known thickness, or with the interval between a pair of close lines.                     I
found that, under the circumstances, the use of a micrometer would have
given the appearance only of greater accuracy.    wish          I        it,

    The difference of this estimate, which         is   probably below rather than in

388                             Dr. W. Huggins          on the   Motions of             [June 13,
  Betelgeux (a Ononis). — In the early observations of Dr. Miller and
myself on this star, we found that there are no strong lines coincident with
the hydrogen lines at C and F. The line H o falls on the less refrangible
side of a small group of strong lines, and H ft occurs in the space between,
two groups of strong lines where the lines are faint.  On one night of un
usual steadinessof the air, when the finer lines in the star's spectrum were
seen with more than ordinary distinctness, I was able with the more
powerful instruments now at my command to see a narrow defined line in
the red apparently coincident with H a, and a similar line at the position of
H  ft. These lines are much less intense than the lines    and   in the solarC      F
spectrum       ;    there are certainly no bright lines          in   the star's spectrum at these
places.
   The most suitable lines in this star for comparison with terrestrial sub
stances for ascertaining the star's motion are the lines of sodium and of
magnesium.     The double character of the one line agreeing exactly with
that of sodium, and the further circumstance that the more refrangible of
the lines   the stronger one, as
               is                  the case in spectrum of sodium and in the
                                               is
solar spectrum, and the relative distances from each other and comparative
brightness of the three lines, which correspond precisely to the triple group
of magnesium, can allow of no doubt that these lines in the star are really
produced by the vapours of these substances existing there, and that we may
therefore safely take any small displacement of either set of lines to show                        a
motion of the star towards or from the earth.                        The lines   due to sodium are
perhaps more intense, but are as narrow and defined as the lines Dlt Da
in the solar spectrum  they fall, however, within
                                     :              group of very fine lines

been assigned to them by some observers.

showing that the stellar lines had been degraded by the star's motion                        from
the earth.    The amount of displacement was estimated at about one                             fifth
of the distance of    from Da, whichD;   probably rather smaller than the

in consequence of other lines in the star at this place, the former estimation
based on the displacement                    of the lines of sodium,        was considered to be
more satisfactory.

hydrogen falls above the middle of the line in the star ; the star is there
fore receding from the earth.  The velocity of recession may be estimated
as rather smaller than Sirius, probably about 30 miles per second, the
earth at the time of observation moving from the star with a velocity of
15 miles, leaving about 15 miles as due to the star. This estimate is pro

                 spectra of the two component stars of this double star
blend in the spectroscope into one spectrum. The line H /3 is rather broad,
nearly as much so as the same line in the spectrum of Sirius.
   The narrow line of rarefied hydrogen was compared in spectroscope B
with eyepiece 3 ; it appeared to fall on the more refrangible side of the
middle of the Hue in the star, leaving more of the dark line on the side
towards the red.   The shift seemed to be rather greater than that in
Sirius, and may probably be taken at from 40 to 45 miles per second ; but
the earth's orbital motion was nearly 1 7 miles from the star, thu sleaving
about 25 miles for the apparent velocity of the star.  This result rests at
present on observations on one night only, but they seemed at the time to
be satisfactory.

hydrogen falls on the more refrangible side of the middle of the dark line
in the star. The air was unfavourable on all the evenings of comparison ;
a rough estimate gives a velocity of from 30 to 35 per second. The earth's

   on account of the unfavourable state of the weather at the time) appear to
  show that the stars Procyon, Capella, and possibly Aldebaran, are moving
  from the earth.
     The stars which follow have a motion of approach.
     Arcturus. — In the spectrum of this star the lines of hydrogen, of mag
  nesium, and of sodium are sufficiently distinct for comparison.                I found
  the comparison could be most satisfactorily made with magnesium.
     The bright lines of magnesium fall on the less refrangible side of the
  corresponding dark lines in the star's spectrum, showing that the star is
  approaching the earth.        I estimated the shift at about ^ to'-J- of the interval
  between     Mg2 and Mg3     ;   this amount of displacement would indicate a
  velocity of approach of 50 miles per second.                To this velocity must be
  added the earth's orbital motion from the star of 5'25 miles per second, in
  creasing the star's motion to 55 miles per second.
     When I     can get favourable weather,       I  hope to obtain independent esti
  mations from the lines of sodium and of hydrogen.
     a Lyrce. — In the spectrum of Vega the line corresponding                to  II (i is
  strong and broad.       Comparisons were made on several nights, but on one
  evening only was the air favourable.              The observations are accordant iu
  showing that the narrow bright line from a Geissler's tube falls on the less
  refrangible side of the middle of the line in the star, thus leaving more of
  the liue on the side towards the violet.             The estimations give a motion
 of approach between the earth and the star of from 40 to 50 miles per
  second,    to which   must be added 3"9 miles for the earth's motion from
  the star.
     a Cygni.   — The hydrogen      line at F in the spectrum of this star is narrower
  than    in the spectrum of Sirius and of a Lyroe, though probably rather
  broader than the same line in the solar spectrum.               I have at present ob
 servations made on two evenings only, on both of which the state of the air
  was unfavourable      for the comparison of this line with that of terrestrial
  hydrogen.       They give to the star a motion of approach of about 30 miles
  per second, which would have to be increased by 9 miles, the velocity at the
 time of the earth from the star.
     Pollux. — The lines of magnesium and those of sodium are very distinct
 in the spectrum of this star.          As the air -was not very steady at the time
 of my observations, I found it more satisfactory to use for comparison the
 lines of magnesium, which are rather stronger than those of sodium.                 The
 three lines of magnesium appeared to be less refrangible than the cor
 responding dark lines in the spectrum of the star by about one sixth of the
 interval from Mg2 to Mg3.            This estimation would represent a velocity of
 approach equal to about 32 miles per second.                The earth's motion from
 the star   was   17-5 miles,  which    increases    the apparent velocity of approach
 to   -49  miles per second.        On one evening only was the air favourable
 enough for a numerical estimate, but the observations were entered in my
jbser:rvatory-book     as satisfactory.

spectra of the other bright stars of this constellation. The line at F is not
so strong, while the lines at b are more distinct, and are sufficiently strong
for comparison with the bright lines of magnesium.        The bright lines of
this metal fall on the less refrangible side of the dark lines, and show a
motion of approach of from 35 to 50 miles per second.            The earth's
motion of 1 1-8 miles from the star must be added.
   y Leonis and e Bootis. — In both these double stars the compound
spectrum due to the light of both component stars was observed.           Both
stars are most conveniently         compared        with magnesium.    I do not consider
my observations        of   these stars as quite satisfactory,   but they seem to show
a movement    of approach ; but further observations are desirable.
   The stars y Cygni, a Peyasi, y Pegasi, and a Andromedce were com

   The velocities of approach and of recession which have been assigned to
the stars in this paper represent the whole of the motion in the line of sight
which esists between them and the sun.       As we know that the sun                        is
moving    in
           space,  certain
                       a   part of these observed velocities must be due to
the solar motion.    have not attempted to make this correction, because,
                        I

are situated in a part of the heavens opposite to Hercules, towards which the
sun is advancing, while the stars in the neighbourhood of this region, as
Arcturus, Vega, a Cygni, show a motion of approach.          There are in the
stars already observed exceptions to this general statement ; and there are
some other considerations which   appear to show that the sun's motion in
space is  not the only or even, in all cases, aa it may be found, the chief
cause of the observed proper motions of the stars*.
       There can be little doubt but that in the observed stellar movements we
have to do with two other independent motions — namely, a movement
common to certain groups of stars, and also a motion peculiar to each
star.
   Mr. Proctor has brought to light strong evidence in favour of the drift of
stars in groups having a community of motion by his graphical investi
gation of the proper motions of all the stars in the catalogues of Mr.
Main and Mr. Stonet.        The probability of the stars being collected into
systems was early suggested by Michell and the elder RerschelJ.        One of

in direction in accordance with the sun's motion towards Hercules do not bear to each
other the relation which they should have if they were mainly produced by the sun's
motion. Even for these stars, therefore, we must look elsowhere for the cause to which.

y, S, s, C have also a common motion of recession, while the star a is ap
proaching the earth. The star tj, indeed, appears to be moving from us, but
it is  too far from a to be regarded as a companion to that star.
    Although it was not to be expected that a concurrence would always be
found between the proper motions which indicate the apparent motions at
right angles to the line of sight and the radial motions as discovered by the
spectroscope, still it is interesting to remark that in the case of the stars
Castor and Pollux, one of which is approaching and the other receding,
their proper motions also are different in direction and in amount ; and
 further, that y Leonis, which             has  an opposite radial motion to a and ft      of
the same           constellation,   differs from   these   stars in the direction      of its
proper motion.
    It scarcely needs remark that the difference in breadth of the line 0 in          II

 by which the lines of absorption are produced.                   A discussion of the ob

                                   Received May 7, 1872.
    I propose in this memoir to deduce, by fair reasoning from acknowledged
facts, a more definite notion than now exists of the meaning of the word
" kinship." It is my aim to analyze and describe the complicated con
nexion that binds an individual, hereditarily, to his parents and to hia
brothers and sisters, and, therefore, by an extension of similar links, to his
more distant kinsfolk.            I hope by these means to set forth the doctrines
of heredity       in  a  more orderly and explicit manner than is otherwise prac
ticable.
    From the well-known            circumstance      that an individual may transmit to
his descendants ancestral qualities which he does not himself possess, we
are assured that they could not have been altogether destroyed in him, but
must have maintained             their existence in a latent form.           Therefore    each
individual       may properly be conceived as consisting of two parts, one of
which     is  latent    and only known to us by its effects on his posterity, while
the other is patent, and constitutes the person manifest to our senses.
    The adjacent and, in a broad sense, separate lines of growth in which
the patent and latent elements are situated, diverge from a common group
and converge to a common contribution, because they were both evolved
out of elements contained in a structureless ovum, and they, jointly, con
tribute the elements which form the structureless ova of their offspring.
   The annexed diagram illustrates my meaning, and serves to show clearly
that the span of each of the links in the general chain of heredity extends
from one structureless stage to another, and not from person to person : —

    I  will now    proceed   to consider the quality  of the several relationships
by which the above terras are connected together.
    The observed facts of Reversion enable us to prove that the latent ele
 ments must be greatly more varied than those that are personal or patent.
 The arguments are as follows: — (1) there must be room for very great
 variety, because a single strain of impure blood will reassert itself after more
 than eight generations ; (2) an individual has 256 progenitors in the eighth
 degree, if there have been no ancestral intermarriages, while under the
ordinary conditions of social and neighbourly life he will certainly have
 had a considerable, though a smaller number of them ; (3) the gradual
waning of the tendency to reversion as the generations increase conforms
to what would occur if each fresh marriage contributed a competing ele
ment for the same place, thus diluting the impure strain until its relative
importance was reduced to an insignificant amount.            It follows from these
arguments that for each place among the personal elements there may
exist, and probably often does exist, a great variety of latent elements that
formerly competed to fill it.
    I have spoken     of the primary    elements as they exist in the newly im
pregnated ovum, where they are structureless but contain the materials out
of which structure is evolved ; the embryonic elements are segregated
from     among them.        On what principle are they segregated 1 Since for
each    place  there   have   been many unsuccessful but qualified competitors,
it must have been on some principle whose effects may be described as
those of    " Class Representation," using that phrase in a perfectly general
sense as indicating a mere fact, and avoiding any hypothesis or affirmation
on points of detail, about most, if not all, of which we are profoundly
ignorant.      I  give as broad a meaning to the expression as a politician
would give to the kindred one, a "representative assembly."              By this he
means to say that the assembly consists of representatives from various
constituencies, which is a distinct piece of information so far as it goes, and
is a useful one, although it deals with no matter of detail ; it says nothing
about the number of electors, their qualifications, or the motives by which
they are influenced ; it gives no information as to the number of seats ;
it does not tell us how many candidates there are usually             for each seat,
nor whether the same           person is eligible for, or may represent at the
same     time, more than one place, nor whether the result of the elections
at one place may or may not influence those at another (on the principle of
correlation).      After  these explanations there can,   I trust, be no difficulty in
accepting my definition of the general character of the relation between
the embryonic and the structureless elements, that the former are the
result of election from the latter on some method of Class Representation.
   The embryonic elements are developed into the adult person. " Deve
            " is a word whose meaning is quite as distinct in respect to form,
lopment
and as vague in respect to detail, as the phrase we have just been con-

sidering  ;   it  embraces   the combined effects of growth and multiplication,
as well   as    those of modification in quality and proportion, under both
internal and external influences.         If we were able    to obtain an approximate
knowledge of the original elements,          statistical experiences would no doubt
enable us to predict the average value of the form into which they would
become developed, just as a knowledge of the seeds that were Bown would
enable us to predict in a general way the appearance of the garden when
the plants had grown up ; but the individual variation of each case would
of course be great, owing to the large number of variable influences concerned
in the process of development.
   The latent elements in the embryonic               stage must be developed by a
parallel,   I  do not say by an identical process,       into those of the adult stage.
Therefore, to avoid all chance of being misapprehended when I collate
them, I will call, in the diagram         I am about to give (see fig. 1, p. 398),
the one process      "                    " and the other " Development b."
                       Development a
   It is not intended to affirm, in making these subdivisions, that the em
bryonic and adult stages are distinctly separated ; they are continuous, and
it is impossible but that they should overlap, some elements remaining
embryonic       while others are completely formed.             Nevertheless the two,
spunking broadly, may fairly be looked upon as consecutive.
   Again, the two processes are not wholly distinct ; on the contrary, the
embryo, and even the adult in some degree, must receive supplementary
contributions derived from their contemporary latent elements, because
ancestral qualities indicated in early life frequently disappear and yield
place to others.        The reverse process is doubtful ; it may exist in the
embryonic stage, but it certainly does not exist in a sensible degree in
the adult stage, else the later children of a union would resemble their
parents more nearly than the earlier ones.
   Lastly,    I  must guard myself against the objection that though structure
is largely correlated,     I have treated it too much as consisting of separate
elements.       To this  I  answer, first, that in describing how the embryonic
are derived from the structureless          elements,     I expressly left room for a
small degree of correlation ; secondly, that in the development of the adult
elements from the embryonic there is a perfectly open field for natural selec
tion, which is the agency by which correlation is mainly established ; and,
thirdly, that correlation affects groups of elements rather than the complete
person, as is proved by the frequent occurrence of small groups of per
sistent peculiarities, which do not affect the rest of the organism, so far as
we know, in any way whatever.
   The ground we have already gained may be described as follows : —
   Out of the structureless ovum the embryonic elements are taken by
Class Representation, and these are developed (a) into the visible adult
individual    ; on the other hand, returning to our starting-point              at the
structureless ovum, we find, after the embryonic elements have been segre

gated, the large Residue is developed (5) into the latent elements contained
in the adult individual.  All this is summarily expressed in the first two
columns of the diagram (fig. 1).             I
                                      might have inserted vertical arrows to
show the minor connexions between the corresponding stages in the two
parallel processes, but it would have complicated the figure.
   In  what way do the patent and latent adult elements respectively con
tribute representatives towards the structureless stage of the next genera
tion ? We know that every quality they possess may be transmitted to                               it,
but     does not follow that they are invariably transmitted.
        it                                                     The contri
butions from the patent elements cannot be by " Class," because their own
original elements have been themselves specialized, and therefore can
contain no more than one or      few members of each class (which,
                                         a                             true,            it

must     have     somewhat developed, both in numbers and variety, into
                   been
what we may call " families "). Their contributions may therefore be justly
described as being effected on some principle that has resulted in " Family       a
representation," though whether in the representation of every family                        I     do
not profess to say.
   As regards the large variety of adult latent elements, they cannot all be
transmitted, for the following obvious reason — the corresponding qualities
of no two parents can          be considered exactly alike        ;   therefore the accumu
lation of subvarieties,    they were all preserved as the generations rolled
                               if
onwards, would exceed    in multitude the wildest flights of rational theory.
The heritage of peculiarities through the contributions of 1000 consecutive
generations, even supposing     great deal of ancestral intermarriage, must
                                         a
far exceed what could be packed into      single ovum.
                                                   a       The contributions
from the latent adult elements  arc therefore no more than Representative                          ;
but they have to furnish all the various members of each Class whence its
representatives haveafterwards to be drawn. Therefore, bearing in mind what
has been just argued, that           is
                                    it impossible for the elements of every individual
quality to be contributed,           we are driven to suppose, as in the previous
case,   a    "Family      representation," the similar elements contributed        the       by
two parents ranking, of course, as of the same family.      It most impor    is
tant to bear in mind that this phrase states   fact andanot an hypothesis                     ;    it
does not mean that each and every Family has just one representative,

   Lastly, it  is often remarked      (1) that the immediate offspring of differ
ent races or even varieties resemble their parents equally, but (2) that
great diversities appear in the next and in succeeding generations.                 In
which stage does the variability occur ? It cannot be in the first (class
representation) nor in the second (development), else (1) could not have
been true ; therefore it must be in the third stage.           A white parent neces
sarily  contributes   white  elements    to the  structureless stage of his offspring,
and a black, black     ;  but it does not in the least follow that the contributions
from a true mulatto must be truly mulatto.
    One result of this investigation is to show very clearly that large varia
tion in individuals from their parents is not incompatible with the strict
doctrine of heredity, but is a consequence of it wherever the breed is im
pure.     I am desirous of applying these considerations to the intellectual
aud moral gifts of the human race, which is more mongrelized than that
of any other domesticated animal.              It has been thought by some that
the fact of children frequently showing marked individual variation in
ability from that of their parents is a proof that intellectual and moral
gifts are not strictly transmitted by inheritance.             My arguments lead to
exactly the opposite result.        I show that their great individual variation
is a necessity under present conditions          ; and  I maintain that results de
rived from large averages are all that can be required, and all we could
expect to obtain, to prove that intellectual and moral gifts are as strictly
matters of inheritance as any purely physical qualities.
III.   "Further Experiments            on the Effect of Alcohol and Exercise on
       the Elimination       of  Nitrogen and on the Pulse and Temperature
       of the Body."          By E. A. Parkes, M.D., F.R.S.                  Received
       April 25, 1872.
    In the ' Proceedings of the Royal Society ' (xviii. p. 362, xix. p. 73) are
 some observations by the late Count "Wollowicz and myself on the effect             of
 alcohol, brandy, and claret on the elimination of nitrogen.             As the expe
riments were on one man,            I   have taken an opportunity        of repeating
 them on another        person j and as      the late observations of Dr. Austin
 Flint (junior)    on    a man who walked 317 miles in five days have ap
 peared to some persons to run counter to the now generally accepted view
 that exercise produces either no change or only insignificant changes in
 the urea,  I  have combined      experiments on exercise with those on alcohol.
With respect, however,        to Dr. Austin Flint's experiments, it would appear
 that while the egress of nitrogen was determined with the greatest ac
curacy, the amount taken in was for the most part merely estimated by
 reference to Payen's Tables, and therefore there is no certainty that the
iugress was what it is assumed to have been.                The food also was very

varied, so that the difficulty   of properly estimating the nitrogen     was  still
more increased.
   The following experiments were made on a soldier, W. D., aged 30.
He is a powerfully built man, 5 feet 6 inches in height, and measuring 40
inches round the chest.       As a young man, he had been employed in a
distillery near Glasgow, and at that time drank largely of whisky, some
times taking half a pint before breakfast.       For the last ten years, since he
has been in the army, he has been very temperate, taking chiefly beer in
moderate quantities, and only occasionally spirits.       He bears the character
of a very steady soldier, and has always had perfect health, with the excep
tion of an attack of " spotted typhus
                                          " six
                                                years ago. He has never served
abroad.
    As he  is a Scotchman and had been      brought up on oatmeal and milk, I
placed him on a diet entirely composed of these two substances ; and after
a preliminary trial to see how much he required, he received every day 28
ounces of Scotch oatmeal and two pints of milk, the whole of which he
took at regular hours.      The oatmeal was all purchased at the same time
and was well mixed, so that he received daily precisely the same amount of
nitrogen.     It would be impossible to keep the ingress of nitrogen more
uniform than was done in this case.        The milk was very good in quality ;
but to   ensure, as far as possible,  that it should be of equal nutritive value
every day, water was added until its specific gravity, which was usually
 1-032, was reduced to 1-028.        He drank only water except on the days
when brandy was added, and, with the exception of salt, took no other
solid food for sixteen days except the oatmeal and milk.        The daily amount
of water (including that in the milk) was 135 fluid ounces ; but some was
lost in cooking the oatmeal.      He was perfectly well and vigorous on this
food, and his weight remained unchanged.
    The oatmeal, burnt with soda-lime, was found to contain 2-023 percent,
of nitrogen ; and the milk contained from *35 to -37 per cent, of nitrogen,
and is taken at a mean of '36.       In the milk and the oatmeal together he
received daily 20 grammes, or 308-6 grains, of nitrogen.         The brandy con
tained 45 volumes per cent, of alcohol.
    The course of experiment    was as follows   : —
    For six days he remained quiet, taking only slow walking exercise to
keep him in health ; for three days he then worked hard at digging
ground from eight to nine hours daily.           It was intended that he should
march thirty miles daily in heavy marching order ; but after marching
for eight miles he became footsore, and I was obliged to change his work
to digging.     He worked as hard as he could and felt fatigued in all his
muscles, but it was impossible to calculate the exact amount of work : as
 far as could be done, he made it as uniform as he could from day to day.
    After three days' exercise he was kept at rest for three days, and then
resumed exercise of the same kind for three days, taking, however, during

 the second period 12 fluid ounces of brandy (containing 5'4 fluid ounces of
 absolute alcohol) daily in three doses of 4 ounces each at 10, 2, and G
 o'clock.
    After this he rested again, but being required for other duty there                were
 only two days' observations during this last period.

   The weight      was very uniform during almost the whole time ; but it is
plain  he  lost  a little weight during the first exercise-period, and continued
afterwards to lose it.        The change was, however, inconsiderable, as there
was a loss   of only     2 lbs.  in weight during the whole period.

   During the sixteen days 19-59 grammes of nitrogen were discharged by
the urine and bowels every day.    The daily entrance of nitrogen during
the same period was 20 grms., viz. 16 grms. in the oatmeal and 4 grms. in
the milk.
  To estimate the  effect of exercise and alcohol on the elimination of nitro

  both the exercise periods a slight excess over the first period, amounting
 to  1 and "5 grm. respectively.         The differences are so slight that they
 might be disregarded, only the recurrence in the two exercise periods seems
 to show that the slight excess is not accidental.
     The observations support the facts noted in the papers already communi
 cated to the Royal Society, viz. that there is a slight excess of nitrogen in
 a mixed exercise and rest period over a period of entire rest, owing, it
 would appear from the former experiments in the rest period, to a slight
 increase in elimination after exercise.
     The brandy had no effect on the elimination of nitrogen, for the mean
 of the two periods of exercise only differs by 0"5 grm., and the results are
 practically identical.      And as a further proof that the brandy had no effect
 in either direction, it may be noticed that both the highest and lowest daily
 excretion occurred in the brandy period.
     With regard to the alvine nitrogen, the elimination was increased during
 the exercise periods, the mean of the whole sixteen days being 3*976 grms. ;
 it was 4*981 grms. and 4'372 grms. in the two exercise periods.                       This
 depended on the effect of the particular kind of exercise (digging) on the
 action of the abdominal muscles and on the bowels, as will be seen from
 the next Table,      if the following point is taken into account.                 In the
 first period there was a loose alvine discharge during four or five days,
 arising apparently from the use of the oatmeal in a man who had lately
 been accustomed to other         food.   Under the microscope the envelopes of
the oat and of barley or wheat which had been mixed with jt were seen in
quantities in the feces ; therefore in this period the large amount of solids
and the smaller amount of nitrogen were given by considerable portions of
 undigested oatmeal passing out ; in later periods the proper excreta                of the
 intestines were probably in larger amount.

    If  we adopt the two last rest periods, which are nearly alike, as the
standard of the usual alvine excreta under this diet, the muscular work
(digging),      by acting mechanically on the bowels, caused a greater discharge
both     of the  solid parts of the excreta and of water ; much of the difference
of the nitrogen,      and perhaps       the whole,    is thus accounted      for.
     It   was   very   remarkable       how uniform the excreta were in the per
centage of water when the means of the periods are taken, though from
day to day there was considerable variation.                    It will be seen how much
larger the excreta were than is usual in meat-eaters, and how much ni
trogen passed from the bowels.

     The phosphoric acid was not affected in the first exercise period ; it
 was slightly increased in the alcoholic, but the difference may be too slight
 to be material.       The chlorine was rather lessened in both exercise periods :
 the free acidity was slightly increased in the brandy period over the
 exercise period on water ; but the change was so slight as to be within
 the range of daily variation.             Exercise on water exerted no marked in

the mean daily pulse sank to 63-6, but rose in the exercise and brandy
period to 70'35.         The effect of the brandy was therefore to cause a daily
increase of 6552 pulsations of the heart over the exercise period with water,
and an excess of 11304 pulsations over the first rest period.                        The effect
of the brandy is seen at once in comparing the hours 2, 4, G, 8, and 10 p.m.

    At    12 o'clock the same fact would have been noted,                 but that on the first
 exercise    day the pulse was greatly augmented (to 92 per minute or 50 per
cent.) by marching eight miles in heavy marching order from 10 to
 12 o'clock.       There is hardly any form of exercise which augments the
 pulse like quick movements, especially when weights are carried.                         In the
 second period the corresponding exercise was digging, which increases the
 pulse much less.         Again, on the third day of the brandy period, he did no
 work     from    11 to 12   o'clock, as it was raining ; and consequently at 1 2
 o'clock on that day his pulse, which in the two previous days was 70 and
 72, was only 58.          These two facts explain the only exception in the Tables
 to the rule of the excess of heart-beats, under the influence of alcohol,                      at
 every hour.        The effect on the heart was also made evident in a way pre
 sently to be noticed.

   The   effect   of exercise and water on the axilla temperature was imper

mean daily temperature, as obtained by observations every two hour?, from
6 a.m. to 10 p.m., was 98° and 980-2, or practically the same.
   If  the hours 12, 2, 4, C, and 10, when the brandy was chiefly acting,
are compared in the two periods, it appears quite certain that 12 fluid
ounces (=341 cub. centims.) of brandy caused no diminution                 in tempera

   The thermometer         was   inserted    4 inches into the rectum,          and, unfor
tunately, gave rise to some irritation, viz. a feeling of pain and heaviness
and the discharge of a little blood.             We were obliged to discontinue the
observations for several days, and can therefore only compare the first five
days with the alcoholic period.
   The comparison shows that alcohol causes no depression of the rectal
temperature; there is even a slight elevation at 10 o'clock p.m., but as
the reverse is the case at      G  o'clock p.m., no weight can be given to it.             As

these results accordwith the former experiments, it cannot,        think, be       I
doubted that alcohol, in the amounts given in these trials, has no  influence
on the bodily temperature of healthy men.
                             6. The elimination        of Alcohol.
   As only qualitative experiments were made, it is not necessary to do more
than state that before the brandy was given nothing could be found passing
off by the skin, lungs, or kidneys which had the slightest reducing effect
on Masing's bichromate-of-potassium test ; while after the brandy a sub
stance which at once reduced the test was passing off by all these channels,
and especially    by the skin, but the amount was not determined.
                   7. The effect      of Brandy       on the work done.
  As     the amount    and kind of work done in the two exercise periods was
nearly    the same,    Irequested the man to observe as closely as he could
whether he did the work better with or without the brandy.       He com
menced the exercise and brandy period with a belief that the brandy would
enable him to perform the work more easily, but ended it with the opposite
conviction. As already stated, the brandy was taken in 4-ounce doses at
10 a.m., 2 p.m., and 6 p.m., in an equal quantity of water, and the work
was chiefly done in the two hours immediately succeeding each dose, and
from 6 to 8 a.m.
   The two hours' work from 10 a.m. to 12 noon, immediately after the
first four fluid ounces of brandy, was, he thought, done equally well with
and without the brandy.      The man affirmed that he could tell no differ
ence, except that, to use his own words, " the brandy seemed to give him
a kind of spirit which made him think he could do a great deal of work ;
but when he came to do          it,
                              he found he was less capable than he thought."
   After the second four ounces of brandy he felt hot and thirsty, but on
the two first days he thought he worked as well as on the water days      on               ;
the third day, however, he had palpitation of.the heart, and was surprised
to find he was obliged to stop from time to time, because, to use his own
words, " of his breathing not being so good."
   The third four fluid ounces of brandy at      p.m. produced on all three
                                                          6
days very marked       narcotic   effects.
                                     Immediately after taking he became           it
heavy, felt the greatest indisposition to exert himself,
                                                      and could hardly re
frain from throwing down his spade and giving up work. He worked with
no vigour, and on the second evening thought his muscular power decidedly
lessened.  On the third evening, as    was raining, he could not dig, but
                                             it
took walking and running exercise under cover.     On attempting to run,
he found, to his great surprise, as he   particularly fast and good runner,
                                              is   a
that he could not do so. He had palpitation and got out of breath, and was
obliged to stop   ;   so that he stated on the next day,          " that   if   he had had his
accoutrements     on and been ordered to          '
                                                      double,'   he could not have obeved
the order."

 1872.]                Alcohol and Exercise on the Body.                       413
    After coming in from work on each evening he fell into a heavy sleep,
from which he was roused with difficulty.           This lasted for three or four
hours, after which he was restless and sleepless.
    The man's own judgment was, at the end of the trial, that he would
prefer to do the work without the brandy ; and when asked for his reasons,
he mentioned " the increased thirst, the heaviness in the evening, and the
fluttering at the heart."
    His appetite was not affected.
                                     Conclusions.
    1. The elimination of nitrogen during exercise     was unaffected by brandy    ;
and since the experiments led to the same result in the former series during
comparative rest, it seems certain that in healthy men on uniform good
diet alcohol does not interfere with the disintegration of nitrogenous
tissues.
    2. The heat of the body,      as judged of by the axilla and rectum       tem
peratures, was unaffected by the amount given.
    3. The pulse was increased in frequency by 4 ounces of brandy, and
palpitation and breathlessness were brought on by larger doses, to such an
extent as to greatly lessen the amount of work the man could do, and to
render quick movements impossible.            As the effect of labour alone is to
augment the strength and frequency         of the heart's action, it would appear
obviously improper to act on the heart still more by alcohol.               In this
effect  on the heart, and through it on the lungs, is perhaps to be found
the explanation of the trainer's rule, which prohibits alcohol during
exertion.     Whether in a heart exhausted by exertion alcohol would be good
or bad is not shown by these experiments ; but it can hardly be supposed
that to urge a heart which        requires rest, as would   then be the case, can
be proper.
   4.  It  seems   clear, from the suddenness with which         marked    narcotic
symptoms came on after the third dose was taken on each day, that the
eight hours from 10 to 6 o'clock were not sufficient to get rid of the brandy
taken at 10 and at 2, and that in fact the body must have been still
saturated at    6 o'clock.
   The exact amount of brandy which commenced            to lessen the labour   the
man could perform is not shown by these observations, and would require
more careful modes of investigation.        It was evidently some quantity more
than 4 ounces which produced effects sufficiently marked to attract his
 attention  ; but  I should not wish to affirm that even    4 ounces   produced no
effect in this direction.    The man himself was of opinion that 4 ounces had
no influence either way.       He was quite certain it did not aid his work, but
he could not see that it injured it. The second 4 ounces decidedly produced
a bad effect.
    5. Neither    exercise on water or on alcohol produced any effect on the
phosphoric     acid of the urine.    The result is in accordance with that of the
                                                                  2  h  2

  experiments recorded in No. 89 of the Proceedings of the Royal Society
  (vol. xv. p. 339).
      The effect on the free acidity of the urine was inconsiderable.                    The
  free acidity may have been a        little increased in the brandy period, but the
  change was slight.
      The    effect on the chlorine was not certain, as its ingress was not suffi
  ciently constant, but it seems to be lessened in the exercise period.
      As the action of alcohol in dietetic doses on the elimination of nitrogen
   and on the bodily temperature is so entirely negative, it seems reasonable
  to doubt      if alcohol can have the depressing effect on the excretion            of pul
  monary carbon which is commonly attributed to it.                  It can hardly depress,
     ne would think, the metamorphosis of tissues, or substances furnishing
  carbon, without affecting either the changes of the nitrogenous structures
/ca
   or bodily heat.       It seems most important that fresh experiments should
  be made with respect to its effect on carbon elimination, as without a per
  fect knowledge on that point the use of alcohol as an article of diet in
  health cannot be fairly discussed.

       During the last autumn and winter I              was   much engaged with experi
   ments on the reproduction of gratings by             means of photography, and met
   with a considerable degree of success.             A  severe illness has prevented my
   pursuing the subject for some months, and my results are in consequence
    still far from complete ; but as I may not be able immediately to resume
    my experiments,      I think it desirable    to lay  this preliminary note before the

Royal Society, reserving the details and                    some theoretical work connected
with the subject for another opportunity.
    Itis some years since the idea first occurred to me of taking advantage
of the minute delineating power of photography to reproduce with facility
the work of so much time and trouble.                  I
                                          thought of constructing a grating
on a comparatively large scale, and afterwards reducing by the leus and
camera to the required fineness.  I am now rather inclined to think that
nothing would be gained by this course, that the construction of a grating
of a given number of lines and with a given accuracy would not be greatly
facilitated by enlarging the scale, and that it is doubtful whether photo
graphic or other lenses are capable of the work that would be required of
them.
    However     this may    be, the method             that     I   adopted is better in every
respect, except perhaps one.    Having provided myself with a grating by
Nobert, with 3000 lines ruled over a square inch, I printed from it on sen
sitive dry plates in the same way as transparencies for the lantern are usually
printed from negatives.
   In order to give myself the best chance of success,                    I   took as a source of
light the image of the sun formed by a lens placed in the shutter of a dark
room.    I hoped in this way that, even if there should be a small interval
between the lines of the grating and the sensitive surface, still a shadow of
the lines would be thrown across it.  Results of great promise were at once
obtained, and after a little practice I found it possible to produce copies
comparing not unfavourably with the original.      A source of uncertainty
lay in the imperfect flatness of the glass on which the sensitive film was
prepared, though     care was taken to choose  the flattest pieces of patent
plate.     The remedy  of  is,
                          course, to  use worked  glass, which    required in       is
any case   the magnifying-power of telescope

                                                                     is
   Almost any of the dry processes   known  to  photographers may be used.
I   have                      albumen on plain collodion, and Taupenot
           tried plain albumen,
plates. The requirements of the case differ materially from those of ordi
nary photography, sensitiveness being no object, and hardness rather than
softness desirable in the results.   After partial development,    have found       I
a treatment with  iodine, in order to clear the transparent parts, very useful.
In proceeding with the intensifying, the deposit falls wholly on the parts
that are to be opaque.    It    more essential that the transparent
                                         is                                                  parts
should be quite clear than the dark parts should be very opaque.
    The performance of           these
                              gratings     very satisfactory.

the solar spectrum,  Ihave not been able to detect any decided inferiority
in the defining-power of the copies. With them, as with the original, the

eyepiece  held independently.       believe this arrangement to be moie

 efficient than a common spectroscope, with collimator and telescope nil on
 one stand ; at any rate, the magnifying-power is considerably greater, and
 it seems to be well borne.
    I  have also experimented on the reproduction of gratings by a very
 different kind of photography.        It will be remembered that a mixture of
 gelatine with bichromate of potash is sensitive to the action of light, becoming
 insoluble, even in hot water, after exposure.       In ordinary carbon printing
 the colouring-matter is mixed with the gelatine and the print developed
 with warm water, having been first transferred so as to expose to the action
 of the water what was during the operation of the light the hind surface.
 In my experiments the colouring-matter        was omitted, and the bichromated
 gelatine poured on the glass like collodion and then allowed to dry in the
 dark.     A few minutes' exposure to the direct rays of the sun then sufficed
 to produce such a modification under the lines of the gratings that, on
 treatment with warm water, a copy of the original was produced capable of
 giving brilliant spectra. In these gelatine-gratings all parts are alike trans
 parent, so that the cause of the peculiar effect must lie in an alternate ele
 vation and depression of the surface. That this is the case may be proved
 by pressing soft sealing-wax on the grating, when an impression appears
 on the wax, giving it an effect like that of mother of pearl.       It is known
 that the effect of water on a gelatine print is to make the protected parts
 project in consequence of their greater absorption, but it might have been
 expected that on drying the whole would have come flat again.           It is diffi
 cult  to say exactly what does happen    ; and  I am not even sure whether the
part protected by the scratch on the original is raised or sunk.           Gelatine
 can scarcely be actually dissolved away, because the uppermost layer must
have become insoluble under the influence of the light.        I do not at present
 sec my way to working      by transfer, as in ordinary carbon printing.
    I  have not yet been able to reduce the production of these gelatine-
 gratings to a certainty, but can hardly doubt the possibility of doing so. One
 or two of considerable perfection have been made, capable of showing the
nickel line between the D's, and giving spectra of greater brightness than
 the common photographs.         Not only so, but the gelatine copy surpasses
 even the original in respect of brightness.            The reason is that, on
account of the broadening of the shadow of the scratch, a more favourable
ratio is established between the breadths of the alternate parts.
    Theory shows that with gratings composed of alternate transparent and
opaque parts the utmost fraction of the original light that can be concen
trated in one spectrum is only about -fa, and that this happens in the first
spectrum when the dark and bright parts are equal.           But if instead of an
opaque    bar stopping  the  light, a transparent   bar  capable of retarding the
light by half an undulation can be substituted, there would be a fourfold
increase in the light of the first spectrum.       I  accordingly anticipate that
the gelatine-gratings arc likely to prove ultimately the best, if the conditions
of their production can be sufficiently mastered.

     With regard                     of the photographs, I need not say much
                         to the application
at present ; it is evident that the use of gratings would become more general
if the cost were reduced in the proportion, say, of 20 to 1, more particularly
if there were no accompanying inferiority of performance.
   The specimens sent with this paper are both capable of showing the
nickel line and give fairly bright spectra, but they must not be supposed
to be the limit of what is possible.     From their appearance under the mi
croscope I see no reason to doubt that lines 6000 to the inch can be copied
by the same method, a point which                      I
                                         hope shortly to put to the test of
experiment.

subject (supra, p. 308) has drawn my attention to the investigation made
by the Director of the Prague Observatory.
  Dr. Hornstein having remarked the uncertainty of the result for the
time of the sun's rotation as deduced from the movement of the spots in
different zones on its surface, thought    would be desirable to consider

other phenomena associated with the sun's rotation; and the apparent
connexion of the frequency of the solar spots with the amount of the mag
netic oscillations induced him to seek for period in the daily mean values

of the magnetic elements.    For this end he grouped the daily means of
observations made at Prague and Vienna in 1870 in periods varying from
16 to 28 days   and subjecting the resulting means to calculation for the

giving by calculation 26 '4 days, while the inclination at Prague showed
26 days.
    Dr. Hornstein concludes that the mean of                         these   four values,   " 26*33
days, may be considered provisionally as the most probable value [of the
period], and as the result of the first experiment to determine the time of
the sun's synodical rotation by means of the magnetic needle. The true
time of the sun's rotation derived from this                      = 24*55 days, almost exactly
coinciding with the value found              by

418                            Mr.    J. A. Broun      on the                [June 20,
 Magazine' for August 1858, I made the following remark : — "The result
 which I have now obtained from three years' observations near the mag
 netic equator, it appears to me, is wholly independent of the moon, and is
 due to the sun's rotation on its axis.           If we could suppose that the solar
 magnetic   poles  are  fixed, it  might   then   be possible to determine accurately
 the time of the sun's rotation by means of the movement of our magnets.
 If, on the other hand, the poles        are  in motion,   as   I conceive they are, we
 shall have to employ another period than 25'325 days, as obtained from the
 solar spots.    The period to be employed will of course be found by careful
 examination of the observations and by trial" [of different times]. These
views resulted from a discussion of observations of the horizontal                force
 made at Trevandrum        in the years 1855, 1856, and 1857.
    In February      1861   a paper by me was         read to the Royal Society of
 Edinburgh, containing       conclusions     derived  from  an examination of all the
 observations of the horizontal force which had been published, made between
  1842 and 1848, the whole having been recorrected for temperature by my
 own method, for the purpose of this and other investigations.                Founding
 chiefly on the simultaneous daily means of observations made at Makers-
 toun, Trevandrum, Singapore, and Hobarton during the years 1844 and
  1845 (the only years for which a complete diurnal series existed for
 Makerstoun), I arrived at the conclusion, from an examination of a series
 of successive periods, shown nearly equally well at all the four stations,
  that there was a period of nearly 26 days, probably due to the sun's rota
 tion on its axis, the mean of the whole number of periods being 25,96
  days *. The observations, however, seemed to show that the single periods
 had a variable length, though this might be due to some extent to irre
 gular disturbing causes, yet dependent, perhaps, on the period of the year,
 and it might be on other arguments, such as the position of the planets.
    In the examination of observations made by me in India, I had sought
 for the greatest amplitude on trial of periods of 26 to 27 days, but post
 poned a complete investigation till the observations of a greater number of
 years should enable me to follow more certainly the apparent variations in
 the length of the single periods ; this other investigations have hitherto
 prevented, and     I  am glad that Dr. Hornstein has taken up the subject,
 though evidently ignorant of my previous conclusions.
    Mr. Airy's communication on this subject is very important ; its con
 clusion refers to a period of 26£ days ; and although the evidence may be
 imperfect for such a period, it seems to me that the Greenwich results, when
 projected, give considerable grounds for concluding that a period of near
 26 days exists.                           I
                      In what follows, limit myself wholly to the observations
 of the horizontal force, as     I have found that element, when accurately cor
 rected for temperature, best fitted to show the period in question.
    The Astronomer Royal has noted            a probable inaccuracy in the amount
 of the  correction   employed    for  the  secular  change; as this correction is of

importance     in the investigation, I have sought to determine it from the
means   for the 26^-day period in each year. A consideration of the mean
value of the horizontal force at Greenwich will show that it varies irregu
larly from year to year, and that          no single value employed as a correction
due   to a supposed uniform change from the beginning to the end of a
year  would   satisfy all the years.      I adopted the following method to obtain
this correction (not being in possession of the Greenwich observations) : — by
comparing the mean value for the 1st day with that for the 14th, that of
the 2nd day with the mean for the 15th, and so on, 13 values of the
change for 13 days are obtained for any gradual change, which will be ap
proximately true whether there be a period of 2G days or no period what
ever.   This method      gave the mean change during           13  days for each year as
follows  : —
            1850.       1851.         1852.      1868.       1809.         18/0.

 the unit being in all cases "00001 of the whole horizontal force.                  Having
applied the proportional parts of these quantities with the signs changed
to the mean values of horizontal force for the respective years (Table,
p. 310, supra),     I then calculated the values of the constants for the term
                                       a sin  (0+c).

  1844 ; in a similar way the change for 1845 was found: the corrections

  It   will      be seen that though the constant a varies                    little, it is greatest for
each year by the period of 26 days ; on the other hand, the constant c
varies considerably ; and this constant may be made the most delicate test
for the true mean period.   By the period of 25 days, the maximum hap j
pens between the 1st and 2nd days in 1844, but ten days later in 1845 ;
by the 26^-day period, on the other hand, it happens seven days earlier in
1845 than in 1844.   The 26-day period shows a difference in the same
direction of four days.
   It will be evident that         if
                             the time employed for the calculation be less
than the true period, the   maximum    resulting from the superposition of a
succession of periods will be thrown later than the maximum derived from
the exact period ;    on the other hand, the time employed be longer
                           if,
than the true time, the maximum resulting from the superposition will
occur earlier. The difference between the epochs of maximum derived
from two successive series of groups                       will thus give       an approximation            to
the error of the period employed.                     If    we apply this          to the difference of
epochs in the preceding Table, remembering that 14 periods intervene
between the means from the two years (excepting for the 25| days, when
there are 14 periods), we shall obtain the following corrections to the

  It    not unlikely, however, that this exact agreement

the secular change, but also for the annual period         though any slight   ;
change which this additional     correction might produce would probably have
little effect on the final result.
  With       these results   in view,     we may now return to the Greenwich                       values.

If    suppose, as the above calculations indicate, that the interval from
     we
maximum to maximum is somewhat less than 26] days, we obtain from
the differences of the epochs for 1852-1850                                 and 1870-1868               the following

  The result from 1870 and 1868 is that which merits the greatest value,
owing to the largeness of the coefficient a for these two years. If we as
sume, then, that the true period is 26 days, we may, by                                         applying a correc
tion to the epochs of maximum                           for 1870 and 1852                     of + -14 days = 4J,
find the epochs for 1869 and 1851 : these would be for 1869, 17-1 days, or
three days later than results from the calculation ; and for 1851, 17"9 days,
five days later than from the calculation ; and the smallness of the coeffi
cient for 1851 would show that an error of this amount is quite possible.
   We have still, however, another means of determining which of the
values, 26 or 261, js the most probable.   The two best-marked results
from the Greenwich observations  are those  for 1852 and 1870; we may
compare the epochs of maximum from these years with that derived from
the Makerstoun observations for 1814.        The terms for these three years
having the largest value of the constant a are (in 100,000ths of the force) : —

     Now       ns the period          began    the 1st of January, the first

   The results for 1844 and 1870 are, I think, very near the truth, and
they confirm, within 2 days, the epoch with a period of 26 days ; and
whatever value may be given to the epoch for 1852 compared with that
for 1844, will diminish the probability of the value 26^.    On the other
hand, 1852 compared with 1870 satisfies exactly the period of 26^ days;
hut it would also be satisfied equally well by a period of 26-02 days ; so
the interval       is,
                in this case, too great to decide between the two values.
The other results, however,             seem to me sufficient, and, neglecting the long
intervals, we have from
                              1844-45, period = 25-96 days.

think there cannot        be the slightest doubt      ;   the examination of great masses
of observations        has confirmed my belief in       it, as  has Dr.Hornstein's.

accidental minima, in opposition to the minima belonging to the period                        :
these accidental minima are connected with great disturbances, probably
allied to the solar eruptions or to causes which generally produce spots and
protuberances.     It to these accidental minima that the smallness of the

an irregularity in the length of    few successive periods.

the conditions of the problem, without which perfect exactness in the cal

             impossible.

     In determining the interval between the maximum of January            1844 and
 that of January 1852, the epoch of maximum for 1844, deduced from the
 26-day groups, was compared with that from the 26^-day group in 1 852.
 Either the latter should be corrected by + i'1* day = + 2-J-days, or the
 epoch found for the 26J-day group in 1844 (22-9 day instead of 25 days)
 should be taken.        In either case the number of days intervening becomes
 291   1  days, which is only one day less than 112 periods of 26 days        ; or it
 is equivalent to 112 periods of 25-99 days.
    If we   try  113 periods, we obtain 25'76 days for the length     of one, which
 is less than that by any of the one- and two-year comparisons. The longest
 interval, from January 1844 to January 1870, becomes (the above correc
tion made) 9494 days, which number is equivalent to 365 periods                    of
 26-01, or 366 periods of 2594 days.

    Since writing the preceding note,          I  have examined the observations of
the bifilar magnetometer made at different stations on the earth's surface
during the years 1842, 1843, 1846, and 1847, and found, as shown in my
paper already cited for the years 1844 and 1845, that the variations of the
daily mean horizontal force are the same at all stations at the same time :
this   I  consider a test essential in the first instance before seeking from any
observations other results which depend on the changes of mean values
from day to day.
    In the case of the observations for the years just mentioned, as in those
for 1844 and 1845, great disturbances are indicated always by a great
diminution of the mean magnetic force ; these diminutions are frequently
so great, that in the calculations      for a single year they decide the epoch   of
minimum.
    In my paper        on   the Horizontal Force of the Earth's Magnetism,         I
stated that     "a  careful investigation of a much larger series of observations
leads me to believe that the period is variable within certain limits " * ;
whether this variation is due to a change of the solar meridian producing
the maximum' after certain intervals, or to superposed regular or irregular
causes, I hoped, and hope yet, to determine.
    If   the variation   is one about a mean value, then that value will be best
determined by comparing the result of two well-marked groups of periods
separated by an interval of several years, as has been done in the preceding

varies, the mean period should be sought for each year by the trial of

III.   "Contributions towards the History of the Ethylene Bases."
       By A. W. Hofmann, Ph.D ., F.R.S., Professor of Chemistry in the
       University of Berlin.        Received May 20, 1872.
    The manufacture of chloral, which, since the discovery of the remarkable
physiological properties of this compound, is conducted on a daily increasing
scale, gives rise to a variety of secondary products which have not failed to
attract the attention of chemists.           Some time ago I showed that the
most volatile     fraction   ot these by-products consists almost entirely of
chloride of ethyl,           constituting a very valuable material for the pre
paration of an abundant quantity of the ethylated ammonias.            The fraction
boiling between 70° and 100° is chiefly bichloride                  of ethylene,
which, when submitted to the action of alcoholic ammonia              at 100°,  fur
nishes a supply of ethylene bases such as would be difficult to obtain from
other sources.      Dr. Schering, one of the principal manufacturers of chloral
in Berlin, has lately placed at my disposal between 30 and 40 kilograms
of these latter by-products, which the kindness of my friends Drs. Martius
and Mendelssohn,        by placing at my disposal one of their magnificent
enamelled autoclaves, has permitted me to treat in one single operation with
alcoholic ammonia.
    The product of this operation        was a large proportion of sal-ammoniac
deposited in crystals, and a       dark alcoholic mother-liquor which, after the
alcohol had been distilled off, yielded on evaporation a brown crystalline
 residue, consisting of salts of ethylene bases.     Large quantities of ethylene-
 diamine chlorhydrate in a state of absolute purity were separated from this
 mixture by systematic crystallization.       An additional portion was procured
 by distilling the mother-liquor, after it had ceased to crystallize, with an
 alkali, collecting apart the first products, as long as they yielded with
 chlorhydric acid the easily crystallizable ethylenediamine salt.           In this
 manner more than a kilogram of the perfectly pure chlorhydrate was ob
 tained, not to speak of quantities of the more complex bases, which I have
 not yet endeavoured to separate.
                                                                     I
    A new source of ethylenediamine having thus been opened, was induced
 to resume the study of this remarkable substance, the history of which still
 presents a great number of gaps.         I was more particularly anxious to ascer
 tain whether some of the reactions, to which the ordinary alcohol bases
  have  of late  been found to lend themselves, might be        with equal   success
  applied to the ethylene bases.
       1.  Action of Carbon Bisulphide on Ethylenediamine.
     Having repeatedly     been engaged    during the last few years with the study

   4.26                      Dr. A. W. Hofmann on        the             [June 20,
   of the mustard-oils, my attention was in the first   place directed towards the
   production of the ethylene term of this class of compounds, and       I  was thus
   led to make some experiments on the behaviour of the diamine towards
   carbon bisulphide.    Indeed, if the reaction between these two bodies ensued
  in   a manner    analogous to that which obtains in the case of carbon bi
   sulphide    and ethylamine, the formation of an ethylenediamine ethylene
  disulphocarbamate,

  was to be expected, which, under the influence     of metallic salts, might   have
  split up in ethylenediamine, sulphhydric acid, and ethylene mustard-oil,

      Ethylenediamine sulphocarbonate. —     If carbon bisulphide be mixed with
  a solution of ethylenediamine in alcohol, a clear liquid is obtained, which
  after a few moments becomes troubled by the separation of a while, almost
  amorphous compound.         This substance rapidly augments, so that after the
 lapse   of  a quarter of an  hour the liquid is converted into a white or pale
 yellow    solid mass.
     The new compound is nearly insoluble in alcohol and ether, and may
 therefore be readily purified by washing with these solvents.         It is soluble
 in hot water, undergoing, however, at the same time slight decomposition ;
 if care be taken not to heat the solution to the boiling-point, the compound
 separates on cooling in prismatic crystals.     In the dry state also it is decom
 posed at a temperature of 100°, and must therefore for analysis be dried
 in vacuo or over sulphuric acid.        Analysis shows that the substance is
 formed by the union of one molecule of ethylenediamine and one molecule
of carbon bisulphide, its composition being      expressed   by the formula
                         C,HaNaSa«=(C,H4)H4Na,CSa.
     The behaviour of ethylenediamine to carbon bisulphide is therefore so
far analogous to that of ethylamine that we have, in both instances, a double
molecule of ammonia uniting with one molecule of carbon bisulphide.
The ethylenediamine derivative, however, is distinguished from that of ethyl
amine by its chemical characters ; for whilst the latter is evidently the
ethylamine salt of ethylsulphocarbamic acid, a similar view of the consti
tution of the former is untenable ; for neither do dilute acids cause the sepa
ration from it of ethylene sulphocarbamic acid, nor do alkalies liberate
ethylenediamine, reactions which would certainly take place if the new
body were constituted like the ethylamine compound.              Under these cir
cumstances there was but little expectation of meeting amongst the pro
ducts of its decomposition       an  ethylene mustard-oil     having the compo
sition of ethylene sulphocyanate described by Buff.           In fact I may state
at once that hitherto all my attempts to prepare such a compound have
entirely failed.

      Ethylene sulphocarbamide, ethylene urea. — When a solution of the bi
  sulphide of carbon compound of ethylenediamine is boiled with a metallic
  salt (mercury chloride for example), sulphuretted hydrogen is eliminated,
  whilst at the same time a small quantity of carbon bisulphide distils, and
  there remains in solution a salt of ethylenediamine and the metallic com
  pound of a new body still containing sulphur.
     A similar change is produced by boiling with dilute acids, hut in this
  instance much carbon bisulphide is evolved.             Finally, the decomposition
 may    also be  effected by boiling with water ;  in this case scarcely any thing but
 sulphuretted hydrogen is given off, the product of the reaction consisting
 almost entirely of the above-mentioned new sulphur              body, which can by
 this means be easily obtained in a pure state.
     If  the aqueous solution be allowed to cool, when sulphuretted hydrogen
 has ceased to be evolved, beautiful white prismatic          crystals having an ex
 tremely bitter taste are deposited ; they are soluble with difficulty in ether,
 but easilyso in alcohol. Theirmelting-pointis 194°; at a higher temperature

 be removed even by        boiling with lead oxide in    an alkaline  solution, and is
 only detected by fusion with potassium nitrate.          Analysis of the body dried
 at 100° leads to the formula

     The   new substance,   which may be considered as ethylene sulphocarbamide
 or ethylene sulpho-urea, is thus seen to be formed from the carbon bisulphide
 compound by the elimination of one molecule of sulphhydric acid,

    The    same body, as already mentioned, is produced by boiling the carbon
bisulphide      compound with metallic salts or with acids, the by-products
ethylenediamine and carbon bisulphide, always formed in larger or smaller
quantity, belonging to a secondary reaction, in which the original compound
is resolved into its constituents.      Ethylene sulphocarbamide crystallizes un
changed from its solution in acids, but combines with silver nitrate and
mercury chloride, forming crystalline compounds.            The mercury salt having
been frequently prepared in the attempts to obtain the mustard-oil has
been repeatedly analyzed. Probably several double salts exist; but under the
conditions in which I have operated a compound of two molecules of the
urea with three molecules of mercury chloride,

    A second platinum-salt exists which only differs from that just mentioned
by containing two molecules of hydrochloric acid. This salt was accidentally
obtained in an attempt to decompose the ethylene sulpho-urea by sulphuric
acid.    The urea was heated with the concentrated acid until sulphurous
acid began to be evolved ; on adding platinum chloride to the solution
after it had been diluted with water, a difficultly soluble platinum-salt was
formed, crystallizing in beautiful long needles.        At the first glance this
appeared to be the platinum-salt of a new base, but on examination it was
found to contain the original sulphur compound.             It is represented by
the formula
                           2(C,H,N1S,HCl).PtCl4.
   On decomposing this platinum-salt by sulphuretted hydrogen       a chlorhydric
solution was formed, from which platinum chloride precipitated the original
amorphous salt, and which on evaporation left the original ethylene
 sulpho-urea  ; this was identified by its bitter taste and by a determination
of its melting-point. It is not easy to form an idea of the manner in which
 sulphuric acid acts in this case, as the needle-shaped platinum-salt is not
produced in the presence of chlorhydric acid alone, even when very concen
trated and in large excess.
    On comparing the composition of ethylene sulphocarbamide with that
of ethylenediamine on the one side and that of ethylene mustard-oil on the
other, it will at once be seen that the new body occupies a position inter
mediate between the two     :

    The idea naturally suggested itself of procuring the mustard-oil by the
further action of carbon bisulphide on ethylene sulphocarbamide ; but al
though numerous experiments have been made in this direction under varied
conditions, hitherto all these attempts have been without success.      Digestion
with carbon bisulphide alone ov with carbon bisulphide and lead oxide
produces no result   ; nor is the sulphur compound changed by treatment
 with potassium xanthate under pressure.         In every respect the body ex
 hibits remarkable stability ; indeed all endeavours to remove the sulphur by
 the action of metallic oxides or of ammonia, even under pressure at a very
 high temperature, have hitherto failed.
    An experiment may here still briefly be mentioned by which the formation
 of the body sought for was aimed at in another way. As is well known,
 ethylic mustard-oil   may also be procured from diethylsulpho-urca          when

    Ethylenediamine      sulphocyanhydrate. — I first endeavoured to prepare
this salt by decomposing the chlorhydrate               with silver sulphocyanide,
but no action takes place between the two salts even under pressure.                  It
can, however, be readily obtained by saturating free sulphocyanhydric               ncid
with ethylenediamine.         The compound crystallizes in large transparent
prisms which soon become opaque.           The crystals, which are anhydrous, are
exceedingly soluble in water, somewhat less so, but still very soluble, in
alcohol, insoluble in ether.       The formula
                      C4 HI0 N4  S2=(C2 H4) H4 N„ (HCNS),
was verified by the analysis      of the substance dried at 100°.
    On heating the sulphocyanhydrate, it immediately undergoes profound
decomposition.       Even below its melting-point, which lies at 145°, the salt
becomes changed into the ethylene sulpho-urea already described, am
monium sulphocyanide being simultaneously            separated.

    This transformation is perfectly analogous to that which, as              I pointed
out many years ago *, aniline sulphocyanhydrate                 undergoes under the
influence of heat when it is changed into sulphocarbanilide and ammonium
sulphocyanide.       No indication of the formation of a mustard-oil could be
observed.       I must not leave unmentioned      that experiments made in my
laboratory by M. Jul.       Strakosch, with the view of preparing the mustard-
oil of benzidine, have had no better results.        New methods, then, must          be
sought for the production of the mustard-oils         corresponding to diamines.

    In order to complete the history of ethylenediamine I may here be allowed
to append some further observations, partly new and partly old, which have
not yet been published.
     Action of benzoyl chloride     on ethylenediamine.     — The reaction, which is
 a very energetic one, takes place precisely         in the manner indicated          by
 theory.     The hot liquid solidifies on cooling         to a crystalline mixture of
 ethylenediamine      chlorhydrate,   and a new compound to which the name
 ethylene dibenzoyldiamide        belongs.    After washing away the ethylene-
 diamine salt, the residue only requires to be crystallized once or twice from
 alcohol in order to obtain it in fine needles of perfect purity.                 These

    Action of chloral    on ethylenediamine.  — In   order to become acquainted
also with an ethylcncdiamide belonging to the series of fatty acids,        I  have
prepared    the  formyl compound.       The  basic properties of ethylenediamine
being, indeed, similar to those of potash and soda, it appeared appropriate
to treat the base with chloral in order to produce ethylene diformyldiamide.
Experiment has confirmed this anticipation ; the two substances act on one
another with great energy, torrents of chloroform being given off which may
be readily condensed       : on evaporating the residuary liquid on the water-
bath, ethylene diformyldiamide remains behind as a transparent syrup.
       (C„ H4)H4 N2+ 2[C Cl3     . CHO] = (C, H4)(CHO)2 H2 N2+2CHCl3.
    Both acids and alkalies, especially on boiling, readily change this amide
into ethylenediamine and formic acid.          In passing I may mention that
chloral may also be conveniently used for the preparation of other
formamides.       When anhydrous ethylamine and chloral are brought to
gether,   a white   crystalline mass is immediately formed by the direct union
of the two substances. This, on distillation, gives considerable quantities
of pure ethylformamide boiling at 199°, chloroform being eliminated at the
same time.
    Formamide also may be obtained in this manner, but less advantageously.
     Action of oxalic ether on ethylenediamine. — If a concentrated alcoholic
solution of ethylenediamine be mixed with oxalic ether, the liquid becomes
warm and solidifies after a few minutes to a white amorphous mass, which is
almost insoluble both in water and in alcohol.       On evaporating the alcoholic
filtrate from   the  insoluble body  on  the water-bath,  a white crystalline sub
stance is left, which is soluble both in water and in alcohol.
    The white amorphous substance is swollen up like starch-paste, and can
only be washed with difficulty ; moreover, as no solvent for it was to be
found, it could not be further purified, a circumstance which was not with
out a slight influence on the analytical results. As might be expected, the
amorphous body is ethylene oxamide,

    About three years ago one of us* laid before the German Chemical
 Society the results of some experiments on the naphthaline dye commerci
ally called Magdala Red. These experiments showed that the dye in ques
tion represents three molecules of naphthylamine which have lost three mo
lecules of hydrogen, and that it is formed by the action of naphthylamine
on azodinaphthyldiamine         with separation of one molecule of ammonia.

Azodinaphthyldiamine.       Naphthylamine.         Naphthaline red.
    The idea occurred to us of studying this reaction in other series and in
other combinations.         Preliminary experiments showed at once that aniline,
as well as toluidine    salts, readily act on azodinaphthyldiamine, forming per
 fectly similar     red colouring-matters;       and the question finally presented
itself, whether to this group of dyes might            not belong also the blue body
which MM. Martius and Griesst produced by treating azodiphenyldia-
mine with salts of aniline, as mentioned in their interesting paper on Amido-
dijihenylimide, but which has not            as yet been more minutely investigated.
    The solution of this question by experiment appeared all the more de
 sirable,   since the composition of a compound likely thus to be formed
would in all probability coincide with that of violaniline which MM.
 Girard, De Laire, and Chapoteaut          J  obtained by the oxidation of pure ani
line. We have performed these experiments.
    For the preparation of the blue colouring-matter derived from azodi-
phenyldiamine, which, for the sake of shortness, we will call azodiphenyl
 blue, equal weights of the pure azo base and aniline chlorhydrate with
twice the weight of alcohol were heated in hermetically sealed tubes to
 160° C. for four or five hours.         After the lapse of this time a dark blue
pasty mass had been formed ; no gaseous compounds were produced in the
reaction.      For the purpose of purification, the crude product, which was
at once recognized to be a chlorhydrate, was treated with boiling water
in order     to remove unaltered        aniline   salt and sal-ammoniac   formed in
the process ; it was then dissolved in alcohol with addition of chlor-
hydric acid, and precipitated by soda.                The base thus separated was
carefully washed with water to free it from soda, and then dissolved in
boiling alcohol     ; the liquid was then mixed with chlorhydric acid and sub
mitted to distillation.      As soon as half the alcohol had passed over, a dark

blue and slightly crystalline salt was found to be deposited on cooling.
This salt is insoluble in water, but readily dissolves in alcohol, especially
when heated.      The solution is of a deep violet-blue colour, which is fixed
by wool and silk, but cannot possibly be compared to the tints of the
substituted rosanilines for brilliancy or beauty.     The blue chlorhydrate is
perfectly  insoluble  in  ether.   When    soda is added  to the concentrated
alcoholic solution of the salt, the base is separated as a dark-brown powder
which is insoluble in water, but dissolves in alcohol and ether with a red-
brown colour.     On addition of chlorhydric acid, the alcoholic solution as
sumes a pure blue tint ; the ethereal solution, on the other hand, becomes
perfectly colourless, the blue salt being precipitated.     Treated with gra
nulated zinc in presence of alcohol and chlorhydric acid, the solution of
the salt is decolorized, but becomes blue again on exposure to the air.     An
attempt to prepare a leuko base in this manner failed ; nor was an experi
ment made with ammonium sulphide more successful.
   Analysis of the chlorhydrate just described, as well as of some other
salts derived from      it,
                      showed that the reaction between azodiphenyldiamine
and aniline indeed takes place, exaetly as our knowledge of the analogous
experiment in the naphthaline series had led us to expect.  In forming the
blue    body one molecule of azodiphenyldiamine     and one                    molecule   of
 aniline unite with separation of one molecule of ammonia,

 washing out the soluble salts and recrystallizing without addition of acid,

    We have finally analyzed the

 chlorhydric salt of azodiphenyl blue is precipitated by an alcoholic solution
 of picric acid. The picrate is a blue powder perfectly insoluble in water
 and ether, and only very slightly soluble in boiling alcohol.           For analysis,
 the precipitated salt was carefully washed with water and dried at 100° C.

    As has been already stated in the beginning of this note, the colouring-
 matter which we call Azodiphenyl blue possesses exactly the same com
 position as violaniline,      which  MM. Girard,    De Laire, and Chapoteaut have
prepared by oxidizing pure aniline,
                               3C0H7N-3HH=CUH15N3.
    Are   these two bodies identical ?     We had hoped to      be able to decide this
question by experiment ;           our researches   have, however, for the present
taken a different direction, so that the question remains an open one.
    If instead    of an aniline salt the chlorhydrates of toluidine and naphthyl-
amine     are allowed      to act on azodiphenyldiamine,        as might have been
 expected, blue dyes with properties perfectly similar to those of azodiphenyl
 blue are produced.         It is extremely   probable that    these compounds     are
 respectively
                                CI„H17N3 and CMII17N,.
 These formulae must, however, still be established by analysis.
    The attempts here briefly sketched at producing new colouring-matters
 were capable of expansion in another direction.             Indeed, instead of sub
 mitting azodiphenyldiamine to the action of toluidine and naphthylamine,
 the idea suggested itself of starting from azoditolyldiamine, which would
 then be treated with aniline and naphthylamine salts.
    An azoditolyldiamine exactly corresponding to azodiphenyldiamine
 remains as yet unknown. In all his experiments Dr. Martius, who, as he
informs us, has repeatedly attempted the preparation of this compound,
has invariably obtained only the isomeric body diazoamidotoluol, which
is decomposed on boiling.           We have not been more fortunate in our efforts
to produce the true analogue of azodiphenyldiamine.                     On passing a
rapid    current    of  nitrous   acid through    toluidine  heated   to  fusion on a
saturated solution of common salt, the liquid base after seme time solidifies
to a crystalline mass, which may be easily purified by washing with water
and recrystallizing from alcohol.            In this way well-formed dark lemon-
coloured needles are obtained.           The analysis of this body, dried in vacuo,
shows    that  it  certainly possesses the composition
                                       C„H15Nr
    However, on boiling this substance with chlorhydric acid, it is readily
decomposed to cressol and toluidine, giving off quantities of nitrogen,

   The body formed in our experiments is thus found to be diazoamidoto-
luol and not azoditolyldiamine, the latter, as before, still remaining to be
discovered.      Since, in consequence of the operations just mentioned, we
had in our possession an appreciable quantity of the diazo body, we were
not willing to pass by this opportunity of testing, however cursorily, its
action on aromatic monamines.           Dyes are in fact produced by treating di-
azoamidotoluol with the chlorhydrates of aniline and naphthylamine in alco
holic solution at 1 50° C. The numerous by-products, however, which are
formed in these processes sufficiently show that the reaction is by no means
a simple one.       It is more particularly worthy of remark that in its reac
tion with aniline salts no trace of the easily recognizable rosaniline was
formed, which might have been the case if the true azoditolyldiamine
could have been employed.           We have not further studied the products
 generated in these reactions.

        June    1,  1872.
                                                            Fallowfield,  May 3, 1872.
My dear Dii. Sharpey, — In my memoir                 on Calamites, published in the
last volume of the ' Philosophical Transactions,' I gave two figures of sections
of a plant (plate 25. fig. 16 and plate 28. fig. 39) supposed to be aCalamite,
but respecting the Calamitcan nature of which            I expressed     my doubts in a

  436           Prof. W. C. Williamson's Further Researches               [June 20,
  note at the foot of page 488.        I have now got numerous examples of this
  plant, and it proves, as      I surmised, to belong to a distinct type.    It has a
  branching stem, not jointed, and having a remarkable pith.         Since the latter
  organ, when divided transversely, gives a star-shaped section, closely re
 sembling that of a Calamite, except that it has not been fistular,            I pro
 pose to give to the plant the generic name of Astromyelon.           I have further
 examined a series of curious stems which         I described briefly at the Edin
 burgh Meeting of the British Association under the name of Bictyoxylon
 radicans   ; this plant    I  also find must be placed in a new genus.          It is
 characterized by possessing an exogenous, woody, branching stem, com
 posed of reticulated vessels.          It has no pith, and its bark consists of
 cells arranged in columns perpendicular to its surface.             I  think it not
 improbable that this has been the subterrauean axis of some other plant,
        I
 since have succeeded in tracing its ultimate subdivisions into rootlets.            I
 propose for the present to recognize it by the generic name of Amyelon. My
 specimens of this plant are very numerous, some of them having been
 kindly supplied to     me by Messrs.     Butterworth and Whittaker, of Oldham.
 They may prove to      be  rhizomes and roots of the Asterophyllite described in
 my last letter to you.
     Of this last genus      I  have just got an additional number of exquisite
 examples, showing      not   only the nodes but verticils of the linear leaves so
 characteristic of the plant.        These specimens place the correctness of my
 previous inference beyond all possibility of doubt, and finally settle the
 point that Asterophyllites is not the branch and foliage of a Calamite, but
 an altogether distinct type of vegetation having an internal organization
 peculiarly its own.       This organization is identical in every essential point
 with that of my Folkmannia Bawsoni already referred to in my previous
letter, and which        I   do not now hesitate to designate Asterophyllites
 Dawsoni.      The peculiar triquetrous form of the young vascular axis of
 this genus is too remarkable and too distinct from that of all other Carbo
niferous types to be mistaken for any of them, and especially for that of
 Calamites, with which it has not one single feature of real affinity.
    I have also obtained, partly through the assistance of Messrs. Butter-
worth and Whittaker, but especially the latter, an instructive series of
specimens of the genus Zygopteris, which has recently been made the sub
ject of an important memoir by M. B. Renault, published in tome xii. of
the 'Annales des Sciences Naturelles.'          Our Lancashire specimens are of
the type which he describes under the name of Z. Lacattii. The French
savant has found these plants, in one instance, connected as petioles to a
rhizome, which he believes to be that of a fern.            Our specimens supply
some information additional to that published by M. Renault ; they appear
to me to sustain his idea that they are petioles, and I have traced in them
the origin of the two vascular bundles which he refers to as pores existing
in the bark.      I find much reason for concluding that they are, as he sur
mises,    the vessels  going to the secondary rachis of the pinnules.            Our

1872.]                among the Plants     of  the Coal-measures.                   437
Lancashire      specimens are covered with sparse, but very distinct hairs, that,
unlike the ramentaceous form common amongst ferns, are perfectly cylin
drical.       Whilst    I   am  thus inclined    to express my conviction that M.
Renault is correct in his views respecting Zygopteris,           I find it increasingly
difficult to distinguish fragments of ferns from those of Lycopods, as also
fragments of petioles from those of roots.
      Mr. Nield and Mr. Whittaker, of Oldham, have just supplied me with
two magnificent stems of Calamites of large size.                 The pith is absent
from both, except some slight traces at the node of one of the specimens.
I find on dissecting      these matured stems that the remarkable arrangements         of
 the vascular structure seen in plate 23. figure 2 of my memoir on Calamites
 almost entirely disappear in the more external of the exogenous growths.
 The conspicuous vertical lamina; of cellular parenchyma (my primary
 medullary rays), which separate the woody wedges, rapidly diminish in size
 as they proceed from           within outwards, becoming more or          less like the
 secondary or ordinary medullary rays represented in my fig. 5.                 Many of
 them, however, retain the evidence of their primary medullary origin in
 their unusual length, and by consisting of two, or even three, vertical series
 of cells instead of one, as is usual with the secondary rays. The vessels
  pursue their longitudinal course across the node undeflected in any direction,
  save where they bend aside to allow the passage outwards of vascular bundles
  going off to the aerial branches*, as represented in my figures 13 and 38.
  Thus in the exterior parts of these large stems the ligneous zone exhibits little
  or no indication of the presence of a node, except what these divergent bundles
  afford.     I find that these bundles slightly increase in size as they proceed
  from within outwards, showing that they share in the exogenous additions
  made to the exterior of the ligneous zone ; in one of my stems that zone
   has a circumference of seven inches, and the other of six and three
  quarters.      It is in the former one that I find the nodal bundles ; but I have
  not seen one of these organs whose actual diameter exceeds three sixteenths
   of an inch, confirming my previous statements respecting the compa
   ratively small size of the aerial branches.         As in my previously described
   examples, these bases of branches exhibit no separation of the vessels into a
   circle of wedges like those of the parent stem. The persistent growth of
   the vascular bundles just described seems to indicate more permanent rela
   tions between them and the central stem than              I  once thought probable.
   There appears to        be a close approximation    to uniformity in the number of
    the woody wedges of these large stems ;          one of mine contains 85, and the
    other 83 such.        Mr. Binney counted 73 in his large specimen (loc. cit.
    pi. 2. fig. 1). In the thin, young, woody cylinder represented in my fig.
     1 9, the mean diameter of which was slightly over an inch, the number was
    also about 80.       This  close resemblance between steins so different        in age
    and size again illustrates another of my previous statements, viz. that age
        * This condition is very correctly              in plato 3. fig. 3 of  Mr. Binuey's

  produces no increase in the number of the woody wedges, but that each
 one of the latter enlarges by successive additions to its peripheral portions
 of new lamina:, which latter partly fill up the increasing area of the en
 larging     circle, and partly encroach upon the primary medullary rays, as
 represented in my figure 17, in addition to some interstitial growth.
     We thus learn that as the ligneous cylinder of a Calamite increased in
 age and size it gradually exhibited less and less of the Calamitean pecu
 liarities seen in young stems ; its external portions assumed a generalized,
 unsulcated form, which recurs with remarkable uniformity in several other
wise different plants of the Coal-measures.
    Amongst the Burntisland fossils sent to me by Mr. Grieve,                     I find two
 very    curious    stems, probably      of the  same    general    nature   as  Zygopteris.
 Both have a dense outer cortical layer, with vascular bundles in the inte
 rior. In the simpler of these plants the transverse section of this bundle is
 crescentic ; but in the concave border of the crescent are two small project
ing capes dividing it into three minor bays (fig. 2). In the other the vascular
 axis is a double one, lodged in a somewhat elliptical stem : one of these is a
 simple crescent, the concavity of which is directed inwards ; the other has
 a very elegant transverse section (fig. 1 ).        It is shaped like a dumb-bell, one
 head of which rests within the concavity of the crescentic bundle, and the
 other turns in the opposite direction ; at each of these two extremities the
  margin of the dumb-bell is excavated into a small bay, as if a vertical canal
 had existed at each point ; but these seem to have been merely columns of
  cellular tissue encroaching upon the rounded outline of the vascular struc
  tures.     I  propose provisionally       to recognize these two forms under the
 generic name of Arpexylon.

    sents   the form    of a chnir or sent, and to which I propose to assign tho namo
    Edraxylon.      This form exhibits numerous modifications of the pattern represented
    in the outline down to a single central vascular bundle.       It may prove to belong to
    Dic/yoxylon Oklhamium.

    The author passes in brief review the principal theories which in modern
times have been proposed to account for volcanic activity.

 1872.]                 Mr. R. Mallet   on  Volcanic Energy.                    439
    The chemical theory, which       owed  its partial acceptance chiefly to the
 fame of Davy, may he dismissed, as all known facts tend to show that
 the chemical energies of the materials of our globe were almost wholly
 exhausted prior to the consolidation of its surface.
    The mechanical theory, which finds in a nucleus still in a state of liquid
 fusion a store of heat and of lava &c, is only tenable on the admission
of a very thin solid crust ; and even through a crust of but 30 miles thick
it is difficult  to see how surface-water is to gain access to the fused nucleus,
yet without water there can be no volcano.           More recent investigation on
 the part   of  mathematicians has been supposed to prove that the earth's
 crust is not thin.      Attaching little value to the calculations as to this
 based on precession, the author yet concludes, on other grounds, that the
 solid crust is probably of great thickness, and that, although there is
 evidence of a nucleus much hotter than the crust, there is no certainty
 that any part of it remains liquid ; but if so, it is in any case too deep to
 render it conceivable that surface-water should make its way down to it.
 The results of geological speculation and of physico-mathematical reason
 ing thus oppose each other, so that some source of volcanic heat closer to
 the surface remains to be sought.          The hypothesis to supply this, pro
 posed by Hopkins         and  adopted by some, viz. of isolated subterranean
 lakes of liquid matter in fusion at no great depth from the surface re
 maining fused for ages, surrounded by colder and solid rock, and with
 (by hypothesis)     access of surface-water, the author views   as feeble  and un
 sustainable.
    A  source, then, for volcanic heat remains still to be found    ;  and if found
under conditions       admitting to it water, especially of the sea, all known
phenomena       of volcanic  action on our earth's surface are explicable.
    The author points out various relations and points of connexion between
 volcanic phenomena, seismic phenomena, and the lines of mountain ele
vation, which sufficiently indicate that they are all due to the play of one
 set of cosmical forces, though different in degree of energy, which has
been constantly decaying with time.
    He traces the ways in which the contraction of our globe has been met,
from the period of its original fluidity to the present state : first, by de
formation of the spheroid, forming generally the ocean-basins and the
land ; afterwards by the foldings over and elevations of the thickened crust
into mountain-ranges &c. ; and, lastly, by the mechanism, which he points
out as giving rise to volcanic action.         The theory of mountain-elevation
proposed by C. Prevost was the only true one — that which ascribes this to
tangential pressures propagated through a solid crust of sufficient thick
ness to transmit them, those pressures being produced by the relative rate
of contraction of the nucleus and of the crust         ; the former being at the
higher temperature, and having a higher coefficient of contraction for equal
loss of heat, tends to shrink away from beneath the crust, leaving the latter
partially unsupported.        This, which during    a much   more    rapid  rate  of

440                  Mr. R. Mallet   on   Volcanic Energy.          [June 20,
cooling from higher temperature of the whole globe and from a thinner
crust gave rise in former epochs to mountain-elevation,       in the present
state of things gives rise to volcanic heat. By the application of a theorem
of Lagrange, the author proves that the earth's solid crust, however great
may be its thickness, and even if of materials far more cohesive and rigid
than those of which we must suppose it to consist, must, if even to a very
small extent left unsupported by the shrinking away of the nucleus, crush
up in places by its own gravity and by the attraction of the nucleus.
   This is actually going on, and in this partial crushing, at places or depths
dependent on the material,       and on conditionspointed out, the author
discovers the true cause of volcanic heat. As the solid crust sinks together
to follow down after the shrinking nucleus, the work expended in mutual
crushing and dislocation of its parts is transformed into heat, by which, at
the places where the crushing sufficiently takes place, the material of the
rock so crushed and of that adjacent to it are heated, even to fusion.  The
access   of water   to suchpoints determines volcanic eruption.    Volcanic
heat, therefore, is one result of the secular cooling of a teraqueous globe
subject to gravitation, and needs no strange or gratuitous hypothesis as
to its origin.
  In order to test the validity of this view by contact with known facts, the
author gives in detail two important series of experiments completed by
him : — the one on the actual amount of heat capable of being developed
by the crushing of sixteen different species of rocks, chosen so as to be
representative of the whole series of known rock formations from Oolites
down to the hardest crystalline rocks ; the other, on the coefficients of
total contraction between fusion and solidification at existing mean tem
perature of the atmosphere of basic and acid slags, analogous to melted
rocks.
  The latter experiments were conducted on a very large scale, and the
author points out the great errors of preceding experimenters, Bischoffand
 others, as to these coefficients.
   By the aid of these experimental data, he is enabled to     test the theory
 produced  when  compared with such facts as     we possess as   to the rate of
 present cooling of our globe, and the total annual amount of volcanic action
 taking place upon its surface and within its crust.
    He shows, by estimates which allow an ample margin to the best data
 we possess as to the total annual vulcanicity of all sorts of our globe at
 present, that less than one fourth of the total heat at present annually lost
 by our globe is upon his theory sufficient to account for it ; so that the
 secular cooling, small as it  is,
                                 now going on   is   sufficient primum mobile,
                                                     a
 leaving the greater portion still to be dissipated by radiation.   The author
 then brings his views into contact with various known facts of vnlcanology
 and seismology, showing their accordance.
   He also shows that to the heat developed          by
                                                    partial tangential thrusts

a thoroughly     saturated solution of zinc sulphate, the positive element con
sisting of pure zinc resting on the     paste. The best method of forming this ele
ment is to dissolve pure zinc sulphate to saturation in boiling distilled water.
When cool, the solution is poured off from the crystals and mixed to a thick
paste with pure mercurous sulphate, which is again boiled to drive off any air ;
this paste is then poured on to the surface of the mercury previously
heated in a suitable glass cell ; a piece of pure zinc is then suspended in
the paste, and the vessel may be advantageously sealed up with melted
paraffine-wax.       Contact with the mercury may be made by means of a
platinum wire passing down a glass tube, cemented to the inside of the cell,
and dipping below the surface of the mercury, or more conveniently by a
small external glass tube blown on to the cell, and opening into it close to
the bottom.        The mercurous sulphate (Hg2 S04) can be obtained com
mercially * ; but it may be prepared by dissolving pure mercury in excess
in hot sulphuric acid at a temperature below the boiling-point : the salt,
which is a nearly insoluble white powder, should be well washed in distilled
water, and care should be taken to obtain it free from the mercuric sulphate
(persulphate), the presence of which may be known by the salt turning
yellowish on the addition of water.
    The electromotive force of the elements thus               formed is remarkably
uniform    and    constant, provided the elements be not connected up and
allowed to become weak by working.               A long series of comparisons was
made between various elements,            some of which had been made many
months, and it was found that the greatest variation among them all did
not differ from the mean value            more than one thousandth part of the
whole electromotive force ; such a large difference was, however, very un
usual, and might have been due to slight differences of temperature.
    Several experiments were made to determine the variation of the electro
motive force produced by temperature, from the mean of which it appears
that the electromotive force decreases with increased temperature in the
ratio of about -06 per cent, for each degree Centigrade ; for example, an
element gave relative values of -9993 at 0° Cent, and -9412 at 100° C,
between which limits the decrease appeared nearly proportional to the in
crements of temperature.            These results, however, might be verified with
advantage.
    The element is not intended for the production of currents, for it falls
immediately in force if allowed to work on short circuit.             It is intended to
be used    only as a standard of electromotive force with which other ele
ments can be compared by the use of the electrometer cr condenser, or
other means not requiring the use of a prolonged current.                   The author
finds that the most delicate method of making              these  measurements is by
means of his potentiometerf.

448            On a Voltaic Standard       of Electromotive Force.        [June 20,
   The    uses  of this standard element      to practical   electricians  are suffi
ciently obvious.     It may be used for determining the electromotive force of
other elements by the use of an electrometer or by the discharge from a
Condenser.     Or  a condenser having a capacity     of ~7   farad charged by the
standard cell would contain the British-Association unit quantity of elec
tricity (one veber), or yj^y of the absolute unit of quantity.
   It is also of great value for maintaining a current of known strength in
any circuit for the purposes of experimental research.
                                   +S7   OHMS.
   Thus, if it be desired to produce in any circuit, a b, a current equal to
the British-Association current (yIs absolute unit), it is only necessary
to insert in the circuit a wire (R) having a resistance of l-457 ohm, and
to connect to each end of this wire the poles of a standard cell (c) with a
galvanometer (p), and to vary the strength of the current in a b until no
deflection is produced on the galvanometer ; the current through a b will
then be equal to one British-Association unit of current, or one veber per
second, whatever its length or resistance.
   By varying the resistance of R, or by varying the number of elements
(c), any given current can be steadily maintained through a £ at pleasure ;
on the other hand, the value of any given current can be measured by so
varying the resistance R that no deflection is produced              on the galva
nometer.      The value of the passing current will then be
                         C= —    -—

                                 IX
   It  is also evident that, knowing      the value of E, we may determine the
horizontal intensity of the earth's magnetism (H) in anyplace quickly and
simply by means of an ordinary sine or tangent galvanometer.
   In fact, the standard of electric potential is second only in importance
to that of, the standard of electric resistance  ; and the use of such a standard,
 combined with an auxiliary battery in the manner above described, admits
of a variety of applications which it is believed will be found of great
value in electrical research .

             Communicated by Prof. Stokes, Sec. R. S.                               Received May 29,
             1872.
      Pyrology, rs distinguished from ordinary blowpipe manipulation,
        1.
may be described as the art of inducing chemical changes in substances
from which their composition* can be concluded, by the scientific applica
tion to them of fire, and the use of acid as well as alkaline fluxes for pur
poses of solution and of separation.
   2. The term "Pyrocone" is used instead of that of "flame," em
ployed by writers on the blowpipe, which last expression is here only
applied to flames without a definite shape (vide paragraph 25), both
because           such a distinction         is evidently       a more correct phraseology, and
because  it prevents otherwise unavoidable confusion when both kinds of
fire are produced in the same operation.    For similar reasons the word
"   blowpipe," which                 and inexpressive appellation, equally
                                 seems a coarse
applicable to a pea-shooter and the tubes of an organ, will be relinquished
in these pages for the term " Pyrogene."
                                                 Pyrocones.
  3. Pyrocones are divided into two classes, (a) natural and (b) artificial ;
(a) is the shape candle and other flames assume in air when left to them-
selves       j    (6)                    (a) artificially as follows : —
                        is that formed by treating
  4. <Jn the application of a fine jet of air or breath, such as is impelled by
operators with the pyrogene, to one side of the base of the natural pyro
cone, the unburned gases in the centre are apparently expelled ; the
luminous            cone, unless the blast is too weak, entirely vanishes, and what
now appears is a long solid tongue of blue light, terminating in a point of
needle-like fineness with a violet-coloured cone enveloping the apex, and
extending, with a more obtuse termination beyond        to   distance com     it,       a
mensurate with the strength of the blast.
  5.         If
       we take the natural pyrocone afforded                        by
                                                ignited spirits or other light
hydrocarbon producer, and blow into the centre of   with mouth pyrogene, it         a
the jet of which  kept at some distance from one side of the cone, we ob
                            is
serve two           synaxial pyrocones formed              by   the blast, the bases of which are
contracted or enlarged proportionately with its strength or weakness.                              If
we approach the jet of the pyrogene so as to touch the side of the spirit-
lamp pyrocone, and blow with greater violence, the inner or blast cone be
comes invisible from the accelerated movement of the air      but we must               ;
analogically conclude that its basic diameter   contracted, and  its length
                                                                    is
extended proportionately                 with      those    changes      in the outer or visible
pyrocone.

tion.

be observed to be broken up by the blast at the under extremity, the sides
remaining intact, so that the form is now that of a hollow cylinder.
   7. Very different is the pyrocone produced by the attempt to blow into
the natural one afforded by the flame of ignited oil*, wax, coal-gas (not
previously mixed with air as in the Bunsen burner), or other dense hydro
carbon.   The blast cone no longer penetrates the blue flame, but moves
above          it,
           drawing out, as      were telescopically,

under its base, so that the two cones are no longer synaxial but conjunc
tive (fig. 1).
   8.       If
           we view this pyrocone from above, the diagram (fig.     some                       2)   is
thing like what we see. All ascending heat from the lamp       completely                is
stopped  whereas we could not view the spirit-pyrocone from alike position
                 ;
without burning the face, because in the first case the natural pyrocone isbent,
as   it    were, under the blast, but               in the     second merely bored      through by it.
      9.    It   will   be seen from fig.       2   that the hollow nucleus of the natural pyro
cone, which we have assumed to be filled with unburned gases,                          traversed
                                                                                             is
over its whole length by the blast cone from the jot, showing the wick of
the lamp underneath as     black band, the breadth of which

portional            to the diameter of the base of the blast cone, and therefore in
versely so to the strength of the blast, which, blowing in the short side a

the long axis of the oil- or gas-lamp artificial pyrocone, as       generally                is
assumed, and as              is
                    undoubtedly   the case with the spirit-cone, we could not

and oil-lamp pyrocones should possess different properties, and this   the                              is
fact.  The pyrogenical or artificial cone of the former cannot, or can but
feebly, attain the results produced    the latter. Filled with breath-vapour,

     13.  It follows also, from a consideration of fig. 2, and the facts detailed
in paragraph 9, that the central portion of the wick or fuel in ordinary
pyrological lamps is unutilized ; and in fact, if an oil-lamp be used, having
two thin wicks instead of one thick one, and these be slightly pressed apart
in the front (as at a, fig. 2), it will be found that a pyrocone of nearly
double power will be produced by a similar blast and expenditure of fuel*.
     14. Keeping the assumed fact of the superincumbency of a blast cone,
and the consequent solidity of the blue pyrocone underneath in remem
brance, we can readily understand that a roundish object placed in the
latter about the centre of its longitudinal axis, which has a diameter equal
 to or less than that of the pyrocone, will be wholly enveloped by the
ignited gas or gases of which the cone is composed, so as to form a kind of
 bulb or jacket round the front, i. e. that side towards the base of the py
 rocone whence the current proceeds.           The object is thus apparently pre
 served from communication,          not only with atmospheric oxygen, but with
 unignited gas of any kind.         Such an envelopment is termed
              The Hydrocarbonous       Pyrocone (Symbol      H. P.) (fig. 4).
      15. The behaviour of different substances when held steadily in the
 hydrocarbonous pyrocone causes it to be a synthetical and analytical agent
 of great value to the pyrologist.        Substances of a viscid nature (not salts),
 as phosphoric      or boric acid, become coated, after     a few minutes' insertion,
 with a shining lustrous film having an extraordinary resemblance to a
 metalf, which, when gold or silver oxides are previously dissolved in the
 bead, becomes tinged with yellow in the first case, and with a silvery shade
 in the second, much as alloys of those metals would.             This film evidently
 increases in thickness according to the length of time it is immersed in the
 hydrocarbonous        pyrocone, for after a short immersion the glass is still
 semitransparent ; but when held a longer time it becomes opaque.
      16. The film thus formed is very hard, being unsusceptible to the point
 of a penknife.       It has no taste, or, if any, that of a metal, while the taste
 of the oxidized phosphoric acid is sharp and acidulous. After the applica
 tion of the tongue, an iridescent tarnish is left like that of sulphur upon
  silver ; in fact none of these films will stand long exposure to a damp
 atmosphere.       They are so very thin and hard that it seems impossible to re
 move any portion from the glass (which remains vitreous in the inside) with
 the forceps, or even by breaking up the whole bead.
      17. Sulphur in the viscid or red and resinous state is also changed
  by this treatment to a metallic appearance on its outer surface ; but to pro
  duce this reaction, the pyrocone must be very perfect and of an unmodified
 blue colour, or the sulphur will be at once ignited and burn away.               When
     * Messrs. Price and Co. have
                                    manufactured, to the order of tho writer, pyrological
 caudles with a double wick on this principle.
     t These films are difficult to produce with coal-gas, on account of its general im
 purity.    Vide paragraph 4.

   once prepared in this way,          sulphur has no further tendency to burn, and
  it then has the remarkable property of giving, in a glass of phosphoric
   acid, reactions similar to those of copper, viz. green hot, and blue-green
  cold after treatment with a peroxidating pyrocone (to be hereafter de
   scribed)  ;  but green hot and cold after a reducing pyrocone has been ap
  plied*.      Ultramarine might        owe its blue colour to this fact.
      18. "When a roundish mass of silica or alumina, or of both combined, is
  held in the hydrocarbonous pyrocone, it becomes quite black ; and as this
  blackness is not merely on the surface, but throughout the mass, it would
  appear to be due to a decomposing                effect exerted by the latter upon the
  pyrocone itself, and not a mere deposition of soot, which might have been
  supposed to have been mechanically carried along by the blast upon its
  surface.     Alumina, however, appears to become partially fused, and thus
  forms into roundish          or botryoidal swellings, whiie silica presents a steel
  black mass to the lens with shining metallic-looking                points in it. These
  two omnipresent and almost universally combined earths, therefore, may
  be thus pretty correctly and extremely              rapidly distinguished  f.

      19.  Lime, strontia, and,       to  some     extent, baryta and magnesia are not
. thus carbonized by treatment with the hydrocarbonous pyrocone, and may
  therefore when pure, be easily thus distinguished from the two first-men
  tioned earths.         For lime, especially,      a quantitative  assay may be approxi
  mately made by slaking the mass thus treated in distilled water, when it
  will remain dark or grey or white, according as the lime exists in lesser or
  greater proportion.         Above 80 per cent, of lime will cause the mass to re
  main perfectly white. The oxide of iron does not interfere with this reaction.
      20. This property, which lime possesses, of remaining perfectly white
  and of resisting all tendency to reduction during such treatment, renders
  it an excellent medium for the detection of chlorides and fluorides, which
  seem to separate after a time from the lime, and to form some combination
  with the carbon of the pyrocone, the lime having no such tendency ; for
  instance, in chloride of calcium, after a few minutes of this treatment, a
  small black patch, round in proportion to the sphericity of the mass, is
  formed on the side next the current of blue flame, which can be easily seen
  through the       lens  to be not soot, and seems to have a sweet taste           ; but if
  such a mass be often quenched in distilled water, and as often re- treated in
  the hydrocarbonous pyrocone, the black patch will shortly assume a
  metallic and white appearance.
      21. Fluorides after the above            treatment exhibit     an irregularly shaped
  patch,   also    next   the   direction   of   the  hydrocarbonous    current ;  but this
  patch, instead of being black, has a changeable green colour like some of

the aniline compounds, and, after some quenching with water, a metallic
appearance, but still green.
    22.    A very curious result is obtained by the treatment of bicarbonate of
soda in the hydrocarbonous pyrocone.              After a short time violent ebulli
tion commences in the melted bead ; bubbles of some (carbonic acid ?) gas
are seen to rise with great rapidity through it while red-hot.              In this state
of violent ebullition, fragments        are projected from the mass, which,           when
examined through        a lens, are found to be black       hollow spheres like micro
scopic shells.      Notwithstanding the loss occasioned by the ejectment of
these projectiles, the mass, if now carefully examined by a lens, will be
found to consist partly of caustic soda, and partly of a black substance,
 solid and even angular and shining like a piece of coal. This substance
 is proved to be carbon by its deflagration when heated with nitre, and its
 formation is proved to be not due to a deposition of soot from the lamp-
 flame, by the fact that the similar treatment of chloride of sodium will pro
 duce no such result.
     23.   If any of the " earths " be held on platinum-wire after being made
 into a paste with a little distilled water in a hydrocarbonous pyrocone,
 those which carbonize in such a situation, as alumina and silica, being
 slightly heated in an oxidating pyrocone for a few seconds so as to just
 burn off the carbon, and if the mass be then saturated with cobalt solution,
 lime and strontia will immediately turn a distinct blue; and of these two, if
 allowed to remain exposed to the air for a time, the lime will slowly turn
 green, the strontia brown*. The previous addition or existence of iron sesqui-
 oxide will cause these to turn, instead of blue, green in the first instance.
 All the other earths, if pure and not in a chemically caustic state, become
 pink with cobalt solution ; and if then they are approached carefully to the
 natural pyrocone of a spirit-lamp, this pink colour deepens to a rich
 carminef. Of these earths, alumina and magnesia will (as is known), when
 treated with a peroxidizing pyrocone, change, the first to a deep blue, the
  second to a pale flesh or salmon-colour.           Silica in this case turns a distinct
 purple, even in presence of oxide of iron; lime, baryta, and strontia a grey
  or grey-black.     We thus obtain a nearly new chromatic series between the
  common " earths
                       " of considerable value in

of the most valuable qualitative indications of cobalt, due to the important
fact that lime and strontia are rendered caustic by much less heat than the
other " earths," and therefore dehydrate the cobalt solution after treat

that the ingenious blowpipe of Bunsen, by which the breath is forced into
a jet of ignited gas itself, is utterly useless for the purposes, and to produce
the results detailed in these pages. The pyrocone thus formed is indeed
the counterpart of that produced by blowing into the pyrocone of a spirit-

    30. These are invariably supported on platinum-wire in the admirable and
perfect manner invented by Gahn, and, as soon as a pyrocone is applied,
assume the form of a spheroidal bead, which revolves or spins round upon
its centre with a rapidity proportional to the fluidity of the matter of which
it is composed. The " glasses

dissolved in them, may be quantitatively determined, as to their weight and
size, by means to be presently described.
    31 . Berzelius informs us that
                                     " Cronstedt used but three reagents — basic
carbonate of soda, borate of soda, and the double salt of phosphate of soda
and ammonia. These reagents are still in use; and among the great number
of those which have been tried since that time, not one has been found to re
place either of these.     It is singular enough that in the very beginning of
the art, the very best reagents should have been hit upon." (Berzelius
on the Blowpipe, p. 32.)
    32. One of the objects of this paper is to attempt to show that the two
last fluxes mentioned in the above paragraph are not only not " the very
best reagents," but that they have, by the complicated and obscure results
 obtained necessarily from their compound nature, seriously retarded the
progress of pyrognostic examination.         For instance, speaking of the third
 flux mentioned, the metaphosphate of soda, produced from what is com
 monly called microcosmic salt, Berzelius says (p. 39), "its efficiency as a
 reagent depends principally on its free phosphoric acid ; and it is preferred
 to this because the phosphoric acid cannot be kept without deliquescing,
 while at the same time it is much dearer, and is also easily absorbed by the
 charcoal.    The salt of phosphorus shows, therefore, the action of an acid
 upon the substance to be tested."

    33. Now, if glacial phosphoric acid be heated until it melts into a sub-
 stance of viscid or gum-like appearance, and be thus poured hot into a wide-
 mouthed stoppered bottle (which should also be hot when receiving it), it
 can not only be kept without deliquescing, but, when solidified by cooling
 in the bottle, may be carried about in the pocket without fear, kept for
 years in the most rainy climate, and allowed to remain even for hours with
 the stopper of the bottle off. It has also the great advantage of being now-
 a-days far more easily procured pure enough for the purpose from most re
 spectable chemists even in out-of-the-way stations, as in India, in conse

qucnce of its use in therapeutics, than microcosmic salt can he. It is used
by simply dipping the red-hot platinum-wire loop and the glass, of whatever
description, formed upon it into the bottle, when a fresh supply of phos
phoric acid adheres to the hot bead, without the supply in the bottle being
at all adulterated.
    34. That the metaphosphate of soda does not, when heated, exert upon
substances    added to it the reactions of an acid, unless the basic soda be
displaced by another base for which the acid possesses a greater attraction,
must be evident to an ordinary chemist ; and there would appear to be few
substances     for which phosphoric acid has a greater attraction than it has
for   soda ; in fact, the most valuable pyrognostic reactions primtffacie of the
acid upon substances have been lost to operators precisely because the salt
it forms with soda fails to give us those acid reactions, as follows : — The
acid effervesces violently with all carbonates, and with some of the me' illic
oxides, the salt does nothing of the sort ; and the necessity felt by iiany
mineralogists and geologists of carrying about in their pockets a phial of the
unpleasant and dangerous hydrochloric or nitric acid is thus at once obviated.
    35. The acid used to dissolve cobalt oxide in any considerable proportion
is blue hot, but assumes on cooling a magnificent red-violet colour*, to which
the modern word        "             "  is partly applicable.      When soda or potash
                           magenta
is applied to this glass in sufficient proportion (about 17 percent.) to form
the metaphosphate of those bases, the glass remains blue, and a standard
of alkali for purposes of calculation is thus evidently obtained. But as
cobalt oxide produces with this flux many shades of colour according to the
quantity in which it is added, from a pale and scarcely perceptible pink to
the deep crimson- violet above mentioned, and as these degrees of red are
exactly azurizedt by a corresponding strength or quantity of the alkali
added, it is plain that a kind of chromatic scale or table of colours might
 thus be made, of great use in the quantitative measurement of alkalies on
the one hand, or of cobalt oxide on the other, instead of the unvarying
 "blue " which we find opposite oxide of cobalt in all blowpipe tables.
     36. Instead, therefore, of superfluously multiplying illustrations of the
 difference between the reactions of the pure acid used as a flux and of the
 assumed " free acid
                           " in microcosmic salt, it will be better to
                                                                               give here in
 slight detail some of the more important of the former with various

 appearance, which       the application of a    P. P. (as  at 3, fig.  1) will soon re
 move, the bead then appearing not merely diaphanous, but             highly refractive.
 If  this brilliant auriferous glass be now treated with a good H. P., the white
 metallic-looking film referred to in paragraph 15 is formed, with a slight
 but distinct shade of yellow like pinchbeck, which is apparently due to the
 gold in solution ; and this bead may thus be made alternately diaphanous
 and metallic-looking as often as is desired.
    38.   If  the auriferous transparent bead be carefully kept for some time
 about half an inch from the point of the whole pyrocone, or two inches from
the blue, as at 2, fig. 1, a beautiful shade of bluish rose-colour flushes over
it just   as it is becoming cold*; and the production of this tint, which cannot
 be confounded by the dullest         observer with the red violet of cobalt, or the
amethystine tinge      of  titanic  acid or manganese, is an excellent test of the
skill of the operator, as well as of the delicacy of the pyroconical reactions
in this flux, for a hair's breadth too far towards (3, fig. 1) will cause the
glass to be diaphanous and colourless on cooling ; while a corresponding
error in the other direction towards 1 will, as has been mentioned, produce
a muddy appearance.
    39. Gold-leaf is more rapidly dissolved, and the above reactions more
 easily produced in a glass of phosphate of lime, which appears to be, under
pyrological conditions, a more powerful solvent of metallic oxides than any
other known flux.         It  will be afterwards described ; but     it has the disad
vantage in analysis, referred to in paragraph 32, of being a salt.
    40. The ruby colour bestowed by gold upon glass and fluxes would
thus appear, by the experiment above detailed, to be due to an exact
amount of oxidation.          The oxides of tin and antimony, added with it to
colour glass    under  the   name   of " purple of Cassius " &c, seem not to have
any thing to do with the production of the colour f.

    4 1.  The most infinitesimal trace of the oxide, or of a salt of silver, added
to a bead of P, gives a copious yellow precipitate like cream, accompanied
at first, if the bead be held in a P. P., as at 2 or 3, fig. 1, by a very beau
tiful but very transient rose-colour.          This is such a delicate reaction for
silver, that it will be at once obtained from most galenas ; and although
thus a most important test qualitatively, is too fine to admit of being used
as a quantitative standard for the estimation of rich ores.
    42. There are two ways of effecting this. First, for an ore supposed to
contain only a small percentage of silver.             If the slightly argentiferous
glass   be  retained  in  the  position  3, fig. 1, the yellow precipitate soon dis
appears, and the glass becomes clear, highly refractive, and brilliant.              On

decidedly.

changing its position in the pyrocone to that of a, fig. 1, at present called
the " oxidizing flame," the yellow precipitate immediately and copiously
reappears ; but there is no visible mark or signification by which the
operator can thus judge of the quantity of silver oxide added.    When, how
ever, this amounts to 5 per cent. of the whole glass, and the latter, rendered
diaphanous by the first position, is suddenly and momentarily brought into
the second one indicated above, or, better, to just the tip of the blue, from
whence, however, it must be instantaneously removed, a very remarkable
and very beautiful appearance results.   It is that of an almost perfect imi
tation of a pearl, produced apparently by the reduction of the oxide near
the surface to the metallic state, while a vitreous glaze or gloss is still re
tained upon the surface.
   43. This, then, may be called the first standard of silver for ores con
taining that oxide up to 5 per cent., though of course it may be used for
richer ones ; but the following method is more rapid for a rich ore, pro
vided there are no chromatic oxides present to interfere with the clearness
of the glass.
    44. Second, for rich argentiferous ores.                            If
                                                  we continue adding oxide of
silver to a weighed P glass, and dissolving it carefully as at 3, fig. 1, we shall
find the glass remain diaphanous until 20 per cent. of the oxide has been
added, when the yellow creamy precipitate again begins to appear, causing,
for rich ores, 20 to be the standard of silver. Of course, in calculating
results from these
                         "   standards,"             the ratio deducible from them must be of
the inverse kind     ;      for instance,

                                              Sulphur.
   A7. If sulphur be added to a P bead as described in paragraph 45, and
then treated with a P. P., the curious result of chromatic reactions exactly
similar to those of copper, i. e. green hot and blue cold, is produced. The
addition of plumbic oxide heightens this effect ; and the resulting blue bead
is quite indistinguishable from a cupreous one placed alongside.
                                             Nitrogen.
   48. If a P bead be constantly dipped in the strongest possible solution
of ammonia or in concentrated nitric acid, and immersed as often in a H. P.,
as fig. 4, numerous black specks will be found on the surface like carbon,
but much more difficultly burned away.          After a time these appear to
combine with the metallic-looking film which is formed by the H. P., and
the substance is then by no means easily volatilized.      The glass thus im
pregnated  with  nitrogen will be  found to be clear hot, yellow and gelatinous
on cooling, therein exactly differing from those of the alkalies, the volatizable
oxides, and some of the earths, which are yellow hot and clear cold.

    49.   If   we add pure cupric oxide to a weighed                P   bead, and treat   it with
a P. P. (2, fig. 1), we find that it takes exactly 5 per cent. of the whole bead
to produce distinctly the peculiar blue of copper.      The glass must be care
fully held in the position indicated, as O. P. would leave it green * : 5 per
cent., then, may be taken to represent the standard of copper for quantita
tive measurements as described in paragraph 44 ; but in such cases as Cu
pyrites, where there is a chromatic interference of other oxides, something
more is necessary.
    50.   It
           requires one third more than the weight of a P glass in sulphur
to give it the cupreous blue appearance referred to in paragraph 47 ; that
is to say, a 50 mgrs. glass of P requires 75 mgrs. of flour sulphur added by
degrees for that purpose.     But it is found that by treatment in H. P. the
flour sulphur, when it assumes the metallic appearance referred to in para
graph 1 7, is reduced to one fifth of its bulk ; so that 75 mgrs. of flour sulphur
only represent 1 5 mgrs. of the allotropic sulphur, and 1 5, therefore, is taken
as the standard of sulphur.      It has also been ascertained that 16 mgrs. per
cent. of oxide  of copper, when    added to this sulphurous P bead, cause it to
remain green even after a P. P., probably on account of the disposal by the
sulphur of the superfluous oxygen ; 16, therefore, is taken as the equivalent
standard of copper to sulphur.       If we now add oxide of lead to the green
cupreo-sulphurous      P bead       thus produced, we shall find that, on the addition
of 24 mgrs. per cent. the glass will again appear blue ; 24, therefore, is
taken as the equivalent standard of PbO to sulphur.

    This  is not very wide    of the actual composition of Cu pyrites as decided
by chemical analysis, which is sulphur 34'9, copper 34-6, iron 30-5.                    The
specimen treated was a rich one from Freiberg in Saxony *.
     52. With rich ores, as the red oxide, the method (paragraph 49) is so
delicate, that an assay roasted through platinum foil gave 4 mgrs. more in
the hundred than it did unroasted. The best and safest plan is to have an
azure P glass coloured with 5 per cent of CuO as a pattern, and place the
assay    alongside of it on a sheet of white paper.

will, after being held a considerable time as at 3, fig. 1 , show (apparently)
crystals, yellow with Ti, and white with Sn, produced in it. This result
cannot be effected with the mouth, but only with a table pyrogene f.

mineral thus : — " Every substance of an earthy or mineral nature, which
 melts with soda with effervescence into a transparent glass which remains
 transparent on cooling, is either silica or a silicate in which the oxygen of
 the silica is at least double the quantity of that of the base."                  This in
genious discovery, which is strictly correct in cases where               it is applicable,
 and in such cases, therefore, most useful, is unfortunately                inapplicable to
 those silicates in which the estimation of the silica is of the most impor
 tance.     The so-called " alkaline earths," especially Lime, will not permit
 silica, though combined in any proportion, to yield a bead with soda trans
 parent on cooling, and they seem also to prevent or cancel effervescence in
 the same.

 alumina and silica in various ways, one of which is referred to in paragragh
  18, which occupied the writer some years, the following plan, which ought
 from its simplicity to have suggested itself at first, has been followed with
 apparent success.
     Nearly every oxide or substance is more soluble pyrologically in P than
 alumina and silica, while alumina is far more soluble than silica is.                The
 "  alkaline    earths
                         "  are rapidly dissolved ; and lime especially is not only
 dissolved, but forms a salt, referred to in paragraph 39, which will dissolve
 almost any thing but silica*.
     56.  It  has been ascertained that alumina         will dissolve to the extent of
 20 per cent., and silica to that of only       6 per cent. in a B bead  ; and this result
is not materially modified by lime.             After those amounts respectively have
 been added, the undissolved          alumina appears as white roundish fragments,
like   pieces   of fat, the silica  as a semitransparent mass      like melting snow, so
that they are thus distinguished           without difficulty even in presence of lime
or the alkaline earths.
     Six per cent. is therefore taken as the standard of silica in quantitative
 calculations ; but as 20, that of alumina, is inconveniently large, it is better
 to employ as the flux a P bead half saturated with 10 per cent. of pure
alumina, and to make 10 the standard of that "earth."
     57. A P glass saturated with silicic acid still dissolves a little alumina,
but the converse is not the case ; it is best, therefore, to test qualitatively
for either earth with a P glass saturated with alumina.
                                  Boric Acid (Symbol B).
     58. Plattner and succeeding writers on the "blowpipe" made use of this
 substance for the purpose of separating metallic lead from copper in an
 alloy of the two by oxidizing the former, and therefore as a means of affi-
nage of the latter metal        f.   In this operation, B appears to absorb litharge
 precisely as bone-ash does        in cupellation ; but it acts at the same time as a
 kind of shield to protect the copper from oxidation.
     59. Berzelius employed B as a test of phosphoric             acid in phosphates by
 the insertion through the mass of a piece of pure iron wire, which is cor
 roded and fused if the phosphoric acid exists over 5 per cent. ; but this reac
tion, to be effectual, presupposes the perfect solution of the substance contain
ing the phosphate in B, which,              as will be seen, can be effected   with very
few oxides indeed.
     60.  In fact it   is precisely the  insolubility of almost all substances but the
alkalies in boric acid which gives it the extraordinary value it undoubtedly
possesses as an agent of separation ; and the following few examples will
not only clearly demonstrate this fact to the impartial chemist,                but show
    * Borax   dissolves silica pyrologically more completely than any known flux.     The

    61. If a good specimen of the mineral "cerite" be powdered and ap
 plied to a bead of B in an 0. P., the following phenomenon results.                 The
 substance appears to separate into three distinct parts :            —   (1) red-brown
 and resinous-looking round spots appear near, but not on the surface ; (2)
 other round spots, more bulky or puffed out, nearer the middle of the bead,
 of a pale buff colour ; (3) a slight milky turbidity through the bead, as
 though a finely divided precipitate were suspended throughout the whole
 mass.       If  what is sold or made by the chemists as " pure oxide of cerium
                                                                                        "
 (generally a nut-brown powder) be applied to a B bead in like manner,
 precisely the same triplicate        separation occurs, only the turbidity is very
 much less.
     62. These round spots are observed to be round through a lens when
 viewed in every direction ; they are therefore sphericles or globules*.
    After considerably long treatment with O. P. the smaller buff-coloured
 globules will be dissipated throughout the bead, causing more turbidity
 with a slight shade of buff in it ; but the red resinous globules remain un
 changed, appearing white-hot in the red-hot bead (from which it appears
 that their fusing-point is higher than that of B), and may be collected, from
 their superior specific gravity, at the bottom of the bead, by careful mani
 pulation with the point of the blue pyrocone, into one large globule.
     63. Professor Stokes has found that, by treating this B bead with dis
 tilled water, the general mass is dissolved while the contained globules
 remain intact, the most minute of which may be thus perfectly extracted.
 They may          be also  extracted more quickly, but with less precision, by
 wrapping the bead         when   quite cold in paper, and tapping it gently upon
 an anvil with a light hammer, when the matrix breaks away from the
 globules.        Added to a bead of P under O. P., the red globule first fuses
 to an intensely lemon-coloured mass on the surface, and then dissolves in
 the glass with effervescence, giving the reactions of eerie oxide.            These red
 eerie globules have been discovered by Professor Stokes to contain also
  oxide of didymium, the absorption-bands           of which, when spectroscopically
 examined, they show very distinctly.
     64.    It  is therefore assumed that the red balls are composed          of ceric +
  didymic oxides, and the buff-coloured ones of lanthanic oxide ; while the
 turbidity is proved beyond reasonable doubt to be caused by lime, which
 with baryta are the only substances, except phosphoric acid, capable of
 causing this opaline turbidity on first application to the         B  bead  f.   At any

rate, the so-called "pure oxide of cerium" is thus shown, by one simple
operation, to consist in reality of no less than four substances.
             Lime, Strontia, Baryta, Alumina, Silica, and Magnesia.
   65.   Of the alkaline earths, lime,            as above mentioned,   causes    immediate
turbidity over the whole bead, and when added in greater proportion, pro
duces round spots suspended in the turbid mass.  These spots are perfectly
clear and colourless like drops of limpid oil in milk.      When added in
very large proportion, the clear spots collect in one large one, which, if
still further addition of lime is made, absorbs the remainder of the turbid
part, leaving the whole bead beautifully clear and colourless.       The turbid
part, therefore, would appear to be an attempted solution of the lime by the
boric acid ; the clear part, a complete solution of the boric acid in the borate
of lime.
  06. Strontia forms large beautiful vitreous-looking globules, quite trans
parent and even refractive ; they have great specific gravity, and can be
easily aggregated at the bottom of the bead. Baryta affords sphericles like
fish-eyes, transparent at first, but soon becoming opaque.  Magnesia is not
at first acted on by B, but after a short O. P. resolves itself into opaque,
white, and compact sphericles like mininture snow-balls ; these, after
long O. P., and consequent exhaustion of B, are clarified and become
transparent, but are again rendered opaque by the addition of fresh B. It is
concluded        from this fact that these         contained balls have a fixed relative
proportion as regards quantity to the containing B.     Alumina and silica
remain as amorphous fragments, and do not congest into globules ; those
of the former are white and opaque like pieces of fat ; of the latter semi-
transparent.

   67. Soda, potash, and lithia appear to be the only substances which
dissolve completely in boric acid in any proportion, and hence the value of
the latter as a detective agent for them, and also as an alkalimeter                  ;   forif a
very small trace of soda or potash contained in a mineral or salt be applied

 latter, a fresh bead should be impregnated with a weighed portion of the
 substance, which should be dissolved as far as possible by an O. P. Then,
 the bead being rapidly removed from the point of the pyrocone, it should
 be blown into while red-hot with the jet of the pyrogene, which for that
 purpose should be advanced so as just to touch the ring of the platinum wire.
 If  the bead be not too cold, the result will be that the whole mass is blown
 out into a thin clear bubble or vesicle about seventy times its first size, thus
 presenting a very large surface of the dissolved substance to be operated on.
 This vesicle should then be held in the operator's open mouth and breathed
 upon for some time, when, if the alkali has contained even a trace of potash
 ( 1 per
          cent, of KO affords the reaction), the vesicle will immediately be
 come clouded over with a light blue film of the colour of a solution of quinine
 when held against the light.         If   only soda be present, the vesicle will
 remain clear but will begin to deliquesce.        Lithia affords a tarnish like that
 of breath on a pane of glass, and the vesicle does not deliquesce.
    69. This test for potash in presence of soda is so delicate that if two
 beads, even   of borax, one containing a trace of potash, be vesiculated and
allowed to remain in a moderately dry room for some time, the one con
taining the potash will in the course of a few hours cloud over, while the
 other will remain quite clear.
                    Determination     of Gaset by Veticulation.
    70.  The  B   vesicle by itself will cloud over after a few minutes, but the
appearance then is more white than blue; and if the clouded vesicle be
approached to the flame of a spirit-lamp, this white coating is not removed
until the flame almost touches it and shrivels the substance of the vesicle,
whereas in the case of the addition of a trace of potash, the cloud flies as
if by magic when the vesicle is even a considerable distance off.
    71.  The addition of chlorine to the      B  bead, made by dipping the bead
in strong hydrochloric       acid  and   treating  as in paragraph 48, apparently
causes the vesicle made therefrom to be still more sensitive to the action of
gases upon its surface.        It clouds over in common air almost the instant
it is   made.    If held over a solution of ammonia, this nubilescence is pre
vented, and the vesicle remains clear.         If  held in a noxious or putrescent
gas, creamy or brownish-white streaks are formed over the
                                                                      surface, which
is otherwise clear.     But the most characteristic reaction     is that afforded by
sulphuretted    hydrogen, in an atmosphere          of which this vesicle becomes
rapidly pitted with circular spots as though       it had suddenly taken smallpox.
These spots through a lens are observed to         be round radiated crystals, with
a yellowish tinge near the circumference.          After a short time, they rot into
holes.
    72. Another curious result of vesiculation is the crystallization of the
surface in a moderately damp atmosphere in the course of ten or twelve
hours.     Borax- vesicles show these best ; but the complicated nature of the
salts formed renders conclusions from their crystallization very uncertain.

Microscopically viewed, however, these crystals are very beautiful, especially
in polarized light ; and it seems at any rate certain that silica and the sili
cates thus treated invariably crystallize in most elegant and beautiful
arborescent appearances, the form taken by other salts being usually           that
of a disk, often of a leaf.
                      Cobalt, Copper, and Metallic Oxides.
    73. The behaviour of these in B has not yet been fully examined ; but
 iuch as have, promise results quite as interesting and important as those
which may be derived from that of the earths. For instance, when an ore
containing the oxides of cobalt and nickel, previously manipulated as in para
graph 90, is boracically treated as described in paragraph 61, the cobalt im
mediately congests into globules, which after O. P. appear blue-black, after
H . P. red-purple through a lens ; the nickel oxide, on the contrary, remains in
amorphous fragments, which are bright green after O. P., and have a metallic
lustre after H. P. Cupric oxide forms in O. P. balls of an indigo-blue colour,
not easily distinguishable at first from those of cobalt; but in H. P. the cu
preous globules immediately give out streaks of the red suboxide, which can
not be mistaken, though, of course, were further proof necessary, the addition
of 5 per cent, of soda would form a pink glass from the first, and a blue one
from the second.       Iron oxide remains in amorphous fragments of a black-
brown colour with a rusty halo or tinge round them, and is thus easily
 distinguished.    Oxide of Uranium forms a stringy black mass with a yel
lowish opacity round, which the addition of soda dissolves to a bright pea-
green bead.     Molybdic acid affords many curious and beautiful changes,
for a description of which there is not space.
                  Silver, Lead, and the Volatilizable Oxides.
    74. None of these      form either balls or fragments in boric acid, but
spread over the whole bead as a milky precipitate, that of silver having a
slight pinkish tinge. Nothing, therefore, can be easier than their separation
thus from those metallic oxides which form balls or fragments, as the former
of these can not only be collected or aggregated into one sphericle, but ex
tracted from thecold bead with thegreatest ease, as described in paragraphs.
It is obvious that this process would probably form an important method of
extracting silver from its ores with very little loss ; for the boric acid pro
tects oxides contained in it from the direct effect of an O. P., which dissi
pates pure silver unprotected to the extent of   10 per cent, in a very short time.
    75. Altogether, as a detective reagent, boric acid seems scarcely in
ferior even to phosphoric acid, while as a separating one it is quite un
surpassed.
    Many hypotheses of the formation of      these sphericles or balls have sug
gested   themselves to the writer,   but none with a sufficient weight of evi
dence in their favour to be stated here.      They may be due (a) to capillary
phenomena,    (J) to the retention of a certain amount of carbonic acid      (forof

the "earths
               " it  is evidently only those forming carbonates which produce
 them), or (c) to some law or principle as yet not fully known.
    76. A bead of pure boric acid is evidently more fluid in II. P. than in
O. P., and the hydrated appearance of cobaltine balls in the former (para
graph 73) would seem to suggest the setting free of some constitutional
water (?)

   77. This is a useful flux for purposes of mere solution, as referred to in
paragraph 39. A curious phenomenon results from the application to the
hot glass, containing      a metallic  oxide in solution, of carbonate of soda,
which, instead of fusing in the glass under O. P.,      does so by itself at first,
apparently drawing or precipitating the metallic oxide to itself.        If a hot
glass of phosphoric acid be applied to warm calcined lime, the mixture
takes fire and burns with a very pretty pale yellow light, phosphate of lime
being formed.       This flux has been little investigated for pyrological pur
poses, having been thus first used by the writer.

   78. For this purpose it is evident that the glass must not only    be weighed
but measured     ; for, as both phosphoric      and boric acids lose weight and
substance in direct proportion after a strong O. P., some means of measuring
the diameter of the bead, and of thus keeping it up to the mark, is required.
Sufficient accuracy for this purpose seems to be afforded by a simple instru-

 exactly covers a 50-mgr. bead of phosphoric acid. The graduations on
the outside of the tube are for the purpose of showing the length of the

weight, the thickness or diameter being the same.

corresponding to the size of glass required. It is a pair of common cage-
maker's pliers with round but tapering legs ; only the right (or left) leg
should be graduated and figured, say, in tenths of an inch, to show the

however, is to be understood as at all dispensing with the use of the assay
balance, of which a beautifully portable description is now made cheaply

plied as part of all pyrological apparatus, to be found in most chemical
works, are manifold    and almost amusing.      It would be better, if these
directions are to be followed, to have no platinum foil at all than to have it
and not use it; but in practice it will be found that there are comparatively
few substances which injure platinum foil when heated through               it,

    82. It will be found that only a certain and normal, not an uncertain
and irregular degree of heat can thus be applied to substances which under
pyrological conditions combine with oxygen or are reduced to the metallic
state ; and therefore that oxidation on the one hand is as exactly regu
lated as though it had been controlled by a balance, and that reduction
on the other hand need not be feared, except in the case of the very fusible
metals, as antimony or lead.          For instance, copper pyrites roasted in this
way will be found to lose exactly 1 7 per cent. and no more, however long or
 strongly the pyrocone has been applied.           The same amount of sulphur is
 thus driven off from     " copper glance;" and there can therefore be little rea
sonable doubt that        17  per cent. is the extent to which sulphur may be
 dissipated from copper ores without fusing both together.
                                      Sublimation.
     83. This is better performed on such a platinum tray held by steel-legged
 forceps than in the ordinary manner on charcoal or in a glass tube.               By
 mixing a little common rust or lime with arsenic or antimony, the most
 timid operator     need not fear injury to his platinum, which, however, it is far
 better to spoil than to lose a single valuable reaction. The addition of iron
 sesquioxide has another advantage ; for it will be observed that the anti-
 monial oxide mixed with it is deposited on the upper steel leg of the forceps
  unchanged as a white sublimate, but the arsenic oxide as an orange one,
 in consequence, it is presumed, of the ability of the latter to carry up a
  portion of the red iron oxide with it.       This would appear to afford a valu
 able distinction between these two metals in toxicological cases, which even
  Marsh's test does not give.
     84. If flour sulphur be treated in this way, and the upper leg of the
 forceps be sufficiently high to be out of its blue flame, for of course it ignites,
  the steel leg will not be found to have changed further than by being covered
  with a yellow varnish, which is apparently distilled sulphur; but if the leg
  be plunged warm into water, it will appear white from the number of
  bubbles caused by some chemical action upon it.               If instead of sulphur
  only,  a mixture   of sulphur  and  any inorganic   substance   containing nitrogen,
  as gunpowder (only of course, for this purpose, that must be well watered
 and ground       into a paste), be used, we shall find the forceps apparently
  unchanged ;    but after being plunged warm into water, the upper leg will
  come out perfectly black.        No bubbles will be observed through the lens,
 but the leg,    on drying,   will be found covered with rust.
     85.   This curious reaction is also produced when sulphur is thus subli
 mated in company with such minerals          as emit an empyreumatic or nauseous
 odour when heated in a matrass alone, as,        e. g., stinkstone.    Such minerals,
  dissolved in a     P glass, give also the nitrogenical reaction referred to in
  paragraph    48  ;  and one of such (a black mineral found at Mussoorie in

mates of metals by means of the different distances at which they are de
posited from the assay on charcoal, is apparently based on au error, as these
seem to be due chiefly to the violence or weakness, as the case may be,          of
the superposed blast (paragraph 7).        This may be proved by causing the
 sublimate of the same metal, as antimony, to be deposited at different dis*
tances, as shown in fig. 8 at c c e, through modified blowing.

stances which cannot be conveniently supported on platinum
wire, as metals or alloys, by which the defects of large pieces
of charcoal in breaking up and spreading out the pyrocone,
and in absorbing and wasting so large an amount of heat, may
be avoided.      This is by sawing charcoal paste (made of C
powder, flour, and water according to the directions given in
Plattner's work) into parallelograms about         l|  inch long by

three inches long, withstand the strongest heat of the pyrogene without
fusing as well as platinum does, over which the former metal possesses this
great advantage, viz. that many metals, as gold, silver, lead, &e., or their
alloys, may be fused upon it without the least fear of combination.
    It is thus possible to use this beautiful metal as a support upon which

    This memoir, which is intended       to be the first of three communications
as to the action   of electricity on  gases, is devoted to the consideration of
the changes produced by the action of electricity on oxygen gas as estimated
by the changes thus effected in its chemical properties.
    The memoir is divided into four sections.
    Section I. contains an account of the methods employed for generating,
 collecting, and preserving the electrized gas, and also of the measuring-
apparatus employed for estimating the changes in the volume of the
 electrized gas effected in the various experiments subsequently described.
    The gas, carefully dried, was submitted to the action of electricity by
causing a current of the gas to pass through the induction-tube of Siemens,
 the interior of which was filled with water or (where a low temperature
 was desired) with a saline solution.      The tube was placed in a glass cylin
 der containing water or a refrigerating-mixture.        The interior and exterior
 of the tube were respectively connected with the terminals of a powerful
 Ruhmkorff's coil. The electrized gas, after its passage through the in
 duction-tube, was collected, in a gas-holder of peculiar construction, over
 concentrated sulphuric acid.      It may be thus preserved for several hours
 without sensible variation in its properties.
    The principle employed for the measurement of the gas in which it was

 desired to estimate the changes in volume produced by the experiment, was
the principle of pipette-measurement which has been so successfully em
ployed by chemists for the measurement of liquids.                 In this way a con
siderable volume (say from 250 to 300 cub. centims.) may be measured with
facility and precision. A definite volume of gaswas thus always operated upon.
     The gaa having been measured in the pipette was drawn over by means
of   a mercurial    aspirator, an instrument which served the double purpose of
 an aspirator and measurimg•apparatus.               The principle of this aspirator was
 that originally employed in the apparatus of Regnault for measuring the
 volumes of gases, namely, the estimation of the pressure and temperature
 at which the gas occupied a known space, from which the volume of the
gas at standard temperature and pressure was calculated.                   By means of
this apparatus      a change in the volume       of the electrized  gas, to the extent of
about    1  part in 1000, could be accurately estimated; that is to say, after
the calibration of the apparatus, 1000 volumes of gas as measured in the
pipette were found to measure 1000*7 volumes in the aspirator.                     These
numbers represent the errors of the experiment, and any differences in the
volume of the gas beyond this limit must be considered to be due to the
 experiment to which the gas was submitted.               The pipette and the aspirator
were placed on a       table,  separated by    an  interval of about 8 or 1 0 inches.
    In  Section  II.  the results are given of passing the electrized gas through
 a solution of neutral iodide of potassium, also of heating the gas, of passing
the gas over metallic silver, copper, gold, aluminium, and binoxide of man
ganese,    and of the decomposition of a solution of binoxide of sodium effected
 by   the   passage of the gas, a quantitative estimation of the changes in
the volume of the gas and the oxidation effected being in all cases made.
    The precision attained in such experiments may be estimated by the re
sults of the measurement of the gas before and after its passage through a
solution of neutral iodide of potassiun.             As the mean of eight concordant
experiments,      100  cub. centims.   of gas,  as measured   in the pipette, were found
after the experiment to measure 99'93 cub. centims. in the aspirator.                 An
oxidation was     effected in  the solution  of  neutral iodide of potassium equivalent
to 3-77 cub. centims. of oxygen ; that is to say, 3'77 cub. centims. of oxygen
were thus removed from the gas without an appreciable variation in its vo
lume.      The volume of the gas thus absorbed by neutral iodide of potassium
was in subsequent experiments assumed as the unit to which other analo
gous variations were referred.
    When the electrized gas is passed through a solution of binoxide of
sodium, an increment occurs in the volume of the gas. Thus in two experi
ments     the   increment     in the volume of the gas, as estimated from the
difference of the volumes in the pipette and the aspirator, was 1*93, 1*99,
the "titre" of the gas (as just explained) being taken as 1 ; and the ratio
of the sum of the oxygen lost by the binoxide of sodium (as estimated by
titration of the solution of binoxide of sodium before and after the experi
ment with permanganic acid) and the titre of the gas to the titre of the gas

474     Sir B. C. Brodie on the Action of Electricity on Gases. [June 20,
was in the same experiments 2'06,            2- 1 7.   In two other experiments this
same    ratio was 2,00,       2-08  ;  the reaction being analogous to the decom
position of binoxide of sodium by ferrocyanide of potassium, and of binoxide
of hydrogen by permanganic acid, previously investigated by the author.
    Section   III.  comprises an account of the action of the electrized gas upon
a solution    of hydriodic acid, strongly alkaline hyposulphite of soda, poly-
sulphide    of sodium, and other substances.
    In the case of the passage of the gas through a solution of hydriodic acid,
the oxidation effected (after a certain degree of concentration of the acid
has been attained) is exactly twice the oxidation effected by the same gas
in a solution of the neutral iodide of potassium.                The mean of 33 such
experiments gave 1*99 as the amount of oxygen employed in the oxidation of
the hydriodic acid as compared with the " titre
                                                           " of the gas. The individual
experiments     exhibit   no  inconsiderable    differences   ; but the probable error of
the result, as estimated by the method of least squares, is 0-02 ; that is to say,
from these experiments alone, without introducing any hypothetical consider
ations whatever, it is an equal chance that the true value of the ratio sought
lies between the values 2*01 and 1*97.               The value indicated by chemical
theory is 2, with which theory, therefore, the experiments agree.
    The action of the gas upon a strongly alkaline solution of hyposulphite
of  soda   is precisely of the same character.           The volume of     gas was mea
sured before and after the experiment, and             a contraction was found to occur
equal in amount to the "titre" of the gas.                The   mean   of twenty-two ex
periments gave       1*03    as  the amount of this contraction.           The peculiar
oxidizing properties of the ozone are entirely destroyed by its passage
through the solution ; and it is to be inferred that while the diminution in
volume is equal to the "titre" of the gas, the oxidation effected iu this, as
in the previous case, is the same as that which would be effected by a volume
of oxygen equal to twice the "titre" of the gas.
   Experiments made with a solution of polysulphide of barium gave a
similar result.
    Section  IV.   comprises various experiments made with solutions of neutral
and slightly alkaline hyposulphite of soda, with oil of turpentine, and with
protochloride     of tin.
   The experiments with neutral and slightly alkaline hyposulphite of soda
were conducted precisely in the same manner as the experiments described
in Section III., with the strongly alkaline hyposulphite.               The result, how
ever, is very different, the contraction in this case being equal in amount
to twice the "titre" of the gas.           The mean of 17 experiments made with
the neutral hyposulphite gave 2*02 as the value of this contraction, and
the mean of 10 experiments made with the slightly alkaline hyposulphite
gave for it the same value.
   It is hence to be inferred        that the oxidation      effected in these cases    is
equal in amount to three times the oxidation effected by the same                  gas in
neutral iodide of potassium.

   Similar experiments made with oil of turpentine entirely confirmed the
view of Soret as to the amount of contraction which the gas undergoes
when acted upon by this substance, the mean of eight experiments giving
2-02 as the value of the contraction.
   The investigation of the effect due to the action of the electrized gas upou
protochloride of tin is attended with considerable difficulty, from the cir
cumstance that a solution of protochloride of tin is readily oxidized by the
action of pure oxygen.    The difficulty was met in two ways, both of which
led to, the same conclusion,        — namely, by applying       a correction for the    oxi
dation effected by the oxygen with which the ozone was associated, and by
using very dilute solutions of the protochloride of tin in which this oxi
dation is reduced to a minimum.     In two experiments conducted on the
latter principle, and in which the oxidation, as well as the contraction, was
experimentally determined, the value of the contraction was found to be
2-l9 and 2'33, while the oxidation in the two experiments respectively was
3-12 and 3-07.
   Using the notation employed by the author in a previous communication *
to the Royal Society, and putting £2 as the symbol of the unit (that is of
l'000cub. centim.at0°and 760 millims.) of oxygen, and putting [5] as the
symbol of that simple weight £ transferred to the oxidized substance in the
various oxidations effected by the ozone, and further assuming that ozone
is to be regarded as some denser form of oxygen, to the unit of which the
symbol £2+" (where n is a positive integer) is to be assigned, the result
of the total system of experiments of which the account is given iu this
memoir may be expressed, so far as regards the distribution of the matter
of the unit of the ozone, in the various reactions by the general equation
                          (p+q)l?+»=9l?+(p(2+n)+qn)                [«],
where   p,   q, n are positive integers.
   The investigation of the various hypotheses originating                in this equation
leads to the conclusion that the hypothesis that the unit of ozone is com
posed of three simple weights, I, and is to be symbolized as         both ne £3,   is
cessary and sufficient for the explanation of the total system of phenomena,
and that no other hypothesis of the order referred to              is   tenable.

I  collated all the information then extant, both from my own researches
and from those of others, introducing qualitative descriptions of an extended
series of the salts of the metal.        I propose in the present paper to lay
before the Royal Society the details and results of experiments which have
engrossed much of my spare time during the last eight years, and which
consist of very laborious researches     on the atomic weight of thallium.
                                   SECTION I.
             On   the Determination of Atomic Weights.
   In determining accurately the atomic weight of          a metal that stands so
high in the     scale as thallium,  difficulties  and sources of error which are
comparatively small with elements of low atomic weight are magnified to
serious proportions, and require more than ordinary care for their elimina
tion.    When so large a proportion of the compound under analysis or
synthesis consists of the body itself whose atomic weight is the one un
known quantity, it is evident that the almost unavoidable errors occasioned
by impurity in the materials employed, the losses incident to imperfect
manipulation, or the inaccuracies arising during the weighing from the
omission of the corrections required by temperature, pressure, &c, will all
find their way into the number which is finally considered to represent the
atomic weight of the metal.
   I have attempted two entirely different methods of arriving at the
atomic weight of thallium.          Had the results of these determinations
differed materially,   I should have extended the research to other methods ;
but as they so nearly agree, it appeared unnecessary to incur so great an
additional expenditure of time and material with no reasonable prospect
of getting any but confirmatory results.         The first method, and that which
I shall describe, consists in taking a known quantity of metallic thallium,
dissolving it in nitric acid, and weighing the nitrate of thallium produced.
   The second method consists in dissolving known quantities of sulphate
of thallium in water, and ascertaining how much nitrate of barium is
necessary to precipitate the sulphuric acid as sulphate of barium.
                                  SECTION II.
                            Apparatus employed.
    The absolute weight of any substance may be found from its apparent
weight in an atmosphere of 30 inches of mercury, and from its apparent
 weight under, say, 25 inches of mercury.            But the best weighings are
 undoubtedly one in air at ordinary pressure and temperature, and one in a

culty of working under such a difference of pressure between the atmo-
sphere of the balance and that surrounding it.
                                   The Balances.
    Two balances were used. That which I shall call the air-balance was
made by Messrs. Eeissler and Neu expressly for this work, and will clearly
indicate a difference of 0-0001 of a grain when loaded with 1000 grains in
each pan.
    The second balance, which I shall call the eaffuitm-balance, is almost a
duplicate of the first, of 14-inch beam, with agate knife-edges and planes,
made by (Ertling. It is enclosed in a cast-iron case connected with an air-
pump, and so arranged that I can readily weigh any substance in air of any
desired density, the rarefaction being measured by a barometer-gauge.
    At first it was attempted to put nearly the correct weight into the pan,
and then make the final adjustment by means of the rider.          It was, how
ever, soon found that a nearer approach to accuracy is to introduce a certain
weight, and then to alter the pressure of the air until the balance shows
equilibrium. Two weighings at different degrees of atmospheric pressure,
varying by a considerable interval, give data upon which to calculate what
 the weight would be in a perfect vacuum.
                                   The Weights.
     A set of weights as ordinarily supplied by even the best instrument'
 makers is never absolutely exact ; however carefully they may be adjusted,
 the pieces of metal which respectively represent 1000 grains, 100 grains,
  10 grains, &c. are only more or less approximations to the true weights.
 In most chemical analyses, the error arising from such inaccuracies in the
 weights used is so small in comparison to errors of manipulation, or to im
 perfections inherent in the chemical processes adopted, that it may gene
 rally  be disregarded ; but when the chemist has for his object the deter
 mination of an atomic weight, or is engaged in other researches demanding
 the highest refinement of accuracy which chemistry and physics can supply,
 then he is bound to neglect no correction which will increase the precision
  of the results.
     The weights   I employed were of platinum, made expressly for these in
 vestigations by    Messrs.  Johnson and Matthey. The platinum was quite
  pure ; it was fused, cast, and then well hammered.         The weights were
  adjusted by myself during May, June, July, and August 1864: they
  were first roughly adjusted, and then the specific gravity of each weight
  was taken.     The weights were heated to redness in a bath of magnesia pre
  vious to ascertaining     their specific gravity. The density of the larger
  weights was ascertained to the second place of decimals, and that of the
  smaller ones to the first place.    The following are the results of the final
  adjustment, the weight in vacuo being calculated by the formula: —

to   a decided red heat      in  a gas-flame.     Following the suggestion of Pro
fessor Stas,     I  have obviated this source of error by employing a bath of
pure magnesia ; and I find that the weight remains constant even at a nearly
white heat. I have likewise employed baths of lime with similar satisfac
tory results.
    The special apparatus that I have used are described in the processes in
which they were required ; I need scarcely say that in no case were materials
of untried purity employed.

    Before detailing the processes of the determination, it will be requisite to
describe the means of producing a vacuum in the flasks and bulbs em
ployed.       In proceeding with the determinations, several additions and
improvements have been made to the Sprengel pump as generally found in
the laboratory.         The apparatus, as thus arranged, is readily manageable,

    The detail of the     processes   of preparing the thallium and the reagents in
a chemically      pure state   is too necessary to admit of useful abstraction.
                                       SECTION IV.
                              Processes and Results.
    The processes and manipulation necessary to the determination of an
atomic weight are at all times difficult and delicate, but especially in the case
of a metal such as thallium, so readily oxidizable.            This strong tendency to
combine with oxygen, renders the ordinarily exact processes of weighing out
pure metals inapplicable to the present purpose.                 The chances of contact
with the oxygen of the atmosphere must be reduced to a minimum, and to
this end jt was found desirable to work in vacuo. For this purpose the series
of bulbs shown in fig. 1 1 have been blown.               Pure thallium is introduced
into a, the upper end of which is then sealed.             The end c is also sealed up,
 and the horizontal tube e is connected to the Sprengel pump, and a
vacuum obtained, the tube being then sealed at/.                  The thallium in a is
now heated on a magnesia-bath to its point of fusion (561° F.), and when
molten caused, by gently tilting the vessel, to flow by the narrow channel
d into the lower bulb           b, all oxide remaining      in a.    The channel d is
now contracted before the blowpipe, and a removed.                      The bulbs then
appear     as  in  fig.  12,  and   after cooling  are   carefully  weighed in air and
in vacuo. The fine point of a blowpipe-flame, caused to impinge upon the
end of the tube at g, softens the glass, and the air, endeavouring to force

its way into the bulbs, forms a capillary orifice. By heating the bulb, aud
immersing the orifice in the pure nitric acid, the acid is introduced into
 the bulbs h and the globe b until all the thallium has been dissolved.
 The most tedious part of the process then commences, the evaporation of
 the excess of free acid. For this purpose an apparatus is used of the form
 represented in fig. 13: a is the apparatus, connected by a wide tube (A)
 and a narrower glass tube with a Woulfe's bottle (c) ; this is in connexion
 with a Bunsen's water-pump (d), having 15-feet fall of water, and capable
 of producing an exhaustion equal to 10 inches of mercury.     In the course
 of time the nitrate of thallium is left in the form of dry white crystals.
 The pump is theu stopped, and air allowed to enter the apparatus by
 opening the pinch-cock, e, connected with the chloride-of-calcium tubes,
f. The nitrate of thallium is then treated with a solution of oxalic acid
to reduce any pernitrate that may be formed, the crystals dried, fused,
dissolved in water, again allowed to crystallize, the evaporation of the
water being repeated under diminished pressure. When there is no longer
a loss of weight, the nitrate of thallium is finally weighed, the air being
exhausted from the apparatus.    The apparatus is now of the form shown
in fig. 14, and is weighed at two different atmospheric pressures.    The
nitrate of thallium having been afterwards removed, the apparatus is alone
weighed at two different pressures.          There have thus   been obtained   :   —

      The reduction of the atomic weight from           these data becomes       a case    of
  simple proportion ; but the values found are absolute in so far only as the
  atomic weights of nitrogen and oxygen are correct. The atomic weights of
  nitrogen and oxygen have been usually represented by the numbers 14 and
  16 ; but Professor Stas found these elements          represented, according to ob
  servation, by
              Oxygen (03)                                            = 47'880
              Nitrogen                                               = 14-009
 or nitric acid   N03=6P889.          According to the old equivalents, N06=62.
     Taking as data the series of weighings in vacuo, the quantity of nitric
 acid required to convert the thallium into nitrate is
                   (239-646066-183-790232=) 55-855834 grs.
     We  have,  then, with Professor Stas's determination of the atomic weights
 of nitrogen and oxygen, the following proportion            : —
         Weight of                Weight of             Atomic weight of Atomic weight
        nitric acid.              thallium.                  nitric acid.     of thallium.
        55-855834         :      183-790232          ::        61-889       :       *  ;
                        .-.  #=203-642.
     Let us see what would be the atomic weight of thallium if one or other
 of the corrections introduced into the above determinations had been
 omitted.     The use of the old equivalent (=62) for nitric acid, with the
 data derived from the weighings in vacuo, gives
               55-855834      :   183-790232        ::    62     :   204-007
 as the atomic weight       ; but I  cannot admit this number to be so nearly
 correct as 203-642.
     If we take the corrected weighings       in air of ordinary density, we have,
 with N0,=61-889,
                                         203-738.

    The error of the last deduction, +-523, is sufficiently large to show the
necessity of neglecting no precaution in chemical manipulation, especially
in a determination of this character. The largeness of these errors have an
immediate bearing upon quantitative analysis ; for they show that from
data ordinarily given, very varying results may be obtained.                    Chemists
have to deal with      much     smaller  quantities   than  a  quarter per cent., par
ticularly in organic analysis, where such a difference from the truth may
lead to very erroneous reasoning.

     I   wish it to be noted that              I have   made determinations          with various
 weights of thallium. In ordinary analysis chemists are satisfied to take 5
 or 10 grains of the substance under investigation : here I have gone to the
 very highest weight that can be entrusted, with safety, to the balance.
 The lowest weight of thallium taken is 183-/90232 grains, the heaviest
 497'972995          grains, the remaining determinations varying between these
 limits.        It is hardly necessary to say that the purpose has been to eliminate
 the error arising from manipulation with small quantities, and to produce
 such variety in the results as renders the chances of coincidence of very
 small value.

weights of the elements are severally multiples of the atomic weight of
hydrogen — to be without the corroboration of experimental result.    This
view of the hypothesis  further borne out in the present investigation for
                               is                                                               ;
the number 203-642 cannot, within the limit of what has been shown to be
the probable error, by any liberty be made to follow the hypothesis.
Without doubt, when the atomic weights of all the metals are redetermined
according to the standard of recent scientific method,     will be found that
                                                                      it
there are more exceptions to the hypothesis than commonly considered.
Marignac gives, in his confirmatory discussion of Stag's experiments, and in
his own results with calcium (40'21), lanthanum (94-13), strontium (87-25),
analogous opposed evidence, as in the case of the weight found for
thallium.
I      have thus striven to eliminate all erroneous influence in the number                         I
submit to the Royal Society as the atomic weight of thallium and   shall         ;       I

    1.  Introductory.   — The   formation of the different spectra which one gas
is said to exhibit, when examined under different conditions, still remains
one of the most obscure points of spectrum analysis.                 In 1864, when
Plucker and Hittorf published their researches "On the Spectra of Ignited
Gases and Vapours, with especial regard to the different Spectra of the same
elementary gaseous substance"*, they drew attention to the close resem
blance in character of the band-spectra which certain metals yield at a
comparatively low temperature to the band-spectrum of nitrogen and sul
phur. Roscoe and Clifton, n their paper "On the effect of increased Tem
perature upon the nature of the Light emitted by the Vapour of certain
 Metals orMetallicCompounds"          t,  rendered it probable that the band-spectra
of the metals belonged really to the oxides. The two spectra of nitrogen
were not, however, examined from that point of view, but, on the contrary,
they were made the starting-point of new investigations by Wullner, who
 came to the conclusion that certain         gases   may give even more than two
 different spectra.       Angstrom J, expressing his doubts about the trust
worthiness of Wullner' s experiments, says in a note : "As regards the spectra
 which are usually attributed to nitrogen,         I mention here, as a general fact,
that it is my conviction that the fluted bands which are so characteristic of
the oxides of metals are never found in spectra of elementary gases."
    I  propose to show, in the present communication, (1) that pure nitrogen
gives only one spectrum ; (2) that this is the line-spectrum ; (3) that the
fluted spectrum of the first order is due to oxides of nitrogen, formed under
the influence of the electric spark.
    2. First experiment. — The first experiment which           I  made with respect
 to the spectrum of nitrogen, was a repetition of an experiment of Secchi,
who found that in different sections of the same tube three different
 spectra of nitrogen might be obtained.           A vacuum-tube was made exactly
 according to Secchi's description, filled with nitrogen and exhausted.              To
 my astonishmemt the tube showed, even in its widest parts, only a spectrum
 of lines.    No accurate measurements were taken at the time, but the spec
 trum was no doubt that of the second order described by Plucker.                 Sud
 denly,    and  while   I was  looking through the spectroscope, the spectrum
 changed, and the well-kuown fluted bands appeared.               The first spectrum
 could now easily be obtained by introducing a Leyden jar in the circuit.
 The spark very      soon ceased to pass, and it was then found that the tube
 was leaking.
     3. The behaviour of this tube at once suggested the idea that the pre
 sence of air was necessary for the formation of the fluted spectrum.              It is

1872.]                  Mr. A. Schuster on             the Spectrum       of Nitrogen.                       485
well known that the oxides of nitrogen are formed on passing the electric
spark through air, and the resemblance which this spectrum bears to
the spectra of the oxides of metals rendered this view probable. In order
to test    it,  a   series       of experiments        were made, showing that, —
   (a) Whenever the fluted spectrum appeared,      could be shown that    it
traces of oxygen were present                  ;
   (6) Whenever there was     certainty of no oxygen being present, the
                                               a
spectrum of the second order appeared under all pressures and in all tem
peratures.

in the vacuum-tube.     This proved in each case perfectly satisfactory  for                             ;
when every trace of oxygen had thus been absorbed, the line-spectrum alone
was invariably obtained*.

    5. Description of apparatus. — The tubes generally used had two pockets,
A   and B, into which small pieces of metallic sodium were introduced by
means   of the tubes C and D.      The tube C  was connected  with the receiver
containing the nitrogen, whilst the tube D was connected with the air-pump.
The nitrogen was generally prepared by the combustion of phosphorus in
air.   After a few hours' standing, when all the phosphoric acid formed had
been   absorbed,  the gas became quite clear and was ready for use.        This
mode of preparation, it is true, does not give the nitrogen very pure ; but
as my object was to get the nitrogen free from oxygen, and this was easily
obtained by means of the absorption by sodium, the method was found
sufficient.    Other modes of preparing the nitrogen were tried, such as
passing    air over red-hot copper or the decomposition of ammonia by
chlorine,   but the same results were invariably obtained.       The air-pump
used was that    of Carre's freezing-machine, with  which   pressures down to
2 millims. could be easily obtained.      When the pressure was measured, a
"f -shaped tube was employed, one side of which was connected with the
Geissler's tube, the other with the pump, while the mercury was drawn up
in the longer part of the tube ; its height was read off and compared with
a barometer.     I now pass to the description of the experiments.
    6. Method of experimenting . — When the air in the vacuum-tube had
been exhausted, the communication with the receiver containing the nitrogen
was opened, and the gas was allowed to pass through it for some time while
the pump was being worked.         The tubing connecting the tube with the
receiver was then clamped air-tight, and the tube was exhausted.
    The electric spark in passing through it exhibited a violet colour,     and
gave the spectrum of fluted bands     :
                            5129                4436
                            4981                4390

                            4556                 4237
    The sodium was next heated until it presented a clean metallic surface.
The light which the tube now emitted was bluish white, and much fainter
than before ; and the whole appearance of the spectrum had changed to
that of the second order with its characteristic green line.            It was,
however, found that the pressure in the tube had slightly increased, owing
most likely to the vapour of the sodium present ; and on bringing the
mercury to its former level, the spectrum became brighter, but remained
the same in character.      New nitrogen was then led into the tube, and after
exhaustion the old fluted spectrum again appeared ; this was, however, at
once changed into that of lines by heating the sodium.       This process was

 1872.]         Mr. A. Schuster     on the Spectrum     of Nitrogen.           487
 repeated several times in succession, but invariably with the same result.        I
 have in my possession two tubes sealed off under 2 millims. pressure, one
 without sodium, showing the fluted bands, the other containing sodium,
 showing the spectrum of lines. Two other tubes, sealed off under 1 5 millims.
 pressure, show the same thing.       I  have repeatedly convinced myself that,
 from the highest pressure under which the spark of the induction-coil passes
 to the lowest pressure which    I could obtain with an ordinary air-pump, pure
 nitrogen invariably gave    one and   the same line-spectrum.      Once, when     I
 intended to seal a tube off under higher pressures, it was found that the
 sodium was not sufficient to absorb all the oxygen present, so that a sort
 of mixture of the two spectra was seen.       Such a mixture was often observed
 by Plucker and Wullner at the point where one spectrum changed into
 the other; it is characterized by the green line of nitrogen and the fluted
 violet bands at the same time.
    The tube showing the mixture at       15  millims. pressure was gradually   ex
 hausted, but the spectrum remained exactly the same.           If the formation
 of the two spectra depends merely upon the pressure or temperature to
 which the gas is subjected, how can a mixture of the two spectra, indicating
 a state of transition, exist under so entirely different pressures and different
 temperature?
    In order to ascertain whether nitrogen even carefully prepared contains
 oxygen, a drop of a solution of iodide of potassium and starch was intro
 duced into the tube ; after the spark had passed for a few seconds only,
 the liquid was coloured blue — showing either the formation of oxides of
nitrogen or of ozone, but at any rate the presence of oxygen.
    7. Spectrum of oxides of nitrogen. — I tried to obtain the spectra of the
different oxides of nitrogen ; they all give the same fluted spectrum, and I
could get no information as to which particular oxide the fluted spectrum
is due : this is, however, easily understood if we remember that it is just as
difficult to prepare the oxides of nitrogen free from oxygen as pure nitrogen
itself;  so that the oxide giving    the spectrum in question will always be
formed.     I have,  however,  convinced myself that the absorption-bands of
nitrous acid gas are not coincident with the bright bands of the spectrum ;
and it is probable that the spectrum is due to nitric oxide, this being the
most stable of all the oxides of nitrogen.
    I may add that one of the tubes containing the sodium and showing the
lines one day cracked, and then at once showed the violet bands.              This
fact will not be easily explained by the assumption that the fluted spectrum
belongs to a lower pressure and lower temperature than the spectrum of
lines.
    I propose to subject the different spectra of the remaining       gases  to a
careful examination.
    The  above experiments were made       in the Physical Laboratory of Owens
College, Manchester ; and      I have to thank Professors Balfour Stewart and
Roscoe for many valuable suggestions.

       Paraffins."     By T. E. Thorpe and John Young, of the Ander-

                                    (Abstract.)
   The authors first refer to their preliminary communication read before the
Royal Society on March 9, 1871, in which they described the combined
effect of heat and pressure upon the solid paraffins.         They showed that
when these substances are exposed to a high temperature in a closed vessel,
they are almost completely resolved, with the evolution of but little gas, into
hydrocarbons which remain liquid at the ordinary temperature.              In the
present communication they describe how this transformation may be easily
effected   on the small    scale. A  few grams of ordinary paraffin are sealed
np in   a piece of strong combustion-tubing,    bent in the form of the letter Y ;
the tube is securely surrounded by strong wire gauze, and the limb con
taining the paraffin is gently heated along its entire length in a gas com
bustion-furnace.      If  the heat is properly regulated, the paraffin rapidly
distils over and solidifies in the cold portion of the tube.     The gas-flames
are then turned down, the tube reversed, and the paraffin again distilled.
After a very few repetitions of this process the paraffin acquires the con
sistency of butter, and the warmth of the hand is sufficient to liquefy it ;
and after about a dozen distillations, the greater portion of the substance re
mains permanently liquid.         It seems to be absolutely necessary that the
paraffin should thus be distilled over and condensed ; by merely heating it
in the tube in such a manner that the condensed vapours flow back again
upon the heated portion, the liquefaction is never accomplished.      It appears
that only paraffins boiling at an extremely high temperature, and those
usually solid under ordinary conditions, are thus susceptible of decomposi
tion. The readiness with which they yield liquid hydrocarbons appears to
depend upon the complexity of their constitution.
   The authors have not determined with certainty the limits of the decom
position, but they find that the mixed paraffin and define, boiling at about
255°, may be repeatedly distilled backwards and forwards in a sealed y-tube
without suffering the slightest change.
   The authors have repeated the process of conversion of solid paraffin into
liquid products upon a large scale, in the hope of obtaining an insight into
the constitution of the higher members of the C„H.,„+ 2 series of hydrocar
bons.     The paraffin employed was obtained from shale ; it melted at 46°,
and had a specific gravity (when solidified under pressure) of 0*906 at 13°.

    The action of bromine upon this body showed that it was a member
 of the C„H2,+ 2 series. Heated in a sealed tube in the manner above de
scribed, it was readily split up into liquid hydrocarbons, which were shown
 to be mixtures of hydrides and olefines.
    The four litres of liquid were submitted to a systematic fractional distil
lation over sodium ; the greater portion of the operation was effected in an
apparatus after Warren's design. The following fractions were thus isolated
(boiling-points uncorrected)        : —

    By  means   of bromine all     these fractions were shown to be mixtures   of hy
drides and olefines    ;  and an attempt was made in each to determine, by means
of this reagent, the relative quantities of the two series of hydrocarbons. The
method by which this was accomplished is detailed in the original memoir.
It  was shown that    in the lower fractions (up to 200°) the amount of hydride
was sensibly equal    to   that of the olefine. Thus the fraction boiling at 65-70°
was shown to be a mixture of hexane and hexylene in equal proportions ;
the fraction at 94-97° was also made up of heptane and heptylene in equi
valent   amounts.        In  the higher fractions, however, there is a decided
increase in the amount of the hydride present.
   After treatment with bromine the hydrides could be isolated in the pure
state.    The authors obtained : —

   They   have also prepared a few derivatives from the hydrides, and studied
the action of nitrogen tetroxide upon the mixture boiling at 122-125°.
   The mode of decomposition of the paraffins under the influence of heat
and pressure appears to be general for the higher terms of the series of
normal hydrocarbons.
    If the paraffins be represented constitutionally, by linking together the
carbon atoms in a single chain, the simultaneous formation of hydride and
define obviously arises from the loosening of the affinities of the CHa
groups.     Under the influence of heat, these groups become disassociated,
and recombine to form saturated hydrocarbons.          Assuming, for the sake of
simplicity, that this decomposition may occur so low down in the series as
in the case of butane, it might be thus represented      : —
                    HHHH                      II   H          HH

   The authors have but little direct evidence to offer as to the exact
manner of this decomposition — whether it is attended by the gradual
elimination of ethylene, a hydride containing a greater number of carbon
atoms being left behind, or whether the paraffin is at once split up into

hydride and olefine containing an equal number of carbon atoms as in the
above equation.      Neither supposition is exactly substantiated by experiment.
If  the action of heat gave rise to the former mode of decomposition, we
ought to obtain a larger quantity of ethylene after prolonged heating,
especially when the liquefied portion is rich in hydrocarbons of low mole
cular weight ; but it has already been pointed out that the process of
liquefaction is accompanied with the production of comparatively little gas.
On the other hand, an examination of the amounts of bromine required to
render the hydrocarbons boiling above 200° permanently red, shows that
the proportion of hydride to olefine in the several mixtures becomes gra
dually larger as the molecular weight increases.
   It  would doubtless have been interesting to have determined the relative
amounts of the twelve fractions isolated from the decomposed paraffin ; but
when    it is considered that their separation    was  only effected after several
thousand distillations,     it will be evident that the quantities obtained after
such prolonged treatment can afford no real indication of the amounts
present in the original liquid. It appears, however, that the amounts of
liquid boiling at 94-97° and 122-125° were but slightly, if at all, less than
the quantities boiling at 252-255° and 273-276°.

300 to 800 fathoms along the coast of Britain many species of all the
orders are enormously abundant, so much so as to give a very marked
character    to the fauna of that special zone.          Several of these species,

Parellii, D. & K., A. Andromeda, M. & T., and Euryale Linkii, M. & T.,
have been long known to inhabit the deep water of the British area, and
form part of a fauna which will be probably found to have a very wide lateral
extension at temperatures whose minimum ranges from 0° C. to + 2° C, a
fauna which crops up, as it were, within the ordinary limits of observation in
the seas of Scandinavia, and which has consequently been carefully studied
by the Scandinavian naturalists.
    Another group of      species,  including Tripylus fragilis, D. & K., Cteno-
discus crispatus, Retzius, Pteraster militaris, M. & T., Amphiura abyssi-
cola, Sars, Antedon Eschrichtii, O. F. Miiller, and several others, are members
of the same fauna described from localities in the seas of Scandinavia and
Greenland, but not hitherto known as British. A third section, consisting
of a number of undescribed Echinideans, Asterideans, and Ophiurideans,
may probably also belong to this fauna ; while a fourth group, likewise
undescribed, and including such forms as Porocidaris, Phormosoma, Cal-
veria, Pourtalesia, Neolampas,            Zoroaster, Ophiomusium, Pentacrinus,
Rhizocrinus, and Bathycrinus, would rather appear to be referable to a
special deep-sea fauna of which we as yet know only a few examples, and
with whose conditions and extension we are unacquainted.              This abyssal
fauna is of great interest, inasmuch as nearly all the hitherto discovered
forms referred to it show close relations to family types of Cretaceous or
early Tertiary age, and hitherto supposed to be extinct.
    Twenty-seven species of Echinidea were procured during the cruises of
 1868, 1869, and 1870, oif the coasts of Britain and Portugal, at depths
varying from 100 to 2435 fathoms.

                                Porocidaris, Desor.
    This genus  was established by Desor chiefly on a character which    I cannot
regard   as of great importance, and which is absent in the present species, a
row of small holes surrounding the tubercles of the primary spines in the
scrobicular arece.     From the description these holes seem to be nothing
more than complete perforations, owing to imperfect calcification, in the
position of the depressions which frequently occur in the scrobiculw of the
Cidaridie for the insertion of the muscles of the spines. Along with this cha
racter, however, there were some others of greater value, a very remarkable
paddle-like form of the spines surrounding the mouth, and a tendency to
coalescence in the scrobicular areae.      These characters are well marked in
the species described.      This genus has hitherto only been found fossil —
a few detached plates and some of the characteristic spines in the Num-
mulitic bedsof Verona and Biarritz, and some spines referred to the genus, on
account of their having the same singular form, in the Lower Oolite of Frick.

    I think it due to the memory of the late Dr. S. P. Woodward to adopt
as the type   of this very distinct and remarkable family the genus Echino-
thuria, which he described with singular sagacity from one or two imperfect
specimens from the White Chalk. The Echinothuridae are regular urchins
with depressed tests, rendered perfectly flexible by the whole of the
plates, both ambulacral and interambulacral, being arranged in imbricating
rows, the interambulacral plates overlapping one another from the apex to
the mouth, and the ambulacral plates in the opposite direction. The margin
of the peristome is entire, and the peristomial membrane is covered with
imbricated scales, through which the ranges of double pores and ambulacral
 tubes are continued up to the edge of the mouth as in Cidaris.         The am
 bulacral plates are strap-shaped, and the pores trigeminal ; the two inner pairs
 of each arc pass through small accessory plates intercalated between the
 ambulacral plates, and the third pair, remote from the others, pass through
the end of the ambulacral plate.       The dental pyramid is broad and low, and
the teeth are simply grooved as in Cidaris. The two divisions of the tooth-
socket are not united by a closed arch ; the ambulacral tube-feet on the oral
surface are provided with suckers, while those on the apical surface are simple
and conical.

 distinct floscelle, with the anal opening at the bottom of a deep posterior
groove excavated in a kind of projecting rostellum, with narrow ambulacral
areae and a small compact group of apical plates, must be referred to the
 Cassidulidse ; but it differs from all known genera of the family, living or
extinct, in having no trace of a petaloid arrangement of the ambulacra,
which are reduced on the apical surface of the test to a single pore pene
 trating each ambulacral plate, and thus forming a double row of alternating
 simple pores for each ambulacral area.

  backward      into a long rostrum, on the upper surface of which, near its

merely shown that they have a somewhat greater range in depth than was

species (Cidaris papillata, Echinus elegant, E. noreegicus, E. raritpina, E.

doubtful exception of Echinus microstoma, have been observed in compara
tively shallow water off the coasts of Scandinavia.    Five species (Cidaris
affinis, Echinus melo, Toxopneustes brevispinosus, Psammechinus microtu-
berculatus, and Schizaster canaliferus) are recognized members of the Lu-
litanian and Mediterranean faunae, and seven (Porocidarispurpurata, Phor-
mosoma placenta, Calveria hystrix, C.fenestrata, Neolampas rostellatus,
Pourtalesia Jeffrey si, and P.phyale) are forms which have for the first time
been brought to light during the late deep-sea dredging operations, whether
on this or on the other side of the Atlantic : there seems little doubt that
these must be referred to the abyssal fauna, upon whose confines we are now
only beginning to encroach.    Three of the most remarkable generic forms,
Calveria, Neolampas, and Pourtalesia, have been found by Alexander Agassiz
among the results of the deep-dredging operations of Count Pourtales in
the Strait of Florida, showing a wide lateral distribution ; while even a
deeper interest attaches to the fact that while one family type, the Echi-
nothuridsc, has been hitherto known only in a fossil state, the entire
group find nearer allies in the extinct faunas of the Chalk or of the earlier
Tertiaries than in that of the present period.

  There    perhaps, no necessity to describe in detail the ordinary phe

nomena presented        by
                    supersaturated saline solutions, since they must now
be well known to all.
  The following       seriesof experiments have chiefly been made upon sodic
sulphate    ;   but before citing them,it may, however, not be out of place to
briefly allude, en passant, to the conclusions drawn      by
                                                      the numerous writers
and experimenters upon this subject, since the results of my own experi
ments are supported          by
                          the authority of some of these observers and run
counter to that of others.
   The theories which have been put forth are,        the main, as follows :—

mechanical agencies, such as agitation &c.       The principal supporter of
this view was Gny-Lussac, who wrote         in
                                             1819.      has since been shown

    After waiting some time to be certain that nuclei had not gained admit
tance, some of the alcohol was run out on to the surface of the solution by
momentarily loosening the stopper.
    This experiment   was repeated many times, at different temperatures and
with alcohol of various strengths, but never did the alcohol act as a nucleus.
    Previous to the experiment the alcohol had been boiled to destroy nuclei.
    Exp. Concentrated sulphuric acid was substituted for the alcohol, but
likewise with no result.     The smallest quantity of acid was added, so as to
prevent any undue rise in temperature, which would of course vitiate the
result.    The flask was likewise kept cold by a stream of water.
    In a later form of these experiments, a small glass bulb with a long neck
blown from glass tubing, such as is used in the elementary analysis of        a
fluid by combustion, was made use of.
    The bulb was first well heated in a Bunsen burner, so as to destroy any
nuclei which might adhere to it ; then, while still hot, the open end was
dipped into the alcohol or acid under trial, when, of course, as the air in the
bulb cooled some of the liquid was forced up into it ; its liquid contents
were then boiled and the open end again dipped into the fluid, and as the
vapour condensed more fluid was forced up into it.
    The tube was then surrounded by cotton-wool and inserted into the neck
of the flask, and the supersaturated solution boiled up for   a moment, so as
to render the whole apparatus, cotton-wool included, inactive, the steam
 escaping through the interstices of the cotton and not affecting the spirit.
When cold a drop of the spirit or acid was delivered by merely heating the
 glass bulb.
    Exp. Trial was next made of several solid dehydrating substances, such
 as calcic chloride, anhydrous   chromic acid, phosphoric anhydride, freshly
ignited quicklime, &c.
    These bodies were placed in sealed thin glass bulbs and heated nearly to
redness and then dropped into the supersaturated solution ; the flasks were
plugged with cotton-wool, through which a glass rod passed, and boiled
 up, after which they   were allowed to cool for some hours ; when quite cold
 the bulb was broken by means of the glass rod and its contents set free,
but, as in the case of the liquid, with no result.

  It should perhaps here be mentioned that each flask was always proved
to be thoroughly supersaturated by dropping in a crystal of the salt or
touching the solution with a dirty rod, after the substance made trial of
was found to be wanting in nuclear power.
   From the foregoing it appears that the crystallization of supersaturated
saline solutions is not determined by the removal of water by chemical
agency; neither do porous bodies, like wood, charcoal, sponge, spongy plati
num, earthenware, &c., determine the solidification of solutions by me
chanical absorption of the water.
                             Concerning the action   of thin films.
    In the       same     paper it is stated that while oils, fats, and greasy bodies
generally do not act as nuclei when chemically           clean and in the bulk, t. e.
in the form of a solid mass, lens, or drop, yet these identical bodies when
in the form of thin films do act as nuclei, and that any substance which
possesses       a nuclear action derived such power from having become
                                        has
contaminated with a thin film of greasy matter, which it acquires by hand
ling, wiping with a dirty cloth, or by mere exposure to the air containing
the products of respiration and other excretions, &c.
   Thus in the series of experiments detailed it was found that such bodies
as ether,        absolute    alcohol,
                             naphtha, turpentine, herring-oil, sperm-oil,
castor-oil, and many others, while in the form of a lens or globule, did not
act upon a supersaturated solution, but did immediately when spread out
into     a   thin film.
    It
     should be noticed that the oil was added to the solution by removing
the cover of the flask, delivering the drop, and then replacing the cover ;
or a glass tube was used provided with a shield covering the mouth of the
flask : both methods have the great objection of exposing the solution to
the air, and so allowing nuclei to gain access.
    It                           if
                        the finger be cleaned by washing it in alcohol or
             is stated that
caustic potash, or by passing it through the flame of a spirit-lamp, it may
be held in a supersaturated solution for some time without causing crys
          ; but that if it be rubbed against the sides of the flask, a greasy
tallization
smear is produced which at once acts.
   The writer has repeated this form of experiment several times, but never
with the above result when sufficient care had been taken to free the finger
from nuclei.
   Exp. The finger was made greasy by dipping it into oil and imperfectly
wiping it with a cloth ; it was then passed many times through the flame
of a spirit-lamp, and finally, while still far above its normal temperature,
inserted into a flask of supersaturated solution : the flask was chosen with
a neck such that it could be entirely closed by the thicker part of the
finger.    The flask was then transferred to a vessel of water, lowered arti
ficially to 38° F., and there kept, with the finger still in             it,
                                                                   for several
 minutes, varying           in   different experiments from 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35

minutes   ; and although the finger was strongly pressed against the sides
of the flask, which was seen to be smeared all over, yet crystallization was
not set up when the solution was made to flow over the finger-marks, which
were plainly visible.  That the solutions were not warmed by the heat of
the finger, and so rendered inactive, is proved by their immediately solidi
fying on the insertion of a dirty glass rod.
   Exp. By means of the two modifications of bulb-tube, as already de
scribed for the experiments with absolute alcohol, thin films of various oils
and other bodies were formed upon the surface of supersaturated solutions
without inducing crystallization.  That                       is,

                                ;
allowed to cool when quite cold
                    ;               drop of the liquid was forced out of the
                                                  a
bulb on to the  solution, then               by
                                   sudden jerk the lens or small globule
                                                  a
thus obtained was flattened out into                  a    thin film, often iridescent, but with
out causing solidification.
  In numerous instances the temperature of the solution was lowered by
means of ice-cold water, so as to increase its sensitiveness, but with no
different result.
   In many cases the oil or fatty body, such as olive-oil, Russian tallow,
citronella-oil, castor-oil, &c, was dissolved in ether and then used   this                      ;
device was used for two reasons: first, so that the greasy matter might be
much diluted and so spread over         large surface, and then be left as
                                                      a                                                   a
thin film on the evaporation of the ether and second, so that   ;     much                      a
smaller quantity of the oil might be delivered at     time.   Usually the oil
                                                                          a
collected into globules shortly after the evaporation of the ether, but could
generally be spread out into            a    film again       by    imparting     a   sharp twist to the
flask.
   Supersaturated solutions of sodic sulphate having films of oil, benzol,

stood for rather more than eighteen months.
   One explanation accounting for the activity of the thin film as prepared

air, thus affording an opportunity for nuclei to gain entrance   and also they          ;

probably float upon the surface of the disk or globules of oil, and would
not come into contact with the solution itself; neither might they touch
its surface even when the disk was broken up into small globules, for these
globules would be immensely large in comparison with the dimensions of
the nucleus itself; but, on the other hand, when the disk was flattened out
into an iridescent film, and therefore                      one    of   tenuity, the nuclei
                                                                           excessive

  That nuclei will           pass through     the substance of               a   thin film       is   shown    by   the
solidification which almost immediately takes place on exposing to air the
solution covered merely by    film of oil, turpentine, &c.

thin films were as follows — Citronella-oil,

  Concerning the action             of  a   crystal of       the normal sodic sulphate upon a
                              supersaturated        solution          of the     same.
   It     is   well known       that there are three modifications of sodic sulphate
crystals      : —
   1
   .   The anhydrous salt (Naa SO.,), crystallizing in octahedra, and depo
sited from supersaturated solution on further concentration
                   a                                           these crystals                    ;
are inactive to         a   supersaturated solution.
   2. The modified salt (Na2 S04, 7Ha O), containing 7H20, formed          a                                       in
supersaturated   solution by reduction of temperature and other causes these                                   ;
also are inactive, and admitted so by all.
   3. The normal salt (Na3 S04, 10H2 O), crystallizing in prisms with dihe
dral summits, and containing 10IIaO.     Usually regarded as the best nu
cleus.  Experiments relating to its behaviour as such will be detailed.
   It    always the normal salt (NaaS04, 10H2O) which
         is                                               formed when a                      is
solution     caused to crystallize
                is                  touching  with bydirty rod or by exit           a
posing     to the
              it  air, &c.
   Experiments           were made with recently generated crystals of the normal
salt.
   Exp. Two                     fully supersaturated solutions, were covered
                       beakers, containing
with watch-glasses, and allowed to cool in one of the beakers     ;     small                                 a
glass  bucket, attached to thread,  had
                                    a   been  placed and  boiled  up with the
solution.   Next, both beakers were arranged under large bell-jar, and the        a
silk thread from the bucket passed up between the stopper and the neck
of the jar. The solutions were then uncovered, after waiting ten minutes
for any nuclei which might have been disturbed to fall         fine wire was             ;   a
 passed        down into the beaker containing the bucket, and as far as possible

 from the part of the solution        through which it would pass on being
 drawn up.
    The bucket, now full of the crystallized normalsodic sulphate (Na2S04,
  1011,0), was raised, and lowered into the second beaker of still fluid solu
 tion ;  immediately that the point of one of the crystals hanging from the
under surface of the bucket touched the solution, crystallization was set up
instantaneously     throughout the mass.
    This experiment was performed many times, and with every possible
 care to prevent the entrance of nuclei other than those purposely borne by
 the wire.
    A modification of the above plan was tried and with similar results.
    Exp. A tubulated glass bell was fitted with a cork bearing two glass
 tubes, open below and closed above with cotton-wool ; they were bent so
 as to permit both of them being placed in one and the same beaker, or
 into either separately.
    In  the first place, the ends of the tubes inside the bell were freed from
 nuclei by passing them through a flame ; two beakers of cold supersatu
 rated solution were then placed in position under the bell-jar, and their
 covers removed.       After waiting five minutes or so for any dust to settle,
 both   tubes  were  next lowered into one of the beakers, on opposite sides,
 so as to be as far apart as possible.       A dirty wire was now passed down
 one of the tubes, when, of course, crystallization immediately took place,
 and was propagated across the beaker.         The second tube, with its adhe
 ring crystals, was then raised and lowered into the second beaker, when,
 the moment the extreme point of the longest crystal touched the surface
 of the solution, crystallization immediately started from that point, and
 the whole contents became solid.
    A. third variation was then made in this experiment.           One of the two
beakers was replaced by       a U-tube   of  thin, hard glass,  one of the before-
mentioned tubes being inserted into either limb.        Crystallization, when set
 up in one limb, travelled round the bend and up into the other, from which
 crystals were transferred,     as before, to a beaker or flask    of solution also
 under the bell-jar.
    The three modifications of this form of experiment were tried time after
time, and always with the same unvarying result.            Solutions which were
supersaturated     although not perfectly, and therefore less sensitive, were
operated upon in this way ; but, even with such less favourable circum
stances, the normal crystals always started crystallization in the solution
to which they were added.
    To ascertain, if possible, whether nuclei, other than crystals of the normal
salt, were carried by the tube or its adhering crystals, a capsule of sul
phuric acid was placed under the bell. The crust of crystals was by this
means dried, and became effloresced       to a greater or less extent.    Now, on
lowering them into a supersaturated        solution of alum or of magnesic sul

 504 Mr.          A. Livcrsidgc    on   Supersaturated Saline Solutions. [June SO,
 phate, they were proved to be inactive, having been changed to the inactive
 anhydrous salt.
     But such dried normal crystals         were active to a solution
                                                                  of sodic sulphate,
 even after three days' exposure to the       sulphuric acid*.   It seems as if the
 normal  crystals become          covered with a coating of effloresced anhydrous
salt which acts as a protection to the underneath portions, in the same
way as oxide of lead does to metallic lead ; hence it takes a long time to
convert a crystal of the normal salt into the anhydrous by simple
                                                                    exposure
to dry air, although it is an exceedingly short operation to perform at tem
peratures superior to 34° C.
   Yet another form of this experiment           was tried again and again, and
                                                                                always
with the same result.
   A glass tube bent into the form of            an elongated letter S was suspended
by a plug         of cotton-wool in the neck of
                                          a flask containing a supersaturated
solution   the solution was boiled, and the tube was also boiled in
              ;
                                                                         so as     it,
to get all nuclear particles adhering to         it
                                           thoroughly destroyed.
   The solution       was then allowed to cool, with the
                                                          still in
                                                         tube         the tube
                                                                            it ;
was then raised out  of the solution and dirty wire passed down'
                                                  a
                                                                         crys-   it;
talhzation was, of course, set up in the portion of
                                                     supersaturated solution
contained withm the tube the crystals
                                  ;
                                        gradually grew down the tube, then
through the first bend, travelled up the upright
                                                     portion, then travelled
round the second bend, and finally down the
                                              third and last straight portion.
Now, on lowering the extreme tip of the
                                          crystals formed at the end of the
tube mto the solution, crystallization was
                                           immediately               set up from      it   as   a
centre, and thence throughout the mass.
  By this arrangement access of extraneous nuclei was
                                                      entirely prevented.
The upper end of the tube was
                                plugged with cotton-wool until the dirty
 wire was passed down.
    That the normal crystals thus formed did not                   by
                                                     act    any transient mo-
 ccular movements, which recently formed
                                             crystals might be supposed to
have, is proved doubtless         by
                              the fact that such crystals were found to act
just as readily even when they had been
                                          kept over the solution for 24,   10,         5,
24, and 48 hours, and then lowered
                                       into the solution, and when any mo
lecular agitation may with fairness be
                                        supposed to have ceased.
 •
     At   a   future day
                       I   hope to have the results of more experiments
                                                                        upon this point.

 1872.]      Mr. A. Liversidge      on Supersaturated     Saline Solutions.      505
   Exp. Supersaturated solutions of common potash alum were treated in
the same way and      with the like results ; alum, perhaps, affords a prettier
example even than sodic sulphate, since the crystals formed in the tube
are of an opaque white, and can therefore be more readily observed during
their growth.
   Exp. Supersaturated solutions of magnesic sulphate were also operated
upon and with the same success ; but the experiment is not so striking,
owing to the much longer time required by magnesic sulphate to crystallize.
   Although pure clean crystals of the normal sodic sulphate are active to
a supersaturated solution     of sodic sulphate, yet, as might be expected, they
are not active to a similar solution      of alum or magnesic sulphate, and vice
versd.
   For example, let us take      a supersaturated    solution of alum, and one of
sodic sulphate, and also crystals of both their salts, which crystals have
just formed and are taken from their still warm mother-liquors.
   Exp. A crystal of alum from its mother-liquor was added to a super
saturated solution of alum.       Crystallization immediately took place.
   Exp.   A  like crystal  of alum   was then added to a supersaturated solution
of sodic sulphate.     No effect.
   Exp. A crystal    of  the normal salt was taken from its mother-liquor and
added to a solution of sodic sulphate.          The solution instantly crystallized,
although another crystal was inactive to a solution of alum.
   Exp. A crystal of magnesic sulphate was added to solutions of alum and
of sodic sulphate respectively.       No effect on either, but actire in a solu
tion of magnesic sulphate.
   Concerning the composition      of the crystals of sodic sulphate formed by
      spontaneous evaporation      of a supersaturated    solution  of the same.
   When    a supersaturated solution      of sodic sulphate is allowed  to evaporate
spontaneously, a crust or     ring of crystals forms    on the surface   of the solu
tion, or a  ring in the upper part of the vessel ;      these crystals are perfectly
inactive, as has long been      known   ;  and this has been accounted for by re
garding them as crystals of the modified salt (Naa S04, 7HaO), which is
non-nuclear : but recently they have been regarded as crystals of the normal
salt (NaaS04, 10HaO), and their want of action upon the supersaturated
solution   has been explained      by saying that, unlike crystals which have
been exposed to the air, they are chemically clean, and therefore free from
any film of greasy or other matter ; for this writer views the activity
shown by the normal salt as being entirely due to impurity of this kind,
and not as due to any property inherent in it.
    Lowel made analyses of this salt, formed by spontaneous evaporation,
 and found it to consist of the modified salt containing Naa S04, 7HaO.
    Faraday also examined it and came to much the same conclusion, only
that he gave it 8H,0, instead of 711,0. There is no doubt that Faraday

 506       Mr. A. Liversidge     on Supersaturated      Saline Solutions, [June 20,
 obtained this salt and not the normal with          1 0H2O,  although he made what
 has since been proved to be a mistake          in assigning 8H,0 to the modi6cd
 salt.
     The writer allowed       some   supersaturated solutions of sodic sulphate to
 evaporate spontaneously,       and  after several vain attempts at last succeeded
 in obtaining good crops of such crystals, without admixture of the normal
 salt, which, of course, is liable to crystallize out also on opening the receiver.
 The ring of crystals     at the top   of the solution only were taken.

    I   trust that by the above-mentioned results I have clearly proved the
following facts with respect to supersaturated solutions of sodic sulphate : —
     1. That liquids and solids, such as alcohol, quicklime, &c, do not de
termine crystallization by removing water.
    2. That thin films, when sufficient precautions are taken to guard against
the entrance of nuclei, do not act as nuclei.
    3. That chemically clean crystals of the normal salt            (NajSO,, 10HaO)
do act as nuclei and are most powerful.
    4 .  That crystals of the normal salt are not produced in supersaturated
solutions of sodic sulphate on allowing it to evaporate spontaneously, but
that crystals of the modified (and known inactive) salt are.
    In conclusion     I may perhaps be permitted to state that the above series
of experiments have extended over a period of three years, less a few
months, and that most of them have been repeated a countless number of

referred to again for the sake of comprehensiveness.
   At present the writer does not venture to put forth any definite theory
respecting the presence and nature of the nuclei which are so universally
diffused throughout the atmosphere ; but when it is considered how much
sodic chloride is constantly present in the air, and what quantities of sul
phurous acid are evolved daily, which becomes partly converted into sul
phuric acid, the presence of particles of sodic sulphate in the air would not
be surprising ; and that it does exist is proved by drawing air through, water
and finding comparatively large quantities in the solid matter arrested by
water.
   Sodic sulphate solutions, too, crystallize on exposure much more readily
than those of any other salt.    The other salts which form supersaturated
solutions are certainly less diffused than sodic sulphate.

                              Poisson showed that certain important for
mulae were true up to the third order inclusive of the standard small
quantity. The object of this note is to establish the truth of the formulae
for all orders of the small quantity.
     Suppose we require the value of the potential of a homogeneous
       1.
body at any assigned point.  Take a fixed origin inside the body ; let                                          r',
 0', denote the polar coordinates of any point of the body
        i//'                                                and let r,                     ;                0,   \j/
be the polar                coordinates of the assigned point and, as usual, put
                                                                             ;                             p'   for
cos 0', and            /x   for cos 0. The density may be denoted by unity.
     Then the potential                   V    is   given by the equation
                                          J
                                          J
                                          J                   V(r*+r"-2rr'A/
where

The integration must extend over the whole body.
       2. Suppose             that   r      is      greater    than   the    greatest value of     r ;      then
(ra-f-r'a—            2rr'X)_*           can be expanded         in   a   convergent    series   of powers of
-.          Thus, for example, let the body                     be an ellipsoid,       and take the centre
as the origin           ;    let a,       b,
                                          c   denote the semiaxes in descending order of mag
nitude.              Then,    ifr     is   greater than a, the expansion may be effected in the
manner just stated     and so    convenient expression may be obtained for

those which             make    r greater than              a.    It    is obvious   that there may be
external particles for which r is less than a ;                               and for these the process
cannot be considered satisfactory, since it involves the use of a divergent
series.
   3. Still it has been usual with writers on the Attraction of Spheroids
and the Figure of the Earth to leave this point unexamined.  They, in fact,
assume that   formula; which are demonstrated on a certain condition are
true, even when that condition                        does not hold           ;   so that, for example,            an
expression obtained strictly for the potential of an ellipsoid on an external
particle when r is greater than a, is assumed to be true for any external
particle.
   4. Poisson, however, has drawn attention to the difficulty; his discus
sion of it is the main part of his elaborate memoir
                                                    " Sur l'Attraction des

1829.            He shows that the ordinary formulie,                        although obtained in an
inadequate manner, are really true as far                              as the terms of the order u3 in-
c/itsive, where a is the well-known standard small quantity of such inves
tigations.          I
               propose to extend his process so as to show that the result is
true for all powers of a.
   It will be necessary to give some preliminary transformations                                        ;   this    I
shall do with brevity, referring to Poisson's memoir for detail.
      5.    It
        is convenient to separate Vinto two parts, one being the potential
of a sphere of radius r, and the other the potential of the excess of the
spheroid above the sphere ; the word excess is here used in an algebraical
sense, for the surface            of the spheroid is not necessarily all external to that
of the sphere.            Thus    we obtain

extend over so much of the surface of a sphere of radius unity as corre

form which        specially convenient for the case of an internal particle.
                  is
   It   will be sufficient for us to confine ourselves to the case of an external
particle, as the same process        is   readily applicable to the case of an internal
 particle.

I    am not certain whether Poisson himself had carried his investigation
beyond this point.                     In   the later part of his memoir he certainly implies

that results which partly depend on the present investigations are true for
all powers of «— r. It seems, therefore, curious that he did not here ex
plain how the terms which involve powers of z above the third vanish, so
as to make    (4) absolutely true.       To this   we now proceed.

      This Cave, or Tather     of enlarged fissures
                                   series            the Devonian Lime
                                                                   in
stone, was discovered in January 1858 whilst quarrying the rock on the
slope of the hill which rises above the small fishing town of Brixham,
near Torquay.     The owner of the quarry had the excavation carried
sufficiently far to show that the cave had several branches, and contained
bones both on the surface of the stalagmite and in the red loam beneath
it.     Mr. Pengelly visited the
                             cave soon after its discovery, and, believing
it likely to prove of much   interest, opened negotiations with the pro
prietor, with    view to secure the right of exploration.
                    a                                        There were,
however, obstncles which then prevented this object being carried into
execution.  Shortly afterwards the late Dr. Falconer, while on      visit to   a
Torquay, was informed of the discovery, and, after    careful inspection of
                                                                   a
the cave, he was so impressed with the opportunity here afforded of
working out completely     new and untouched bone-cavern, that on his
                                   a
return to London he addressed    letter to the Council of the Geological
                                            a
Society,      in which, afterreferring to the early researches on ossiferous
caves    by   Dr. Buckland, and the little progress the subject had made since
that period, notwithstanding its great interest on so many grounds, he urged
the importance of      thorough exploration of such
                          a                                 cave, and suggested
                                                                   a
that this was    case
                    a " deserving of combined effort among geologists to
                                                  a
organize operations for having     satisfactorily explored before mischief was
                                            it
done by   untutored  zeal and desultory work."
   Dr. Falconer further stated that, " from what he had already seen of the
cave, he was strongly of the conviction that, with our present advanced
knowledge, .the thorough investigation of           well-filled virgin cave in
                                                             a
England would materially aid in clearing up the mystery, either of the
contemporaneity of the Pliocene Mammalian Fauna with the commence
ment of the Postpliocene Fauna, or of the conditions and associations
under which the former was replaced by the latter."
   The Council of the Geological Society, not having at their disposal
funds for undertaking such   work, addressed
                                       a       letter to the President and
                                                             a
Council of the Royal Society,     whom       by
                                            grant of afil00 was promptly

made from the Donation Fund, on the understanding that any specimens
obtained should be eventually deposited in the British Museum.        This
sum was afterwards increased                by
                                the liberal donation of £bQ from Lady

 Arthlington,          Esq., and by a further grant of .£100 from the Donation
 Fund of the Royal Society.
   A Committee of the Geological    Society was thereupon appointed to
direct, and a local committee named to carry out the work of exploration.
It   is,   however, to        Mr. Pengelly that the Committee                    are   indebted for the
constant, close superintendence              of the work, and for the record of                      each
day's proceedings, — assistance without which                        it   would not have been pos
sible to have carried through this investigation.
   The work was commenced in July 185H, and was sufficiently advanced
by the following September to enable Dr. Falconer, Professor Ramsay, and
Mr. Pengelly           to report     highly satisfactory progress, and             to state that    " one
result of great interest had been brought out, namely, the superposition of
undoubted remains of the Reindeer above the so-called       Flint Knives,'             '
from which the inference arose                that the 'Reindeer'                continued    to be an
inhabitant of Britain after the appearance of man in this island.'
                                                                    "
   In November 1858,                 by

Survey, and these were completed         Mr. Bovey, of Brixham, at the con

   Brixham stands at the entrance of narrow valley which runs about three
                                                    a
miles inland.    The hills on either side consist of Devonian Limestone dip
ping northward, and rise to the heio-ht of from 70 to 90 feet, while higher
                                                                     1       1

running nearly magnetic north and south, and the other being at nearly
right angles to it. The several galleries of the cave were found to extend
135 feet from north to south, and 100 feet from east to west                           ;   and although
the passages          became     so contracted      at the end that           further progress was

was hoped, but for his untimely death, that the late Dr. Falconer would
have furnished the Society both with an account of the organic remains
and with the general report.     As                       is,

5] 6                 Abstract of Mr.    J. Prestwich's   Report on        [June 20,
In dealing with the theoretical questions connected with the subject, they
will    be restricted to those alone   which   are suggested by the local nature   of
the phenomena.
     The main gallery of the cavern was that which extended southwards
from the entrance for a distance of 135 feet, and was termed the Rein
 deer Gallery.        From the left of this, and at a short distance from the
 entrance, is a small inclined passage 40 feet long, and called the
                                                                              " Steep
 Slide Hole."       From the Reindeer Gallery further on branches on the right
 the Flint-knife Gallery, which runs westward, and terminates in the West
 Chamber, from which other short galleries, known as the Pen, Keeping's,
 and Mundy's galleries, proceed, and connected with them is the South
 Chamber.         These chnmbers were found to have three other external
 openings, which, like the original entrance from the road, had all become
 blocked up by fallen debris.
      When first opened, all the galleries and chambers were found to be more
  or less filled with the following deposits, in descending order :
                                                                        —
       1st. A layer of stalagmite, varying from a few inches to upwards           of a
             foot in thickness.
      2nd. Reddish cave-earth, with angular fragments and blocks             of lime
             stone in places, generally averaging from 2 to 4 feet.
       3rd. Water-worn shingle, 2 to 6 feet.
       In   addition   to these, a  thin layer of peaty or carbonaceous         matter
  extended on the cave-earth from near the entrance to a          distance of 40 feet,
  and was overlain part of the distance by a limestone breccia.
       The stalagmite was not of constant occurrence ; the Flint-knife Gallery
  was almost free of it.
        In places the galleries were completely choked up by the cave-earth
   rising to the ceiling, as in the West Chamber and part of the Flint-knife
   Gallery. A few pebbles, the same as those composiug the underlying
   shingle bed, were occasionally found in the cave•earth, together with
   fragments of stalagmite, — portions, apparently, of an old destroyed stalag
   mite floor.      These latter were extremely numerous in the West Chamber
   and adjacent part of the Flint-knife Gallery, and also in the Steep Slide
    Hole, where no stalagmite floor existed.
         The basement, or shingle bed, consisted of pebbles of limestone, quarU,
    greenstone, grit, and shale, all derived from rocks of the Brixham district.
    In one part of the Flint-knife Gallery the gravel rested on a continuous
    limestone floor, but elsewhere its base was not reached, the fissures con
    tracting to a wedge too narrow to allow of working them out to the bottom.
         The section of the Reindeer Gallery may be likened to the irregular
    figure    of  a skate,  with double pectoral fins — the shingle bed filling the
     space represented by the
                                 tail, or a little more, and the cave•earth extending
     usually about halfway up the body.            The pectoral fins represent the
     position of two sets of longitudinal grooves, which Mr. Pengelly states to
     extend the whole length of the cave, with a general slight dip in a given

direction    from the West Chamber,     and also from the main entrance to
the Steep Slide Hole.      Below this the limestone walls curve inwards, " but
instead of meeting to form a continuous floor, they remain separated by a
central longitudinal fissure, which varies from 3 to 18 inches in width,
tapering till the walls meet," and forming, as it were, the tail of the skate.
The dimensions and exact shape of all these parts vary considerably              ;   6   to
8 feet in width by 8 to 10 in height may, however, be taken as the average
dimensions of the galleries above the basal fissure.
   In addition to the existing stalagmite floor, remains of an older and
higher floor were found throughout part of the Reindeer Gallery, ex
tending in places horizontally from wall to wall, and varying from 6
inches to a foot in thickness.   Above the considerable openings which
occurred in      it,
               there was an open space of from       to   feet high.
                                                          1       5   In
places fragments  of limestone, of quartz, and of older stalagmite, both
angular and rounded, were attached to the underside of this stalagmite
ceiling.
    In that part of the Reindeer Gallery called the Crystal Gorge, there
was a    series of six or seven thin stained layers of stalagmite extending
from wall to wall, and separated      by
                                      layers of the cave-earth.
  A    few stalactites depended from       the roof of the Reindeer          and Pen
Galleries and the South Chamber.
  Mr. Pengelly found that the " dips of both the second and third beds
corresponded, in amount and direction, to that of the grooves in the same
branches of the cavern.  But between the eastern end of the Flint-knife
Gallery and the northern   end of the Crystal Gorge, the inclination of
these beds was southwards, that   from the former to the latter point."
                                    is
Mr. Pengelly also describes some variations in the deposits of the less
important part of the cavern, which do not, however, affect the general
persistence of the characters and structure above named.
   Organic Remains. — No shells were found in any of the beds but            ;           a
considerable number of existing land-shells, and one limpet-shell, were
found on the surface, and      a    few in the stalagmite.        They   were    most
numerous near the external entrances.
  Mammalian remains       were found sparingly in the stalagmite, in abund
ance in the  cave-earth,  and  rarely in the shingle.  Mr. Pengelly gives                a
complete   list of  every   find,  and  tabulates the result in     series of
                                                                         a
valuable tables, from which    itappears that in the stalagmite 25 bones
were  found,  in the  cave-earth  and on its surface 1589, and in the
shingle     7,
            making     total of 1621 bones.
                       a                            Of   these,   835 occurred in
the  Reindeer Gallery, 515 in the Flint-knife Gallery, 244 in the West
Chamber, and only 27 in the other parts of the cave.      great part of
                                                                  A
these were found at various depths of from to 101feet beneath the top of
the cave-earth   but
                  ;   considerable number were also found on the surface
                       a
of the cave-earth, generally where there was no stalagmite, especially in
the southern extremity of the Reindeer Gallery, and were the remains of

small rodents, no doubt of comparatively recent introduction.                  Omitting
these 519 specimens, the number of bones in the cave-earth is reduced to
1102.
     No coproliles were found in any part of the cave.
     The bones belong to 20 or 2 1 animals, referred by Dr. Falconer and Mr.
Busk to the following species : —
         1. Elephas primigenius.                11.   Ursus spelceus.

        10.  Hyeena spelcea.                    20. Sorex vulgaris.
     On  these   Mr. Busk makes the following remarks : —
     1. Remains      of the Mammoth occurred in five situations, viz. the
 Reindeer Gallery, the Flint-knife Gallery, the West Chamber, South
 Chamber, and Steep Slide Hole.             For the most part they appear to have
 lain at a considerable depth, and, with one or two exceptions, they were the
 only remains met with in the shingle bed.           On the whole, it would appear
 that these remains occupied the deepest levels in the cavern.
     The most remarkable specimens among these bones are an astragalus
  and the lower end of the corresponding tibia, which were found in close
  contiguity, and doubtless belonged to the same individual.             It is tolerably
  certain   that  they  had  been   introduced   into   the  cavern   whilst   still con
 nected by the soft parts.        The astragalus, which is nearly entire, is much
 gnawed on the        inner,  anterior,   and hinder aspects, and the portion of
  tibia is also gnawed on the same three sides, that upon which they lay
  presenting no marks of the Hyacna's teeth.           It is to be remarked that no
  fragments of the tusks or teeth of the mammoth were met with, whence it
  may perhaps be concluded that the remains discovered were                 merely    the
  relics of parts brought in by Carnivora for prey.
      2. The remains belonging to the Woolly Rhinoceros were rather nume
  rous, amounting to between sixty and seventy specimens : of these no less
  than forty-nine occurred in the "Reindeer" and "Flint-knife galleries;"
  they were usually met with at a considerable depth in the cave-earth.
   In the South Chamber, however, one specimen, most probably rhinoce-
  rine, though possibly elephantine, was found "in the stalagmite floor,"
  whilst other undoubted fragments occurred " immediately beneath it." A
  curious circumstance with respect to the rhinocerine remains consists in
  the numerous instances of the middle portion of the femur, or that part
  which includes the base of the third trochanter, which have been gnawed

1872.]                the Exploration     of Brixham   Cave.              519
by  Hyenas in almost exactly the same manner — a condition in which
Mr. Boyd Dawkins informs us numerous remains of the thigh-bone of
Rhinoceros were found in Wokey Hole.    Many of the rhinocerine bones,
however, presented no marks of gnawing or of being water-rolled.
  3. The equine remains include about thirty well-marked specimens,
indicating a species varying from 13 to 15 hands high, and indistinguish
able from the existing Horse.      They varied a good deal in external
characters, some appearing as ancient as those of the llvrena, whilst others
presented, like some of those of the Bear, a far more modern aspect.
  4, 5. The bovine remains are not very numerous, and, with the excep
tion of the teeth, most of them are very imperfect.      They occurred chiefly
in the Flint-knife Gallery and West Chamber.            From the size of the
bones and certain other characters, these bovine remains appear to have
belonged to more than one species, which may be provisionally regarded
as Bos primigenius and Bos taurus (var. longifrons).
   6. Not more than ten or eleven specimens certainly referable to Cervus
eluphus appear to have been met with, and these, with three exceptions,
lay at an average depth of between three and four feet in the cave -earth in
the Reindeer and Flint-knife Galleries.   The majority of the specimens
consisted of either the basal portion of shed      horns   or fragments (2)   of
round antlers.
  7. Next to those of the Bear, the remains of the Reindeer are by far the
most abundant of all others in the collection.      About seventy well-
characterized specimens have been determined.      They occurred in about
fifty different localities in the Reindeer and Flint-knife Galleries and in
the West Chamber      ;they occurred at a rather less depth iu the Reindeer
than in the Flint-knife Gallery, but in both localities generally at a depth
of little more than two or three feet in the cave-earth.   Several (five or six
out of thirty-five) were found lying on the surface or immediately beneath
it, some below and others either on or protruding through the stalagmite
floor.    Some are incrusted with thin, crystalline stalagmitic deposit. But
                                  a
it   is  curious circumstance that several among them, though met with in
           a
different parts of the cavern and at considerable distances apart, appear to
be parts of the skeleton of one and the same young animal.        Most of the
Reindeer bones, but not all, present marks of gnawing.
   8. The specimens of remains distinctly belonging to the Roebuck are not
more than ten or twelve    in   number.Some among them are gnawed, but
others not but they exhibit, perhaps more distinctly than any of the other
               ;
bones, indications of having lain long on the surface of the ground, and
exposed to atmospheric influence, before their introduction       into the
cavern.
      9.   The remains of the Cave Lion     are scanty in number,  but amply
sufficient to show that carnivora     formed part of the most ancient fauna of
the cavern.

    10.  Next below those of the Reindeer in frequency           are  the remains
 belonging to Hycena spelcea, amounting to about sixty in number; and
 they occurred in nearly equal proportions in three divisions of the cavern,
 their average depth in the cave-earth exceeding 3 feet.             No specimen
 seems to have occurred above the stalagmite floor, nor more than four or
 five on or very near the surface of the cave-earth.      Their general condition
betokens great antiquity, and very few among them exhibit any indication
 of gnawing, weathering, or rolling. Many among them are quite perfect,
and in all probability belong to one and the same animal.          The bones and
 teeth clearly indicate several individuals of all ages, from that at which the
 epiphyses of the femur and tibia were still ununited, up to one at which
the canine teeth were almost worn away ; but no certain trace of a foetal
 or very young Hyaena is perceptible.       All the teeth belong to the perma
 nent series.
     11, 12, 13.   Of all the animal remains discovered in the cavern, those
 belonging to the Bear are by far the most numerous, and in some respects,
 more especially with regard to their distribution, perhaps of the greatest
interest.
    In  the present, as in almost every instance of the occurrence of ursine
 remains   in caverns, the extreme variation in size and other characters of
 the different bones and teeth is so great, as naturally to lead to the belief
 that they must have belonged to more than one species.
    The number of specimens clearly determined is about 350 or 360, and
 to these, from among the less easily determined fragments, probably forty
or fifty more might be added. But,           in part explanation of this large
number, it should be remarked that          it includes several collections, each
 composed of numerous bones of the          skeletons of individuals of various
ages found lying together at the same       spot.
    Of the specimens enumerated above, about 1 1 6 occurred in the Reindeer
 Gallery, 214 in the Flint-knife Gallery, 26 in the West, and only 1 in
the South Chamber.
    Taking all the levels at which these remains were found, the mean
horizon of the genus Ursus appears to be about the same as that of the
Reindeer, and a few inches above that of the Hvaena.            It must also be
remarked that, as compared with the latter species, a much larger propor
tion of the ursine remains were found lying on or near the surface of the
second bed, or sometimes even imbedded in the stalagmite itself.          Another
remarkable     circumstance connected     with   the ursine  remains is the fre
quency with which bones, obviously belonging to one and the same
skeleton, were found      collected together in one spot ; and to this remark
it may be added that the great number of very young, or even foetal bones,
affords the strongest possible evidence that the Bear actually inhabited the
cavern.     The close investigation and comparison of the ursine bones and
teeth leaves little doubt that they represent the remains of three distinct

forms or species, viz. U. spelaus, V '. ferox fossilis* (U. prison, Goldf.),
and V. arctos, or the existing European and Asiatic Brown Bear : but the
evidence tending to show this would demand more space than can be given
to this abstract.
    14.     Strange to say, the genus Cards is represented only by the Fox,
no trace of the Wolf having occurred in the entire collection ; and of the
Fox not more than seven specimens were met with, five of which occurred
in the Reindeer Gallery, and all but               one on or near the surface         :  but in
no other respect is there the slightest                difference in the characters of the
bones and teeth.
     15-20.      Innumerable      bones of the Hare and Rabbit,             of different   sizes
and of all ages, occurred in the Reindeer and Flint-knife Galleries, and for
the most part on or near the surface of the third bed, or in the stalagmite
floor.       The only marked exceptions to this are in " find " No. 92, which
affords the tibia of a young Hare, found at a depth of three feet in the
Reindeer Gallery.
    The most interesting of all the rodent remains, however, is a fragment
of the skull, including, fortunately, the entire maxilla, with all the teeth
but one of Lagomys speleeus. It was found, together with numerous bones of
the Polecat, Hare, Rabbit, Water-Rat, Shrew, &c, in the Reindeer Gallery,
 1 10  feet from the      Dyer's Entrance, lying on the surface of the second bed.
It   differs in no respect, as regards condition or appearance, from the other
bones with         which it was associated, and, like most of them, is very
slightly dendritic.
    Traces      of Man. — Not       a single human bone has been found in Brixham
Cave     ;   but thirty-six rude flint implements and clips, referable in great
part, or wholly, to man's workmanship, were met with in different parts of
the cave ; of these, sixteen were found in the bed of shingle, at depths in
it of from          6  inches to      12 feet, or, including the overlying beds, of
from       6  to 18 feet     from the surface of the cave-floor.              Seventeen    were
found in the Reindeer Gallery, five in the Flint-knife Gallery, eleven in
the West Chamber, and three in other parts.                     In fourteen instances their
infraposition to bones of the Mammoth, Rhinoceros, Hyaena, Tiger, Bear,
Reindeer, Red Deer, Horse, and Ox is perfectly well proved, as many as
 120 of such bones having been discovered higher in the cave-earth over
where these flints were found.             One specimen in particular deserves notice ;
it is a roughly shaped          flint  hatchet,  broken in two, but the two halves not
worn, and their jagged edges fitting perfectly.                These two parts were found
buried in the cave-earth in distant parts of the cave, and it was not until
some time after their discovery that             Dr. Falconer detected their relation.
    The report then proceeds            to discuss the    origin of the   cave, and the mode
in which its contents were accumulated,                 considering    this to be a typical
 case for a large number           of ossiferous  caves.
    * It was    the specimens  from this cave that first led Mr. Busk to recognize this northern
American species amongst the ossiferous        cave-fauna of Europe.

               along  which the  galleries have been excavated by the
long-continued action of water.   Mr. Pengelly attributes the excava-
vation "to a stream of fresh water not subject to great floods, and
flowing constantly from the West Chamber through the Flint-knife and
Reindeer Galleries to the Steep Slide Hole." Mr. Bristow, on the other
hand, is inclined to attribute some portion of the formation of the cave to
marine action at a time when the land was lower.      The same causes are
supposed by these gentlemen to have led respectively in each case to the
accumulation of the bed of shingle ; and as no shells are found in   this                                it,

periods the cave was dry and at other periods flooded by fresh water, that
during the former intervals the cave was frequented          Hyaenas which                  by
brought     their prey to devour, and that with each successive inundation

successive collections of bones were covered up and imbedded in the

one spot, favourably        situated, a series of thin seams of stalagmite, contem
poraneous     with    the  cave-earth,   was met with.
    Although the evidence proves the contemporaneity of Man with the cave
animals, it is doubtful whether Brixham Cave was at that period ever
inhabited by man.           Caves have constantly been a place of resort for un
civilized man, either for shelter or for security.            When resorted to per
manently for these objects, traces of his habitation, in the form of refuse
(whether of bones cast away at meals, of broken and lost tools of daily use,
and, after the discovery of fire, of hearths and their surroundings), neces
sarily occur in quantities more or less abundant, according to the length of
man's habitation ; but no such evidence of his presence exists.                   It may
rather be supposed that the worked flints were lost or left behind by man
during occasional visits to the cave, either for the sake of temporary refuge,
or in following prey which may have sought shelter there.
    Looking     at all the phenomena of Brixham Cave, the conclusion your
reporter   has    arrived at is that the formation of the cave commenced and
was carried on simultaneously with the excavation of the valley — that the
small streams flowing down the upper tributary branches of the valley
entered the western openings of the cave and, traversing the fissures in the
limestone, escaped by lower openings in the chief valley, just as the Grotte
d' Arcy was formed by an overflow from the Cure taking a short cut through
the limestone hills, round which the river winds.              These tributary streams
brought    in  the   shingle   bed No.   3  which  fills the bottom   of the fissure. It
was only during occasional droughts, when the streams were dry, that the
cave seems to have been frequented by animals, their remains being very
scarce in that bed, while indications of man are comparatively numerous. As
the excavation of the valley proceeded, the level of the stream was lowered
 and became more restricted to the valley-channel.               The cave consequently
 became drier, and was more resorted to by predatory animals, who carried iu
their prey to devour, and was less frequented by man. At the same time,
 with the periodical floods which there is every reason to believe, from other
 investigations, were so great during the quaternary period, the cave would
 long continue to be subject to inundations, the muddy waters of which
 deposited the silt forming the cave-earth, burying progressively the bones
 left from   season     to season   by succeeding generations of beasts of prey.
 By the repetition at distant intervals of these inundations, and by the accu
 mulation during the intervening periods of fresh crops of bones, the bone-
bearing cave-earth was gradually formed. During this time the occasional
visits of man are indicated by the rare occurrence of a flint implement lost
 probably as he groped his way through the dark passages of the cave.                  As
the valley became deeper,         and  as, with the   change  of  climate  at the close of
 the quaternary period, the floods became less, so did the cave become drier
and more resorted to by animals.             At last it seems to have become a place
 of permanent resort for bears : their remains in all stages of growth, in
 cluding even sucking cubs, were met with in the upper part of the cave-earth,

524                     Abstract   of Report   on   Biixham Cave.     [June 20,
in greater numbers than were the bones of any other animal. These animals
 resorted especially to the darker and more secluded Flint-knife Gallery,
where 221 out of 366 of their determinable bones were found, whereas only
twenty-six were met with in the Reindeer Gallery.
   Finally,    as the cave   became   out of the reach of the flood waters, the
drippings from the roof, which up to this period had, with the single ex
ception before mentioned, been lost in the accumulating cave-earth or
deposited in thin calcareous incrustations on the exposed bones, now com
menced that deposit of stalagmite which sealed up and preserved undisturbed
the shingle and cave•earth deposited under former and different conditions.
The   cave, however, still continued to be the occasional resort of beasts of
prey ; for sparse remains of the Reindeer, together with those of the Bear
and Rhinoceros, were found in the stalagmite floor. After a time, the falling
in of the roof at places (and any earthquake movement may have detached
blocks from      and the external surface-weathering stopped up some parts
                it)
of the cave, and closed its entrances with an accumulation of debris.   From
that time it ceased to be  accessible, except to the smaller rodents and bur
rowing animals, and so remained unused and untrodden until its recent dis
covery and exploration.
  At this time     itnot necessary to contend for the correctness of many
                        is
of the early observations, so long contested,    evidence of the antiquity of

man   ;they  are too numerous   and too well attested to admit of doubt, and
are now generally accepted by geologists.     At the same time       itto be
                                                                          is
observed that the discovery and exploration of Brixham Cave have had           a
very important influence in bringing about such    result. a The discoveries
of Schmerling and others had dropped      into  oblivion,  the assertions of
M. Boucher                              until the certainty of the facts early
                 de Perthes were ignored,
 established in the exploration of Brixham Cave showed the strong prima,
facie evidence in proof of the contemporaneity of man and of the great
extinct mammalia, and at once led to the conclusive investigation of the
Somme valley. The evidence of Brixham further has its own special points
of value, — in the completeness of its record, the certainty of its data, and
                                                      in
in the fact of its having been the first ossiferous cavern worked out in a
systematic  and  complete manner, of which the record, plans, and sections
are complete, and of which every specimen        preserved, duly marked and
                                                      is
registered, so that   can
                        it at any time be assigned to its exact original place
in the cave.    This work, in fact,not only important as the first systematic

                         I. Duplication of the       Cube.
   Let A B be the given cube root.        Erect the perpendicular B K ; bisect
A B in C, and   with radius    C  B describe the arcs intersecting at E ; let fall
the perpendicular E D and trisect C D ; then, with radius B F from E as a
centre, describe the arc H I cutting BK in L ; join A L, which will be
nearly equal to the cube root of double the cube of A B, the amount of
error being very small, which is proved      as   under.
   Let AB = 3.     Then

    In and about   a given circle, as    A/E   e,  draw the inscribed and tangent
 squares in the manner indicated by the figure, with their diagonals.         Draw
 the diameter A E bisecting the opposite sides of the said squares ; bisect
 A B in C, and D E in F ; set off from E and D respectively E G and D              I
 equal to D F, E  F and join G I ; from E let fall E H perpendicular to G I,
 and with radius   E II describe the circle H K ; draw the line C L touching

the circle  H K, and cutting the circle      A/E      e   in   P ;  then through the   point
P, parallel    to  All,  draw    MN      terminating        in its intersections with    th3
 diagonals, as shown by the diagram, which will be one side of a square very
nearly equal to the circle AfEe.
    [The author has appended           a mathematical            calculation  proving,  in a
 somewhat    indirect  manner,    that  his construction         gives an exceedingly   close
 approximation.      The construction leads directly            to the following result : —
    Let the radius of the circle be taken as unity,              and let * be a side of the
 square given by the construction        ; then
                         s= V3 + 4w + 2m2—           m

 ing result  :—

    As it  was understood that the requirements         of the Public Service would
not permit the employment, during any part of the last year (1871), of
either the ' Porcupine or the ' Lightning,' for the continuation of the
                               '
Deep-sea Researches carried on by my Colleagues and myself in the three
preceding summers, it was not deemed advisable by us that the Council of
the Royal Society should be moved to make any application to the Ad
miralty in furtherance of this object. Early in June, however, I was in
                                                                        ' Shearwater,'
formed by the Hydrographer that as the Surveying-ship
under the command of Capt. Nares, was about to proceed to the Medi
terranean, and would not be required to enter on her work until the end of
October, an opportunity would present itself for making further researches
on the Gibraltar Current, in which, if so disposed,           I should have the ad
vantage of being associated with Capt. Nares ; whilst, if inclined to proceed
as far as Egypt, I might have an opportunity of prosecuting in the Eastern
basin of the Mediterranean some of the Physical and Biological researches
which I had carried out last year in the Western.
    Although the results of the conjoint inquiries which had been made by
Capt. Calver and myself during the 'Porcupine' Expedition of 1870
seemed to us to leave no reasonable doubt as to the existence of an outward
Under-current in the Strait of Gibraltar, yet we both felt extremely desirous
that the matter should be more thoroughly examined ; for we were fully
conscious that the proof could not be regarded as complete, until direct
mechanical evidence should be obtained by the "current-drag" of the
                                                         " or "                        "
passage of Mediterranean water over the "ridge                   marine watershed
between Capes Trafalgar and Spartel, which forms the proper boundary of
the Mediterranean basin, the evidence we had obtained of such passage
being inferential, and therefore open to objection.              And as we saw, in
addition, that the rate, perhaps even the direction, of this under-current was
subject to variation under the influence of Winds and Tides, we felt that the

536                          Dr. W. B. Carpenter on the                     [June 13,
subject could not be fully elucidated without a far more prolonged and
systematic study of its phenomena than it was in our power to carry out.
    But, further,     I  had endeavoured to correlate the phenomena of the
Gibraltar Current with those of the Bosphorus and Dardanelles Currents,
and of the Baltic-Sound Current, under one general Physical Theory ; and
also to show that this Theory also applies to the doctrine of a General
Oceanic vertical Circulation sustained by difference of Temperature.                For
whilst, in the case     of Inland Seas, a disturbance   alike  of  level and  of equili
brium between their water and that of the outside Ocean will be produced
either by excess of evaporation over the inflow of fresh water, or by an
excess   of the inflow of fresh water over evaporation, the like disturbance
will be produced at the two extremes of each quadrant of the Earth along
which there is a free communication between the Polar and Equatorial
seas, by the opposite effects of Polar Cold and Equatorial Heat.
    This view has been strongly opposed, however, on the one hand by Cap
tain Spratt, and on the other by Mr. James Croll.                The former has not
merely affirmed* that this Physical Theory             is  altogether disproved, as
regards the Bosphorus and Dardanelles Currents, by his own observations,
but has called in question the validity of the evidence obtained by the in
quiries of Capt. Calver and myself in regard to the Gibraltar Under
current, and has expressed his disbelief in the Under-current Theory alto
gether. — Mr. Croll, on the other hand, taking his stand upon what he re
gards as a well-established datum in regard to the gradient necessary to
produce movement in water, considers that he has demonstrated the com
plete inadequacy of Thermal agency to maintain the General Circulation                   I
advocate t.
    The objections of a Surveying Officer of Capt. Spratt's ability and expe
rience could not but be entitled to great respect ; and I had therefore much
satisfaction in availing myself of the opportunity afforded me by the
Hydrographer, for cooperating with Capt. Nares in the re-investigation of
the Gibraltar Currents, and for prosecuting such other scientific inquiries
during the voyage to Alexandria as circumstances might admit.
    The ' Shearwater ' being specially fitted for the Surveying Service, only
such arrangements could be made for Scientific research as were consistent
with its requirements.         And since it was not considered expedient to in
clude deep Dredging in our programme, .the following were the objects
which     I proposed to myself, in addition to the investigation of the Gibraltar
Current : —
    I. To ascertain whether Serial Temperature-soundings off the Coast of
Portugal would justify the inference I had drawn, from the correlation of
the .Bo^om-soundings taken in the previous year (Report for 1870,
 §§ 79, 80: Proc. Roy. Soc. vol. xix. p. 188), as to the existence of a

Magazine for Oct,. 1870 and Oct. 1871.

 very distinct division between the upper warm and the lower cold stratum,
 in that portion of the Eastern Atlantic.
    II. To ascertain whether any evidence would be furnished, by the relative
 Specific Gravities of the surface- and JoMom-waters on the Atlantic slope of
 the "marine watershed" between Capes Spartel and Trafalgar, of the
 passage of Mediterranean water over that ridge.
    III. To make a further Dredging-exploration of the comparatively shallow
area   between Sicily and the Coast of Africa, — part of it constituting the
Skerki and Adventure Banks, — from which several specimens were obtained
last year that proved of great interest.
    IV. To make a sufficient number of deep Soundings in the Eastern Basin
of the Mediterranean, to ascertain whether its water corresponds in Tem
perature and Density with that of the Western basin ; and also, whether
the deposit on its bottom is of the same character, and whether the water
immediately above it is copiously charged, as in the Western basin, with
very finely divided particles in suspension.
    V. To ascertain, by analysis of the Gases of this bottom-water, whether
the proportions of Oxygen, Nitrogen, and Carbonic acid correspond
with those which had been found in the Northern Atlantic to be compatible
with the presence of an abundant Fauna ; or whether, as I suggested in my
last year's Report (§ 103), the stagnation of the deeper part of the Medi
terranean basin (in consequence of the want of Thermal Circulation) is
attended with such an excess of Carbonic Acid and diminution of Oxygen,
as is incompatible with the existence of Animal Life.
    VI. To carry a series of Dredgings along the Northern Coast of Africa,
eastward from Malta, in moderate depths, to ascertain how far its Fauna
presents the same characters, and the same limitation to depths of between
 150 and 200 fathoms, that it does in the corresponding part of the Western
Basin.
    With the view of enabling   me to obtain the requisite assistance in carry
ing out the Zoological portion of the inquiry, and of meeting other scien
tific expenses, the Council of the Royal Society assigned a sum of £100
from the Government Grant ; and this enabled me to secure, as on former
occasions, the services of  Mr. Laughrin   as Dredger and Sifter. — A   further
sum of £50 was assigned to me from the Donation Fund, as a provision for
the expenses of our return from Alexandria, the point at which we were to
quit  the ' Shearwater.'
    The Admiralty having charged itself, as on former occasions, with the
provision of Thermometers and Water-bottles, it was only requisite for nic
to provide the Apparatus needed for Gas-Analysis and for the accurate de
termination of Specific Gravities.     As this last point was of special im
portance, and as   I had found the use of a delicate Hydrometer on board
ship, when there was even a trifling roll, to be attended with uncertainty,
I  thought it worth while to make trial of the method of taking Specific
                                                              2  r2

538                          Dr. W. B. Carpenter       on the                 [June 13,
Gravities by a graduated series of lulbs, adjusted to indicate differences of
0- 1 .    On consulting Mr. Casella, I fouud him willing to undertake the con
struction     of such   a series,   which  should range from 1025'0 to 1030'0.
These     I have found to answer admirably, as the motion of a ship interferes
much less with their performance than it does with that of a delicate Hy
drometer.    —I    should    strongly recommend that a similar series, graduated
to every 0'2 (which is quite close enough for ordinary purposes), should
be provided for general use at sea, instead of the Hydrometers at present
furnished by the Meteorological           Department.       Every case of such bulbs
should include a small Thermometer suited for taking the exact temperature
of the water of which the Specific Gravity has to be ascertained, with a
Table whereby the observed Specific Gravity may be reduced to a common
standard — say 60°.        In every observation, the Temperature should be care
fully noted, and the requisite correction applied.            I have strong reason to
believe that the neglect of such correction has led to no small exaggeration
of the differences between the Specific Gravities of the surface-water of
the Ocean in different regions*.          The record of observations ought either
to state the result as corrected, or to state the Temperature at which each
Sp. Gr. determination, if uncorrected, was made. — In the present Report
all the Specific Gravities       are reduced to the Standard     of 60° Fahr.
                                     I
   As it is not probable that shall again take a personal share in the work
of Deep-sea Exploration, and as the present Report will therefore close the
account of the Physical inquiries which I have been led to consider as my
special department, I have thought it desirable to develope somewhat at
length what I regard as the bearings of the results obtained by these
inquiries upon the Doctrine of a General Oceanic Circulation sustained by
difference of Temperature.            This has involved a careful examination of
the whole question of the Gulf-stream : as elucidated, on the one hand, by
the careful and elaborate Surveys prosecuted near the American Coast
under the able direction of the late Prof. Bache ; and, on the other, by the
Thermometric        observations on the Surface-temperature               of the Ocean,
which have been recently correlated as regards the Atlantic by our own
Hydrographic and Meteorological Departments, and as regards the Arctic
Sea by Dr. Petermann.             As no similarly comprehensive examination has
been made, so far as      I am aware, by any other scientific inquirer, and as the
doctrine put forth on the subject by Mr. Croll is likely, if not thus scruti
nized, to command the unquestioning assent of those who regard him as
a high authority      " on  the subject of Oceanic Currents and their bearings on
Geological questions "f, I venture to hope that the inclusion of its results
as an Appendix to this Report will not be deemed inappropriate.
   *   I cannot but think that there must be some such f2llacy in the statement of Dr.
Rattray (Transact, of Linn. Soc. vol. xxvii. p. 272), that he encountered a range of
Specific Gravity in the Ocean-water of the Pacific from 1023| to 1029.

Temperature-Phenomena               of the Atlantic, in relation to
       those of other seas and to the general oceanic cir
       culation.
    1.  The first scientific work to which we applied ourselves was the ob
taining, on the Kith of August, a deep Temperature-sounding                      in Lat.
41° 9' N. and Long. 10° 2' E.,— about 60 miles to the west of Oporto.
The depth here struck was no less than 2100 fathoms ; but unfortunately
the line parted in rceling-iu, and we lost two thermometers and a water-
bottle.      This incident was greatly to be regretted, as the results of Serial
Soundings at this depth would have been of peculiar interest. — Circum
stances were unfavourable, however, to the renewal of the attempt in this
locality.
   2. On the 17th we took three Soundings nearer the Coast of Portugal ;
the first two in Lat. 38° 20^' N. and Long. 9° 23' W., which, with a sur
face-temperature of 66°, gave a bottom-temperature of 54°-5 at 5 70 fathoms,
and 56° at 600 fathoms ; while the third, in Lat. 38° 13' N. and 9° 21' W.,
gave 53° in 590 fathoms.       These temperatures were higher by 5° or more
than those which       were obtained last year, nearly in the same locality, at
corresponding depths (see Report for 1870, § 79) ; and I cannot account
for this elevation in any other way, than by supposing that as we know the
bottom along this part of the coast to be very rocky and irregular, with
many
         " holes,"  the area within which the higher temperatures were found
may have been cut off, as regards its deeper stratum, from the basin of the
 Atlantic, — just in the same manner as the deeper portion of the Sulu Sea
appears to be cut off from the China Sea (§ 12).

     3. On    the 19th of August we took another deep Sounding in Lat.
36° 47' N. and Long. 9° 39' W.,— about 60 miles to the S.W. of Cape St.
Vincent. The surface-temperature being here 68°, the temperature of the
bottom at 1560      fathoms w as 37£°.     A series of Temperature-soundings at
intervals of 10 fathoms down to 100 fathoms having been then taken by
Capt. Nares at my request, the results given in the Table, p. 539, were ob
tained, which it may be well to compare with the temperatures obtained at
corresponding depths, and nearly under the same latitude, within the Me
 diterranean (Report for 1870, § 87, Series II.).
      4. The continuity of the surface-temperature through the uppermost ten
 fathoms' stratum, with even a slight increase, was a phenomenon which            I
 have not myself met with in any other instance, the temperature at 10
 fathoms' depth being generally at least 3 degrees below that of the surface.
 But Capt. Chimmo, in his " Soundings and Temperatures in the Gulf-
 stream" (Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society, vol. xv. 1871,
 p. 99) states that out of 45 carefully obtained observations between
 Ilalifax and the Mid-Atlantic, 26 gave a temperature at 12 fathoms
 warmer than the surface, — sometimes as much as 1|°, — 10 colder, and            9
 of the    same temperature ;   whilst  he   further states that in the Pacific, off
  the Isalcos Mountains     on the west coast of America, the temperature has
  been found not less than 10° or    1 1° higher at 12 or 15 feet below the sur
  face than at the surface.     This he presumes to    be due to excessive   evapo
  ration,   as he has often there found the difference between     the wet- and the
  dry -bulb thermometer to be 9°, and on one occasion 1 1°.            From this  it
  seems probable that the marked differences observable between the rates         of
  descent of the thermometers in the subsurface-stratum are partly referable
  to the hijgrometric condition and movement of the air above, which will
  have an influence even more potent than Temperature per se upon the rate
   of evaporation from the surface.
       5. Having  been led to believe, by the bottom-soundings      taken last year,
   that the temperature of the upper stratum of the Atlantic from 100
  fathoms down to the " stratum of intermixture
                                                         " would here fall
                                                                              pretty
   regularly to about 50° at 700 fathoms, I did not think it needful that time
   should be spent in carrying Serial soundings continuously downward, if the
   temperature at that depth should be found to accord with my expectations ;
   aud this it did in a very satisfactory manner, the thermometers sent down
   to 700 fathoms giving 50°\j.      I therefore requested Capt. Nares to take
   successive   temperature-soundings     from 700 fathoms downwards, at in
   tervals of 100 fathoms; and these also gave the result I had anticipated,
   the thermometer falling to 46° at 800 fathoms, to 42° at 900 fathoms, and
    to 38° at 1000 fathoms.       From 1000 fathoms to the bottom at 1560
    fathoms, the further reduction was only from 38° to 37^°.
       6. Thus, then, this set of Serial soundings fully confirmed the deduc
    tion I had ventured to draw last year (Report for 1870, § 81), from the

  Portugal, as to the well-marked distinction between the upper warm
  stratum and the lower cold stratum, with a stratum of intermixture be
  tween the         two.     For whilst the reduction of temperature beneath the
  superheated        stratum      of the surface was only from 57°' 7 at 100 fathoms
  to 50o-5 at 700 fathoms — that is to say, 70,2 in 600 fathoms, or at the
  rate of l0-2 per 100 fathoms, — the reduction between 700 fathoms and
  1000 fathoms was 12°-5, or at the rate of nearly 4°-2 per 100 fathoms ;
 while the whole mass of the deeper water from 1000 fathoms down to the
  bottom at 1560 fathoms was found to have a temperature between 38°
 and 37%° •
      7.  The significance of these facts becomes most apparent when they are
 graphically contrasted (as in Plate III.) with the temperature-phenomena
 of the Mediterranean under nearly the same parallel ; for, as was proved
             '
 by the Porcupine' Temperature-soundings of 1870 in the "Western basin,
 the temperature from 100 fathoms (at which depth the influence of direct
 insolation appeared to cease) down to the bottom at 1400 or 1500 fathoms
 is uniform throughout*, namely about 54|°.                    It is clear, therefore, (1)
 that depth per se does not give rise to any change in the temperature of
 sea- water occupying a basin which has only a superficial connexion with
 the great Ocean-system ; and consequently (2) that the diversities of tem
 perature shown in the different strata of the Atlantic must depend upon
 their derivation from different sources.
     8.   Now with regard           to the upper  stratum lying between 100 and 700
fathoms, there is no evidence of its derivation from any Southern source ;
on the contrary, the Temperatures taken at 200 and 400 fathoms, in the
recent voyage of the New York School-ship 'Mercury' from Sierra Leone
to Barbadoes (the Report of which has been kindly transmitted to me by
 Prof. Draper), indicate that below the stratum superheated by direct inso
lation, the temperature is even lower between the Tropics than it is in this
more northern            portion of the Atlantic       area.    For the average of nine
observations at 200 fathoms, taken where                 the  depth of the Oceanic basin
was 1000 fathoms or more, was almost exactly 52°, the range being only
between 54° and 50°              ;  and the temperature at 400 fathoms, about 350
miles east of Barbadoes, was only 47°.
     9.   If    this last fact should be confirmed by further inquiries, it will
furnish        a  powerful argument in support of the doctrine of a vertical
Oceanic Circulation which              I have repeatedly   advocated ;  since it is obvious
that     as  it will  be  in the Intertropical   area that the cold bottom-water        will
be most rapidly brought up to the surface (Report for 1870, § 127), the
temperature of the stratum not yet within reach of direct insolation might

be    expected to be lower than it is in the Temperate area.               And it is a
very    curious   confirmation     of  this view,  that   three  of  the temperatures
taken in the 'Mercury' at 200 fathoms, which ranged several degrees
higher than the      average,  — viz.  600, 60°, and 58°,  — were over  a bottom (be
tween Sierra       Leone    and the Cape- Verde Islands) of which the depth
ranged only from 290 to 680 fathoms ; though to the south as well as to
the north of these stations, where the depths were respectively 1000
and 1100 fathoms, the temperatures at 200 fathoms were 53° and 54°.
For if bottom-water, in its gradual rise towards the surface, starts
from great depths at an almost glacial temperature, it will obviously be
much      colder, until it     has come under       the direct   influence  of insola
tion, than     if it  has started from a shallower bottom at a temperature of
(say) 45°.
     10. But whilst the Temperature of the upper stratum in our Atlantic
   •
sounding does not give any definite indication of the derivation of its water
from any remote source, the case is very different in regard to the tempe
rature of the stratum below 1000 fathoms.                For I am at a loss to con
ceive how the rapid fall in the Thermometer                  between 700 and 1000
fathoms, and the depression of Temperature below 38° which exhibits
itself in this Sounding dowu to 1 560 fathoms, and in the Soundings taken
by the ' Porcupine in 1869 from 1000 fathoms down to 2090 and 2435
                         '
fathoms, are to be accounted for, unless on the hypothesis that the tempe
rature of this stratum has been reduced by the flow of glacial water from
 the Polar area towards the Equatorial.           For it seems clear that any mass
of sea-water which remains long enough on the same bottom, must come to
acquire a temperature at least as high as that of the bottom, unless cooled
below this either by the action of Atmospheric cold on its surface, or by
 the intrusion of colder water from some extraneous source.               Now, in the
case of the Western basin of the Mediteranean, the uniform temperature
(54jc) of the whole stratum beneath 100 fathoms agrees so well on the
one hand with the mean temperature of the crust of the earth in that
region (Report for 18/0, § 89), and on the other with the lowest winter
temperature of its surface*, — while the comparative shallowness of the
"ridge"       between Capes Spartel and Trafalgar so effectually prevents the
admission of aiy considerable body of water of a temperature below 5A\°
from the depths of the Atlantic outside, — that we may fairly assume that
temperature to be the normal of the Latitude.              And since, in the Eastern
Atlantic outside the       Strait, the  whole   mass  of water   below 1000 fathoms
has a temperature from sixteen to eighteen degrees below this normal,
which cannot be attributed to the action of surface-cold in the locality
itself, the inference seems irresistible that this depression must be pro
duced and maintained by the convection of cold from the Polar towards the

 Equatorial     area,   — the low conducting-power of water altogether forbidding
 the idea that such a permanent depression can be sustained by lateral con
 duction from the Polar area against the warming influence of the bottom
 beneath and of the air above.                And if this be admitted as probably true
 with respect to the Temperate area to which my own inquiries have been
limited, with how much more force docs the same argument apply to the
 Intertropical region, where, with a surface-temperature rarely, if ever,
 falling below       75°, we find a temperature           of -17° at so small a depth as 400
 fathoms, and a io^om-temperature                  but little above the freezing-point of
 fresh water — the " protected

    1 1 . If any confirmation of this view be thought                   requisite, it is supplied
by    a  similar     comparison       of   the Temperatures       of   two   other Inland Seas
with those of the Oceanic Basins                   with    which they communicate.           The
Red     Sea,  like the Mediterranean,            is entirely cut    off from communication
with the deeper and colder stratum of the Arabian                          Gulf, with which its
surface-layer communicates through                    the shallow    Strait   of Babelmandeb.
Whilst the lowcst(February) temperature observed in that surface-layer, eveu
in the northernmost extension of the Red Sea known as the Gulf of Suez,
is 71° (as    I  learn from Capt. Nares, who has been recently engaged in its
survey), that temperature is there carried uniformly down to the bottom at
450 fathoms       ;   and it may hence be pretty certainly affirmed that no lower
temperature         than this will be found in the southern portion of the Red
Sea, even on a bottom            exceeding 1000 fathoms in depth, since the lowest
surface-temperature of that portion is probably never less than 75°.                         Yet
in the Arabian Gulf the temperature at a depth                      of   2000   fathoms   is cer
tainly not above, and is very probably below 3(ic'S*.
    12. The like contrast is shown by the Temperature- soundings of
Commander Chimmo (which have been kindly communicated to me by the
Hydrographer), between the deep temperature of the Sulu Sea, — a small
area between the north-eastern portion                 of Borneo   and Mindanao,      — and that
of the China        Sea.     The former, though not ostensibly an inland sea, being
but very partially surrounded by land, is so shut in by reefs and shoals, as
to have only a very superficial and limited communication either with the
China or with the Celebes              Sea.    Notwithstanding       this enclosure, its depth
is very great, ranging          to   1778    fathoms; and its Temperature-phenomena
present exactly         the same       contrast with those of the China Sea that the
temperature-phenomena of the Mediterranean present when compared with
those of the Eastern Atlantic, as will be seen in the Table in the next
page.

Thus it appears that with surface-temperatures almost exactly identical,
and with a rate of descent through the first 100 fathoms which seems
nearly the same, there is a most marked difference beneath.           For whilst
in the Sulu Sea the thermometer only falls to 56°-2 at 200 fathoms, to
 51|° at 308 fathoms, and to 50° at 500 fathoms, and the temperature is
uniform from that point down to the bottom at 1778 fathoms, it descends
                                                               °
rapidly in the China Sea to 5 1° at 200 fathoms, thence to 4 1 at 4 1 6 fathoms,
and thence to 37° at 550 fathoms, at which point it remains stationary down
to the bottom at 1546 fathoms.          This difference is attributed by Capt.
         —
Chimmo in my opinion with adequate reason — to the exclusion from the
Sulu Sea of the deep Polar flow which lowers the temperature of the
China Sea.       That the uniform temperature of its deep water from 500
fathoms    downwards     is lower by 4° or 5° than that of the Mediterranean,
notwithstanding that the temperature of its superficial stratum is consider
ably higher, can be easily accounted for on the very probable supposition,
that there are passages between the reefs and islands which admit
water of a temperature below 50° from the outside Sea ; in fact we might
almost certainly     fix the minimum depth of such passages as about 250
                                                                              —
fathoms.     (See also the Addenda in pp. 589, 590). These contrasts
graphically represented in Plate     III.  (in which the dotted lines show the
temperatures of the inland Seas, nnd the continuous lines the temperatures
of the adjacent Oceans) — are readily explicable on the doctrine of an under
flow of Polar water towards the Equator ; and how they are otherwise to be
accounted for,   I am myself at a loss to conceive.
   13.  This underflow involves,    as its necessary complement, a movement
of the upper stratum, bearing with it the warmth of Temperate seas, to
wards the Pole ; and of such a movement very cogent evidence is afforded

  Now in the first place it is to be noted how closely the Temperature of
  the surface of the Sea corresponds with that of the Air ; the reduction of
  both, in passing northwards, being at almost precisely the same rate, and
  the extreme differences being nearly identical.             Next it will be observed
  that   these differences   diminish in amount from above downwards, showing
  that   as the influence of insolation (which is for the most part restricted to
  100 fathoms' depth) is lost, there is an increasing tendency to uniformity
  of temperature. This influence extends the deepest, as might be expected,
  at the southernmost        station   ; the range between      100 and 500 fathoms
  being there 60,2,    whilst   at  the   northernmost   station it is only 20,1. But
  while the temperatures at Station I. from 100 to 500 fathoms so nearly
  correspond with the uniform temperature of the Mediterranean between
  the same depths as to justify our assuming this to be nearly the normal of
  the Latitude, but little modified by the convection either of heat or of cold
  from any extraneous source (§ 8), the temperature at Station IV. of the
  whole stratum of water between 100 and 500 fathoms is so much above
   the normal of its Latitude as clearly to depend upon a translation of
  warm water from a Southern area.              And when we compare these extremes
  with the intermediate temperatures of corresponding strata at Stations II.
  and III., we see how regularly gradational is the transition ; the rate of
  diminution being about ha/fa degree (Fahr.) for every degree of Latitude
  at 100 fathoms, and coming down to little more than a quarter of a degree
   between 300 and 500 fathoms.            The inference seems unavoidable, that the
   entire stratum of water down to at least 500 fathoms has flowed northwards
   to the parallel of 59-j0 from some lower parallel, losing heat in its way by
  imparting it to the air above ; that loss of heat being chiefly shown in

 5-46                          Dr. W. B. Carpenter on the                                      [June   13,

      14.Now, that there is a slow N.E. movement of the upper stratum of
 the water of this part of the North Atlantic, is affirmed by Admiral
 Irminger as the result of the careful discussion he has made of the reckon
 ings kept by ships of the Danish Navy in their passages to and from
 Iceland and Greenland ; the rate of that movement being estimated bv him
 at from 0'8 to 4v miles per day*.     On the other hand, that beneath this

 crust of the Earth beneath, but by the warm stream coming up against it.
 And     further significant indication of its movement
           a                                                 afforded by the     is
comparison of the two sets of Serial Soundings taken in the Cold Area
(Report for 1869, Proc. Roy. Soc. vol. xviii. p. 4.,i6); namely, No. 61
extending to   depth of 610 fathoms, and No. 52 at which the depth
                    a
was  only 381.     For although the latter Station was    degree to the             a
southward of the former, and its surface-temperature was 2°-4 higher,
the glacial stratum was sooner reached    the stratum from 300 fathoms

of from 400 to 4.00 fathoms.     This case, therefore, seems precisely
parallel to the creeping of Polar water up the sides and over the ridges
of submarine hills, of which the U.S. Coast Surveyors have obtained                                    di
stinct evidence in the Florida Channel (§§ 129-133)  and   does not seem   ;          it
explicable upon any other hypothesis, than that of     flow of the colder    a
stratum, which,   left at rest, would gravitate to the deeper part of the
                        if
channel.
     15. Proceeding still further North, we find this glacial stratum lying
nearer and nearer to the surface the nearer we approach the Polar ice-
barrier.    This appears very clearly from the Temperature-soundings which
have been recently taken in the neighbourhood of Spitzbergen by M. Charles
Martins and by MM. Payer and Weyprecht these having effectually dis

of M. Charles Martins           on this point having confirmed those formerly        made
by Scoresby off the coast of Greenland, in indicating a temperature above
32° at 40 fathoms, when the temperature of the surface is below 32°.
This    is easily accounted for by the inferior salinity of the cold surface-
stratum, the reduction of its temperature and of its salinity being alike
due to the melting of ice.       For if the ice be that of Icebergs formed
as Glaciers    on land, the water into which it dissolves will be entirely
fresh ; whilst if it has been formed by the freezing of sea-water, so large
a part of its salt will have been left out in the act of congelation, that the
product of its liquefaction will be of comparatively low Specific Gravity ;
and thus Sea-water at or even below 32° may float upon water some degrees
warmer than itself.   That this is really the explanation of many cases of
this kind, seems probable from the fact, which I have learned from Capt.
Toynbee        (of the Meteorological       Department),     that when our American
Packet-ships, in crossing the Atlantic,           meet   with   a sudden depression         of
surface-temperature,   they find the Specific Gravity also of the surface-
water to be sensibly lessened ; both results being pretty certainly due to
the melting of icebergs borne southwards by the Arctic Current. — But the
strata of Ocean-water        do not always arrange themselves in accordance               with
their relative Specific Gravities and Temperatures.    Two currents may
meet, as on   the Agulhas  Bank,  in such a manner  that the inclination of
the Sea-bed throws up the colder one nearer to the surface than the warmer ;
and the former may maintain this superiority of position as long as its force
of translation lasts.  This agency was doubtless operative in the following
remarkable case cited by Dr. Pctermann :— " Lieut. Rogers, in 1855, found
" in the Asiatic part of the Arctic Ocean a warm surface-current with water
"of low Specific Gravity ; beneath it a cold current ; and then, again, a warm
"current of heavier water; and all these strata running in opposite direc-
" tions." I am informed by Mr. Leigh Smith, who last summer penetrated
to the N.E. of Spitzbergen, that he has encountered a similar succession. —
Cases of this kind, however, do not invalidate the general fact, that the glacial
stratum in Polar Regions extends from less than 50 fathoms below the surface
to the bottom, however deep. Thus Scoresby found the temperature at about
 120 fathoms to be 29°, when it was 3-1° at the surface.     Sir Edward Parry
found the surface-temperature off Spitzbergen to vary from 31° to 28°, and
the bottom-temperature at depths down to 100 fathoms to vary from 30°
to 28°. Sir John Ross found the temperature in Lat. 72° 33' N. and Long.
73° 7' W. to be 35° at the surface, and to decrease gradually to 28 at              J-°     a
depth of 1000 fathoms.   And the recent observations of M. Chas. Martins
have shown that from 40 fathoms downwards             the temperature constantly
undergoes reduction, until          the thermometer stands below 2D°*.   This               is
confirmed by the still more recent observations of MM. Weyprecht and
Payer, which further show that the stratum above 32° becomes thinner as
it   flows northwards   :   —

    17.   Two       separate    questions have to be considered, which have not,
perhaps, been kept sufficiently distinct either by      Mr. Croll or by myself : —
first, whether there is adequate evidence of the existence of                        a General
vertical Oceanic Circulation         ; and second, whether, supposing its existence
to be provisionally         admitted, a vera causa can be found for it in the dif
ference of Temperature     between the Oceanic waters of the Polar and the
Equatorial Areas.    It is obvious that while the admission of the existence
of such a Circulation by no means involves the acceptance of the explana
tion of it which I have offered, no disproof of the validity of that expla
nation can neutralize the inferential evidence in its favour which is afforded
by the facts of observation.    But it is also obvious that if a Force can be
shown to be in constant operation, which is adequate to produce the effect
I assign to    the inferences based on the facts of observation are greatly
                   it,
strengthened.            AndI   cannot too strongly protest against the statement
that no body         of   observations can establish a doctrine, in opposition to an
asserted demonstration              of its impossibility, the probative value of which
entirely rests upon   single set of observations, and upon the relevancy of

   18.    am indebted to the Presidential Address of Mr. Prestwich to the
          I
Geological Society in 1871 for the following summary of the older doctrine
on this subject, which had been generally lost sight of in this country
through the prevalence of the erroneous doctrine of the universality of the
temperature of 39° in the Deep Sea, to which have alluded in former

perature of the tropical seas at great depths could only be owing to currents
from the Poles to the Equator. — D'Aubuisson, in 1819, also attributed the
low temperature of the sea at great depths at or near the Equator to the
flow of currents from the Poles (Traite de Geognosie, p. 450). — Lenz, in
 1831, gave the results of some experiments he had made at great depths in
the ocean    and concluded that between the Equator and Lat. 45° the
               ;
temperature decreases regularly to the depth of 6000 feet, when the de

  550                            Dr. W. B. Carpenter on the                  [June 13,
  was     still more explicitly set forth two or three years later by Prof. Buff, in
  his    " Physics of    the Earth," as I showed in my First Report (1868, p. 187,
  note) ;      and   although his experimental illustration was inappropriate, he
  very clearly attributed the initiation of the movement to Polar Cold, rather
  than to Equatorial Heat.             It was not to this, as I shall hereafter show
  (Appendix        I.,  §§ 92,  93), but  to the clearly untenable doctrine of Capt.
  Maury, as to the production of the Gulf•stream and other sensible currents
  by the elevation of level resulting from Equatorial Heat, that Sir John
  Herschel's trenchant criticism applied ; and, as will presently appear, the
  doctrine advocated in my last Report was explicitly accepted by him shortly
  before his lamented death (§ 37).            So that the general opinion of the most
  eminent authorities in Physics may be fairly said to have been in favour of
  the opinion which Mr. Croll dismisses as "a supposition very improbable."
      19.    The/acts on which I would lay most stress          as justifying the pro
  visional acceptance        of this doctrine, may   be summarized as follows : —
      I. The marked horizontal division of the North Atlantic — the only            open
 Ocean of which the temperature has been yet examined by Serial Soundings
 — into an upper Warm and a lower Cold stratum ; as shown by the rapid
 descent       of the thermometer in the        " stratum of  intermixture
                                                                             "  between
 them      (§§   5,  6).
     ii. The      entire absence of any such horizontal stratification in the water
 of the Mediterranean (§ 7), as also in that of the Red Sea (§11) and of the
 SuluSea(§ 12); the temperature of           these Inland Basins, beneath the stratum
 heated by direct insolation,         being uniform down to their greatest depths.
     in. The prevalence of a Temperature averaging 52° at a depth of only
 200 fathoms, and of 47° at 400 fathoms, in the Atlantic Ocean between the
 Tropics       (§8);    where the water, even at these small depths, is lower in
 temperature         than  at the greatest depths in the Mediterranean.
     iv. The prevalence of a Temperature only a few degrees above 32° 8ver
 the Deep Sea•bed of the North Atlantic generally (Iteport for 1869,
 §§    1 13-1 18), as also in the deepest parts of the Indian Ocean, not only to
the south (§ 10) but to the north of the Equator (Report for 1869, § 120),
and in the China Sea (§ 12) ; and the deep flow of Polar water, which, as
will be shown hereafter (§ 129), underlies the Gulf-stream from the Banks
of Newfoundland to the Florida Channel, and there passes beneath the
outflowing current into the Gulf of Mexico.
    v. The prevalence of a Temperature of from 32° to 29|° in the deeper
stratum of a portion of the " Lightning Channel
                                                           "

the Boreal character of the Fauna of that area, a S.W. underflow of glacial
water from the Arctic Sea.
    vi. The existence of a Temperature much warmer than the normal of
the Latitude, down to a depth of more than ;,i00 fathoms, in another part
of the same Channel (§ 13), indicating a N.E. movement of the whole upper
stratum in this part of the Atlantic ; and the extension of that movement
as shown by Thermometric observation, into the Arctic Sea.

 1872.]                              Scientific Researches.
    20. All these facts  (of which Mr. Croll has not   even attempted to offer
a rationale) are brought into harmonious relation by the doctrine of
a General vertical Oceanic Circulation,       from which the Mediterranean
and other Inland Seas are excluded (n.) in virtue of the shallowness of
their communications with the general Ocean-system.          For (i.) the hori
zontal division of the Atlantic into two strata separated     by a marked dif
ference of temperature is thus accounted for, if    the upper be conceived as
slowly creeping from the Equator towards the Pole, whilst the lower creeps
as slowly from the Pole towards the Equator.        Next, it fully explains the
glacial temperature of the Deep-sea bottom (iv.), which, as the cases of
the Mediterranean and the Sulu Sea clearly prove, cannot be attributed to
depth per se.     Again, it gives an adequate reason for the relatively low
temperature    of the whole   mass  of Tropical water beneath 200 fathoms
depth (in.) ; this having been drawn into the Tropical area as glacial
water, and having risen towards the surface as it received warmth from the
crust of the earth on which it rests); the warmer stratum above it being
drafted away towards the Pole, whilst its place is taken beneath by a fresh
arrival of colder water from the Pole.        Further, it affords an adequate
rationale for the great body of facts now known (vi.) regarding the ab
normally high temperatures met with between Greenland, Iceland, and the
coast of Northern Europe ; for which the ordinary hypothesis of the ex
tension of the Florida Current or true Gulf-stream into that region fails
to account, as will be shown in Appendix I. to this Report.           The Ver
tical Circulation is (as it were) epitomized in the "Lightning Channel ;" in
which there is evidence, from Nautical Observation, of the N.E. movement
of the upper warm stratum (vi.) ; whilst there is inferential evidence of the
 S.W. movement of the glacial stratum beneath (v.). — Although no experi
mental evidence has yet been obtained, either of this movement, or of the
flow of the deeper stratum of Oceanic water generally from the Polar basins
towards the Intertropical zone, indications of such a movement are not
wanting.    The descent of Icebergs into comparatively low latitudes, in op
position to the current of the Gulf-stream, has been frequently recorded.
Two iustauces of this kind are cited by Dr. Hayes, as having fallen uuder
the notice of Capt. Courtney.      On the 27th of April, 1829, he passed an
iceberg from 60 to 100 feet high, in N. Lat. 36° 10' and "W. Long. 39°;
and on the 17th of August, 1831, he met with another in N. Lat. 30° 20'
and W.Long. 47° 45'; both having been carried further south than the
southern edge    of the Gulf-stream,    which   they must thus have crossed.
— So, again,  according to the statement of Mr. Newall, of Gateshead (kindly
communicated to me by Sir Henry Rawlinson), a red-painted buoy, which
 was attached by a wire rope to the end of the Atlantic Cable cut adrift in
 1865, in  N. Lat. 51°   28' and W. Long. 38° 42', was seen seventy-six days
 afterwards in Lat. 42°, Long. 40° ; so that it had travelled nearly due south
about COO nautical miles, or about eight nautical miles a day. Though it
 cannot be affirmed with certainty that this change of place was due to the
   vol. xx.                                                       2 s

552                       Dr. W. B. Carpenter on       the              [June 13,
Action of the southerly underflow upon the long rope hanging to the buoy,
yet the coincidence of this fact with the preceding, and of both with what
the doctrine in question would predicate, may be fairly regarded as evidence
of some value in its favour.
  ¦
    21.  I now proceed to the second head of the discussion, — viz. the demon
stration, which Mr. Croll considers himself to have given, that the difference
of Temperature    between   Polar and Equatorial water cannot possibly produce
the effect I attribute to it.      He affirms (1) that the utmost difference
•which can be supposed     to exist between the levels of the Polar and the
 Equatorial columns will not serve to produce a movement of the Equatorial
surface-water towards the Poles      ;   and (2) that the utmost difference that
 can be supposed to exist between the Specific        Gravities of the Equatorial
and Polar columns will not serve to produce a flow of bottom-water from
the Polar area towards the Equator. — Assuming the temperature of a
column of water at the Pole to be 32° from the surface downwards, and the
temperature of the Equatorial column to be 80° at the surface, gradually
falling to 32° at 10,000 feet, Mr. Croll calculates that the extreme
elevation of level of the Equatorial column above the Polar would be 18
feet.
         " The distance from the Equator to the Poles is about 6200 miles.
 "The force impelling the water down this slope of 18 feet in 6200 miles
 "would therefore be equal to about l-l,820,000th that of gravity.              For
 " example, the force impelling a cubic foot (64 lbs.) of water at the surface of
 " the ocean would scarcely be equal to the weight of one fourth of a grain.
 " But in reality it would not nearly equal this " *. As evidence of the in
adequacy of this force to produce motion in Ocean-water, Mr. Croll relies
on the experiments of M. Dubuat ; who " found that when the inclination
" was 1 in 500,000, the motion of the water was barely perceptible ; and
 " he came to the conclusion that when the inclination is reduced to 1 in
 " 1,000,000, all motion ceases. But the inclination afforded by the difference
 " of temperature between the sea in Equatorial and Polar regions does not
" exceed the half of this ; aud consequently it can have absolutely no effect
 " whatever in producing currents."
    22. Now the experiments of M. Dubuat had reference, not to the slow
restoration of level produced by the motion of water on itself, but to the
sensible movement of water flowing over solid surfaces and retarded by
its friction against them ; and        I  have the authority of Mr. Hawksley
 (whose large experience in the construction of Waterworks enables him to
speak with high authority on this point) for the statement, that whilst the
latter source of retardation is one with which Hydraulic Engineers are well
acquainted, the friction with which the former is attended is so slight that
it is altogether disregarded in practice.      According to Mr. Croll, if a trough
 1,820,000 feet long were partly filled with water, and enough water were
then poured into it at one end to raise the surface at that end one foot, with
a uniform slope to the other end, that inclination would be permanent ;

 since
         "  a pressure    of  one  fourth of  a grain on the cubic foot     of water would
  " be totally inadequate to overcome the mere molecular resistance of the
  "  water to go into motion."          Now not only Mr. Hawksley, but every high
 Mathematical        authority whom I have consulted, has assured me that the
 "viscosity" of water is         so far from having been satisfactorily determined,
 that the assertion that it would be adequate to prevent water whose level
 has been disturbed to the extent          just mentioned, from ever finding it again,
 is totally inadmissible.          The very small degree in which this "viscosity"
 operates     to bring to a    stand the motion of water upon itself, is shown (as
 Mr. Hawksley has suggested            to me) by the long persistence in the open sea
 of the "swell" produced by            a gale of wind (provided that after the subsi
 dence    of the gale there be no counteracting wind), and by the propagation
                     " to a
 of this "swell               great distance*.
     23. Now, so far from asserting (as Captain Maury has done) that the
 trifling difference of level arising from inequality of Temperature is adequate
 to the production of
                             " ocean-currents," I simply affirm that as fast
                                                                                       (or as
 slowly)    as  the  level  is  disturbed   by change     of Temperature,     it will be  re
 stored by Gravity ; and I venture to think that as this is a direct corol
lary from the fundamental conception of a fluid, the onus probandi of the
 contrary rests on Mr. Croll.           When he shall have shown experimentally
that water is so viscid a fluid that it does not find its own level when time
is given to it to do so, he will have obtained a definite foundation for rea
soning which is at present simply baseless.
     24. But, further, there is an experimentum crucis in constant progress,
which appears to me completely to disprove Mr. Croll's position.                      It will
not,   I  presume, be denied by him that the semi-diurnal Tide is produced by
the attraction of the Moon, augmented or partly neutralized (as the case
may be) by that of the Sun.              Now, according to Sir John Herschelf, the
Moon's maximum of power to disturb the Earth's waters is only about
 1-1 1,400,000th part of gravity; while that of the Sun does not exceed
 1 -25,736,400th part of gravity.             Yet the Moon's attractive force, even
when partly counteracted by that of the Sun (as at neap-tides), suffices to
raise and to propagate a vast wave, which, though neither high nor strong
in the open Ocean, rises and           becomes   more rapid where its onward move
ment is checked, and especially where a large body of water is forced to
flow in a narrow channel.            Now since the disturbance of Gravity produced
by difference of Temperature is many times greater than that produced by
the combined action of the Sun and Moon, it is for Mr. Croll to show why
such a vast force is without effect.
     25.  Mr. Croll proceeds to say (loc. cit. p. 251) : — "Suppose that at the
"Equator we have to descend 10,000 feet before water equal in density to
     * I happon   to have myself been subjected   for three days continuously, in the middle

"   static equilibrium when there is a difference between the temperature of
"  the water at the Equator and the Poles."   Taken by itself, this propo
sition would seem irreconcilable with the simplest principles of Physics                                   ;
but    I
      presume that it is to be understood in its connexion with what Mr.
Croll seems to regard as a permanent inequality of level between Equatorial
and Polar waters.              For    he goes on to say      :   — " The only slope that has         any
" tendency to produce motion of the water is the slope formed by the sur-
" face of the ocean in the Equatorial regions being higher than the surface
" at the Poles ; but this is a slope of only 18 feet in 6200 miles." — Now
if,   as
       I    maintain, there          is   no such permanent    inequality of level — any dif
ference produced by inequality                     of Temperature always tending towards
equalization, — the inclined plane of denser because                         colder water,      of which
the slope (as admitted by Mr. Croll) must be nearly two feet per mile,
constitutes   serious disturbance of equilibrium, that must be capable of
               a
producing very decided effects.
    26.    Mr. Croll's whole manner of treating the subject                      is   so different from
that which      appears to me to require, and he has so completely misappre

films,and by their successional renewal, the temperature of the whole
mass of the water will be progressively reduced, until its density reaches its .
maximum at 39°-2 ; after which the further application of cold no longer
causes       the descent of the surface-film.                And thus it   comes to pass that the
temperature of all the water beneath that superficial stratum which under
goes further reduction of Temperature with increase of Specific Gravity until
itfreezes, is uniform throughout, down even to the very bottom of such deep
basins as some of the Italian and Swiss lakes ; and that, as there is no
downward convection of Heat when the summer sun acts on their surface,
and the only warming influence will be that of the crust of the Earth
beneath, the temperature of 39°-2 is found to prevail throughout the year
from a small distance beneath the surface of the deeper lakes down to their
very bottom.
   27. But the case is very different with Sea-water, which does not attain
its maximum of density until it freezes (at or below 27°) ; for the downward
convection of Cold will continue until any further reduction of temperature
produces the formation of ice ; and thus we should expect to find the deepest
stratum of Sea-water that has been acted on by surface-cold showing the
lowest temperature, which is precisely what we have ourselves met with in
the "Lightning Channel" (§ 14), where we found 29°6 at 640 fathoms,
and what Messrs. Payer and Weyprecht met with in Lat. 78° very near the
surface      (§ 15)*.
  28. Let us next suppose that only a portion of the area of the basin is
exposed to the action of surface-cold; the movement of the liquid takes
place somewhat differently.         For the surface-film which descends is then
replaced,    not  from  beneath,   but  by an inflow from the neighbouring area,
as may be proved experimentally by the means already indicated                     : and  i

Sea-water to the same level, but the temperature of the water in one of
them (W) to be 60°, while that of the other (C)   30°;    obvious that

 reduces its Temperature to 30°, and proportionally augments its Specific
 Gravity, then (the levels of the two columns being equalized by such in
 flow) the excess of weight in column C will be maintained, until, by the
continued      outflow through the bottom pipe, the whole of the warm water
in column W has been transferred to C ; for this outflow lowers the level
in C, and      at the same time       tends to lift up the superincumbent         warm
water in W, which will consequently flow back through the upper pipe
into C,   so as to restore the equality     of the levels of the two columns.      And
if all  the water which       passes  from W to C is cooled down on entering C,
this circulation       must continue,     though at a gradually diminishing rate,
until equilibrium is restored by the depression of the temperature of the
entire water of both columns to 30°. — But let us suppose, further, that the
cold water,     as  it enters the bottom of W by the lower pipe, has its tempera
ture raised again by warmth applied beneath ; and that this elevation is
further increased by surface-heat as the water rises to the top of the column ;
the result will be that, as the temperature of the water in column W, except
of that lowest stratum which has last arrived from C, will               be kept con
stantly   above that of column C, whilst there will be a constant tendency to
the equalization of the levels of the two columns, there will be a continu
ally renewed difference between their Specific Gravities and consequently
between their absolute weights.           This will produce a continual transference
 of water from the bottom of C to the bottom of W, and from the top of
W    to the top of C, with a constant descending movement in C and a con
stant ascending movement in W.               The descending movement in column
 C will not consist in a successional descent of surface-films from above
downwards, unless it should happen that the surface-cold is intense enough
to reduce their temperature below that of the subjacent water ; but it will
be a downward          movement   of the  entire mass,   as if water in a tall jar were
being drawn off through an orifice at the bottom.              And in like manner the
upward movement in column W will not so much consist in a successional
ascentof bottom-films,        as in an  upward movement of the entire mass ; since
the films warmed at the bottom will only ascend until they meet with water
of which the temperature is as high as their own ; and this will be the case
so   soon   as they     have passed through the cold stratum which has last
flowed in from C.          The force which will thus lift up the entire column of
water in    W,    is that which causes the descent of the entire column in C,
namely, the excess of Gravity constantly acting in C ; the levels of the two
columns, and consequently their heights, being maintained at a constant
equality by the free passage of surface-water from W to C.
    30. The whole of Mr. Croll's discussion of this question, however, pro
ceeds upon the assumption that the levels of the Polar and Equatorial
columns are not kept at an equality, in consequence of the inadequacy of
the excess of level in the Equatorial column to put in motion the interven
ing water    ;  and that instead of there being an excess       of weight in the Polar
column,    there is a condition        of static equilibrium     between the two. —

Having shown the untenablencss of this assumption (§ 22), I might dismiss
his arguments without further notice, were it not that I should leave it in his
power to reply that, granting my view of the case to be the correct one,
the force of Gravity which I regard as the primum mobile of the Circulation
cannot be greater than it is on his.
   31. In order to show how a disturbance of Static Equilibrium produced
by difference of Temperature      would operate through a vast extent of
Ocean, I shall suppose an elongated Inland Sea like the Mediterranean,
with a uniform temperature of 54° throughout, to have one-tenth of its
length cut off from the rest by a septum, and the whole surface of this
portion to be acted on by Polar Cold, until the temperature of the entire
body of water it contains should be reduced to 27° ; its level being thus
lowered, and its Specific Gravity augmented, without any increase in its
absolute weight.   If, now, we suppose the septum to be removed, it is
evident that not only will the depression of level produce a surface-inflow
into the Cold area, from the portion of the basin next adjacent to        but                it,
that the compensatory movement must extend, though in                           a       gradually
diminishing ratio, to the opposite extremity of the basin for,          :      if   it    do not,
cither water   is   not   a   liquid, or liquids do not find their own level.                  The
water of the Cold area, having its surface now raised to the general level
of the basin, will have its absolute weight augmented in proportion to its
increase in density   and both its downward and its lateral pressure will
                          ;
therefore be in excess of that of every other column of equal height and
base in the entire basin.   Now Mr. Croll's position              is,
                                                         that the difference
in Gravity between the two columns       and    at the opposite ends of the

to Z  ;so that the state of disturbed Equilibrium produced      the original
reduction of Temperature will last so long as that reduction    maintained.

water en bloc, as    if   it  solid body
                               were   a    instead of regarding
                                                 ;                as liquid, it          a
of which each component part, being free to move upon every other {re
tarded only    by
               its "viscosity"), carries from point to point along the whole
length of the basin the action of the force initiated at the cold end.    In
order to determine how this force will operate, we must begin considering    by
what change will occur between the water of the cold and heavy column
(A), and that of the warmer and lighter column (B) next adjacent to                                it,
when free communication               has been opened between them.         The difference
in the weight of the two columns involves an excess of lateral pressure                            in
column A, increasing from above downwards     and this will cause

of A and raising that of B, will produce        a  further surface-indraught   from
B into A.     Supposing B to be cut off by a septum from the rest of the
basin, as A was in the first instance, this interchange would proceed until
half of the heavier water of column A has flowed into the lower part of
column B, and half of the lighter water of column B has flowed into the
upper part of column A, so as to equalize the pressure and the level in the
two.     If now the  septum be removed between columns B and C, the excess
of pressure which B shares with A will operate in like manner (though in
a diminished    measure) against C    ;  and the same interchange will take place
until the equilibrium    is restored.     And thus by a propagation of the like
interchange through the whole succession of columns in a progressively
diminishing ratio, the stratum of colder and heavier water (supposing its
temperature not to be altered by conduction from below or from above)
would ultimately spread itself at a uniform level over the entire floor of the
basin.     This extension, in fact, would be simply a question of time, like
the equalization in the level of its surface ; the rate of the movement being
determined by the "viscosity" of the water.
    33. But we have now to trace out the result of the continued action            of
severe   Cold on the surface of the limited      area at one extremity  of the basin.
As fast as the bottom-outflow tends to restore the equilibrium between the
 Polar column and the rest of the basin, a new disturbance will take place
by the cooling of the water brought in by the surface-inflow ; and this
 disturbance will be propagated onwards from column to column, along the
 whole length of the basin, in the manner just indicated.              If the glacial
 stratum were not to acquire any heat in its diffusion over the floor of the
 basin, its thickness would      be continually    augmented by fresh exchanges
 between column and column, — the warmer surface-vmter flowing towards
 the cold extremity of the basin, as fast as cold io^om-water flows from
 it ; until at last the entire mass of the water in the basin (supposing its
 surface- temperature not to be kept up by insolation) would have its tem
 perature progressively reduced by downward convection in the area over
 which the cold directly      acts, and thence      by lateral convection, until the
 whole would be brought       down to 27°, when no further movement would
 take place.
     34. But since the Glacial stratum, as it creeps along the sea-bed, is con
 tinually receiving heat from the crust of the earth beneath and from the
 warmer layer of water above, its thickness would diminish with the increase
 of distance from the Polar area ; or, in other words, its surface would form
 an inclined plane, lying at a greater and yet greater depth, the further it
 has flowed from its source, — which is just what, 'so far as our present
 knowledge extends, proves to be the case.              And further, as the upper
  stratum   is being continually draughted off in the opposite direction,
 the portion of the glacial stratum which has had its temperature raised by

  come under the direct influence       of insolation   ;  whereby its temperature will
  be greatly augmented, and its level raised, so as to promote the            return-flow.
 Thus at the two extremities of the basin there will be two forces in constant
 renewal, the opposing actions of which will as constantly tend to a disturb
  ance of equilibrium ; and to deny that a movement will thus be produced
 and sustained, tending to the restoration of equilibrium through the entire
 basin, is simply to assert that a constant force acting on particles that are
 free to move does not move them.
    35.   It  is to be remembered that, however small the original amount of
 movement may be, a momentum tending to its continuance must be gene
 rated from the instant of its commencement           ; so   that if  the initiating force
 be in constant action, there     will  be a progressive       acceleration of its rate,
 until the increase of resistance equalizes the tendency to further accelera
 tion.    Now if it be admitted that the propagation of the disturbance of
 equilibrium from one column to another is simply retarded, not prevented,
 by the
          " viscosity " of the liquid, I cannot see how the conclusion can be
 resisted, that the constantly maintained difference of Gravity between the
 Polar and Equatorial columns really acts as a vis viva in maintaining a Cir
culation between them.           A remarkable confirmation of my argument as
to the sufficiency of difference, in Specific Gravity to keep up a Vertical
 Circulation, is afforded by recent researches on the Dardanelles Under
current.      (See § 1 73.)
    36. Those who are         accustomed     to look      only at    the  movements of
great   volumes    of fluid, and to discuss them en masse, are apt to ignore facts
perfectly    well known    to such as have had occasion to observe those minuter
changes which are constantly taking place within any collection of liquid
under the influence of slight alterations of Temperature. — The following is
a remarkable example         of this kind, which fell within my own knowledge
many years ago, and made a strong impression upon me. Mr. West, a very
ingenious mechanician at Bristol, having heard of the success of Mr. Peter
Barlow's plan of constructing object-glasses for Telescopes of moderate
aperture, in which the double concave of flint-glass was replaced by a highly
refracting fluid (such as sulphuret of carbon, or oil of cassia), carried out
this plan on a large scale in the construction of an object-glass of eighteen
inches in diameter.          By the mathematical aid of Mr. Barlow, and his
own great mechanical ability, this object-glass (exceeding in diameter that
of any refracting telescope which had been at that time constructed) was
completed with theoretical correctness; but when it was brought into use, its
performance was found to be so seriously impaired by movements produced
in the fluid by the very slight disturbances in the equality of the Tempera
ture of its different parts, occasioned by atmospheric currents, that in spite
of every precaution which could be taken for its protection, it was found to
be valueless for the purpose       of Astronomical     research. — Those, again, who
have been accustomed to the minute observation of Aquaria, have frequently
noticed currents, marked by the movement of minute suspended particles,

that could only be attributed to slight differences of Temperature ; and Dr.
Mobius*, who has given much attention to this inquiry, has ascertained
that a difference of half a degree of Reaumur is quite sufficient to produce
sensible movement. — Further, Mr. Rainey, who has paid great attention to
the internal motions of small collections of liquid entirely enclosed within
glass and placed under the Microscope, has recently published a series of
observations, which show that definite currents, made obvious by the transla
tion of suspended particles, take place in liquids thus enclosed, under condi
tions that seem to exclude any other agencies than inappreciable differences
of Temperature. (St. Thomas's Hospital Reports, New Series, vols. i. & ii.)

Croll's objections to the doctrine I advocate ; whilst I have, on the other
hand, had the satisfaction of receiving from both Sir John Herschel
and Sir William Thomson an explicit acceptance of it.        The former was
kind enough to write to me, only a short time before his last illness, as
follows   :   — " Assuredly, after well considering all you               say, as well as the com-
"   mon sense of the matter, and the experience of our hot water circulation-
"   pipes in our greenhouses, &c, there is no refusing to admit that an Oceanic
" circulation of some sort must arise from mere Heat, Cold, and Evaporation,
" as veree causa ; and you have brought' forward with singular emphasis the
" more powerful action of Polar Cold, — or rather, the more intense action,
" as its maximum effect is limited to a much smaller area than that of the
" maximum of Equatorial Heat. The action of the Trade and Counter-trade
"   Winds in like manner cannot             be   ignored    ;   and henceforward the question
" of Ocean-currents will            have to be considered under a twofold point                 of view.
" The Wind-currents, however,      are of easier investigation. All the causes lie

" tration,     are limited by the configuration            of the sea-bottom, which             has to be
" studied over its whole extent by the very imperfect method of Sounding."
    38. Imperfect as that method       however,   is,

sufficient number of Serial Temperature-soundings, taken in different parts

 562                          Dr. W. B. Carpenter on the                    [June    13,
    39.   If the   views  I  have propounded    be correct,  it may  be expected    that
 near the border of the great Antarctic Ice-barrier, a Temperature below 30c
 will   be met with (as it has been by Parry, Martins, and Weyprecht
 nearSpitzbergen,§       15) at no great depth beneath the surface; and    that instead
 of rising    at still greater depths, the thermometer will fall to nearly the
 freezing-point of salt water.        The greater the distance from the ice-barrier,
the greater would be the depth at which the surface of the Glacial stratum
would be met with ; but in consequence of the free communication between
the Antarctic area and the great Southern Oceans, it may be expected that
the deepest parts of these will be fcund to show a temperature as low as
32°, or perhaps lower, even near the Equator. — The bottom-temperature of
the North Pacific will afford a crucial test of the truth of the doctrine.
For since the sole communication of this vast Oceanic area with the Arctic
basin is a Strait so shallow as only to permit an inflow of warm surface-
water, its deep cold stratum must be entirely derived from the Antarctic
area ; and if its bottom-temperature is not actually higher than that of the
South     Pacific,   the glacial stratum ought to be found at a greater depth
north of the Equator than south of it. In the North Atlantic, again, the com
parative limitation      of communication with the Arctic area may be expected
to prevent its bottom-temperature from being reduced as low as that of the
Southern Atlantic.          But it will be a matter of peculiar interest to determine
the bottom-temperature of the deep channel that separates Greenland and
Iceland, to ascertain the thickness of the Glacial stratum which (I venture
to predict) will be found to occupy a large proportion of its entire depth,
and to trace the gradual thinning-out of this, as it diffuses itself over the
vast area of which the bottom-temperature is reduced by it.
    40. It will further be extremely important to ascertain by Mechanical
means, if possible, whether this Glacial flow has a movement of which the
direction and rate are determinable.          And I would especially point out that
the   " Lightning     Channel
                                "
                                  (§ 14) affords a peculiarly favourable opportunity
for such investigation, in consequence of the well-marked distinctness of it s
two strata. If my view be correct, a " current-drag" suspended in the upper
stratum ought to have a perceptible movement in the N.E. direction ;
whilst another, suspended in the lower stratum, should move S.W.                   And
though the rate of movement in each may be very slow, yet the opposition
of their directions may be expected soon to make itself apparent, in the sepa
ration of the surface-buoys from which the drags are suspended. — Should
the examination of this Northern portion of the Oceanic area be beyond the
scope of the Circumnavigation           Expedition, I would urge that it should be
undertaken by any Polar Expedition which the British Government may
fit out. For the difference in the Thermal conditions of the Northern and
Southern Oceans, consequent upon the difference in their respective relations
to the Arctic and Antarctic basins, is a question of peculiar interest in a
 Geological point of view.
    41.   If, again,   as may be anticipated,   it should prove that    a considerable

                         ' Shearwater '                                                563

 difference exists between the bottom-temperature of the North Pacific and
  that of the North Atlantic, it is evident that if there ever was a time at
  which   a  continuous Continent extended from Greenland to Scandinavia, the
  North Atlantic would then have been cut off from the Polar basin almost
 as completely as the      North Pacific is now, and its bottom-temperature would
  be higher than we now find it.            If, on the other     hand, there should ever
 be such a subsidence       of the Peninsulas        of Alaska and Eastern Siberia, as
 would open a free communication between the Arctic basin and the North
  Pacific, the temperature of the lower stratum of the latter would probably
  be greatly reduced.
     42. How important would be the Geological and Biological effect of such
  changes, and how great a light may be thrown on Palaeontology by such
 inquiries as I have indicated, was admirably shown by Mr. Prestwich in
  the Presidential Address which he last year ( 1871) delivered to the Geolo
 gical Society. After pointing out how entirely the Thermal condition of the
 Mediterranean differs from that of the Atlantic, in consequence of its
 exclusion from the general Oceanic circulation, he suggests whether the
  deep Sea in which the Chalk of Europe, with its more, Tropical genera, was
 deposited may not also have been a sea shut out from direct communication
  with Arctic     seas.   As  the Cretaceous Ocean formed an east and west              belt
  across the present Continents of Europe and Asia, we must look for "dry
  " land on the confines of that ocean ; and it is probable that the latter may
  " have been, to the north, in the direction between Greenland and Scotland
 " and   Scandinavia, where the present ocean is some hundreds of fathoms
 " shallower      than further south.        We know that towards the end of the
 "  Cretaceous period a change took place in the Fauna, arising apparently
 "  from the shallowing of the sea that preceded the deposition of the Maes-
"   tricht beds.       Many of the great Cephalopods disappeared, and Reptiles
 "                                  at the same time the          Lamellibranchiate   Mol-
                                                     ..."
    increased in numbers         ;
 "  lusca    became     more predominant." .                  If such a northern land
 '*
    barrier as that which      I   have  alluded  to  existed at  the period of the Chalk,
"   and that barrier was submerged during the early part of the Tertiary
" period,     it would (taken in connexion with the very different conditions
 "  of depth under which the Chalk and Lower Tertiaries were formed) go far
 "  to account for the great break in the Fauna of the two periods. Some years
 " since I had occasion to show on other grounds                that the Thanet     Sands,
 " which repose on the Chalk in the South-east                   of England, exhibited    a
 " Fauna essentially of temperate or cold latitudes            ;  and  I inferred the inset
 " of currents      from the north."
    43.   It   is regarded by      Mr. Prestwich      as  highly probable that the old
Cretaceous ocean was prolonged into the American Cretaceous area, across
the present Atlantic ; and he thinks
                                                 " that the hypothesis with regard to
 "  the continuity of that sea-bed from the period of the Chalk to the present
" period     is one of high probability."         Now this continuity is all that it was
intended       by Prof. Wyville Thomson and myself to express by the phrase

 564                          Dr. W. B. Carpenter on           the                    [June 13,
 used in my  First Report (1868, p. 193), that " we may be said to be still
living in the Cretaceous epoch."   We then anticipated — what our own sub
sequent inquiries and those of our friends of the United States Coast Survey
have abundantly confirmed — that with the persistence of the Globigerine
life which forms the Cretaceous deposit, there would prove to be a like
persistence of numerous types characteristic of the old Cretaceous Fauna ;
 so that the Globigerina-mxidnow in process of increase on the sea- bed of
the Atlantic may be regarded " not merely as a Chalk-formation, but as a
continuation of the Chalk-formation."   Now we have been told on high
authority that Geological epochs are essentially marked out by great changes
in the Fauna, — whole series of Animal forms disappearing, and their places
being taken by others which then first make their appearance ; and further,
that the termination of the Cretaceous Epoch must be considered, in this
sense, as coinciding with the disappearance of those numerous types of
chambered Cephalopods which were so eminently characteristic of the
Old Chalk, and of which very few appear to have survived the changes that
inaugurated the Tertiary epoch*.
   44. There is nothing really inconsistent, however, between Sir Charles
Lyell's view of the case and our own.              If
                                             his definition of a Geological
Epoch be accepted, then our doctrine that
                                           " we may be said to be still living
in the Cretaceous epoch
                         " requires to be expressed in somewhat different
language.   But if that which we meant to be understood by       and which      it,
has been admitted as probable by so eminent an authority in Geology as
Mr. Prestwich, should         be really the case, then,   I     submit, some new term
must be invented to designate that state of things which will present itself
to the " Geologist of the future," whenever the present bed of the Atlantic
shall be raised into dry land.  For there will then be found superimposed
upon the newest beds of what    now known as the " Cretaceous Formation,"
                                    is
not a series of deposits resembling the Tertiaries of Europe and America,
but an unbroken succession of layers of      substance resembling the Old
                                                   a
Chalk in all essential particularst, and containing numerous Animal types
which do not differ more from those of its uppermost beds than these do
from the types found in the earlier members of the Formation.      Doubtless
there will be   a great and perhaps     sudden change in certain portions of
                                          a
the Fauna   ;  but  whilst the material  of the deposit continues unchanged,
whilst its Stratification remains conformable, and large number of Generic

t    Much stress has been laid on the fiict that the specimens of the Atlantic mud brought
up by our dredge proved on analysis to contain a considerable admixture of Sand, and
could not bo said to be true Chalk.    But this admixture may very probably have been
purely local, resulting from the drift of the Northern detritus along   a  lino of specially
rapid underflow. According to Dr. Bailey and Prof. Huxley, the Atlantic mud brought
up by the Sounding-apparatus from the Mid-ocean scarcely contained     trace of sand
                                                                            a               ;

probably be the explanation of tbo purity of tho Old Chalk.

" Geologist               "
             of the future would scarcely think himself justified in limiting
the " Cretaceous Formation " to beds distinguished only by the presence
of a certain set of Animal forms not to be found in those above them. If,
however, he should think proper so to limit that term, he would have to
invent a new one for the later beds deposited in absolute continuity with                      it,
and perhaps in all but one particular under the same conditions.        That
particular,    Mr. Prestwich's very ingenious speculation be accepted as

provisionally true, was Temperature        reduction in that of the Cretaceous

maintain their ground, and would in their turn leave their remains to be
entombed in the mass of Globigerina-mud, the production of which on the
Atlantic sea-bed seems to have gone on uninterruptedly through the whole
of the Tertiary Period to the present time.

         Further Investigation of the Gibraltar Currents.
  46. The inquiries made in the 'Porcupine' Expedition of 1870 having
shown that the information obtainable by the Hydrometer respecting the
stratification of Atlantic and Mediterranean water in the Strait of Gibraltar
might afford valuable evidence in regard to their movement,         made the      I
determination of Specific Gravities my own special charge, whilst Capt.
Nares, in consultation with me, carried out the Mechanical portion of the
investigation.   As his separate Report of the inquiries he conducted, and
of the deductions he drew from them, has been already communicated to

566                           Dr. W. B. Carpenter on the                [June 13,
the Royal Society by the Hydrographer to the Admiralty, and has been
published in its 'Proceedings' (Jan. 18, 1872), there will be no occasion
for me to do more than state the results of my own Sp. Gr. determinations,
and compare these with the results obtained by the use of the
                                                                    " current-
drag," in such a manner as to enable every reader to judge for himself
whether my own conclusions are or are not justified by the facts now adduced.
— That the complete elucidation of the question requires a much more pro
longed and systematic study than it was in our power to make on this
occasion, is the opinion at which we have both arrived ; and since the know
ledge to be gained by such an investigation would be highly serviceable
to the Navigator, whilst affording most valuable data for the Scientific
study of Tidal and Current movements generally,         I
                                                shall include in this Sec
tion of my Report some suggestions for its further prosecution.
   47. It will be remembered that between Capes Trafalgar and Spartel,
at the western or Atlantic entrance of the Strait, is a "ridge" which con
stitutes a kind of marine
                             " watershed," looking on one side towards the
Atlantic, and on the other towards the Mediterranean.        The depth of the
northern half of the channel across this section scarcely anywhere exceeds
50 fathoms ; whilst in its southern half the depth does not seem anywhere
to reach 200, and may be considered to average 150 fathoms.         From this
"ridge" the Atlantic slope deepens gradually westwards, until, at a dis
tance of about 45 miles, a depth of from 500 to 600 fathoms is reached.
On the other hand, the Mediterranean slope deepens gradually eastwards
along the whole length of the Strait (about 35 miles), as far as its embou
chure in the Mediterranean between Gibraltar and Ceuta, where the depth
of the deepest part of the channel exceeds 500 fathoms.       Thus it appears
that the Strait is to be considered as a prolongation of the Mediterranean
basin, not of that of the Atlantic.    If its bottom were to be elevated 200
fathoms, the "ridge" would become dry land, entirely cutting off the
Mediterranean from the Atlantic ; but though the channel between the
European and the African shores would be considerably narrowed, it would
still extend further west than Tangier. If thus completely cut off from
the Atlantic, the Strait would be in every sense a part of the Mediterranean,
and would be entirely filled with the denser water of that great Inland Sea.
But in virtue of its communication with the Ocean outside, and of the con
tinual inflow (modified by tidal changes) of a surface-current from the
Atlantic, the whole upper stratum of the water of the Strait has a purely
 Atlantic character, which is as distinctly recognizable by the Specific-
 Gravity test at the Mediterranean as at the Atlantic end of the channel.
On the other hand, the lower stratum was last year found no less distinctly
to correspond in Specific Gravity with the denser water of the Mediter
ranean  ; so that its presence could be recognized by this character no less
certainly on the summit of the
                                 " ridge " than in the
                                                       deepest portion of the
Mediterranean embouchure.       (See Report for 1870, §§ 6l-69.)

sence  of Mediterranean water could be detected by an excess in the Specific
Gravity of the bottom-water, on the Atlantic side of the slope j our previous
inquiries having shown that no such excess is to be found in the ordinary
water of the Atlantic, which appears to be even a little more saline at the
surface than below     — the effect of this excess on Specific Gravity being
                                   it,
neutralized by the expansion produced                       by
                                           the more elevated Temperature
(Report for 1870,   84).   The
                             §  average of our determinations of the Sp.
Gr. of Atlantic water had been 1-0265, the minimum (bottom) being
10261, and the maximum (surface) l-0269; and this agrees very well
with the results obtained    Forchhammer, — who, moreover, explicitly states
                                         by
that while the water taken between Lat. 20° and 30° off the western coast
of Africa has Salinity approaching that of Mediterranean water (which
                    a
he attributes to the great evaporation, and to the absence of river-return of
fresh water), the surface-water of the Atlantic embouchure of the Straits,
for some distance westward, has the average density of Atlantic water*.
    49. The first sample we obtained of bottom Atlantic water within the
influence of the Mediterranean outflow, was                      by
                                                   the deep Sounding already
mentioned          as having been taken on the 19th of August, in Lat. 36°

The Sp. Gr. of the *«r/oce-water being here 1*0268, that of the lottom-

from    adepth of 665 fathoms in Lat. 36°     N. and Long. 7° 43' W., in the

Spartel, we took on the following day        succession of samples from the

    Thus     appears that along the whole of this line of Soundings there
              it                                                                                    is
a   most decided excess in the Specific Gravity of the bottom-water over that
of the «wr/ace-water, and that this excess increases as the "ridge"                                 is
approached, — the exception shown at Station  being really  proof of the

deep valley, since we passed from         1 15 to 325 fathoms by merely shifting
our position about 7 miles to the northward ; and the heavier water wonld
of course gravitate towards the greater depth, where (Station 7) we found
the maximum of density anywhere met with on the Atlantic slope of the
"ridge."
   50. Taking these facts in connexion with those to be next stated in
regard to the Specific Gravity of the water at different depths within the
Strait (t. e. on the Mediterranean slope of the " ridge") and on the " ridge"
itself, I cannot but regard     it as a fair conclusion that this excess is due to
the deep outflow of Mediterranean water over that ridge. It is not a little
significant that the effect of this outflow should be so distinctly traceable
as far as Station    1, — a fact which   seems to me    to negative the hypothesis
of Captain Spratt, that this dense bottom-water is derived from the remote
region of the Atlantic to the south of 30° Lat. : for (1) the excess of eva
poration in that area must be effectually neutralized, in the area between
Cape St. Vincent and Mogador, by the vast quantity of fresh water brought
down by the Guadiana, the Guadalquiver, and the rivers of Morocco ; whilst
(2) all our knowledge of the movement of Oceanic water along the N.W.
coast of Africa (§ 63) indicates that it has a southward rather than a
northward direction.        Further, the Temperature observations made both
last year (Report, §§ 75, 76) and this year (§ 62), indicate that any surface-
outflow of Mediterranean water is more likely to take place along the
European than along the African side.
   51. Proceeding within the Strait, we took up on August 21st our first
position off Tarifa, where a sample of water taken from the bottom at 330
fathoms gave the high Specific Gravity of 1*0293; clearly showing its
Mediterranean character.           Samples taken at depths of 200 and 150
fathoms gave almost exactly the same Sp. Gr., as did also a second pair of
samples taken in nearly the same part of the Strait at 1 50 fathoms and 125
fathoms ; from a comparison of which observations with those taken be
tween Gibraltar and Ceuta (§ 54), it appears that the dense Mediterra
nean water lies about 100 fathoms nearer the surface over a 300 fathoms
bottom, than it does where the bottom sinks to more than 500 fathoms. —
It  was not a  little unexpected to find a marked excess in the density of the
*«r/ace-water in the first set of observations, its Sp. Gr. being as high as
 1*0275.    This seemed attributable to the prevalence of a fresh Easterly
wmd, producing a westward drift of Mediterranean water that mingled with
the surface inflow from the Atlantic ; it must, however, have been local
and transient, since at a later part of the day, in nearly the same spot, the
Sp. Gr. of the surface-water was found to have returned to its ordinary
standard (within the Strait) of 1*0271. — The observations made this day
with the Current-drag, although not so continuous or complete as those
taken subsequently, made it clear that both the upper and the under-cur
rent are not only greatly influenced in rate, but may be completely
reversed in direction, by Tidal agency.           One hour after High water, the

                      ' Shearwater'                                        569

•ur/ace-stratum was found to be moving eastwards at the rate of 1*7
mile an hour ; 3^ hours later, the direction was still the same, hut the
 rale had diminished to l-5 mile an hour ; 2 hours after Low water, when
 the tide was rising, the surface-current was moving to the westward at the
 rate of 1 mile per hour ; and at 4-5 hours after Low water, its direction
 being still the same, its rate of movement had fallen to 0-4 mile per hour.
 In the earlier part of the day, the unrfer-current at 150 fathoms was found
 to  be moving to the eastward, but an accident prevented the determination
 of its rate.  In the afternoon, however,  2 hours after Low water, a current-
 drag suspended at a depth of 125 fathoms moved westward at a rate of
 1'35 mile an hour ; which, allowance being made for the resistance to the
 motion of the surface-buoy, was considered by Capt. Nares to indicate that
 the rate of westward flow of the under-current was really 1*5 mile per
 hour, exceeding that of the surface-movement in the same direction by
 0*5 mile.
    52. On the following day we took up our position on the north part of
 the "ridge" between Capes Spartel and Trafalgar, over a bottom of 125
 fathoms depth.      The weather being very calm, and the water smooth,
 every thing was favourable to the prosecution of our inquiries.   The Specific
 Gravity of the wr/aee-water being 1'0271, and that of the bottom-water
  1029*2, the presumption was very strong that, while the upper stratum
 consisted of Atlantic water, the lower stratum consisted of Mediterranean
 water ; and the first question to be determined was the depth of each. We
 found that   at 50 fathoms the Sp.  Gr. had increased to 1*0273, and that at
 100 fathoms the Sp. Gr. showed a further increase to 1*0276 ; but that a
 marked increase from this to l-0290 showed itself before the depth of 110
fathoms was reached ; so that while the lower part of the Atlantic stratum
 showed a sufficient admixture of Mediterranean water to affect very sen
 sibly its Specific Gravity, the stratum below 1 1 0 fathoms might be con
 sidered as consisting essentially of Mediterranean water.
    53. The experiments with the Current-drag were commenced at 2J-
 hours after High water, when the ebb-tide was running eastwards. The
current on the surface was running inwards at the rate of l-25 mile per
hour; and this was also found to be its rate at 25 fathoms depth. When
the drag, suspended from a small boat, was lowered to 100 fathoms, it still
moved to the eastward, but at a slower rate      ; the surface-current passing
the boat at the (estimated) rate of 0'25 mile per hour. The drag being
then lowered to 119 fathoms, and suspended from a buoy, it first moved
eastwards at the rate of 0- 18 mile per hour ; and then at Low water, while
the sur/izee-current was still moving east, it began to move we«<wards,
retarded at first by the action of the surface-current on the floating buoy.
At 1 hour after Low water, the surface-current having stopped running,
the current•drag had drifted 0' 18 mile to the west; but as it was found
then to have grounded in 118 fathoms, its line was shortened to 108
fathoms. It immediately ran away with its buoy to the westward, drag
                                                                 2t2

570                       Dr. W. B. Carpenter on tlie                    [June 13,
ging it fast through the surface-water, which was itself setting in the same
direction, against a light west wind ; and its rate, at 2£ hours after low
water, was estimated at      1 *2 mile per hour, that of the surface being esti
mated at 0-5 mile per     hour. — Thus it     appeared that in this situation both
the upper (Atlantic) current        and the lower (Mediterranean) current fol
lowed the direction      of the Tidal movement, and that their rates were
greatly affected by it ; but a comparison of the relative amounts of the
flow in each case showed a decided excess in the movement of the upper
current to the eastward, and a no less decided excess in the movement of
the Mnrfer-current to the westward.         For taking 2^ hours after each turn of
the tide as  the time of greatest velocity of each current, the comparison of
estimated rates   (§ 60) stands thus : —

Surface-current
 Under-current    W.<      ¦¦1*2   mile per hour.     —»-E.    0'88 mile per hour.
    Thus the excess of inflow of the upper current being at the rate of 0*75
mile per hour, that of owtfflow of the under-current was 0*32 mile per hour.
    54. Having then proceeded to Gibraltar, our first day's work (Aug. 26)
at the Mediterranean end of the Strait was chiefly devoted to experiments
with Mr. Siemens's Photometric apparatus ; the results of which, as they
were not altogether satisfactory,        I think it better not to record. But the
 opportunity was taken to obtain a series of Specific Gravities at different
 depths in mid-channel       between Europa Point and the African coast.          A
 strong easterly wind was blowing through the day, raising a considerable
 swell ; and this had an obvious effect on the Sp. Gr. of the upper stratum,
 which showed     a decided admixture       of Mediterranean water with the At
 lantic water properly forming it ; for instead of the 1*0271, which we had
 found last year in this situation when a moderate westerly wind was
 blowing, the Sp. Gr. of the surface-water proved to be T0277; at 100
 fathoms it had increased to 1*0279 ; and the same Sp. Gr. was found
 at 200 fathoms.       At 250 fathoms, however,        as in the two observations
 made in the former year at the same part of the Strait, we came upon un
 mistakable Mediterranean water, its Sp. Gr. being 1029*5; this showed
 itself again at 300 fathoms, and again in water taken from the bottom at
 480 fathoms.      Notwithstanding, therefore, the unusually high Sp. Gr. of
 the upper    stratum, the slightness of the increase down to 200 fathoms,
 and the marked increase encountered between 200 and 250 fathoms, clearly
 showed that its character was essentially Atlantic ; and thus we had di
 stinct evidence that the Mediterranean stratum here lies at least 200 fathoms
from the surface.       It  was   further interesting to remark that the whole of
 the lower stratum was composed of densest Mediterranean water; whereas
 in two observations made last year at an interval of six weeks, the water at
  the bottom was found to be of less Sp. Gr. than the water at 250 fathoms.
 It  thus appears that in this peculiar channel considerable          changes   may

be produced, even at a depth                 of from 400 to 500 fathoms, by the action of
Winds and Tides.
   55. On the 28th of August we proceeded to make a series of experi
ments with the Current-drag in the deep water off Point Cires on the
African 6ide ; first, however, making a series of observations on the Specific
Gravity of the water at different depths, for the purpose of ascertaining the
position of the plane of separation between the two strata.       This was very
clearly indicated  as  lying between   200   and  225   fathoms ; for while the
Sp. Gr. of the surface-water was l'02/9 (being evidently raised by the
westerly drift of Mediterranean water, kept up by the continuance of a
strong East wind), and that of the water at 200 fathoms was T0283, the
Sp. Gr. at 225 fathoms was 1-0298, and at 250 and 300 fathoms it was
1'0296.    The continued strong East wind (force 6) obviously had a de
cided effect in retarding the «ur/ac«-current, which, as the tide was ebbing
during the whole series of observations, would probably have set very
strongly to the eastward      being near the date of full-moon) but for this

  It thus appeared (1) that the influence of the ebb on the under-current
was exerted earlier and more strongly than on the upper current, the
former at first moving                eastwards at the rate of 2'G miles an hour, whilst
the rate of the latter was only                   1   mile   but (2) that at
                                                              ;               more advanced

period of the ebb the relative                    rates   were reversed, that of the surface-
current  having increased to 44 miles an hour, and being still 3'3 miles
when the drag, hanging at the same depth (225 fathoms) as in the first
observation, showed a movement of the under-current of only 1*4 mile. —
This           the question whether the rapid flow of the Under-current on

raises a  " head " of   water, the pressure of which must produce an outward
 Under-current   ; as is evidenced by the continuance of the surface in-current,
 which would otherwise       cease as soon as the rise   of the water is sufficient
 to neutralize by excess of gravity the force of the wind.            Now here,
although the westerly drift produced by the wind is not antagonized by
the direct obstacle of a land-barrier, yet the strong in-current which meets
it will obviously have the like tendency to raise   a
                                                      " head" of water, especially
 in that narrowest part of the Strait which       lies between Tarifa and Point
 Alcazar ; and the increase of pressure produced by this, acting in the direc
 tion of the Tidal movement of the under-current, would obviously tend to
 accelerate it.
    56. With the view of obtaining another set of observations on the
 deeper (southern) part of the
                                   " ridge," we proceeded thither during the
 night, and took up our position, on the morning of the 29th, about 7
 miles W.S.W. of Cape Spartel.         There was a slight Westerly wind, with
 a smooth sea.      The Specific Gravity of the surface-water, taken 2 hours
 after low water, when the flow of the tide was giving a westerly movement
 to both strata, was 1'0275 ; thus showing, by its excess above the ordinary
 standard of Atlantic water, that the surface-drift from the Mediterranean
produced by the continuance of strong Easterly wind had reached this end
of the Strait. The Sp. Gr. at 130 fathoms was 1-0282, at 155 fathoms
it was T0284, and was the same on the bottom at 180 fathoms. Thus it
 appeared that as the lower stratum here consists of a mixture of Mediter
ranean and Atlantic water, the predominance of the outward under-current
is not indicated so strongly by Sp. Gr. as it is on the shallower (northern)
part of the ridge, where the lowest stratum consists of nearly pure Medi
terranean water (§52). — The results of this day's experiments with the
Current-drag    confirmed the conclusion indicated by the previous series, as
to the complete Tidal reversal of both currents at this end of the Strait ;
whilst they gave even stronger evidence of the excess of inward movement
in the upper stratum, and of outward movement in the lower.            From 2 to
5 hours after Low water, the *ur/ace-current was running westwards at the
rate of 0*75 mile ; it then slackened, became stationary at High water, and
then flowed «w£wards, its rate increasing at 3| hours after High water to
1*2 mile per hour.        On the other hand, the unrfer-current at 3| hours
after Low water was shown, by a drag hung at 155 fathoms depth, to be
flowing westwards at the estimated rate of l-25 mile per hour, and from
3^ to 4£
           hours was   still running at the rate of 1*10 mile ; whilst at from
3 to 3^ hours after     High water it flowed eastwards at the estimated rate
of only 0-67 mile per hour ; the excess of inflow of the upper-current, and
that of outflow of the under-current, being thus each 0"45 mile per hour.

  position occupied on the 28th ; with the view of experimenting in the
  narrow part of the Strait for as long a period of the flood-tide as possible,
  so as to compare the results with those previously taken during the ebb.
  The wind was here still from the East, with a force of from 3 to 4. A
 *«r/bce-current-drag having been put over very soon after Low water, it
  drifted at first nearly due South, or across the channel, but in the second
  and third hours changed its course to the S.W., moving at the rate of 1'6
 and 1 -5 mile per hour.      Having got into the in-shore current near the
 African side, the drag was then taken up and started afresh in the middle
 of the Strait, close to the under-current-drag ; and it then, between 4 and
  5 hours after Low water, drifted W.S.W. at the rate of 0-55 mile per
 hour. At nigh water, the surface-drag became stationary, and soon after
 commenced drifting to the eastward.         As the wind freshened at the same
 time to a force of 6, the surface-drag was taken up ; but the drift of the
 ship during the rest of the ebb-tide denoted a strong east-running surface-
 current. The direction of the under-current, as indicated by a current-
 drag at 250 fathoms depth, was very decidedly westward, while the sur
 face-buoy was moving nearly due south ; and its rate at 2j hours from
 the beginning of the ebb was estimated at 1 -8 mile per hour.           At from
 3 to 4 hours after low water, the rate of the westward under-current         was
  1*6   mile;   at from  4 to 5 hours     it was still 1*25  mile; and between
 5 hours and high water      it was  0-8.    The direction of the under-current
 changed at High water ; and at 1   hour afterwards it had acquired an ratt ward
 rate of l'O mile, which increased to 1*6 at 2 hours after     H. W., its inward
 rate thus approaching to an equality with its outward rate during the flood,
 which may not improbably have proceeded (as on the 28th) to an absolute
 excess. — It may fairly be questioned, however, whether the strength of
 this easterly Under-current during the ebb was not to be attributed (as
 already suggested) to the continuance of the strong Easterly wind, which
 by heaping up the surface-water, would augment the downward pressure
 on the under-stratum.      It is considered by Capt. Nares, whose judgment
 on such a point is entitled to great weight, that the observations made at
 the Mediterranean end of the Strait are not by any means so satisfactory
 as those made on the "ridge" at the Atlantic end; since "the eddies
 " which would naturally be expected at this part, in consequence of the
 " funnel-shaped mouth of the Strait, complicate the movements and prevent
 " such exact demonstrations as those found further to the westward, where
 " the  current-stream   runs more steadily."
    58. Giving our chief attention, then, to the phenomena presented at the
Western extremity of the Straits, we find these to be as follows : —
    I.  There is a reversal, with every ebb and flow of the Tide, in the direc
tion alike of the upper and of the under-current : but while the under
current is the stronger during the flood or outgoing tide, the upper current
is the stronger during the ebb or ingoing tide ; and while the balance of
the oi^ward and inward movement during each tide            is decidedly inwards

574                          Dr. W. B. Carpenter on      the             [3\mc 13,
in    the upper     current,   it is decidedly ow/wards in the wncfer-current
(§§53,56).
    II.  The upper stratum here always consists of nearly unmixed Atlantic
water ; showing that the westerly flow which takes place during the ebb
is insufficient to bring Mediterranean water from the opposite end of the
Strait.     The increase sometimes observable (§§ 51, 54) in the Sp. Gr. of
the surface-water of the Strait appears attributable rather to wind-drift
than to tidal movement.
    III.   On the other hand, the under stratum here (as at the opposite end
 of the Strait) either consists entirely of Mediterranean water, or shows a
large admixture of it ; and as this is the case alike during the inward and
 the outward movement of the under stratum, it seems obvious that Medi
 terranean water must extend some distance to the westward, — since, if it
 merely came up to the
                                 " ridge " without crossing it, the tidal inflow
would replace it by Atlantic water.            And this inference is confirmed by
the fact that an admixture of Mediterranean water is distinctly traceable
far into the Atlantic basin (§ 49).
    IV. The stratum of Mediterranean water which is found at a depth
between 100 and 125 fathoms             on the "ridge" (§ 52) must be derived
 from   the  stratum   which,  in  the  deeper part of the Strait (extending west
ward as far as Tarifa), lies at more than 200 fathoms from the surface.
 Hence the lower or Mediterranean           stratum   must form an inclined   plane
 from Tarifa to the     " ridge,"    the surface of which    is about 100 fathoms
 higher   at its western than at its eastern end ; and as the distance between
 these two points is about 15 miles, the gradient will be about — — —
 or about    1  in 132.   But it must    be remembered that we have not here to
 do with the absolute        weight of this body of water, but only with the
 difference in Sp. Gr. between water of (say) 1*027 and water of l-029;
 which is less than 1 -500th part of the absolute weight of the water which
 thus runs up-hill.     And with the evidence we have in the Florida Channel
 (§§ 129-133) of the passage of the denser because colder water over the
 shallowest part of the Narrows, there is no improbability in the like
 flow of the denser because more saline water over the marine water
 shed which separates         the Mediterranean from the Atlantic basin, if
 there be a predominant westerly movement in the under-stratum.                 But
 if  there were no such movement, — the             under-stratum   being either at
 rest, or its flux and reflux being equal, — there      seems no reason why this
 inclination of its surface should       be maintained against the operation of
 Gravity, which will be constantly tending to bring it to a level.
    59. I venture, therefore, still to maintain that the existence of a Tidal
 flux and reflux in the Gibraltar currents does not prove that they are
 entirely sustained by tidal action ; any more than the existence of an
 alternate ebb and flow in a river proves that there is no down-flowing
 stream.      In every tidal river, the ebb is stronger on the whole than the

                       ' Shearwater'                                              575

flood ; the excess being proportional to the amount of fresh water which
the upper part of the river brings down. And thus it happens that a
floating body thrown into such a river is at last carried out to sea, though
it may have been brought back by the tide twenty, fifty, or a hundred
times, each time stopping at a point a little further down than before.
Now there can be no doubt whatever, that, putting the action of Wind out
of the question, a vessel which enters the Western end of the Strait would
be gradually carried into the Mediterranean by the predominant easterly
movement of the upper current ; though its general easterly progress would
 be interrupted by a succession of returns to the westward, or, when there
might be no actual return, by periods of rest. And the evidence appears
 to  me  just  as conclusive, that  if a body  could be so weighted as to remain
 freely suspended in the Mediterranean         stratum off Gibraltar, and its move
 ments could be watched from above, we should               find it in like manner
 gradually working its way towards the opposite end of the Strait, and at
 last clearing the " ridge
                                " to descend along the Atlantic
                                                                       slope beyond.
 This it could not do unless the Tidal action were supplemented by an out
 flow produced by some other agency ; and such an agency exists in the
 excess of lateral pressure in the Mediterranean column above that of the
 Atlantic column, which is proportional to the excess of the Specific Gravity
 of Mediterranean water. — In the strong continuous Under-currents              whose
  existence in the Dardanelles and in the Baltic Sound has now been con
 clusively   established, we see what larger differences in Specific Gravity,
 uncomplicated       by Tidal action, can effect.        (See Appendix      II. ; also
 § 134.)
     60. In   one respect   it appears to me that the Specific Gravity observa
 tions, — by which it     can be certainly determined whether the water at any
 given depth       is Atlantic, Mediterranean, or a mixture of the two, — are
  more satisfactory than those made by the Current-drag.              For the actual
  movement of the drag can only give the real rate of movement of the
  stratum in which it is hanging, when that rate is the same as that of
  the surface-stratum      in which the suspending buoy is floating ; in which
  case there will be no       pull of the buoy upon the drag, or of the drag
  upon the buoy (see Appendix II.).          If the HHtfer-current be flowing faster
  than the upper, the drag will be kept back by the buoy ; whilst if the sur
face-current be flowing faster than the deeper stratum, the drag will be
  pulled onwards by the buoy.       If, again, the two strata be moving in opposite
  directions, the reciprocal influence of the drag and the buoy will make the
  observed rate still more different from the real rate, and perhaps will even
  render both stationary. Hence the actual rate of the under-current can only
  be estimated from the observed rate of movement of the suspending buoy; and
  the rule adopted by Capt. Nares in making such estimates was to halve the
  difference between the observed rate of the suspending-buoy and that of the
  surface-current, and to add this half to the former when the rate of the under
  current was the greater, deducting     it when the rate of the surface-current   was
  the greater.    Thus when the surface-current     was running at  1 -0 mile an hour,

576                        Dr. W. B. Carpenter on the                  [June 13,
and the buoy moved in the same direction at the rate of 1 *35 mile per hour,
the real rate of the under-current was estimated at r35 + 0-17, or 1-52 mile
per hour.     On the other hand when the surface-current was running at 4*4
miles per hour, and the buoy moved in the same direction at the rate of
3'2 miles per hour, the real rate of the under-current was estimated at
3-2 — 07, or 2'5 miles per hour.
   61. In the event of any renewal of such experiments, either in the
Strait of Gibraltar or elsewhere, I should recommend that the relative re
sistances of the Current-drag and of the Suspending-buoy at different rates
of movement should be tested, in the first instance, by drawing them sepa
rately through still water with a Dynamometer attached to the line ; and
further, that by suspending the current-drag at different depths, and by
testing the resistance then offered in each case by the drag and the line
conjointly, the amount due to the latter should be determined by the eli
mination of the former.       If in  this manner the amount  of resistance that is
offered by (say) every 20 fathoms of the line from which the drag is
suspended be ascertained, we shall have satisfactory data for determining,
with  a near approach to accuracy, the actual rate      of the current in which
the drag is suspended.      For as it may be     pretty certainly determined by
Specific  Gravity  observations   to what depth the upper stratum extends at the
point of observation, it will be easy to compute, on the one hand, the force
exerted by its current upon the suspending-buoy and on the upper part of
the line that hangs from it ; and, on the other, the force of the under
current, not only upon the drag, but upon the portion of the suspending
line that hangs in    it : and from these data the actual rate of the under
current can be readily worked out with a near approach to accuracy.
    62. Temperature of the Strait of Gibraltar. — It will be remembered
that in the previous year's work a marked reduction of Temperature was
observed in the mid-stream of the Strait, as compared with the water
nearer the Spanish side ; and the inference drawn from these observations
was, that
            " either the water of which the in-current consists is drawn from
"  a part  of the Atlantic at least as far north as Lisbon, or that it is derived
 " from a stratum of the neighbouring ocean somewhat beneath the surface,
" so as to have received less of the solar superheating than the actual surface-
" water" (Report for 1870, § 74). On the other hand, the excess of
temperature in the surface-water of the northern side of the Western em
bouchure of the Strait was considered as indicating that there is a predo
minant surface-outflow of Mediterranean water along the Spanish coast ;
a fact, I was informed, well known to those who have navigated it (§ 75).
— Being desirous of obtaining further information on this point, I requested
Capt. Nares to take observations of surface-temperature at short intervals,
on the two occasions on which we were running obliquely across the
Strait.   One of these series (I.) extends along a line of about 10 miles from
the neighbourhood of the Pearl Rock, at the entrance of Gibraltar Bay, to
a short distance west of Point Cires on the African Coast; the other

   Besides these, another Series       (III.)  was taken  along the African coast,
between a point a little to the west of Cape             Spartel and the western
entrance of Tangier Bay.          And other observations taken to the S.E. of
Europa Point gave temperatures of 72° and 71°'5, which corresponded
with those obtained last year near the entrance of the Mediterranean, its
proper temperature being here somewhat reduced by the inflow of colder
water through the Strait (Report for 1870, § 77). — Hence it appears that
whilst the water nearest the Spanish coast in Scries I. had the temperature
of the Mediterranean, there       was a rapid fall in the thermometer as we came
into the mid-stream,         and a still further reduction   occurred towards the
African    side, — the   lowest temperature observed being 13°-5 beneath the
highest, simply in changing our place a few miles to the southward.                 At
Tarifa the influence of the Mediterranean temperature was less marked ;
but the temperatures taken near the African side within the embouchure
of the Strait were nearly as low as in Series I.
   63. I learn from Dr. Hooker, who has lately visited Morocco, that the
prevalence along that coast of a temperature decidedly below that of the
opposite coast of Spain, is a fact which has long been known locally ;
and that it is indicated at present by the character of the Flora, whilst a
still more marked reduction in past times is marked by the Boreal
character of the Shells found in           the later Tertiary deposits.        Looking
to the fact that a general southerly set is traceable in the water of this part
of the Atlantic, — partly produced, it would appear, by predominant northerly
wind-drift, and partly by the indraught requisite to supply the westerly
Atlantic drift produced by the Trade Winds (§ 120), — I am disposed to
think that the lower temperature of the Gibraltar in-current is due to its
original derivation, not from the portion of the Atlantic immediately
outside it on the same parallel, but from an area of lower surface-tem
perature to the north-west.           But it seems at the same time not impro
bable that just as the water which flows over a mill-dam is drawn, not so

 much from the surface-stratum,          as from a stratum a      little below it*, so the
 current which is (as      it were) sucked-in through the Strait to supply the
 excess   of evaporation in the Mediterranean should be drawn from a sub
 surface stratum, and should thus bring with it a lower temperature.
    64. On our entrance into the Mediterranean,               we kept      in the first in
 stance along the African coast, and took frequent observations of surface-
 temperature ; but we found that we soon lost all indication of the depres
 sion observed within the Strait, the thermometer never falling lower than
 70°  ;  so that this    cold in-current    speedily loses its peculiar character by
 mingling with the general body of Mediterranean               water.

    65. Temperature. — The Temperature-phenomena of the Eastern basin
of the Mediterranean were found to correspond in all essential points with
those previously determined in the Western.                The limitation in the thick
ness of the stratum superheated by direct insolation, and the almost exact
uniformity of temperature beneath this                stratum     down to the greatest
depths, are features no less characteristic of the former than of the latter,
— being, in fact, yet more remarkable in the circumstance that the range
of depth in the Eastern basin is about 500 fathoms greater than in the
Western, some parts of its bottom lying at nearly 2200 fathoms depth
from its surface.       But certain differences were also noted which are suffi
ciently important to deserve being stated in detail.
    66. It should be mentioned, in the first place, that                  the heat of the
latter part of September 1871 was felt at Malta to be peculiarly oppres
sive, the temperature of the air occasionally rising to 90°, and that of the
sea to 80°    ;  and that this high temperature did not suffer much reduction
as we proceeded towards Egypt during the first fortnight of October.                      On
the 3rd of that month, in Lat. 35° 54' N. and Long. 16° 23' E., the sur
face-temperature of the sea was still 80°           ;  and on the 11th, in Lat. 32°
 1
   7£' N. and Long. 26° 44'
                                    E., it was 79°  :   at the former     of  these stations
the    io/fom-temperature       at 1650 fathoms was          56°, — thus     corresponding
exactly    with  the  bottom-temperature       which   we   obtained    last  year at 1 743
fathoms (in Lat. 36° 31' N. and Long. 15° 46' E.) a little to the east of
Malta, — and      at the latter  it  was 56°-7 at 1970 fathoms.
    67.   A  series of Soundings was made (at my request) by Capt. Nares
at each of these Stations, for the determination of the Temperature at suc
cessive intervals of 10 fathoms, from the surface down to 100 fathoms;
and below this at intervals of 50 fathoms, until the depth should be
reached at which the temperature becomes uniform down to the bottom.
The results of these soundings are given in Columns                  III.  and IV. of the

   These results are also graphically expressed, as regards the superficial
stratum, by the Curves in Diagram 11., Plate IV.
   68. Now it will be observed that in these four Series the rates of descent
are by no means in accordance with each other, the differences between the
first three, however, being much less than between any one of them and
the fourth.   The nearest resemblance is that which exists between Nos. I.
and    III.;  for although the surface-temperature    is 5£° higher in the
latter, the rates of reduction at successive depths so nearly correspond, as
to give the two curves a general parallelism ; the temperature in No.            III.
at    100fathoms being still 30-4 above the temperature at the same
depth in No. I.  But while in No. I. the temperature exhibits no further
reduction down to the bottom at 58G fathoms, it falls 2° between
 100 and 200 fathoms in   No.   III.,   so as to come down to   within little more
 than a degree of the temperature of the constant stratum in No.           I.,   and

5 80                         Dr. W. B. Carpenter on the                      [June ] 3,
nearly the whole of this excess it retains to the hottom at 16fi0 fathoms.
The rate of reduction in No. II. differs from the preceding in being much
more rapid between 10 and 20 fathoms; the reduction in that stratum
being 9°-5, as against 4°-3 in No. I., and 3°-6 in No.          III.    And this de
pression extends to the subjacent strata ; the temperature falling almost to
its minimum at 50 fathoms.           On the other hand in No. IV. the tempera
ture of the upper stratum shows a much leas rapid reduction than in either
No. I., II., or    III. ; the high surface-temperature      being carried down to
30 fathoms with a loss of only 3|°.           Between 30 and 40 fathoms, however,
the reduction is more considerable, amounting to 6£° ; but from this depth
to 60 fathoms, the temperature is still about six degrees higher than at the
like depth in No.      III. ; and whilst at 60 fathoms the temperature in No.
III.  is only 3°-7 above that of the bottom, it is 8°-8 above that of the
bottom in No. IV.          Whilst in No. III., however, the further reduction
takes pla«e very slowly, so that the temperature only falls l°-2 between
60 and 100 fathoms, there is a fall of 6° in this stratum of No. IV., which
brings down the temperature at 100 fathoms to within one degree of the
temperature at the same depth in No.            III. A slight excess appears to be
maintained at yet greater depths ; the temperature at 200 fathoms being
2° higher in    No.   IV.  than in No.    III.,  and being still l°-8 higher in No.
IV. than the temperature of the bottom, whilst in No.                III.  it is at that
depth only     0°-5  higher;   and  the  bottom-temperature    of  No.    IV.,   even at
a depth    of  1970 fathoms, was 0'7       in excess of the bottom-temperature        of
No.   III.  at 1 650  fathoms.
    69.  It would   thus appear : — (1) that the high surface-temperature which
we met with during the early part of October, in proceeding from Malta to
Alexandria,    extended to a much greater depth in Long. 26° 44' E. than it
did in Long. 16° 23' E. ; (2) that the stratum of which the temperature is
considerably raised by insolation was much thicker at the former than at
the latter station ; and (3) that the temperature of the stratum between
 100 and 200 fathoms still exhibits in the Eastern basin some evidence of
being influenced by direct insolation, the bottom-temperature which is met
with in the Western basin at all depths below 100 fathoms being here not
encountered until 200 fathoms have been passed.
    70. How far these differences are due to the different conditions of the
Eastern and Western basins, or are attributable to the remarkable prolon
gation of a high Summer temperature in the season of 1871, is a point
which can only be determined by a much more extended series of observa
tions.    There are, however, some considerations which may help us to a
probable    conclusion.  — In   the first place, it appears certain that a higher
«ur/ace-temperature      prevails over the Eastern basin generally than over the
Western.      This is doubtless partly due to its lower Latitude ; for whilst the
axis of the Western basin may be considered to correspond with the parallel
of 38°, that of the Eastern corresponds with the parallel of 34°. But what
has probably a yet greater effect, is the absence along the Eastern             portion

of North Africa of      any mountain-barrier like that of the Atlas and other
ridges which intervene between the Sahara and the coasts of Morocco and
Algeria, and cool down those heated winds which blow from Central Africa
without any moderating influence over the low expanse of Tripoli and Egypt.
And further, while the surface-temperature of the Western basin is also
kept down by the admission of colder water through the Straits of Gibraltar,
that of the Eastern basin will be elevated rather than depressed by the dis
charge of the vast body of water brought down by the Nile through the
hottest months of the year.      And thus it comes to pass that the summer
isotherm of 80° which runs through the interior of Northern Africa from
Mogador to the Syrtis, thence follows the coast-line between Tunis and
 Syria, then turns northwards along the coast of Syria, and returns along
 the coast of Asia Minor, so as to enclose the Levant in a "bight" of
high temperature. — Looking, again, to the fact that the fioMom-tempera-
 ture was found in the previous year to be somewhat higher, even in the
Western basin, to the east of Sardinia, than nearer the Strait of Gibraltar,
 I think it probable that the permanent bottom-temperature of the whole
 Eastern portion of the Mediterranean is about 2° higher than that of the
 Western. The cause of this difference, also, is to be sought in the conditions
 which affect the surface-temperature ; for, as I showed in my last year's
 Report (§§ 88-91), the complete separation between the deeper water of
 the Mediterranean and that of the Atlantic will cause the temperature of
 the former to be the lowest mean of the locality ; and thus as the winter
surface-temperature of the Eastern basin is somewhat above that of the
Western, its 6ortom-temperature also will be higher. A remarkable con
firmation of this view is afforded by the fact already stated respecting the
 temperature of the Gulf of Suez (§ 11).
    71. It might be anticipated, therefore, that such an excess of tempera
 ture in the whole superficial stratum heated by direct insolation would
 show itself in the Eastern basin, as is represented by Series III. (Table and
 Diagram) when compared with Series I. and II. But the extraordinary
 elevation shown in the superficial stratum of No. IV. seems to betoken
 some special calorifying agency ; for although the difference of about 3|°
 of Latitude in favour of that Station might account for a general elevation,
 yet as this does not show itself at all in the aur/frce-temperature, and
 scarcely at all in the 6ottojn-temperature, there seems no reason for its
 showing itself to such a marked degree in the intermediate temperatures, —
 especially in those of 20 and 30 fathoms.       Now if I was correct in the
interpretation which I gave, in my last year's Report (§§90, 91), of the
mode in which the Sun's heat penetrates downwards by co?wection, — the
surface-films successively concentrated by evaporation sinking until their
excess of density is lost by diffusion, — it is obvious that the longer the
 continuance of surface-heat, especially if combined with dryness, the deeper
 would its influence extend, though the surface-temperature might not itself
be raised. For, as I then remarked, " the continual repetition of this process

582                       Dr. W. B. Carpenter on the                   [June 13,
"  through the hot season will carry the elevation of temperature further
"  and further down ; but so soon as the temperature of the Air falls much
"  below that of the Sea, the surface-layer being cooled will become heavier
" and   sink, and will thus carry down cold instead of heat."      Now as Series
IV.   was taken not merely eight    days later than Series III., but also con
siderably nearer to the northern coast of Africa, from which a hot dry wind
was continually blowing,     I am inclined to believe that this remarkable
downward      extension of a temperature as high as the mean between the
surface-temperatures of Nos. I. and II. is attributable to these accidental
influences, the local effect of which would      be very  little interfered with
in this part of the Mediterranean by any horizontal movement of water, —
neither tides nor currents having any considerable force along the Tripoli
Coast. — It may be hoped that as Serial temperature-observations down to
 100 fathoms can be made with very little difficulty or expenditure of time,
such observations may be systematically prosecuted in different parts of the
Eastern basin, so that it may be ascertained what are the conditions by
which the rate of reduction of temperature from the surface downwards is
determined.
    72.  Density of Water. — It might be anticipated that a higher density
would prevail in the Eastern basin of the Mediterranean than in the Western,
for two reasons : — first, that the hot and dry winds of the Libyan desert,
unchecked and untempered by the interposition of any mountain-range,
would produce a greater evaporation from its surface ; and second, that
the reduction produced by the inflow of Atlantic water would scarcely
operate at so great a distance.    Accordingly the analyses of Prof. Forch-
hammer gave a larger proportion of saline matter in the water to the east
ward of Malta ; and my own determinations of Specific Gravity lead to
the same result.     These observations, which were frequently repeated upon
surface-water as we proceeded eastward from Malta, did not at first indicate
any decided increase in density ; for in the previous year (Report for 1870,
§ 92) we had found the Sp. Gr. of the surface-water in the neighbourhood
of Sicily to average l-0280, sometimes rising as high as l-0284 ; whilst
between Malta and Crete we now found it to vary between 1*0284 and
 l-0288. The Sp. Gr. of the sample brought up by the water-bottle from
the depth of 2000 fathoms, in the Sounding taken on the 3rd of October
about 100 miles to the east of Malta, was T0291 ; thus being slightly in
excess   of that of the surface-water,   which was     1'0288.      In  the deep
Sounding taken eight days afterwards, not far from the Gulf of Solloom on
the Libyan coast, the density was found still greater ; the Sp. Gr. of the
bottom-water obtained from a depth of 1050 fathoms being 1*0294, while
that of the surface-water was 1'0293.      In another Sounding taken on the
following day nearer the coast of Africa, the density of the bottom-water at
a depth of 3G5 fathoms was fouud to be much more in excess of that of
the surface-water ; the Sp. Gr. of the former being l-0302, while that of
the latter was only 1 -0294.    These results agreed in a very marked manner

with those obtained last year in the Western Basin (Report for 1 870, § 94),
as to the fact of the difference in Salinity between the surface- and bottom-
water being greatest where the depth is moderate ; and the fact of course
becomes yet more significant when the general increase of Salinity is so
marked.       There appears, then, no reason to doubt the explanation offered
last year   ; viz. that supposing an equal degree of concentration by surface-
evaporation to take place in two or more equal areas, the elevation of the
Sp. Gr. of the entire column of underlying water will be inversely propor
tional   to the height    of that column    :  for the diffusion of equal amounts
of  concentrated water through columns whose heights are in the proportion
of   1, 2, 3, will raise the Sp. Gr. of these columns respectively in the pro
portion of 3, 2, 1 ; the shortest column being most affected, while the
longest, in which the same amount of concentrated water is diffused through
three times the quantity, has its density but little raised.
    73. Nature of Bottom. — The character of the bottom indicated by the
two deep Soundings which we took in the Eastern basin, corresponded
with that which was ascertained last year to prevail in the deeper part of
the Western, — the samples of the deposit brought up by the Sounding-
apparatus showing it to consist entirely of clayey mud composed of par
ticles in a state of extremely minute division, and the water brought up by
the water-bottle from the stratum immediately overlying the bottom being
rendered turbid by the presence of like finely divided particles in suspen
sion.     Mud of    a similar character has been       almost universally       found by
Capt. Spratt* and Capt. Nares (both of whom have been engaged in sur
veying the Eastern Basin of the Mediterranean) at depths exceeding
250-300 fathoms; sometimes, however, containing minute Foraminiferal
shells.     A careful examination of the two samples just alluded to gave no
trace either of Foraminifera or of any other Organic forms ; and as it is
only in comparatively shallow waters that such traces are met with, I am in
clined to believe that wherever they occur they must have been derived
from such a littoral bottom as we found along the Tripoli coast, where
Foraminifera abounded at depths of from 100 to 150 fathoms. — The
material of the muddy deposit on the bottom of the Eastern basin must
probably be for the most part derived from the Nile ; and that it should
have exactly the same character near the western border of the basin as
it has in much closer proximity to the mouths of that river, is a striking
indication of the enormous amount of such material which must be brought
down by its current, and of the length of time required for the subsidence
of the most finely divided particles.
    74.   In  my last year's Report (§§ 100-103)         I laid great stress upon the
slow subsidence of the sedimentary particles, and the turbidity of the bottom-
water which is thus produced, as possibly accounting for the scantiness of
Animal life on the deep-sea bottom of the Mediterranean                  ; and  I threw it
out for the consideration of Geologists, whether the                   same   explanation

Animal remains in deposits of considerable               thickness.    — This view, how
ever, has been called in question by Dr.                 McIntosh      ;   who adduces,          as
an objection to      it,
                   that many Annelids and               Nemerteans abound in            muddy
water, while some live nowhere else than amongst mud or muddy sand                               ;
and also that many littoral Sponges are found on extremely muddy
ground, while
               " the Siliceous Sponges all over the world affect muddy             a
bottom."      " In      general,"        he adds,   " muddy       ground   is   found       to   be
" much more productive in marine life of all kinds, than where the
" rocks, sea-weeds, and sands are pure           Even where the margin
" of the sea rendered perfectly turbid from mud
                is
                                                    (and this, too, calca-
" reous), as at White-Cliff Bay,   the Isle of Wight, marine animals are
                                               in
"abundant between tide-marks"*. None of the instances cited by Dr.
McIntosh are really parallel to that of the abyssal deposit of the Mediter
ranean   for they are all cases oilittoral deposit, consisting of particles very
          ;
much coarser (often mixed with sand), which the tidal movement of the
suspending water will keep washing-o^', as much as washing-on, the respi
ratory surfaces.   In no other part of our survey of the deep-sea bottom
has there been any difficulty in clearing the water immediately overlying                        it
by filtration. On our wonderfully rich
                                          " Holtenia-ground," the deposit in
which the Siliceous Sponges were imbedded was any thing but " muddy,"
forit mainly consisted of Sand and Globigerinae    and the water above
                                                              ;                                  it
was free from any turbidity, save that arising from the presence of very
young Globigerinae.   The whitening of the littoral water produced by the

     76. Gases   of the   Bottom-water.   —I    am now disposed, however, to attri
bute more influence to the other condition which          I suggested in my Report
for 1870 (§ 103)      as  likely to  operate prejudicially to Animal life; namely,
the stagnation produced by the almost entire absence of Vertical Circula
 tion.    In the great Oceanic system, if the doctrine previously advocated
be correct, every drop of water is in its turn brought to the surface, and
exposed to the purifying influence of prolonged exposure to Atmospheric
air ; whereby a large proportion of its Carbonic acid and other products of
the decomposition of Organic matter will be removed, and Oxygen will be
absorbed in their place.          But from this movement, the water of the Me
diterranean may be said to be virtually excluded.                 The effect of the
Gibraltar Currents is limited to a stratum of which the depth is very
small in comparison with that of the principal area of each basin ; and to
whatever extent they may produce a change in the water of the deeper part
of the Western basin in the neighbourhood of the Strait, it is obvious that
the amount of such change must diminish as the distance increases, and
that it cannot in any degree affect the water of the Eastern basin. Now,
as the Nile is constantly bringing down a very large quantity of Organic
matter, the finer particles of which seem to be diffused through the whole
mass of the water in the basin and to be slowly gravitating to its bottom, it
might be anticipated that in their gradual decomposition they would gene
rate Carbonic acid at the expense of the Oxygen dissolved in the water ; so
that the abyssal water, being separated from the atmosphere by an inter
vening stratum of many hundred fathoms, and being never brought to the
surface, would come to be unfit for the maintenance of Animal life.

was found that the presence of a very large proportion of Carbonic acid in
the bottom-water was not incompatible with the existence of Animal life in
great abundance.         In fact there was reason to believe that there was a
general relation of conformity between the proportion of Carbonic acid and
the quantity of Animal life on the bottom as indicated by the dredge-
results ; the effect of the respiratory and other changes produced by the
latter being to increase the proportion of Carbonic acid at the expense of the
Oxygen. Thus whilst the percentage of Oxygen in tKr/ace-water averaged
about 25 per cent., and that of Carbonic acid averaged something less than

21, the Oxygen in bottom-water did not average above 19*5 per cent., while
the Carbonic acid increased to nearly 28, — the percentage of Nitrogen
being reduced at the same time from 54 to 52-5.                The percentage of Car
bonic acid in bottom-water often rose much higher than this, being fre
quently between       30 and 40, and in one instance more than 48               ; but the
percentage of Oxygen did not show           a corresponding reduction, being never
less than 16, while that of Nitrogen came down from 54 to 34-5.                   Thus it
appeared      that so  long as Oxygen tons present in sufficient proportion, the
increase of Carbonic       acid to nearly half the total amount of the gases re
movable by boiling did not exert any unfavourable influence on Animal
life ; from which it might be surmised that the Carbonic acid dissolved in
water under great pressure is in a condition altogether different from that
of gaseous Carbonic acid       as regards its relation to   Animal Respiration*.

     78. Having had an opportunity, in the Porcupine' Expedition of 1SC9,
 of making myself acquainted with the method on which the Analyses of
 the Gases of Sea-Water were conducted, and having provided myself on this
 occasion with the requisite Apparatus, I believed myself able — though not
 claiming to be an expert in Chemical Manipulation — to carry on similar
 analyses with sufficient accuracy to determine whether the condition of the
 abyssal water of the Mediterranean is really such as I had suspected it to
 be.    Each of the samples taken in the two deep Soundings (§ 72) was
 boiled until no gas came over ; and the total quantity of gas given off,
 which corresponded very closely with the average formerly obtained, was
 divided in each case into two parts, so that I had four specimens in all.
 The composition of these specimens agreed very closely ; the percentages
 being approximately (for I do not pretend to minute accuracy) as follows :
  Oxygen 5, Nitrogen 35, Carbonic acid 60.              Thus it appeared that very
 nearly the whole available Oxygen had been converted into Carbonic
  acid ; so that while the proportion of Oxygen to Carbonic acid was never
 in the open Ocean less than one third, it was here no more than one twelfth,
 — a difference fully adequate to account for the paucity of Animal life on
  the deep bottom of the Mediterranean.                That this condition does not
  extend to those moderate depths in which the water is subjected to the
  disturbing action of winds, tides, and currents, may be fairly presumed :
  but whether it prevails through the whole stratum beneath 250 or 300
  fathoms, so as to constitute the essential condition by which Animal life is
  limited to these depths, it would obviously be premature to assert.
     * It is by no means improbable that such sluggish animals as Mollusks and Eehino-
  dcrms may be able to bear a much larger proportion of Carbonic acid in the water they
  breathe than Fishes and Crustacea.     Experimental inquiries on this point, which might
  be readily carried out in connexion with any largo Aquarium, would give results of gre2t
  Physiologioil interest.

 Banks, between Sicily and the Coast of Africa, chiefly at depths between 100
 and 200 fathoms, did not add any thing of importance to the collection
 which we made in the previous year in the same locality, save some Sponges
 of considerable interest. We were struck with the limitation of the areas to
 which particular types appeared restricted ; for when encouraged by '* a
 good haul
              " to put down the dredge a second time in the same locality, it
 frequently came up again almost empty.        Whether this depended on a slight
 change of depth, or on the direction of under-currcnts, which probably have
 a considerable influence on these shallows,      it is impossible   to say.  This
 fact, however, seemed constant, — that below        1 50 fathoms Animal life was
 extremely scanty ; whilst even down to that depth Nullipores were often
 very abundant, the dredge coming up full of them.            As there is no doubt
 of the Vegetable character of Nullipora, I deem this fact of considerable
 significance, as indicating that   Light must penetrate     to that depth in suffi
 cient amount to enable this         plant  to   decompose carbonic acid.- — Our

has been carefully explored by numerous Zoologists ; and the barrenness of
its depths seems to leave little to be added by those explorations which have

been so productive elsewhere. True it is that in the Porcupine Expedition
of the previous year, a dredging at 1415 fathoms depth brought up several
species of Shells,— some of them of considerable interest as having been pre
viously known only in a fossil condition (Report for 1870, § 50). But that
dredging was taken in the comparatively narrow extension of the Mediterra
nean basin between the coasts of Spain and Africa, which is most within the
influence of the Gibraltar Currents, and in which, therefore, the stagnation
which      I  believe   to   exist elsewhere may be somewhat disturbed by their
agency.       And the fact that among        these shells was a freshwater Planorbis,
 was an indication that either by gravitation or by some horizontal                travelling
 of bottom-water (such as might be there produced by the Gibraltar under
 current), the shells properly inhabiting the littoral zone might have been
 conveyed thither.           And this view of the case is not invalidated by the
 fact  that   many    of   these  shells are the representatives of types previously
 known only as fossils ; since the same is true of many species found in
 shallow water in this extension of the Mediteranean, which seems to have
 been less explored than most other parts of its shores (Report for 1870,
 §§ 48, 49).
     81.   I  am disposed to believe, therefore, that in the Mediterranean              Basin
 the existence of Animal life in any abundance at a depth greater than 200
 fathoms will be found quite exceptional ; and that, without pronouncing its
 depths to be absolutely azoic, we may safely assert them to present a most
 striking contrast, in respect of Animal life, to those marine Paradises* which
 we continually       met with in the Eastern and Northern Atlantic at depths
 between 500 and 1200 fathoms.                 And I have the satisfaction of finding
 that my conclusion on this point is entirely borne out by the results of the
  dredgings carried on in the Adriatic by Dr. Oscar Schmidt ; who found
 the like barrenness at depths below 150 fathoms, except as regards Fora-
  minifcra, Bathybius, and Coccolithsf.              After a most careful microscopic
  examination of the mud obtained from the depths of the Mediterranean,
  I feel justified in saying that even of these lowest organisms scarcely any
  traces are to be found. —Thus it appears that Edward Forbes was quite
 justified in the conclusion he drew as regards the particular locality he
  had investigated;         and that his only mistake lay in supposing               that  the
  same conditions would prevail in the open Ocean.
     82.    I  venture to think, however, that       I  have shown that the Physical
  conditions of any Inland Sea, which, like the Mediterranean, is cut off from
  the General Oceanic Circulation, must be such as greatly to modify its relation

   to Animal life    ; and that it is a matter of great Scientific importance, espe
   cially in relation  to Geological inquiry, that these conditions should be carefully
   examined.      The Red Sea would probably be found to present a striking con
   trast, in many particulars, both to the Mediterranean and to the open Ocean-
   Its Thermal condition, as I have already shown, is altogether peculiar ; for
   while its surface-temperature rises as high      as that  of any Intertropical portion
   of the Ocean, that temperature          seems to be maintained         with very little
  reduction even to its greatest depths.           Now it seems to be the universal
   opinion of those who have most carefully studied the existing Coral For
   mations, that the Reef-building Corals do not live and grow at a greater
   depth than 20 fathoms ; and as it is affirmed by Mr. Dana, as a deduction
  from the Distribution of Coral Formations, that the existence of the reef-
  builders is geographically limited by the isocrymal line of 68° *,              I cannot
  but suspect that the bathymetrical limit may be essentially a thermal one.
  For all    we know    of the relation of Temperature to Depth (§§ 3, 8) would
  indicate that even within the Intertropical area of the open Ocean, the
  temperature at 20 fathoms may not be above 68°; and that in the next 10
  fathoms it suffers considerable reduction.           Now if the temperature of the
  Red Sea nowhere falls below 71°, it is obviously a most interesting question
  to determine whether the reef-building Corals are, or are not, to be found
 in that Sea at a greater depth than in the Oceanic area ; and if so, what is
  the greatest depth at which they there exist.            For since our own inquiries
 show that Stony Corals similar in physiological characters to the reef-
 building types can live and grow at the depth of many hundred fathoms,
 there seems to me no a priori reason why the latter should not thrive at
 like depths, if the Temperature be congenial to them.
      83. The Red Sea further differs essentially from the Mediterranean, in
 not being the recipient of any great Rivers bringing down detritus from
 the land.       This, of course, will affect the condition of the bottom ; on which
 we should not expect to find the abundant sedimentary deposit that is every
 where settling down on the abyssal depths of the Mediterranean.                    It will
 also leave the bottom-water clear ; and in this respect the condition of the
bed of the Red Sea will be more favourable to Animal life than that of the
Mediterranean.          But the    absence  of organic sediment, if the views pre
 viously advanced be correct, will constitute a still more important difference
between the conditions of the two Seas, in relation to Animal life : for
 while its progressive decomposition, in the abyssal water of the Mediterra
nean, consumes its Oxygen and imparts to it Carbonic acid, at a greater

cold current which comes up from the south on the Western coast of South America,

pushes the southern Isocrymo of 68° — the Coral-Sea boundary — to the north of the
Equator, between the South American coast and the Galapagos, which, though under
the Equator, lie outside of that boundary.

 been my privilege to be engaged,        so much advantage from the clues which
 have offered themselves from time to time for their guidance, that I should
 consider myself wanting in my duty to those who may hereafter take up
 the same line of investigation,     if I were to be kept back from making such
 suggestions, by any apprehension        that  my personal credit would suffer from
 having propounded ideas which subsequent research did not bear out. —

   not lower than C°-5 in different depths down to 700 fathoms.                Of course
   the Casella-Miller's thermometer was used.           This agrees with the results

several   observations        taken     at  different    times, a temperature of about
+ 8° Cent. [44° Fahr.] on the bottom, in a depth of 300 fathoms, between
Iceland and the Faroe Islands.                  What a contrast to the distribution of
temperature in the Channel between the Faroe Islands and Shetland !"—
It is very interesting thus to find the deep Norwegian Fjords showing the
same phenomenon of uniform temperature as other deep land-locked Seas.
In my Report for 1869, 1 pointed out (§ 104) that the comparative shallow
ness of the bottom between Iceland and the Faroe Islands would interpose
an effectual barrier to any glacial current moving southwards at a depth
exceeding 300 fathoms.
   The Hydrographer             to the Admiralty has been good enough to furnish
me with     the following very interesting series of Temperatures recently
taken in the Eastern Seas by Cipt. Chimmo with the "protected" Ther
mometers. — As only a single Thermometer was used in each observation, it
seems    probable that the Temperatures                marked (?) may be more or less
incorrect.

       I. On the Gulf-stream, in relation to the General
                                 Oceanic Circulation.
  85. The question how far the Climate of Northern Europe, and the
temperature of the Arctic Sea between Iceland and Nova Zembla, is modified
by the Gulf-stream, has of late been much discussed among Physical
Geographers ; and opinions the most contrary have been expressed on the
subject. For whilst it is maintained by some that there is ample evidence
of the amelioration of that Climate by a North-easterly stream of Oceanic
water, bearing with it the warmth of a more Southern latitude, and further,
that this flow is essentially a prolongation of the Florida Current or Gulf-
stream proper, still bearing with it a large measure of the initial force which it
derived from the Trade-winds, it is asserted by others that the Gulf-stream
proper dies out in the Mid- Atlantic, shortly after encountering the Arctic
Current off the Banks of Newfoundland ; and that it consequently exerts
no other influence on the Climate of Northern Europe and on the tempera
ture of the Arctic Sea, than as contributing to the warmth of the South
westerly winds which blow from the area traversed by the Gulf-stream
towards the British Islands and the Scandinavian Peninsula, and, by their
prevalence over all others, maintain a North-easterly surface-drift over the
portion of the North Atlantic which washes their shores.
   86. Now since the doctrine of a General Oceanic Circulation dependent on
difference of Temperature, which                I
                                   have advocated in my successive Reports,
will, if admitted, reconcile these opposing views, — by giving a vera causa
for that deep flow of water from the warmer area of the North Atlantic
towards        the Polar    Sea which       Thermometric           observations unmistakably
indicate   ;    whilst it   accepts   as   of no        less   value the conclusions of those
who, after a careful study of the Florida Current, are satisfied of its
entire inadequacy to perform the function assigned to — think worth      it,   I       it
while to develope this doctrine somewhat more fully with special reference
to the question of the Gulf-stream   more especially since my views have
                                                    ;
been strangely misunderstood               by
                                  some of those who have taken prominent
parts in the controversy. — In order to place this question fully before the
Scientific public,  shall briefly summarize the opinions which have of late
                       I
years found advocates among men whose knowledge of the subject entitles
their views to respectful consideration.
   87. The doctrine of the Gulf-stream prevalent thirty years ago was thus
unhesitatingly expressed         by
                             Humboldt in the first volume of his Kosmos            '        '
         —  "   pours itself from the Caribbean Sea and the Mexican Gulf

" seeds on the coasts of Ireland, of the Hebrides, and of Norway. Its
" north-easternmost prolongation mitigates the cold of the ocean, and exer
cises a beneficent influence on the climate of the northernmost point of
"    Scandinavia.   At the point where the stream is deflected to the east by
"    the banks of Newfoundland, it sends off an arm toward the south, not
"    far from the Azores." (Sabine's Translation, vol. i. p. 301.)
  88. General Sabine appears to have been the first to suggest, in a valuable
Note to the passage just cited (p. 454), that the transport of Tropical pro
ducts, as well as of the warmer water of the Mid-Atlantic,                     to the   North
Cape, may be due to other agencies than the propulsive force of the Florida
Current. — " It appears to require a further investigation to decide whether
"    the Stream-current  referred to in the text, which flows along the coast of
" Norway      and round the North Cape of Europe, and                    is,
                                                                  at least, mainlv

"    the waters of the Gulf-stream at its outlet from the Gulf of Mexico, in the
"    Bahama         Channel.        The transport of West-Indian seeds to the coast of
" Norway          is    undoubted     and even parts of the cargoes of vessels wrecked on

Earth, embodied in the Isothermal charts which he published in 1847-48,
afforded strong confirmation of the doctrine that N.E. movement of Atlantic

within the Arctic        area     ;   and he inferred, from the direction    of the Ieo-
thermal     curves, that the influence of the Gulf-stream              extends as far as
Nova Zembla*.
  90. Thedoctrineof the Gulf-stream as the efficient heater of North-western
Europe, and of the Sea that stretches from it towards the Pole, found an
enthusiastic and eloquent advocate in Capt. Maury.
                                                        " There is," he says,
" a river in the ocean : in the severest droughts it never fails, and in the
" mightiest floods it never overflows ; its banks and its bottom are of cold
" water, while its current is of warm ; it takes its rise in the Gulf of Mexico,
" and empties into Arctic Seas : this mighty river is the Gulf-stream," —
which, he affirms, discharges over the Atlantic in a winter's day a quantity of
heat " sufficient to raise mountains of iron from zero to the melting-point, and
"   to keep in flow from them a molten stream of metal greater in volume than
"                                                               " or as " suffi-
    the waters daily discharged through the Mississippi river ;
"   cient to raise the whole column of atmosphere that rests upon France and
" the British Islands from the freezing-point to summer-heat." — Capt.
Maury, however, contests the doctrine originated by Dr. Franklin and
supported by Rennel, as to the propulsive force by which the Gulf-stream
is sustained : for instead of attributing     like his predecessors, to the
                                                      it,

                                                                         it   is
from   asuperficial drift-current into   deep stream-current, he assigns
                                                a                           to         it
a combination of other agencies, the operation of which, however, he rather
indicates than distinctly specifies.   Thus, he says, " modern investigations
" seem to encourage the opinion that this stream, as well as all the constant
" currents of the sea, due mainly to the constant difference produced
                              is                                                             by
" Temperature and Saltness the Specific Gravity of water in certain parts
                                        in

                                                                  is
" aqueous equilibrium and to maintain this equilibrium these great cur-

" rents are set in motion. The agents which derange equilibrium in the
" waters of the sea,         by
                        altering specific gravity, reach from the Equator to
" the Poles and in their operations they are as ceaseless as heat and cold
              ;                                                                               ;

                                         a
" perpetual work." Again, — " As for the seat of the forces which put and
" keep the Gulf-stream in motion, theorists may place them exclusively
" on one side of the Ocean with as much philosophical propriety as on the
" other.     Its waters find their way into the North Sea and the Arctic

directed to prove that the various causes which produced disturbance of
equilibrium (among which he enumerates the abstraction of Carbonate of
Lime from the Ocean-water by the Coral-forming polypes) are adequate to
sustain sensible currents, such as the Gulf-stream.        "A constantly acting
" power," he says, " such as the force of gravitation, is as
                                                                necessary to keep
" fluids as it is to keep solids in motion. In either case the projectile force
"  is soon overcome by resistance ; and unless it be renewed, the current in
"  the sea will cease to flow onward, as surely as a cannon-ball will stop its
"  flight through the air when its force is spent            A propelling power,
"  having its seat only in the Gulf of Mexico, or the trade-wind region,
"  could no more drive a jet of water across the ocean, than any other single
"  impulse could send any other trajectile that distance through either air
" or   water.    The power that conveys the waters of the Gulf-stream across
"  the ocean is acting upon them every moment, like gravity upon the
"  current of the Mississippi river ; with this difference, however, the Mis-
"  sissippi runs down hill, the Gulf-stream on the dead level of the sea.
"  But   if we appeal to salt and vapour, to heat and cold, and to the secreting
" powers     of the insects of the sea, we shall find just such sources of ever-
" lasting changes and just such constantly acting       forces as are required to
 " keep up and sustain, not only the Gulf-stream,        but the endless round of
 " currents   in the sea, which run from the equator to the poles, and from
 "  the poles back to the equator ; and these forces are derived from differ-
 " ence in specific gravity between the flowing and reflowing water. The
 " waters of the Gulf as they go from their fountain have their Specific
" Gravity in a state of perpetual alteration in consequence of the change of
 " Saltness, and in consequence also of the change of Temperature. In these
 " changes, and not in the Trade-winds, resides the power which makes the
 " great currents of the sea." (Physical Geography of the Sea, Chapter II.)
     92. The doctrine     of Capt. Maury     was  powerfully    and convincingly
 opposed by Sir John Herschel ;      who showed, beyond all reasonable doubt,
first, that the Gulf-stream really has its origin in the propulsive force of
 the Trade-winds, and secondly, that the greatest disturbance of equili
 brium which can be supposed to result from the agencies invoked by Capt.
 Maury would       be utterly inadequate  to generate and maintain either the
 Gulf-stream or any other sensible current (Physical Geography, §§ 51-6O).
 But Sir John Herschel did not regard the initial force of the Gulf-stream
 as adequate to carry     it across the Atlantic Ocean, still less to propel it as
 far as the Arctic Sea ; for he speaks of it as dispersed, and in fact de
 stroyed, by the process of thinning-off and superficial extension, about the
 42nd or 43rd parallel of N. Latitude; and regards the N.E. flow of warm
 water towards the opening of the Arctic Sea between Spizbergen and
 Norway as mainly a drift-current swept on by the south-west Anti-trades of
 extra-tropical latitudes.     The Polar current which comes down partly
 from Baffin's Bay along the Labrador coast, and partly from the east side
 of Greenland, meeting the Gulf-stream on the Banks of Newfoundland,

 596                          Dr. W. B. Carpenter         on the                 [June 13,
and thence passing southwards hetween the Gulf-stream and the Coast of
the United States, is regarded by Sir John Herschel as the return-current
of that portion of the N.E. Drift which passes ouwards into the Arctic
basin, completing what (borrowing a term from Anatomy) I would call the
longer circulation.         On the other hand, the southern deflection of a large
portion of the Gulf-stream to the east of the Azores, and its re-entrance
into the Equatorial current, complete the shorter circulation.
     93. As Sir John Herschel, when placing himself in antagonism                          to
the doctrine      of Oceanic Circulation propounded by Capt. Maury, waa
himself an adherent of the doctrine of the uniform Deep•sea temperature
of 39°, which had been propounded by Sir James Ross, on the basis
of observations now proved to have been vitiated by the imperfection
of his Thermometers, his repudiation of Capt. Maury's views must be un
derstood as extending only to the question of sensible currents.                  As to the
existence of any more general, though less perceptible, tur/ace-movement
of Oceanic water from the Temperate towards the Polar seas, Sir                            J.
Herschel offered no opinion         ; nor did he at that time (so far as I am aware)
anywhere express         himself   as either favouring or opposing the hypothesis
of a movement of deep water from the Polar to the Equatorial areas,
which would seem necessary for the maintenance of a bottom-temperature
even of 39° in the latter, much more of a bottom-temperature                      but little
above 32°*.
    * As the doctrine advocated in my previous Reports, of n General Oceanic Cir
culation sustained by difference of Specific Gravity arising out of difference of Tem
perature, differs essentially from that of Capt. Maury, — in that it leaves unquestioned
the Trade-wind origin of the Gulf-stream, and touches only that deep N.E. movement
of Warm water which tho Gulf-stream (on Sir J. Herschel's own showing) could not
produce, and that still deeper return-movement of Cold water of which Sir J. Herschel
was then ignorant, — I cannot but feel surprised at finding his authority cited against
me, not only by Mr. Croll, but also (inferuntially at least) by Sir Charles I/yell : who,
in   the recently published Eleventh Edition of his ' Principles of Geology,' speaks as
follows (vol. i. p. 505) : — " Besides those sensible currents arising from the various
" causes already ment ioncd, a theory of general oceanic circulation first
                                                                             propounded by
"
  Maury has lately been brought into great prominence by Dr. Carpenter."           Now, as  I
have shown, tho " theory of general oceanic circulation propounded by Maury," had
special reference to sensible currents ; and it was the inadequacy of the causes assigned by
him (not by me) for their production, which was the subject of Sir John Herschel's de
monstration, cited by Sir C. Lyell in a subsequent page (p. fi07). Yet by representing
my views as identical with Capt. Maury's, Sir C. Lyell has (perhaps unintentionally)
given the impression that Sir J. Herschel's demonstration was equally applicable to
both. And he has been so understood by an anonymous writer in the 'Athena;um'
(March 2, 1872) ; who, in a notice of Sir Charles Lyell's new edition, asserts, with
reference to " the question of Ocean-Currents, which has been lately brought very pro-
" minently forward
                      by Dr. Carpenter," that "Sir Charles shows that the theory which
"  refers oceanic circulation to difference of specific gravity is founded upon erroneous
" observation and incorrect application of the facts observed." — How
                                                                              differentlv Sir
John Herschel thought of the doctrine as advocated by mo (not in substitution for the
Trade-wind origin of the Gulf-stream, but as supplemental to the whole Oceanic

                         ' Shearwater'
  1872.]                                    Scientific Researches.                     597
      94. The general acceptance of the doctrine of the uniform Deep-Sea
  Temperature of 39°, based on the observations of Sir James Ross, and
  sanctioned by the authority of Sir J. Herschel, caused the earlier doctrine of
  Humboldt and Pouillet (§ 18) to be lost sight of, until it was brought again
 into notice by the more trustworthy observations recently made with Ther
                            '
  mometers 'protected         against the effects of pressure (§ 10).
     95. The views of Sir        John Ilerschel and others in regard to the non-
 extension of the Gulf-stream           as such into the Polar area, were warmly
  contested twenty years ago by Dr. Petermann ; who, in a letter addressed
 to Sir Francis Beaufort (then Hydrographer to the Admiralty *), explicitly
 asserted, on the basis of Temperature-observations,               that the influence of
 the Gulf-stream extends from Newfoundland                  along the north coast of
  Europe and Asia, as far            as  Cape Jakan, in the vicinity of Behring's
 Strait. And this doctrine          he has   since urged in several successive Me
                   '
 moirs in the        Geographische Mittheilungen ;' with the addition that he
 now regards as a branch of the Gulf-stream a current of warm water which
 passes up the east side       of Davis's Straits, and which is traceable as far as
 Smith's Sound. — But,        as will presently appear (§ 10G), Dr. Petermann uses
              "                 " in a sense
 the term        Gulf-stream                   very different from that in which it is
 ordinarily employed in this country.
     96. On the other hand,           Mr. A. G. Findlay, in       a Paper   on the Gulf-
 stream presented to the Royal Geographical Society, Feb. 8, 1869, essayed
 to prove — on the basis of the data supplied by the operations of the
 United States Coast Survey          as to the rate, volume, and temperature         of the
 Gulf-stream in its passage through the Florida Channel, and by the changes
 in   these three conditions which it undergoes during its course as far as
 the Banks of Newfoundland, — that after encountering the Arctic Current
 on the Banks of Newfoundland,             the Gulf-stream    loses all its original  cha
 racters, and can no longer be distinguished from the general North-easterly
 drift of the North Atlantic ; and that our mild climate, being in no way
 dependent on its influence, is to be accounted for as follows : — The great
                                                                             "
 " belt of Anti-trade or passage winds which surround the globe northward
 "  of the Tropics, passing to the north-eastward, or from some point to the
 " southward      of west, passes over the entire area of the North Atlantic, and
 "  drifts the whole surface of that ocean towards the shores of Northern
"   Europe and into the Arctic basin, infusing into high latitudes the tempe-
 "  rature and moisture of much lower parallels ; and this alone would be
"   sufficient to account for all changes in climate by their variations, with-
"   out any reference whatever to the Gulf-stream."
     97. The views of Mr. Findlay as to the limited agency of the Gulf-
Current    system   kept up by the action of Winds on the surface),      has already been
shown (§ 37).

598                           Dr. W. B. Carpenter on the                        [June 13,

eminently qualified, by their knowledge of its Hydrographical phenomena,
to estimate its real influence on the temperature of the North-east exten
sion of the Atlantic. Thus Mr. G. W. Blunt,
                                                         " the head of the well-known
"  house that has for nearly a century prepared and published the charts
"  that have guided the American Mariner in every quarter of the globe,"
says in a letter to the President        of the American Geographical          and Statis
tical   Society, — "Beyond       the Western      Islands,  I  believe the Gulf-stream
" has no existence ; and its alleged effects on the climate of the British
" Islands are matters of assertion only. The Gulf-stream, as a current, I
" believe, entirely ceases and loses all its equatorial heat to the eastward of
" W. Long. 40° ; the set to the east is that of the general set of the North
" Atlantic, and the temperature of the water is that of the general tempe-
" rature in those regions " *. And Dr. Hayes, the Arctic explorer, who
formerly participated in the prevalent belief as to the extended agency of
the Gulf•stream, has recently been so completely convinced by Mr. Blunt's
representations, that he has written an elaborate article on
                                                                               " The Real
 Gulf-stream    "t,      for the purpose of correcting the prevalent idea that
the Gulf-stream        influences the temperature of the North Atlantic.
                                                                                        " It
 " is an error," he says, " into which many persons (including the writer
 " of this
             article) have been led through lack of familiarity with facts,
 " to suppose that the Gulf-stream sends off a branch from its northern
 " limit to the Arctic Ocean, or even, as we shall presently have occasion
 " to show, that it touches any part of the coasts of Europe."
 " Being a resultant current, and having no force applied to it to keep it in
 " motion, its strength diminishes ; the air of a higher latitude brings its
 " temperature down to that of the North Atlantic generally ; the water
 " loses all its Gulf-stream character, as to course, warmth, and flow ; and
 " it dies awuy into the sluggish Atlantic drift which sets from a westerly to
 "an easterly direction." — Dr. Hayes adopts the view of Mr. Findlay, that
 the amelioration of the climate of the British Isles and of regions further
 north is mainly due, as Dr. Stork had previously maintained (Nautical
 Magazine, 1857), to the prevalence of South-westerly                     winds; and he
 affirms, with Dr. Stork, that the temperature of the sea rather follows
 than controls that of the superincumbent air.
     98. On the other hand, the doctrine of Dr. Petermann finds an enthu
 siastic advocate in Capt. Silas Bent          J;   who not only maintains that the
 thermal influence of the Gulf-stream is traceable to Spitzbergen and Nova
 Zembla, but attributes to its agency the whole difference between the

     99. The_ doctrine of the extension of the Gulf-stream proper to the
  Polar area, carrying with it a vast amount of Equatorial heat, has been
 advocated with great ability by Mr. James Croll ; who, employing the
 modern method of computing units of heat, essays to prove that the quan
 tity of heat carried from the Equatorial area by the Gulf-stream is so
 enormous,        to be competent not only to do all that Dr. Petermann attri
                     as
 butes to        it,   but
                      great deal more*.
                             a             In this, indeed, he goes far beyond
 Dr.     Petermann himself     for, as will presently appear, Dr. Petermann

 regards the Florida Stream as furnishing only   part of the thermal power

 exerted        by
             the vast body of water derived from various sources, to which
 he gives the name " Gulf-stream."
   100. Without attempting to follow Mr. Croll through his calculations,
I may stop to point out what appear to me to be the fallacies of his
 method  since
            ;   this can be proved erroneous, Mr. Croll's great array of
                            if
 figures    is   utterly valueless.
    101.        In the first place, in Mr. Croll's preliminary
                                                             comparison of the
 Temperatures     of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, he altogether
ignores the influence on the Distribution of Heat over the Globe which                              is
exerted         by
             the great relative preponderance of Land in the Northern Hemi
sphere.    Yet of the vast importance of this influence, no Meteorologist
or Physical Geographer can entertain the smallest doubt.         The manner in
which     affects the relative Temperatures of the North and South Atlantic
          it
will be hereafter shown       118) to be precisely conformable to that in which

it manifests itself in the Climates of Continental Stations and to affirm, as   ;
Mr. Croll does, that " the lower mean Temperature of the Southern Hemi-

Vapour, Barometric Pressure, and the prevalent Direction of winds, —                                in

600                         Dr. W. B. Carpenter on       the              [June 13,
 that this heat, being wholly taken up by the Water of the Ocean, is trans
 ferred by its currents towards the Polar regions ; whilst of the heat which
 falls upon the Land, a very large proportion is lost by radiation, passing
 off into the stellar spaces.      " It is in the Equatorial regions," he says,
 " that the earth loses as well as gains the greater part of its heat ; so
 "  that, of all places, here ought to be placed the substauce best adapted
 " for preventing the dissipation of the earth's heat into space, in order
 " to raise the general temperature of the earth. Water, of all substances
" in nature, seems to possess this quality to the greatest extent ; and, besides,
 " it is a fluid, and therefore adapted by means of currents to carry the heat
 " which it receives from the sun to every region of the globe "*. Now in
this assumption two facts are entirely ignored : — -first, the very small
depth to which the superheating influence of direct insolation penetrates,
as is shown in the temperature-soundings taken during my two Mediterra
nean cruises (see § 67) ; and second, the conversion of a vast amount of
 the solar heat which falls upon the Ocean into the elastic force of vapour,
its surface-temperature being kept down to a tolerably regular maximum
by evaporation, just as the surface-temperature of the Human body is kept
 down to a uniform maximum by its insensible perspiration.               The maxi
mum surface- temperature ever observed in the open Ocean is never (so far
as   I have been able to ascertain) above 86°, the ordinary maximum being
about 82° ; and any higher temperature seems only to show itself in the
near neighbourhood of land, — as along the Guinea Coast, and in the Red
Sea, where      a temperature    of  90° is said to have     been noted.     Yet the
direct    heat of radiation, measured by a thermometer with a blackened
bulb,    laid upon a black surface, has been seen at Aden (as              I  am in
formed by Col. Playfair) to raise the mercury to 215°.              The enormous
amount of heat thus converted into the elastic force of vapour must
be carried     into the upper regions of the atmosphere ; and whether that
vapour be     there condensed into the heavy rain which falls in the region
of equatorial calms, or      be transported      by atmospheric currents to some
remote region, there to undergo             condensation, the heat thus lost by
evaporation from the sea must be far greater than that lost by radiation
from the land.
     103.   In the third place, Mr. Croll leaves almost entirely out of the
question the N.E. transportation of an enormous amount of heat from the
general surface of the Atlantic by the agency of the Aqueous Vapour thus
raised ; although the importance of this agency has been insisted on by the
most eminent authorities in Meteorology.            " Thus," says Sir John Her-
schel (Meteorology), " aqueous vapour becomes an agent in the transfer
" of heat, in its latent state, from one part of the globe or from one region
" of the atmosphere to another."              And Sir Charles Lyell, after citing
this passage, continues : — *' The upper trade-winds (or Anti-trades), which

" to pursue an almost unbroken course over tropical and                                             subtropical
" latitudes, until they come to those more northern regions                                         where the
"    act of condensation releases                  probably three-fourths of their heat"*. —
But,       says      Mr. Croll, "            the heat of our south-west winds is derived, not
"    directly from the Equator, but from the warm water of the Atlantic —
"    in fact from the Gulf-stream       The greater part of the moisture of
" the south-west                 and west winds         is derived from the ocean
                                                                  in temperate
"    regions . . . The greater part of the moisture received at the Equator is
"    condensed and falls as rain in those regions."      Now to any one who
examines the proportion bonie by the area of the true Gulf-stream, before
its easterly bend, to that of the great Sargasso sea of the Mid- Atlantic,
which has a temperature only a few degrees lower than that of the Florida
Current in corresponding latitudes, and in no way dependent upon      the                                   it,
assertion that the warmth and moisture of our S.W. winds       essentially                    is
dependent on the Gulf-stream,    obviously untenable. So, also,
                                                       is         the                                       is
statement that moisture cannot be thus conveyed from Intertropical to
Temperate regions, because the heated air charged with     must ascend at              it
once into regions so cold that all its moisture will be condensed   for                                 :          if
this were the case, the enormous mass of water raised by evaporation from
the surface of the Red Sea (calculated                          by
                                         Dr. Buist as equal to eight feet
of depth per annum) ought                          to fall back again into the     Red      Sea or the area
immediately surrounding       and yet, as well known, the greater part of
                                             it;                 is
that area   almost entirely rainless.
                  is
   104. Fourthly, until corrected by Mr. Findlay, Mr. Croll assumed
that the whole of the true Gulf-stream                                continues    to flow         in   a    N.E.
direction        ;      unquestionable that
                     whereas       it   is    considerable proportion of  a
it (probably more than one half) turns southward to the east of the
Azores, and re-enters the Equatorial current.    This portion, however,
Mr. Croll regards as the principal heater of the S.W. winds which im
part warmth to the British Islands     whilst the portion of the current
                                                            ;
which he assumes to flow past our Islands up into the Arctic seas, he re
gards as the heater of the S.W. winds which go to warm Norway
and the North of Europe. — Now the fact is, as       shall show hereafter     I
(§  147), that the large division of the Gulf-stream which thus turns
southwards possesses no excess of temperature above the general mass of
Atlantic water in that region, being only recognizable by its movement.
And as to the portion which passes northwards, we shall see that its Area
is    so        relation to the general surface of the Atlantic through
            small in
which       it
        passes, and  that its Temperature     so little excess of that of the
                                                                     is           in
water on either side of                      it,

G02                              Dr. W. B. Carpenter        on the              [June 13,
the      case,   will    be more fittingly pointed out hereafter (§§ 139-142).
At present         I   venture to think that I have made it evident that the real
influence of the Gulf•stream upon the Thermal condition of the North
Atlantic must be determined in some other way than by a theoretical
computation of
                         "  units of heat,"     for which no truly reliable data can be
said to exist.            It is from the position and course of the Isothermal
Lines, which have now been laid down over its whole area for different
 seasons on the basis of a large number of observations, that we derive
 our surest information as to the actual effect produced on the surface-
 temperature of the Mid- Atlantic by the transfer of water in the Gulf-
 stream from the Intertropical to the Temperate zone, and as to the
 course and amount of the further movement whereby the water of the
 Temperate zone is carried towards the Polar area. — This is the method of
 investigation which has been followed by Dr. Petermann in his recent very
 important Memoir on
                                     " The Gulf-stream, and our knowledge of the
 Thermal condition of the North Atlantic Ocean and its Continental

 seem to differ from him in refusing to the

       106. Dr.        Petermann'    s   view   will   be   best   expressed in   his   own
  words      : —
       " My     own ideas, in     1 865,  of the extent and of the immense volume of
  "   the Gulf-stream,         I  expressed as follows (Mittheilungen, pp. 150 et
  "   seq.) :  — .'  Instead of a weak and insignificant drift from Newfoundland
  "   ' toward
                    Europe, as heretofore represented, I consider the northern part
   "  *
         of the Gulf-stream one of the mightiest currents in the world, although
   "  *
         comparatively       but slow, not very perceptible         on the surface    of the
   " ' ocean, and therefore of no great moment to navigation. I do so, be-
   " ' cause Ocean- Currents have to perform yet other functions than those of
   " ' a strong surface-stream. In that view I conceive the Gulf-stream
   " 'to be a deep permanently warm current from Newfoundland to the
   "   ' coasts   of France, Great Britain, Scandinavia, and Iceland, up to Bear
   " ' Island, Jan Mayen, and             Spitzbergen   ;  and along the western coast of

 "    to Smith's      Sound, and another warm current from the Pacific Ocean
 •*
      through Behring's Strait up to the Polar Land discovered by Kellett
 "    and Long. — Although, since 1865, high authorities have pronounced
 "
 "
      against my theory of the extent and volume of the Gulf-stream,                       I
      cannot but still maintain the same ; and shall now produce the figures
 "    of the actual observations on which it is based, and without which we
 "    but drift into arbitrary suppositions."
      107. With reference to the objections advanced by Mr. Findlay, and by
 those who maintain the same opinion with hirn as to the limited agency
 of the real Gulf-stream, Dr. Petermann says : — " That the Gulf-stream,
 " in its course towards          Europe, receives and unites with a drift corre-
 " sponding in direction,          is probable and natural ; but it is equally cer-
 "   tain that the former is the main body or principal stream of the North
 "    Atlantic waters at all times of the year. Of continental rivers the ex-
 "   pression is used that they have their source or head and their mouth ;
 "   but this does not imply that all the water emptying at the mouth comes
 "   exclusively from the small source.            The Florida Stream may be com-
 "   pared with the head of a great river, which is swelled, in its course to
 "   the mouth, by tributaries.          In the same manner, then, as a great river-
 "   basin is named from the principal river, it appears proper and to the
 "   purpose to retain for the warm North Atlantic current the name Gulf-
                                                                                      '
 "   stream.'      It  surely  would be difficult     to ascertain where the Florida
"    Stream ceases really ;      where   it receives tributaries, and how many ; and
"    what part of the temperature of the combined stream is ascribable to the
"    Florida Stream, and what to the tributaries.            The name       *
                                                                              Gulf-stream
                                                                                           '
 "   has been adopted so generally for the great Oceanic current which bathes
"    the European shores, that it would be better to call the head and the
"    first part of the course 'Florida Stream,' than to use for the other
"    part a new and complicated name, instead of one long known and now in
"   general use." — This view has lately received the sanction of Sir Charles
             "
Lyell : — It has been objected that we have no right to attribute to the in-
" fluence of the Gulf-stream the warmth of all the water which we may find
" in the Northern Atlantic above the normal temperature of the latitude.
" But when recognizing the influence of that stream in the Atlantic, we do
" not, as Dr. Petermann justly observes, refer the whole of it to the Current
*' which flows out of the Gulf of Mexico,
                                                       or deny that it has received
" accessions upon its way : we rather retain the name of Gulf-stream just
" as we do that of a river from its source to its delta, although many tri-
"   butaries coming from different regions may have swollen and modified
"   its volume"*.

   108. I cannot but regret that an analogy so fallacious should have been
put forth by a Physical Geographer of Dr. Petermann' s reputation, and
                                                                    '

continually increases in strength and volume by the accession of water
brought into it by its tributaries ; and the retention of the same name
from its principal source to its mouth is therefore perfectly appropriate.
But an Oceanic Stream-current, maintained by its initial force alone, tends
gradually to diminish in strength, through the retardation it is constantly
undergoing by friction, until at last it merges in the general body of
water through which it flows.                     And if that     water has a movement                     of   its

may receive from the current discharged into

 nize the importance, so long as they " remained under the dominant idea
 " that the Temperature of the Deep Sea is everywhere 39c." Now, since
 in my previous Report of the 'Lightning' Expedition for 1868, I had
 specially drawn attention to the prevalent error of regarding the tempera
 ture of 39° as that of the Deep Sea generally (showing that it is not
 that of the greatest density of Sea-water, which contracts until it freezes),
 and had demonstrated the           non-existence of the supposed line of equal
 temperature at all depths, separating the Polar sea, in which the tempe
 rature rises with increase of depth, from the Equatorial, in which it sinks,
 I   cannot but feel greatly surprised at finding these errors repeated by
 Dr. Petermann,      as well as by his coadjutors Drs. Von Preeden and Miihry,
 and determining their interpretation of many of the phenomena which
 they bring under discussion.        Thus Dr. Petermann says of the Gulf-stream
 that   " after coming forth intact from its two struggles with the Polar Stream
 "  east  of Newfoundland and east of Iceland, its waters cool more and
 "  more towards the north, until they are reduced to a temperature of 39°"2,
 "  at which they attain their highest density and greatest weight.          At this
 "  temperature it    sinks  beneath  the Polar Stream, in  July, north  of Iceland
 "  and Spitzbergen, and on hoth sides of Bear Island      ....  North of the iso-
 "  thermal curve of 390-2 toward the Pole, the temperature generally in-
 " creases with the depth, while southward towards the Equator it decreases."
— And Dr. Von        Preeden says, — " It has been established beyond doubt, by
"   late investigations on the high seas, that Sea-water reaches its maximum
 " density, or in other words its greatest Specific Gravity, in exactly the
" same manner as fresh water at a temperature of 3° R." Dr. Miihry, also,
though espousing the doctrine of a vertical circulation between Polar
and Equatorial waters, maintained by difference of Temperature, altogether
misconceives, under the influence of the error just stated, the effects of this
circulation.     "The vertical distribution," he says, "is regulated by the
" hydrothermal law, according to which *ea-water, like fresh water, attains
" its maximum density and gravity at about 390,2 Fahr. Of two streams
" meeting each other, one or the other, the colder or the warmer, will soon
" prove relatively less heavy ; and this will continue its course on the
" surface, while the heavier will submerge, and flow underneath the lighter,
"  provided that they cannot proceed side by side. It must and can be
"  assumed that there is at the bottom of the Polar basin really a tempera-
" ture of 39°"2 or nearly so ; and that there is a gradual decrease of it to
" the    surface, where it is 28°, the lowest temperature of flowing water,
" just near the point of congelation, below the floating field        ice of about
"  eight feet in thickness, which, at the top, has perhaps a temperature of
«  _58° (—40° R.)."— " This," continues Dr. Miihry in a Note, " will be
"  disputed by Physicists, who cling to a few contradictory experiments ;

"  firmed indisputably by the result of our inquiries into the vertical distri-

  111. Now the increase of density of Sea- water down to its freezing-point,
which may be as low as 250-4, is as well established as any fact in Physics ;
while there is no reliable observation (made with Thermometers protected
from the influence   of pressure) which indicates a Deep-sea temperature of
3°°' 2 in either the Arctic or the Antarctic basin.
    112. It will be unnecessary for me to dwell at any greater length on my
points of difference with Dr. Petermann ; since it will be obvious to any
careful reader of his Memoir, that its main object is to prove the existence
of the North-easterly movement of a deep voluminous body of warm water
(as distinguished from a surface-drift) in the North Atlantic ; on which
        I
point entirely agree with him. And although he applies to this flow what
I  cannot but consider the very inappropriate designation of the " Gulf-
stream," he expressly guards himself from assigning to the initial force of
the Florida Current (or Gulf-stream proper) the whole, or even a principal
part, of the power by which this movement is sustained.
   1 13. But a doctrine of the Gulf-stream   has been put forth by my friend
and colleague Prof. Wyville Thomson, to which I regret to find myself in
direct opposition : for he regards the North-easterly movement of
Dr. Petermann's " deep, voluminous, warm stream " as essentially due to
the initial force of the Florida Current ; and attributes its ameliorating
effect on the temperature of the North Atlantic and Arctic seas to the heat
which the Gulf-stream proper has brought from the Intertropical zone.
" The basin of the North Atlantic," he          " forms a kind of cul de sac ;
                                          says,
" and while a large portion of the Gulf-stream water, finding no free outlet
*'
     towards the north-east, turns southwards at the Azores, the remainder, in-
" stead of thinning-off, has rather a tendency to accumulate in the northern.
" portions of the trough. We accordingly find that it has a depth, on the
" west coast of Ireland, of at least 800 fathoms, with an unknown lateral ex-
" tension." Further, he says, in " the shallow, including the Hebrides, the
" Orkney and Shetland Islands, and the Faroes, stretching westwards and
" northwards nearly to Scotland, the average depth is about 500 fathoms ;
" and the Gulf-stream, which has a depth in these latitudes in summer of
" from COO to 700 fathoms, occupies the whole of           it,

tion of the Climate of the region still further north, extending from Iceland
to the east of Spitzbergen : —
   i. That of Mr. Findlay, Mr. Blunt, and Dr. Hayes, who regard this
elevation of Temperature as having no immediate relation to the Florida
Gulf-stream, and attribute it mainly, if not entirely, to the prevalent influ
ence of South-westerly winds and of the surface-drift they maintain ; the
surface-temperature    of the Sea being in their view entirely dependent on
that of the Atmosphere above it.
   ii. That of Dr. Petermann, who attributes it in great part to the north
easterly flow of a
                    " deep, voluminous, warm stream," which he designates
as the
        " Gulf-stream," while admitting that a large part, both of its move
ment and its temperature, may be due to the "tributaries" which the
Florida current receives in its course.  He docs not, however, specially in
dicate any of these tributaries ; nor does he attribute the movement of his
"   deep, voluminous,       warm stream
                                            "   to any other agency than the residual
force of the Florida current, aided by surface-drift.
   in. That of Prof. Wyville Thomson, who explicitly                 refers the North
                                           " deep,     voluminous, warm stream   "
easterly flow of Dr. Petermann's                                                     to the
propulsive' force     of   the Trade-winds acting         as a vis a tergo through the
Florida current, and attributes the Thermal influence of that stream almost
exclusively to the heat which the Florida Current transports into high
latitudes from the Gulf of Mexico ; while he regards the underflow of
Cold water into the Equatorial Ocean as an indraught to replace the Warm
water carried      off from     its surface     by the Equatorial current and Gulf-
stream.
   iv. My own view, which is partly coincident with the first, and partly
with the second of those just enunciated.  In common with Mr. Findlay,
Mr. Blunt, and Dr. Hayes, I regard the progressively diminishing influence
of   the Florida     Gulf-stream as scarcely traceable, either by movement or
temperature,      to the European border of the Atlantic ; whilst, in common
with Dr. Petermann, I maintain (as I have maintained from the first) that
a "deep, voluminous, warm stream" of Oceanic water, not to be accounted
for by surface-drift, is continually flowing in a North-easterly direction
between the parallels of 50° and 60°, the extension of which into still higher
parallels is the main source of the amelioration    of their climate.   But               I
differ from him and from Prof. Wyville Thomson in maintaining that the
northward movement of this deep voluminous stream is produced, not by a
via a tergo, but by an indraught of the Warm upper stratum of the Mid-
Atlantic towards the Polar area, to replace the out/low of the Cold under
stratum which is constantly taking place over the Deep-sea bed, in virtue
of the increase of Density which the Polar column acquires by the reduction
of its Temperature. And I also maintain that the amelioration of the Tem
perature of the Northern area is only due to the Florida Current, in so far
as   it   raises the temperature     of the portion of the North Atlantic that lies
between the parallels         of 40° and 50°     (it
                                                  being from this portion that the

  warmth (either in the form of sensible Caloric, or as the Latent Heat of
  watery vapour) to the South-westerly winds which move over its surface.
      115. Now, as      I  have already remarked elsewhere*, although "to the
  "  mere Physical Geographer it may perhaps seem of little importance which
  "  of these views is the correct one," — the transfer of a vast amount of heat
  from the Equator towards the Poles by a continual movement of a great
                                                         "
  body of water being admitted on both sides, — the question is one of the
  " highest
               tcientific interest, from its relation to the general theory of Ocean
  " Currents, past as well as present. For if the doctrine of a General Oceanic
  "   Circulation depending      only on differences of Temperature be correct, it
  "  comes in as an important element in the study          of all other great Currents
  "  at the present time, and especially     of those of the Southern Oceans, which
  "  seem much less attributable than those          of the Northern to the primum
  "  mobile of the Trade-winds.          Further, the question is of yet greater im-
  "  portance in its Geological relations ; since any Circulation that has its
  "  origin simply in difference of Temperature must have been maintained
  "  throughout all geological epochs ; and the formation of Glacial beds,
  "  marked by the presence of the marine types of Polar waters, may have
  "  been taking place at any time and in any part of the Equatorial             Ocean,
  " without    any reduction     of the land temperature.     Whereas if these glacial
  "  currents   are dependent for their origin on the motion communicated to
  "  the true Gulf-stream (as Prof. Wyville Thomson maintains), they would
 "   cease to flow over the deep bed of the Atlantic, if that stream were di-
 "   verted   by the free passage of the Equatorial current into the Pacific."
      116.  I  propose, then, to consider:     —
     I.  The general      Distribution of Heat in the Atlantic Ocean ; especially
 with reference to the differences between the North and the South Atlantic.
     II. The Thermal condition of the Gulf-stream, and its influence on that
 of the North Atlantic.
     III.  The evidence of amelioration in the Climate of the British Isles and
 of the regions still further north, by a North-easterly flow of Oceanic water.
     IV. The question whether this flow is attributable to the initial force of
 the Gulf-stream proper, supplemented            by the general North-easterly sur
 face-drift of the Atlantic ; or whether it is a larger and deeper movement,
 forming part of a General Oceanic Circulation sustained by difference
 of Temperature.

and the South Atlantic respectively (see Plate VII.) serves to show (as was
well pointed out in the ' Onderzoekingen          met den Zee-thermometer' pub
lished in 1861 by the Royal Meteorological Institute of the Netherlands) that,
while the North Atlantic is as a whole warmer than the South, its Tempera
ture has also a much wider Annual range : for the corresponding Isotherms
lie at a greater distance from the Equator on its Northern than they do on
its Southern side ; and the central line of the belt of warmest water does
not coincide with the Equator, but lies for the most part on its Northern
side ; so that the Thermic Equator, or line of maximum mean Temperature,
falls some degrees to the north of the Geographical Equator. The line
which divides the two Hemispheres climatologically of course shifts its
position according to the seasons ; but all these changes of situation take
place to the north of the Equator, except in February and March, when
this line has its most southerly position, and crosses the Equator in a few
places.    Again, comparing points at which the Isotherms cross the Meri
dian of 30° W. Long, in the North Atlantic, with the points at which they
cross the Meridian of 20° W.       Long, in the South Atlantic, — these two me
ridians being, as it were, the     axes of their respective basins, — we observe
that in the North Atlantic         the distance      between  the  Summer     and the
'Winter Isotherms of 60° is        nearly   15°   of Latitude, whilst in   the South
Atlantic the distance between those two Isotherms is only about 7\° ; and
that a like difference shows itself between the seasonal positions of the Iso
therms of 55° and 65° in the Northern and Southern Oceans respectively.
The    great   regularity of the     directions    and distances of the Isotherms
beyond the parallel of 30° S. Lat.           in the South Atlantic, also, is very
striking when contrasted with the irregularity, both in course and distance,
which marks those of the North Atlantic. The Annual Range is observed
to diminish in the South Atlantic as we pass from lower to higher
latitudes ; so that to the southward of the parallel of 42° S. the summer
and the winter climates differ comparatively little from one another, whilst
near the south point of South America the climate is remarkable for its
mildness in winter.
    118. Now these general differences between the Thermal conditions of
the Northern and the Southern Atlantic are fairly attributable to that
great preponderance       in the proportion of Land to Sea in the Northern
Hemisphere, which is fully recognized by all Physical Geograpners and
Meteorologists as an adequate vera causa alike for the higher average
Temperature of the Northern Hemisphere as a whole and for its greater
annual range*. This preponderance is particularly marked in the Eastern
Hemisphere, where, in the 180 degrees of Longitude which include the
whole of Europe and very nearly the whole of Asia, the Thermic
Equator is almost     a great circle  inclined at an angle of 15° to the Geogra-
for those of Latitudes beyond 50° North,   I  rely on the two Charts accompanying  Dr.
Petermann's Memoir.

phical Equator, crossing East Africa, Arabia, and the Peninsula of India
nearly in that latitude north. According to Prof. Dove, the mean Summer
temperature in the Northern Hemisphere is 70o-9, while in the Southern
it is 590,5 ; but, on the other hand, the mean Winter temperature of the
Northern Hemisphere is 480-9, while that of the Southern is 53c,6. Thus
the mean between the Summer and Winter temperatures is 59c,9 for the
Northern Hemisphere, and 56°-5 for the Southern ; giving an excess of
about   3|°   to the Northern. But the average range between the mean
Summer and Winter temperatures for the whole Northern Hemisphere is
22°, while for the Southern it is only 50-9.        The highest observed Annual
Range in the whole Southern Hemisphere is only 40°, and this over a small
area in Patagonia which does not cover a hundredth part of its surface ; whilst
this range amounts to 40° over about a third part of the surface of the
Northern Hemisphere, and rises in the great Continental areas of Asia and
North America even to 30° ; whilst a considerable area of Northern Asia
has a range of 90°, rising in some places to 100°, and at Yakutsk (which
lies in the centre of it) to 100°*.
    119.  It  may be fairly assumed, therefore, that the general difference
between    the   Thermal condition of the Northern and that of the Southern
Atlantic Ocean, — as regards (1) the excess of Mean temperature, and (2)
the greater Annual Range, — is essentially dependent on the same agency as
that which produces those much larger general differences in the Conti
nental Climates of the two Hemispheres, which cannot be attributed, with
the least semblance of probability, to a transfer of Heat from the Southern
 to the Northern by Ocean-currents.          For these last differences show them
 selves most    remarkably  in the  Eastern     Hemisphere, in which it is physi
 cally impossible that any such northward transfer of superheated surface-
 water can take place to any but a most limited extent ; while there is strong
 evidence, from the low bottom-temperatures found even in the Arabian
 Gulf, that Polar Cold is imported      to the   North of the Equator all the way
 from the Antarctic Ocean f.

and 30° South, they tend towards the Equator.              This is obviously due to
the fact that, commencing from the coast of Portugal, a surface-flow pro
ceeds southwards along the coast        of Northern Africa    as  far as the  Gulf of
Guinea, carrying into the Intertropical area the colder water of the Tempe
rate Zone ; whilst there is a corresponding surface-flow of yet colder wnter
northwards, from the Cape of Good Hope, along the coast of South Africa,
 as far as the   Bight of Biafra.    These currents are the main feeders of the
Equatorial current ; and although they may be partly sustained by the
 agency of prevalent Winds, I am disposed to believe that they are essentially

indraughts    maintained by a vis afronte rather than by a vis d. tergo.        For
it is obvious that the Trade-winds cannot        be continually driving westwards
the surface-water of the Intertropical region, unless that water is as con
tinually re-supplied ; and it is very curious to observe that while the por
tions of the North- and South-African currents which lie furthest from the
Coast are drawn into the general westerly drift that prevails over the Inter
tropical area, the part of each that lies nearest the coast follows its curva
ture, so that the two meet in the Bight of Biafra, which maybe considered
the "head water" of the great Equatorial current.                The eastward de
flection of a large part of the North-African current, along the whole line
of the Guinea Coast, from Cape Verde and Sierra Leone to Fernando Po,
only a little to the north of the we«f -flowing Equatorial current (the boun
dary between      the two being almost as sharply defined as the " cold-wall
                                                                                  "
which separates the Gulf-stream from the Arctic current), is a fact of pe
culiar significance.     And this significance   becomes  still more marked, as we
find that this Guinea current is fed, not merely by the North-African cur
rent, but by an Easterly flow that is traceable across the Atlantic, usually
between 6° and 8° N. Lat., on an average as far as 35° West, and some
times almost to the coast of Guiana.         This flow intervenes between the
well-defined Equatorial current which is driven on by the S.E. Trade, and
the more expanded Westerly Drift impelled by the N.E. Trade, of which
the southern border has nearly the same rate as the Equatorial Current ;
and the area over which it takes place appears to correspond pretty closely
with that of the " Equatorial Calms," — the Thermic Equator, as already
stated, lying a few degrees to the north of the Geographical Equator.
Within this      area  the winds are variable  ;  and neither here nor along the
Guinea Coast does it seem that the easterly flow can be sustained by any
prevalent movement of the Air in that direction.          I would suggest, there
fore, that the " Guinea Current
                                     "  is mainly   an indraught or supply-cur
rent, contributing, with the South-African current, to keep up the level of
the head-water of the Equatorial current in the Bight of Biafra ; and that,
in like manner, the Guinea current itself draws upon (1) the North-
African current, and (2) the " still " region of the Atlantic.
    121. But besides the indraught propagated backwards (so to speak)
from the Guinea Current, the still water that lies between the two great
westerly Drift-currents will be likely to take on an Easterly movement of
the kind known as bach-water*; for as the part of it in proximity to the
 current on either side is carried along by the friction of that current, a void
 will be created, which must be supplied by a flow of water in the opposite di
 rection. And that this is partly the explanation of the more or less constant
 easterly movement of the band of Atlantic water which lies immediately to
 the North of the Equatorial Current, from the Guiana coast to the Bight of
   * The phenomenon of " back-water" has been well explained and illustrated by Mr.
 Laughton in his ' Physical Geography in its Relation to the prevailing Winds and
 Currents.'

 612                           Dr. W. B. Carpenter          on the                [June 13,
 Biafra, appears from the fact that (as was first pointed out by Mr. Findlay*)
 there is a similar counter-current in the Pacific between the Northern and
 the Southern      Equatorial, and that an analogous            current is traceable also in
 the Indian Ocean, setting towards             the coast  of Sumatra.
      122.  With all this      evidence     of »ur/ac«-indraught,       therefore, we need
 have no difficulty in accounting             for the constant supply of the " head
          " of the
 water               Equatorial Current, without having recourse to the hypo
 thesis of a oo^om-indraught of Polar water, which is resorted to by Prof.
 Wyville Thomson (§ 114, in.) to explain the prevalence of a glacial tempe
 rature over the Deep-sea         bed.     It seems obvious, on the axiomatic[principl«
 of " least action," that      a «ur/ace-outflow will always be replaced by a sur-
/ace-indraught,         wherever this can be supplied ; since a 6or7oin-indraught
 would involve the lifting-up of the whole intervening stratum of water :
 and I am assured by Mathematicians and Physicists of the highest emi
 nence, that this view is not open to question. — We shall hereafter see that
 the Westerly Drift which answers to the Equatorial Current in the North
 Atlantic, in its turn draws upon the terminal expansion of the Gulf-stream
 proper (§ 147).
      123.  Passing, now, to the western           side of the North   and South Atlantic,
 we observe that in both alike the Isothermal                lines   bend   away fro* the
 Equator, in conformity with the known course of the two great divisions
 of the Equatorial Current.             For as this sweeps across from the African to
 the    American    side  of  the  Atlantic,    and strikes full upon Cape St. Roque,
  which forms the salient angle of the South American Continent about 5°
 south of the Equator, it is (as it were) split in two thereby; and while the
 larger or northern division is slanted in a N.W. direction towards the Carib
  bean Sea, the smaller or southern division is forced to take a decided bend
  to the southward along the coast of Brazil, forming what is known as the
   " Brazil Current." This is traceable Southwards, at a gradually diminish
  ing rate, as far as the estuary of the Rio de la Plata, in S. Lat. 35°, where
   it appears to turn to the eastward and to recross the Atlantic, forming
   what is known as the        " Southern     Connecting Current," which enters the
   South-African       Current near its commencement, and thus completes the
   comparatively      simple circulation of the South Atlantic.               The Thermal
    effect of this southward       direction    of a portion   of  the Equatorial Current
  shows itself in a very marked          manner in the deflection       of the February (or
   tvmmer) Isotherm of 80° nearly as far south as Rio Janeiro, so as to ap
   proach the February Isotherm of 75° within eight degrees on the meridian
    of 30° W. ; although on the meridian of 20° W. these two Isotherms are
   twenty•five degrees apart.          Yet notwithstanding this decided evidence of
    the thermal power of the Brazil current, its warming influence does not
    seem to extend itself in any considerable             degree beyond the parallel of
    30° S.; along which we find the February Isotherm of 75° and the August
    Isotherm of 65° running almost coincidently, until they bend northwards

 under the influence of the South-African current. The February Isotherm
 of  70° and the August Isotherm of 60° follow a nearly similar course about
 5° further South ; as do the February Isotherm of 65°, and the August Iso
 therm of 55° near the parallel of 40° S. The marked regularity in the
 distribution of these lines and in their seasonal movements, as compared
 with the strong deflection of the Isotherms to the north of 30° S., seems to
 indicate that the Thermal influence of the Brazil current dies out sooner
  than its moving force ; and this, it seems probable, may be attributed to
 the circumstance that its superheated stratum has only the ordinary thick
 ness of that of Oceanic water, whilst in the Gulf-stream the excess of heat
 extends to a much greater depth (§ 127).             For it is obvious that the
 thinner the superheated stratum, the more speedily will its temperature
 assimilate itself to that of the overlying Atmosphere ; and that such is the
 case with the Brazil current, appears from the comparatively         small south
 ward deflection of the August (winter) Isotherms of 75° and 70°, while
 the Southern Isotherm of 80° moves northwards in that month, so as in
 September to be found wholly to the north of the Equator, continuing so
 in  great part through October and November.
     124. In our examination of the course of the Isotherms of the North
 Atlantic, it will be convenient to restrict ourselves, in the first instance, to
 that portion of it which, with the large contribution supplied by the Equa
 torial Current from the southern side of the Equator, becomes the feeder of
 the Gulf-stream. — In February and March, the northern Isotherm of 80°
 follows pretty closely the northern boundary of the Equatorial Current ;
 but it does not extend into the Caribbean Sea, the general temperature of
 which during those months does not seem to be above 76°, or about
the average of that of the open ocean between the same parallels.            In the
 Gulf of Mexico the surface-temperature falls still lower, especially within
the area over which the comparatively cold water brought down by the
 Mississippi diffuses itself; the temperature of the head of the Gulf being
thus    reduced even below 70°. — Now since it is at this period       of the year
that    the temperature     of the Southern portion of the Equatorial Current
is at    its highest,   averaging  about  8H°, it is obvious that the surplus
heat   which it carries    towards  the  Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico
is for the most part dissipated before its water re-issues into the Atlantic
 as the Gulf-stream.        This will be seen to be a fact of some importance
with reference to the Thermal effect of the Atmosphere upon the surface-
temperature       of the Sea. — The February and March Isotherm of 70°
between      the meridians of 35° and 75° W. keeps very close to the parallel of
 28°   N.,    passing directly across the area of the Sargasso Sea ; east of
Long. 35°, however, it bends southward,             under   the influence of the
colder North- African current ; whilst to the west of Long. 75° it turns
abruptly to the North, under the influence of the Gulf-stream, which
issues    from the Florida     Channel during these months at a temperature
of   about     75°.   Impinging,    as it were, on the Isotherm of 70°, the

61 4                      Dr. W. B. Carpenter    on the              [June 13,
warmer     Stream carries it northwards as a loop, which, however,        stops
in February at Cape Fear (N. Lat. 34°), and in March at Cape Hat-
teras (N. Lat. 35 \°) ; and thus we see that instead of carrying far into
the North Atlantic the temperature of the Equatorial current, the Gulf-
stream has lost thus early more than ten degrees of the heat which its
water    possessed when    it crossed  the Equator, and is only five degreet
warmer    than the sea through which it flows.
    125. Very little   change takes place during March and April in the
general position   of the Isotherm of 80°; but the temperature of the Carib
bean Sea and of the Gulf of Mexico rises considerably,       so that the Gulf-
stream in May issues from the Florida Channel at the temperature of
nearly 80°.     The Isotherm of 70° moves northwards with the approach
of   the  Sun to the Tropic of Cancer ; but the looped bend in its
western portion occasioned by the Gulf-stream still stops at about 37°
N. Lat.       From June to September,       however, the northward range of
the Isotherm of 80° extends on its western side over the Caribbean Sea
and Gulf of Mexico ; whilst it also includes a considerable part of the
Sargasso Sea, ranging to the north of the Bermuda group and approach
ing the American coast off Cape Hatteras.             The Gulf-stream during
these months issues from the Florida Channel at an average surface-
temperature of about 83°, which is higher than that of the Equatorial
current at its entrance into the Caribbean Sea ; and for this there is
no difficulty in accounting,     when we bear in mind the fact that the Sun
shines vertically on the Tropic of Cancer at the Summer solstice.        There
is nothing special, however, in the surface-temperature       of the Caribbean
Sea and Gulf of Mexico at] this season; for that of the outside Atlantic
between the same parallels,    though in no way influenced either by the Equa
torial current or by the Gulf-stream, is just as high.          In the eastern
portion of the Atlantic, however, the Isotherm of 80° is greatly de
flected towards     the Equator, not merely by the colder North-African
current, but also, it would appear, by the southward flow of that portion
of the Gulf-stream which passes round the Azores to return into the
Equatorial current (§ 147). — Thus the surplus heat which the Gulf-
stream carries northwards during the summer months is not that of the
Equatorial region, but that of the northern Tropical region ; and we
shall presently see (§ 142) that the slow dissipation of its surplus Heat
in this part of its course is due to its near equality in Temperature with
 the Sea and Air through which it passes for a considerable distance.
    126. From October to January, on the other hand, there is a progres
sive return towards the conditions indicated by the course of the Isothermal
lines for February and March ; with this difference, however, that while
the January Isotherm of 70° for the most part lies south of 30° N. Lat.,
and does not range further north than Cape Hatteras, the Isotherm of 80°
extends, in the course of the Equatorial current, into the southern part of
the Caribbean     Sea.   Thus   as the temperature   of the Gulf-stream   at its

 exit, during the months of November, December, and January, is about
 76°, there is a loss of heat of about four degrees in the passage of the
water that feeds it from the north coast of South America to the south
coast of North America.
     127.    Thermal condition of the Gulf-stream, and its influence on that
of   the North     Atlantic. — In considering this part of the subject, we have
first to inquire whether the Thermal condition of the Caribbean Sea and of
the Gulf of Mexico, which last constitutes the head-water of the Gulf-
stream, differs in any essential condition from that of the outside Atlantic :
and on this point we derive important information from a series of Ther-
motnetric observations           recently   taken     in the New York School-ship
 '
   Mercury,' which show that a very close correspondence in surface-tem
perature may veil a considerable difference between the temperatures of
the underlying stratum. — The * Mercury ' crossed the Atlantic in the
month of March from Sierra Leone to Barbadoes, running before a nearly
steady E.N.E. Trade-wind, with an Atmospheric temperature                       ranging
from 77° to 83°, the surface-temperature               of the Sea ranging from 75° to
80°. At a depth of 100 fathoms, the temperature was 62°; while at
 200 fathoms it was found to be everywhere (save in comparatively shallow
 •water,   § 9) between 5 1° and 53°, the mean of eight observations being exactly
                                                                             '           '
 52°.      Having proceeded from Barbadoes to St. Thomas, the Mercury
sailed, during the first fortnight of April, along the southern side of Porto
 Rico, St. Domingo, and Cuba, finding deep water everywhere ; and then,
rounding the western extremity of Cuba, she made her way northwards
 through the Florida Channel.             Now in this part of the course, the tem
perature of the Air ranged from 80° to 84°, and the surface-temperature
of the Sea from 83° to 86°, showing a considerable elevation, which is
probably attributable to the influence of the Equatorial current, this being
at its hottest in March and April. But a still more marked excess shows
itself in the temperature of the stratum beneath ; for at 100 fathoms the
 temperature was found to be 72°, and at 200 fathoms 62° (in both cases
 ten degrees above the temperatures at corresponding depths in the outside
Atlantic), at 300 fathoms 54°, at 400 fathoms 50°, and at 500 fathoms 48°.
—This, as it seems to me, is an indication that the partial separation of the
Caribbean Sea from the Basin of the Atlantic produces somewhat the same
effect upon the temperature of its deeper water, that is shown in a much
more remarkable degree in the Mediterranean (§ 10) ; for if the bottom-
inflow of Polar water be impeded (though not altogether prevented), the
temperature of the whole mass of the water that is not directly subjected
to solar influence will of course be proportionally higher *.
    *  It is remarkable,  however, that on the Mosquito Coast, — where a very high sur-
face-tomperaturo     usually prevails, — the sub-surface temperature seems to correspond
more closely to that of the outside Atlantic ; the following observations being given by
Capt. Maury from the journals of Mr. Dunsterville : — at 240 fathoms, 4S° ; at 386
fathoms, 43° ; at 450 fathoms, 42°. This difference is perhaps attributable to the much

     128. We have next to inquire what is the Thermal relation                of the Gulf-
stream to that        of  the basin from which it issues ; and what indications are
afforded by its Temperature at different             Depths  as to the   Movement of its
different     strata. — In   the first place it is essential to bear in mind that the
southward       extension of the    Polar Current which impinges against the Gulf-
stream      on the     Banks of Newfoundland has been very distinctly traced
along the sea-board of the United States, as a distinct band of separation
between the coast-line and the Gulf-stream, as far south as the Peninsula
of Florida : for although its surface may be warmed by an overflow from
                                                    '
the Gulf-stream (as, in the ' Lightning               channel, the glacial stream from
the N.E. is overlain by the warm stream from the S.W.), yet its presence
is distinctly indicated by the rapid descent of the thermometer                    at small
depths beneath.            Thus off Sandy Hook, where the distance of the Gulf-
stream from the coast is about 2-10 miles (Diagram v. Plate V.), the tem
perature      of the surface near the coast is 70° in summer,              rises to 75° at
about 150 miles distance,          and to 83° at about 275 miles, where          the section
crosses the warmest band or axis           of the Gulf-stream    : but at a depth of only
 20 fathoms in this intervening band, the thermometer falls to 60°; at 100
 fathoms it averages about 47° ; at 200 fathoms it is about 43° ; at 300
fathoms from 39° to 42° ; and at 400 fathoms from 37° to 40°. As soon,
however,        as  the   "cold wall"      has been passed,     the   thermometer at 20
 fathoms      rises to 77c; at 100 fathoms         to 67°; at 200 fathoms to 62°; at
 300 fathoms       to 59° ; and at 400 fathoms to 55° or even 58°.— The breadth
 of the Polar Stream gradually diminishes, and the rate of its movement
 decreases ; but that it preserves a steady onward flow is proved by its con
 tinuity of temperature, which is distinctly traceable along the whole length
 of the Floridan Peninsula, from Cape Canaveral, where its breadth is about
 35 miles,      into the Florida Channel itself. For here the Gulf- stream is
 separated from the American shore-line by a band about 1 0 miles broad,
 in which the temperature falls within 100 fathoms to 50°, whilst in the
 axis of the Stream          it averages 75° at that depth ; and very distinct evi
  dence of the inward movement             of this colder band is afforded by the fact,
 first pointed out by Prof. Agassiz * and since verified by Capt. E. B.
  Hunt (of the U.S. Engineers), that the Florida Keys and Reefs are
 slowly but steadily extending westwards^.                  During rough weather, the
  sea   about the reefs becomes         milky from the stirring-up of the deposit at
  the bottom ; and this         "               " is
                                  white water         invariably drifted to the westward,
  the matter it carries being slowly deposited both north and south of the
  freer  and   more   direct communication    which exists between the deeper parts of the
  southern portion of the Caribbean     Sea and of the outside Atlantic, than  that which its
 northern portion possesses. — Further inquiry into the sub-surface temperature        of dif
 ferent parts of the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico is much to be desired on
  various   grounds.

 be called    demonstrative,    occupies not only that shallower portion of the

 the deepest part of each section, where it underlies the axis of the out
 flowing Gulf-stream, will be presently shown to be an equally certain in

 in  1866, between      the Dry Tortugas and Havana (see Diagrams iv., vi.,
 Plate V.), that our detailed knowledge of the Gulf-stream commences.
 The breadth of this channel is about 82 miles ; and its maximum depth,
 which is met with at about 37 miles from the Cuban shore, is 845 fathoms.
 On the northern side, the bottom lies in terraces, which are nowhere
abrupt ; but on the southern side, about halfway between the deepest part
and the Cuban shore, there is a steep ridge rising about 400 fathoms from
the sea-bed, so as to come to within about 350 fathoms from the surface.
The    course of the bathymetrical Isotherms in the different parts of this
Section is very remarkable.         Instead of lying parallel to the surface, they
follow the contour of the bottom ; the colder water being found much
nearer to the surface in the shallower than in the deeper portion of the
channel.      The following is the bathymetrical range of these lines at in

    Thus it appears that the lower half of this channel is occupied by water
whose temperature        is below 50° ; and that this colder water is thrown up
in the shallower parts of it to within 200 fathoms of the surface. Looking
to the steady diminution of temperature with depth, until a temperature of
35° is reached at about 600 fathoms, it can scarcely,        I   think, be questioned
that the whole of the water below the bathymetrical Isotherm of 50° is an
imvard prolongation of the Polar Stream ; the o!(<flowing Gulf-stream
being limited to the stratum         of 60° or upwards. This limitation was in
dicated also by the deflection      of the sounding-line occasioned by the cur
rent ; which led the U.S. Surveyors to the conclusion that the outwardly
moving stratum has not above one third of the actual depth of the channel.

In   the northern    half of this            section, above the terraces south of the Florida
Reefs, the water lies almost motionless                     ; and the eastward                 flow   of   the   Gulf-
stream is limited to the deeper southernhalf of the channel.
   130. Proceeding about 120 miles to the eastward, we find that while
the channel (between the Sombrero Lighthouse and the Salt Key Bank)
is narrowed to 45 miles (see Diagram iv.), and its maximum depth is re
duced to 600 fathoms, the evidence of a division between two strata is still
more distinctly marked   by the course of the bathymetrical Isotherms (Dia
gram   vii.). The northern slope, as in the previous instance, is the more
gradual, the depth being only about 120 fathoms at a distance of 13 miles
from the American shore ; and here we find that while the temperature at 50
fathoms is 75°, so rapid a reduction shows itself with increase of depth, that
the bottom at 1 20 fathoms is below 50°.  In mid-channel, on the other hand,
where the depth is the greatest, the line of 50° sinks to 1 75 fathoms, while
towards  the Salt Key Bank it is found at 200 fathoms ; and the whole
mass  of water that occupies the deeper portion of the channel has a tem
perature below 50°, the thermometer      showing 45° at 250 fathoms, 40° at
350, and 35° at less than 400. — Thus it seems clear that the colder water
which underlies the warm Gulf-stream surges up on the shallower bottom
of the northern side of     so as to rise to within 120 fathoms of the sur

rature of the Gulf•stream proper.
   131. After passing Sombrero Lighthouse, the channel of the Gulf-stream
begins to turn northwards (Diagram iv.)     and the next line of section,
                                                                    :
taken between Carysfort Lighthouse and the Great Bahama Bank (Dia
gram   viii.),    shows       it   to have somewhat                  widened        and    at the same time
become     shallower. The total breadth of the channel   here about 60                     is
miles; but of this,    band of about 15 miles broad on the Florida side
                              a
appears to be occupied by the Polar Stream.  The maximum depth in mid-
channel    is    about       500 fathoms       ;   and the portion    of    that exceeds 400
                                                                                      it
fathoms    in depth      is   about 35 miles broad.             The general character of this
section    very closely        approximates            to that of the Havana section, except
that the slope of its banks      more equal.  It
                                              is    only on the American       is
side, however, that the Isotherms down to 50° run upwards, showing the
approach of the colder water to the surface. Thus the temperature of 55°
is there found at 25 fathoms, whilst on the other side      not reached at
                                                                                           is is

in 60 fathoms more           reduced to 40°.
                                   it   is     Although the temperature
does not seem to have                   been observed            at depths        much greater than 400
fathoms,    it   can scarcely be doubted                that             would be found as low as 35°
                                                                 is it

section.
     132. The channel   again contracts, and at the same time diminishes                                             in
depth, as far as Cape Florida (Diagram iv.), between which and the Bemini

 more than 40 miles, the Polar stream occupies 15 miles of this breadth on the
Florida side; and while its greatest depth scarcely exceeds 300 fathoms, even
this excess only extends over a breadth of about ten miles, forming a valley
on either side of a submarine ridge (Diagram ix.). The Florida slope
shows a well-marked succession of terraces, whilst the Bemini slope is very
steep.    It is most singular to see how the bathymetrical Isotherms here
follow the undulating contour of the bottom, instead of lying parallel to
the surface ; plainly indicating that the colder and heavier water has a
motion of its own, by which it is carried up the slopes of the hills, instead
of finding its level in the valleys. The 75° line, which lies at the surface
on the Florida side, sinks to nearly 100 fathoms in the deepest part of the
channel ; and at ten miles from Cape Florida, where the whole depth but
little exceeds 160 fathoms, the water has a temperature of 70° even at
75 fathoms,    clearly showing the extension of the warm stratum to that
side of the channel.       But below 75 fathoms, on this terrace, the tempera
ture falls so rapidly, that 45° is reached at 140 fathoms; though in the
deeper channel the water at that depth has a temperature of 65°, sinking
to 45° at 250 fathoms.        No temperature below 45° is recorded as having
been observed in this section ; but if the rate of bathymetrical reduction
between    200 and 250 fathoms be continued        downwards      to a bottom   below
300, the temperature of the lowest stratum will be found as low as 35°.
     133. Although the temperature of 35° was not actually observed either
in the Carysfort or in the Bemini sections, the fact that it showed itself in
 the deepest water of both the Sombrero       and the Tortugas sections, and in
 the latter at a depth of less than 400 fathoms,       — taken in     connexion with
the difficulty, if not the impossibility, of otherwise accounting for the pre
sence of water of 35° within the Narrows, — seems fully to justify the assump
tion that it has flowed over what may be called 'the submarine watershed
between Cape Florida and the Bemini Isles ; and it is clear that in so
doing it must have flowed up a very considerable ascent, which it could
 only do in virtue of   a constantly acting propulsive force.      This is strikingly
 shown in Diagram      in., Plate IV., which represents the longitudinal course
of the bathymetrical Isotherms of 50°, 45°, 40°, along the axis of the
 Gulf-stream in its passage through the Florida Channel. — The soundings
 taken in the subsequent course of the Gulf-stream do not anywhere give
the depth at which temperatures below 45° exist beneath it ; but as that
 temperature   is reached    in the Polar current at 200 fathoms, while the
 thermometer     sinks at 300 fathoms to 40°, and at 400 fathoms to 38°, it
seems clear that the water occupying the lower stratum of the Florida
 Channel is derived from the same source.
     134. That the Polar current which passes into the Gulf of Mexico beneath
 the outflowing Gulf-stream is due to the excess of density in the outside
•column, depending on the depression in the temperature of its lower stratum,
 was maintained in 1867 by Mr. Mitchell*, who had been engagedin the

620                           Dr. W. B. Carpenter          on the                [June 13,
survey of the Tortugas section, and reported very carefully on the pheno
mena    it presents.       He regards the Gulf-stream current, like that of the
Baltic or the Dardanelles, as tending to the restoration of the surface-level
of the basin from which it flows, which the inset of the Equatorial current
will as constantly tend to raise ; and he gives the following example of
" compensating currents," which is peculiarly applicable not merely to the
doctrine now under consideration, but also to that of the under-currents of
the Straits of Gibraltar         and the Baltic       Sound.   — During     the dry season
(July), the surface-ott^flow of brackish water through the Narrows of New
York harbour occupies nine out of the twelve tidal hours ; this water chiefly
consisting of the water brought down by the Hudson River, with some ad
mixture of salt water.          This salt water enters as a lower stratum, the inflow
of which is nearly uninterrupted, though not constant in velocity ; and the
same condition extends for some distance up the river.                   On running a line
of  levels   from     New    York    City  to  Albany,    it was  found    that the bed of
the Hudson       lies  below  the  mean   level   of  the  sea for  nearly 100 miles from
its mouth     ; but   that  the  surface  of  the  fresh  water,   even  in the dry season,
is above this level, — not so much so, however, as to equalize the difference
of weight between the column of River-water within the Narrows and
that of the Sea-water outside ; so that the latter during the summer months
flows in along the bed of the stream, while the former overflows into the
ocean. During other parts of the year, however, the level within the Narrows
being higher, the inner column is the heavier, and the inflow of Sea-water
does not take place.
    135. We are now prepared to examine the influence of the body of
warm water discharged by the Gulf-stream into the Mid- Atlantic, on the
Temperature of the Oceanic area through which it makes its way. — It is
obvious that so long as it retains its Northern course, and does not diffuse
itself to the East — while it is completely shut in on its Western border by
the Arctic current— it cannot directly affect the temperature of the general
surface of the Ocean west of the Meridian of 70° ; and we find (as already
pointed     out) that the Winter Isotherms of 70° and 65° are only carried
northwards in the immediate course of the Stream, while the great north
ward movement of the Summer Isotherms of 80° and 75° appears to be
quite sufficiently accounted for by the general influences already referred
to  (§§   1 17-119) as     modifying the climate of the North Atlantic.
    136. The most striking peculiarity in the Thermal condition                 of the Gulf-
stream, as compared         with that of the Ocean through which it flows in the
first part of its course, seems to consist, not so much in its more elevated
surface-temperature,        as in the greater thickness of its superheated stratum ;
which, as will be presently shown, has a most important influence on the
maintenance       of its surface-temperature       when it is exposed to an atmosphere
colder than itself.       Recent inquiries have shown that the high surface-tem-*
pcrature of the Gulf-stream is not derived (as commonly supposed) from its
circulation within the almost land-locked Gulf of Mexico ; for the average

   surface-temperature        of the Gulf of Mexico is usually lower than that of the
   Caribbean Sea, and during several months in the year it is rather below
  that of the Gulf-stream in the Florida Channel (§ 124).               Ilence the surface-
  layer, at least, of the Gulf•stream would appear to be derived from that
  warmer current which, after flowing westward along the south of Cuba,
  turns abruptly round Cape Antonio, and then flows eastward towards the
  Florida Channel. — But we might expect that the Gulf of Mexico, even
  more than the Caribbean Sea, would have its au6-surface temperature ele
  vated by the limitation to the admission                 of Polar water ; and such an
  elevation we find to be presented in the section between the Tortugas and
  Havana, which may probably be considered, as regards this stratum, to
  represent the Gulf of Mexico generally.               Accordingly, on comparing its
  thermal condition (§ 129) with that of the corresponding stratum of the
  Caribbean Sea, as shown in the temperature-soundings                  of the ' Mercury '
  (§ 127), we see that the temperatures between 100 and 400 fathoms are
  a few degrees hit/her in the Tortugas section than in the Caribbean Sea ;
  the temperature of 62°, which extends in the former to 300 fathoms,
  ranging in the latter only to 200. But even this downward range contrasts
  strongly with the limitation of that temperature to the uppermost 100
  fathoms in the open Ocean, and the rapid fall in the next 1 00, as shown in
                     '
 the 'Mercury soundings to the east of Barbadoes (§ 127).                      This down
 ward extension of surplus heat is retained through all the early part of the
  Gulf-stream ; as has been already shown in the contrast between the
 temperatures       of the Polar Current       and  of the Gulf-stream off    Sandy Hook
 (§   128).
      137.   It can scarcely be doubted         that the extraordinary thickness of the
 superheated       stratum in the Gulf-stream has much to do both with its own
 retention of a high surface-temperature             in its northward course and with
 its power of imparting heat to the Air above it ; for it is obvious that the
 thinner the superheated stratum, the more speedily will its temperature be
 brought down by that of a colder superincumbent atmosphere.                     But it is
~also clear that its loss of heat may be really much greater than the reduc
 tion of its surface-temperature           would indicate ; for as fast as its superficial
 stratum     is cooled down, its increase of density         will cause it to sink until it
 meets with water as cold as itself,           the   warmer   sub-surface stratum rising
 into its place.       And since this process will continue to take place so long as
 there is a subjacent stratum of higher temperature than the superincum
 bent Atmosphere, the awr/ace-temperature              of the current may be maintained
 with comparatively        little  reduction,  though the temperature of its subjacent
 strata may     have    been   reduced    almost  to that of the ordinary Oceanic water
 which    it  overlies.    But    in  the very same   proportion that it thus loses heat,
 will it impart heat to the Atmosphere above ; and may thus, by warming a
 vast body of air which is rapidly borne towards North-western Europe,
 furnish an important element in the amelioration of its climate. — The de

the superheated  layer is well shown in the contrast hetween the Mediterra
nean and the portion of the Gulf-stream that lies between the same parallels.
For while the surface-temperature   of the former sometimes rises as high as
that of the latter, it is subject to a considerable diurnal range, in conse
quence of the thinness of its superheated stratum     while its seasonal range
                                                                  ;
closely follows the temperature   of the atmosphere, down to its constant
winter mean of about 54° (Report for 18/0, § 89).          But in the latter
there is scarcely any diurnal range ; while its winter temperature only falls
to 72° off Cape Hatteras, and to 67° off Nantucket ; for as a temperature
of 60° or upwards extends to a depth of from 200 to 300 fathoms, the
whole of this sub-surface stratum must be reduced to that standard, or
below    it,   before the sur/i/ce-temperature would fall to 60°. — It follows as                      a
Corollary, that      a   deep stratum   having   moderate excess of temperature
                                                 a
may be     a   far more effectual carrier of Heat into   colder area than
                                                                 a           much           a
warmer    superficial flow.
     138. The thermal power of the Gulf-stream, or of any similar Current,
must depend on three factors, — (1) the Sectional Area of the Stream;
(2) the Rate of its flow and (3) its Temperature.
                              ;
   139. It   impossible, in the present state of our knowledge, to arrive at
                is
any exact estimate of the sectional area of the Stream     since    for the
                                                                         ;           it   is
most part only from the Temperatures      of its different strata that we can
judge whether they are, or are not, in movement, and what        the direction
                                                                             is
 of their movement.     If we accept the conclusion of the U.S. Surveyors
(§1
       29) that in the Havana Section the depth of the outward current was
 not above one-third of the greatest depth of the Channel, — namely, about
 200 fathoms, — and take the average temperature at that depth to be about
 fi0°, we may assume that the stratum extending downwards to 60° in other
 sections represents the real outwardly flowing Stream.         Now     will be           it
seen  that in the Cape Florida and Bemini Section, the line of 60°        the                    in
channel  of the Gulf-stream proper has an average depth of about 75 fathoms,      1
or 1050 feet; but the breadth of the outflowing Stream cannot be taken
(according to Prof. Bache's estimate) at more than 25 miles. — Mr. Croll's
estimate of the quantity of water as equal to          stream 50 miles broad
                                                                     a
and 1000 feet deep, appears to be based on the sectional area of the entire
channel,       which he states at 30 miles broad and         1   950 feet deep   ;    but   it   seems
clear that the lower portion of this channel                 must  be occupied by an in
flowing current and the only question

 which the reversal of the flow takes place.

movement         in the sub-surface stratum ; and all our knowledge               of double cur
rents would lead to the belief that it gradually diminishes                    from above down
wards, until the water becomes motionless,                or nearly       so, as we approach      the
plane of reversal.              Hence, taking the medium       between two miles and cero,
the average rate of the whole outflowing stream would                         be   no more     than
one mile per hour.
   141. If we assume the limit of the stratum above 60° as that of the
real Gulf-stream current, we shall find its average temperature to be
somewhat higher than it has been stated by Mr. Croll, who seems to
have        65° as the average of the water flowing through the entire
        taken
channel.  The average «ur/ace-temperature   of the Florida Channel for
the whole year is 80° ; and we may fairly set the average of the entire
outgoing Stream, down to the plane of 60°, at 70°, instead of 65° as esti
mated by   Mr. Croll.
     142.The prevalent doctrine, however, of the persistence of this Tempe
rature, with but very trifling reduction, nearly as faras the Banks of New
foundland, is based on observations made during the Summer ; when the
Isotherm of 70° extends north of the parallel of 40°, and the cooling
influence of the atmosphere is consequently      at its least. In Winter, on
the other hand, when the Isotherm of 60° follows nearly the same line, the
surface-temperature  of the Gulf-stream is reduced almost to that degree
before it reaches the Banks ; as is shown in the following Table, derived
from the Admiralty Chart : —

   Thus it appears that instead of a loss of only 5° in the northward flow
of  the Gulf-stream from Lat. 25° to Lat. 35°, the average loss for the
whole year is 11°. And the cooling influence of the superincumbent Air
on the Gulf•stream, even at its deepest and strongest, is manfested in its
loss of 13° of surface-temperature in the Autumn, and of 15° in the Winter,
although its passage thus far is accomplished in from forty to fifty days. —
During this time, it must be remembered, it continues to lose heat by
evaporation as well as by radiation ; the large amount of vapour which is
being continually given off being made manifest by its precipitation in the
form of fog when the Gulf-stream encounters the Arctic                             current which
meets it before it reaches the Banks of Newfoundland.
     143.   It   is,   again,    on the contrast    in   Temperature between the Gulf

  624                            Dr. W. B. Carpenter       on the               [June 13,
  stream    and    the   Arctic current, — not between        the   Gulf-stream and     the
   ordinary Oceanic water, — that the prevalent notions respecting its              special
   heating-power are mainly founded.                Thus Admiral Sir Alexander      Milne,
   proceeding in H.M.S. 'Nile' from Halifax to Bermuda iu May                        1861,
  found the temperature 70° at the bow, when it was only 40° at the                 stern ;
  thus showing a difference of 30° within the ship's length. When,                  on the
  other hand, the temperature of the eastern edge of the Gulf-stream in the
  earlier part of its course, and of the southern edge in the later part of its
  course, is compared with the normal of the neighbouring portion of the
  Atlantic, the difference is found to be comparatively slight, the one gra
  duating into the other.
      144. The average rate of two miles per hour, which the Gulf-stream
        in the Narrows, is maintained to Lat. 30°; but it then begins to
  show a decided reduction,          falling to 40 miles per day between 30° and 33°
  N. Lat.      When the Stream has passed Cape Hatteras, and its land side is
  pressed on by the Arctic current, this compression seems to have the same
  effect in increasing its velocity that limitation between banks would exert ;
 for the rate of flow there rises again, sometimes exceeding four miles per
 hour.      At   the same time        the rate  of  the Stream at its outer edge is not
 greater than from         10 to 20 miles per day.       The direction of the Stream is
 gradually changed by the trend of the coast-line, first from N. to N.E. by
 N.,   then to    N.E.,   and subsequently,      after being subject to the influence    of
 the Arctic       current,    to  E.N.E.       Part of this Easterly deflection, how
 ever, is probably to be attributed to the greater easterly momentum which
 this body of water brings with it from its southern source, in virtue of its
 excess of rotary velocity ; as was first pointed out by Capt. Maury, whose view
 on this point was adopted by Sir John Herschel. And, of course, the further
 North the Stream advances, the more strongly will this excess show itself,
 in giving to the movement of the Stream an Easterly direction. Conversely,
 the Arctic Current coming Southwards will bring with it a smaller rotary
velocity than that of the parallel it reaches, and will thus have a Westerly
tendency, which will keep it close to the coast-line of the United States.
     145. Very early in its course, the Gulf-stream begins to show a division
into alternate bands of warmer and colder water ; and these become very
perceptible     before it passes Charleston.          The cause of this division appears
to lie in the contour of the bottom in the Florida Channel ; the elevations
of which,     as already    stated (§ 132), throw up the colder water of the deeper
stratum     nearer    to the surface.        With the increase in the breadth of the
Stream as a whole,         there   is at the same time      an increase   in the distance
between the bands.           Thus at Cape Hatteras, where the " cold wall" sepa
rating    the   Gulf-stream      from the Arctic Current is 30 miles from shore,
the first or axial band of the Gulf-stream has a breadth of 47 miles ; to
the east of this there is a cold band 25 miles broad ; and this is succeeded
by another       warm     band    of  45 miles.    These   two warm     bands,  with the
intervening     colder band, are considered         by Prof. Bache as constituting the

                       ' Shearwater'                                              625
1872.]                                    Scientific Researches.
 Gulf-stream proper       ;  but to the east of this, beyond another cold band of
37 miles breadth,      there    is still another warm baud 75 miles broad          Off
Sandy Hook, where the Stream makes its great bend to the East, and the
" cold wall " is at a distance of 240 miles from the shore, the " Gulf-
                  " has
stream proper               only increased in breadth from 1 17 miles to 1 '27 ; but
the breadth of the second cold band has now increased from 37 miles to
60, whilst the breadth of the third warm band has diminished from 75 miles
to 50 ; the outer portion of the Stream showing an obvious tendency to
lose itself in the general mass of Oceanic water. — The total breadth of the
Gulf-stream is stated by the American Surveyors to be 350 miles off Cape
Hatteras, and 410 miles off Nantucket ; but as the outer boundary is not
well defined, these estimates are only approximative.
     146. The difference in the rate of movement of these bands is probably
one source     of the discrepancy       in the statements given by different   autho
rities  as to the rate    of the flow of the Gulf-stream as a whole.       It is com
monly said to pass Nantucket at the rate of about one mile an hour ; aud
 an observation     cited in Blunt's ' Coast Pilot' would give about 0-7 mile
 per hour as its rate between 'W. Long. 57° and 55|°, between the 41st and
 42nd parallels of Latitude.          Many degrees to the east of this, however, a
 very rapid current — running at the rate of even four miles an hour — has
 been occasionally observed ; and this is probably due, like that sometimes
 seen off Cape Hatteras, to the lateral pressure exerted by the Arctic cur
 rent, which comes down in full force over the Banks of Newfoundland,
 sometimes extending far to the southward, directly into the course of the
 Gulf-stream.      It is during the early months of the year that, under the
 influence of the N. and N.W. winds which then prevail along the coast of
 Labrador, the Arctic current — bringing with it immense fields of polar ice
 — is   at its strongest ; and the Admiralty         Chart shows the southward     ex
 tension of this field-ice, between March and         July, reaching even to the 42nd
 parallel between the meridians of 55° and 45° W. Long. ; while between
 April and June, icebergs range as far South as 39° between the meridians
 of 50° and 40°. This enormous body of Polar ice-laden water must have
  a powerful influence both on the movement and on the temperature of the
  Stream against which it impinges, more especially since the deep-floating
  icebergs will bring this influence to bear directly on its deeper strata ;
  and it is considered by Mr. Findlay that
                                                      " by the time the Gulf-stream
  " has reached this limit, its original character is so thinned out and ex-
  "  panded, and its specific character is so destroyed from this cause, and
  "  from the neutralizing effects of the Labrador currents, that it can no
  "  longer be recognized beyond this cold-water gulf, which cuts off, as it
  "  were, its further progress, and which, it is manifest, it can neither bridge
  " over   nor pass under." (Proc. ltoy. Geogr. Soe., Feb. 8, 1869, p. 107.)
  — That    the Stream has here for the most part thinned-out to a compara
  tively shallow stratum running over much colder water, is indicated by the
  observations    of Capt. Chimmo (Op. cit. p. 92 et seq.), which were made

626                            Dr.   VV.   B. Carpenter     on the          [June 13,
in   July   1868, on the axis or northern           border of the Gulf-stream.       Thus
near the southern edge of the Grand Bank, the temperature of the surface
being G5°, it was found to be only 50° at 100 fathoms ; and a large iceberg
was met with as far as 30 miles south of the Grand Bank, showing the
southward extension of an underflow of Arctic water, although the surface-
temperature of 62° indicated that the upper stratum consisted of Gulf-
stream water flowing in a very different direction. " Although it was still
" 150 feet high,     and nearly 400 immersed, it was quickly and perceptibly
" undermining,       decomposing, splitting with loud reports, and floating
" away in large portions with the easterly current." In another instance,
the surface-temperature being 61°, the temperature at only 50 fathoms
depth was as low as 43° ; but there was here probably a mere overflow of
the surface-stratum, corresponding to that which extends beyond the " cold
wall" off the coast of the United States (§ 128). That there is still
a warm band extending     to a considerable depth, seems to be indicated
by the sounding taken in Lat. 43° 30' N. and Long. 38° 50' W. to test
the existence of the supposed " Milne Bank."    Here the surface-tempera
ture being 73°, the temperature at 100 fathoms was 62°, and at 300
fathoms was 55°      ;   and thus, although the temperature of the upper stratum
was nearly ten degrees        lower than that which it showed off Sandy Hook
(§ 128),    the   temperatures at 100 and 300 fathoms were nearly identical
with those there found       at corresponding depths, and were above those
found at the same depths and under almost the same parallel                 nearer the
coast of Europe (§ 13).
  147. The direction of the Gulf-stream current is here so nearly due
East, that we should naturally look for its continuation across the open
Ocean in the same direction.  After passing the meridian of 40° W., how
ever, we find the summer Isotherm of 75°, which rises between the meridians
of 45° and 65° W. to the north of the parallel of 40° N., and the summer
Isotherm of 70", which rises to 43° N., as well as the winter Isotherm of
60°, which nearly coincides with      all tending southwards, — the first very
                                              it,
abruptly,    the second and third more gradually (Plate VII.)    and this ten
                                                                       ;
dency corresponds with the general set of the surface-current. From the
coincidence of these facts, there can be no reasonable doubt that  very          a
large portion of the Gulf-stream here takes    Southward direction, passing
                                                        a
first S.E. towards the Azores, and then due S. and S.W., so as to return off
Cape Verde        into Equatorial Current, — thus completing, with the
                         the
North-African Current     120), the "shorter circulation" of the North

on an indraught, producing      "compensation-current" for the replacement

before reaching the Meridian of 30° W., the Gulf-stream, to use the language
of Dr. Hayes, " has lost every distinctive character as a current : first, in

varying with the degree in which the westerly
nate in force and duration over other winds.  That it is essentially inde
pendent of the Gulf-stream, seems to be distinctly indicated by the fact
that it commences from the very edge of the Arctic current, on the Eastern
side of the broad band which it covers, as far as 10° to the north of the
Gulf-stream, running parallel to its course.  Although mainly due to the
dominant influence of the "Anti-trades," yet it may be partly accounted
for in another way ; for   as      if,

" Rennell's Current," we have next to inquire what evidence can be adduced
of its influence on the Temperature of the Eastern side of the Atlantic. —
Tiiis question can be best answered by an examination of the course of the
Isothermal lines to the eastward of the Meridian of 30°. For their passage
across that meridian between the parallels of 34° and 50° at more regular in
tervals than are seen between them elsewhere, indicates that their position              is
there comparatively little affected by disturbing causes, either of elevation
or depression and further, the close relation which we there observe between
                 ;
the Winter Isotherms and the Summer Isotherms of 10° higher, indicates
that on this meridian the seasonal movement takes place rather in accordance
with general Climatic changes than under any special influences.     For the
Summer     Isotherms  of 7ii°, 70°, 65°, and 60° are here nearly equidistant,
crossing the Meridian in the parallels of 34°, 41°, 46°, and 50°*5 re
spectively   ; while the Winter Isotherms of 65°, 60°, 55°, and 50° seve
rally cross  itat  distance of scarcely
                     a                    degree from the preceding.

whilst, as we have seen    147),
                               (§the  summer  Isotherm of 70° and the winter
Isotherm of 60° turn southwards to the east of 30° W., the summer
Isotherm of 05° and the winter Isotherm of 55° keep their course nearly
due eastwards     into the Bay of Biscay while the summer Isotherm of 60°

and the winter Isotherm     of 50° in like manner keep an easterly course —              a
little tending to the north — towards the South of Ireland.       There seems
no reason whatever for believing that the ordinary temperature          of the
southern part of the Bay of Biscay        at all higher than the normal of the

thermometer         in crossing the Bay of Biscay from 49° in Lat. 475P
                  rise
to f)5°-7 in Lat. 44 J°; an increase of 6°-7 being thus shown between one
day and the next, although the difference of Latitude alone would account
for no more than 2i°.              Further south the temperature         was found as much
below the normal as      it   here was above it. So again, Dr. Franklin, in his voyage,
in November 1776, between the United States and France, found the tem
perature along the produced line of the Gulf-stream much higher than has
subsequently proved to be usual  the thermometer standing at 62° in Long.

1 5°  W., where subsequently, in August        1 785, it only showed 66°.   Further
west, in the course of the Gulf-stream proper, great diversities are obser
vable between the temperatures found at the same points in corresponding
periods of different years *. — On the whole, then, it seems probable that the
Gulf-stream varies considerably from time to time iu force and in heating
power ; and that an extension of it into the Buy of Biscay may be sometimes
distinguishable    by local elevation of the Thermometer, although the ordi
nary temperature of the Atlantic         as far north as the British Channel is in
no wise dependent on its influence.
    151. Evidence of amelioration in the Climate          of the British Isles, and
of    the region still further North, by a         North-easterly flow of Oceanic
water. — It is when we pass northwards along the western shores of
Europe, as far as the British Isles, that we first encounter, in the marked
northward tendency of the Isothermal lines, especially in winter, an
indication of northerly movement in the water of the North Atlantic.
But it is important here to observe that the winter Isotherms of 55°
and 50°, as laid down in Dr. Petcrmann's Charts, reach a considerably
higher Latitude in the Meridian of about 25° W. than they do where
they approach the coast of Europe in the Meridian of 10° W., — the
former, which nearly touches the parallel of 50°, turning south to Co-
runna in 4-1° N. Lat. ; and the latter, which rises on that meridian to 54|°
N. Lat., falling to 50° at the entrance of the British Channel.                Now
this    may be taken as a very significant indication that the residual heat
which the Gulf-stream may retain, after encountering the Arctic Current,
is dissipated in the further passage of its water to the eastward.         And the
same inference may be drawn from            the monthly averages of the observa
tions of surface-temperature taken on board the Cunard Steam-ships
between the South of Ireland and the Banks of Newfoundland ; which show
 that while the winter (February) average only falls from 54° in W. Long.
 40° to 53° in W. Long. 25° (although most of the change of Latitude
 occurs in that part of the course), it is reduced to 50° in W. Long. 10°.
But the winter Isotherm of 45°, like the summer Isotherm of 55°, tends so
 continuously    to the North, as to pass between the Shetland and the Faroe
 Islands ;  so that the whole western coast of the British Islands, having a
range of more than eleven degrees of Latitude, lies between the July Iso
 therms of 60° and 55°, and the January Isotherms of 50° and 45°.
     152. This northward extension of n Climate so little more severe than
 that of the South of England, bespeaks some very effective ameliorating
 agency ; and the question now arises whether this agency is solely that of
 Wind, as maintained by Mr. Findlay and Dr. Hayes, or is in part exerted
 by Water.      It is argued by Dr. Hayes that the temperature of the Sea
follows,   and  is therefore subject to that of the Air, instead of governing it.
 Thus, he says, " We have seen and examined the Weather-register kept on
 " board the Light-ship off Sandy Hook. It shows that the temperature of

"the Water       follows   that of the Air with remarkable         precision,   whether on
" the ascending or descending scale. The observations were made three
" times daily, and they show a range throughout the year of from 29°
" to 78°. This latter temperature was nearly as high as the highest tem-
" perature of the Air on that day. The lowest temperature of the Air
" was 4°, which brought the water down to freezing, and some ice was
" formed.       The average temperatures for nine consecutive days in July
" were — Air 74°, Water 71°; for a corresponding period in February,
" Air 32°, Water 31°." The following observations, again, are cited by
Dr. Hayes to prove that comparatively                   warm water does not impart
excess of warmth to the Air: — "At midnight, Feb. 22, 1869, tne Pa-
"cific Mail-steamer 'Alaska,' on her way to Aspinwall, was 148 miles
"to the north of the Gulf-stream; the temperature of the Air at the
"  time was 22°,      and of the Water 39°,          the ship    steering   south.     At 2h
"50"'    p.m.,  the   Air   was 39°, the Water 46°, which is the general Winter
" temperature of the Ocean-water in that Latitude on the U.S. coast. At
" 2h 54m, the 'Alaska ' having entered the Stream, the Air was 40°, the Water
" 65°. Afterwards the Water rose to 70°, but the Air remained at 40° until
" the stream was crossed : then the Air rose to 44°, while the Water sank
" to 62°." — Dr. Hayes further cites, from a paper by Dr. Stork in the
'                          '
  Nautical Magazine for 1859, a series of observations which tend                   to prove
that on the coast of Scotland the temperature of the Water of the                   Atlantic
is regulated by that of the Air, rising and falling after it ; so                   that the
diurnal, monthly, and annual variations of the two show a close                     parallel,
except that the fluctuations in the temperature             of the Air are in advance of
those of the temperature of the Sea.
     153. This view, however, is in opposition            to the results   of  the observa
tions which have now been carried               on by the Scottish Meteorological So
ciety through a lengthened            term of years*.       For they show that on the
West Coast of Scotland           the Mean Annual Temperature of the Sea is from
two to three degrees higher than that of the             Air  ; whilst still further north,
the difference is still more in favour of the Sea (§ 155).               And they further
show that this Mean Annual excess represents a very much larger winter
excess ; the summer temperature             of the Sea being below that of the Air.
For   if we  divide the whole year into three periods, each of four months,               we
find   the average excess of Sea-temperature              at Otter    House, Loch Fyne,
which is 2°-5 for the whole year, to be 6°"2 during November, December,
January, and February, and to be only 2°'3 during March, April,
September, and October ; whilst during May, June, July, and August
there is an average        difference    of 20,1  in favour of the    Air. These differ
ences clearly show        that    the Sea here brings      with it a temperature of its
own, which tends to maintain             an equability of Climate by moderating both

 the summer heat and the winter cold. — It would probably be found, how
 ever, on a more detailed comparison, that even in winter the relative tem
peratures of the Sea and Air are much influenced by the direction of the
Wind      ; as the greatest differences may be expected to present themselves
when, after a continuance of S.W. winds which have produced a powerful
 drift of warmer water towards the         coast *, the wind changes to the     N.E.,
immediately reducing the temperature of the Air, and not for some time
producing a like fall in that of the Sea.
     15-1.  It is further urged by     Mr. Buchan, who has paid special attention
to the^Distribution of Temperature in the British Islands f, that the pecu
liar course of the Isocheimal lines, or lines of mean Winter temperature,
indicates that the ameliorating influence comes from the west, rather than
from the south-west, and thus from the Sea as well as from the Air. The
course of the Isotherms between          the months of    April and October     has   a
general relation to the parallels of latitude ; the summer-temperatures of
Ireland and the West Coast being, however, lower in August (Plate VI.)
than those of the middle of England, showing that the neighbourhood of
the sea has      a reducing effect at that period.     In November, however, the
direction of the Isotherms begins to undergo a marked change ; their
western portions turning northward, and their eastern portions southward,
whilst the intermediate parts run almost due north and south.               Thus the
Isotherm of 43° passes from Belfast across the Irish Sea to Whitehaven,
and then turns southwards through Lancaster to Oxford ; while that of 45°,
after passing Cape Clear and Wexford towards Anglesea, there takes a
direct southward bend which carries it to Exeter.            This meridional direc
tion shows itself still more strongly in December,        —  the line of 42°, which
passes through       Belfast, turning southwards so as to pass through Liverpool
and Bristol, and thence S.E. to Brighton and Dieppe ; while the line of 4 1°
ranges nearly north and south from the Shetland and Orkney Islands to
Dover, and that of 40° runs parallel to it from the Moray Firth to Cromer.
It is in January, however, that this Meridional direction is most pronounced
                 —
(Plate VI.), the Isotherm of 39° passing from Unst along the Western
coast of Scotland, and then through the centre of England to Hastings ;
and the Isotherms of 38° and 37° lying parallel to it on the east, while
those of 40° and 41° show a like parallelism to it on the west.            In Ireland
the Isocheimals "seem to envelope the island with their folds, which iu-
" crease in warmth from the centre of the island outward to the ocean."
In February, however, the influence of         the sun begins to show itself in the
tendency of the Isotherms to exchange their meridional direction for that
of the parallels of Latitude ; and this is still more marked in the March
Isotherm, that of April showing the change completed.                  Now, as Mr.
   *  1 learn from a friend who resides at Sidmouth, that tho Sea-temperature always
sensibly rises there with a S.W. gale.

 Buchan points out, if the warming influence were derived solely from
 Winds, the distribution of the Isocheimals or Winter Isotherms would be
 very different.
     155.    The recent extension, by the Scottish Meteorological Society, of
 the same accurate system of observations to the Faroe Islands and Iceland,
 and by the Meteorological Institute of Norway to various points on the
 Norwegian Coast, has brought out still more strongly the fact that the
 Climate of these stations is moderated, not merely by their proximity to the
 Sea, but by the warmer temperature, derived from a Southern source,             which
 the Sea brings with it.      At Thorsavn (Faroe), the Mean Annual excess             of
 Sea-temperature,    its maximum    in the Winter months, and the reversal            of
 the difference between the     Air and  Sea in the Summer, correspond closely
 with the similar averages on the West of Scotland.            At Reykjavik the
 Mean Annual excess of Sea-temperature is a little higher, but the Winter
 maximum is not so great, and in the Summer the temperatures of the Sea
 and Air are nearly equal.     At Stykkisholm the Mean Annual excess of Sea-
 temperature rises to 4°-2 ; the higher average being due not so much to
an increase in the Winter excess, but to the continuance of a sensible dif
ference in favour of the Sea through the whole Summer, excepting in the
month of May. — It is at the Norwegian Stations, however, that the excess
of Sea-temperature shows itself most strongly, and particularly at Fruholm
near the North Cape; where, the Mean Annual excess being 6°'l, the
mean excess of the four Winter months is 14°- 5 (that of December alone
being nearly 1 7°), the mean of the four Spring and Autumn months being
60-3, while the excess of Air-temperature          in the four Summer months
averages   only 2°-6.
    156.  It  can scarcely be doubted, then, that a general North-easterly
surface-movement of Oceanic water is taking place in the portion of the
North Atlantic which lies between Iceland and Scandinavia ; and of the
existence of such a movement adequate evidence has already been adduced
  (§14).    This movement, says Admiral Irminger*, "is the cause why
"  the harbours of Norway, even further than the North Cape, and as far
"  as the Fiord of Varanger, are accessible for navigation during the whole
"  year ; just as the warm current which passes Cape Reikianiis, and runs
" to  the northward along the western shores of Iceland, is the cause of the
" south and west coasts of this island being clear of ice, so that even
" during the severest winters ships may go to Havne Fiord and other
" places in the Faxe Bay of Iceland, where they will always be sure
" of finding open sea. If this current to the North in the Atlantic did not
" exist, the ice from the sea round Spitzbergen would float down to more
" southern latitudes than is now the case ; and certainly the coasts of Nor-
" way, as well as the sea between Shetland and Iceland, would frequently
" be filled with ice from the Icy Sea, and the influence of the ice would
" then be felt on the climate of the neighbouring coasts." —That this

the considerations formerly stated (§ 13).
    1 57.  But independently of this general N.E. Oceanic movement, the Tem
perature-observations which have been correlated by Admiral Irminger *,
and another series more recently collected and correlated by Prof. Mohn of
Christianiaf, indicate that its surface is traversed by bands of somewhat
greater warmth.         Admiral Irminger specially notes the existence of two
such bands, — one of them a little to the west of Fair Isle, which is regarded
by Dr. Keith Johnston and Mr. Buchan (on the basis of Prof. Mohn's data)
as the axis of this " slow current," its temperature being sensibly higher
than the temperature to the west or east of it ; whilst the other, the posi
tion of which is more variable, is met with much further to the westward,
sometimes even beyond the meridian of the southernmost point of Iceland.
— These bands, the existence of which has been lately confirmed by Von
Middendorf (§ 1 60), are regarded by Admiral Irminger (as it seems to me
with great probability) in the light of real continuations of the " Gulf-
stream proper," which are not only deflected northwards, but also carried
onwards by the general N.E. " set."              Admiral Irminger, moreover, with

     158. Having thus found, in the Temperature-phenomena of the British
Islands and of the Seas immediately adjacent to them, very decided indi
cations of a general N.E. movement of Oceanic surface-water, we shall next
trace the relation of these phenomena to the Thermal condition of the por
tion of the North Atlantic that extends from Newfoundland to the Arctic
Sea, as indicated       by the course of the Isothermal lines laid down in Dr.
 Petermann's Gulf-stream Charts for January and July. These show (Plate
VII.) in a very marked manner the influence of the Labrador current, which
 bears    southward   a  great body of Polar ice and glacial water, in depressing
 alike the summer and the winter Isotherms on the western side of the North
Atlantic ; the influence of this current in lowering the temperature of the
portion of the Ocean in which it meets the Gulf-stream being probably fully
 as great as that of the Gulf-stream in raising it. — It is curious to see how
 sharply the summer Isotherms of 541°, 50°, and 45-^° turn northwards to
 the east of the Banks of Newfoundland             :  diverging from one another and
 from the Summer Isotherm           of 60° at intervals which are pretty nearly
 equal almost as far to the East as the meridian of 30° W. ; but then again
 trending strongly to the North, so that the summer Isotherm of 54£° crosses
 the parallel of 60° N. before, by a slight trend to the South, it passes
through the Pentland Firth.         Thence crossing the North Sea, this Isotherm
 passes along the coast of Norway as far as Tromso (very near the parallel

of 70°), and then turns southwards along the land, keeping within the
coast-line of Russian Lapland, and passing across the narrow throat of the
White Sea. The summer Isotherms of 50° and 4o|° cross the mouth of
Baffin's Bay, and then follow the curve of the coast of Greenland towards
Iceland ; when approaching which they turn eastwards, the line of 50°
striking the land at Stykkisholm on the N.W., while the line of 45£° passes
altogether to the north of the island.       To the east of Iceland the Isotherms
take a southerly bend, apparently under the influence of a drift of ice from
the Polar Sea ; but soon turn northwards again, — the line of 50° running
nearly parallel to the const of Norway as far as the North Cape, and then
turning southwards along the coast of Russian Lapland, so as to cross the
mouth of the White Sea to the base of the Kanin Peninsula ; while the line
of 451° runs parallel to this as far north as Lat. 72-J-°, and then turns south
wards, still retaining the same parallelism, so as to strike the coast of Russia
beyond that peninsula.       Still further north, we find the summer Isotherms
of 41° and 36?° showing a nearly W. to E. direction until they have passed
the meridian of 1 0° W., and then suddenly turning northwards ; the line
of 36|° passing up to the west of Spitzbergen as far as 82° N., and also
extending itself irregularly eastwards along the parallel of 75° as far as
Nova Zembla.
    159. The course of the winter Isotherms of 45£°, 41°, 36i°, andJ32°,
as shown in Dr. Petermann's Chart, is no less significant ; for they all
turn sharply to the North on the eastern side of the Banks of Newfound
land, cross the entrance of Baffin's Bay, and then keep a course of general
parallelism to the coast of Greenland, crossing the meridian of 30° W. at
almost equal intervals.       The winter Isotherm of 45|° follows almost
exactly the course of the summer Isotherm of 54^° as far as the Shetland
Islands : but it then turns back on itself so as to form a loop, passing south
wards along the Western Hebrides towards Belfast.              The course of the
winter Isotherm of 40° in like manner at first bears a general correspond
ence with that of the summer Isotherm of .50°, skirting the south coast of
Iceland, and then passing N.E. in the channel between Iceland and Nor
way ; but in Lat. 674° N. it also returns in a loop, which brings it back
to the east coast of Scotland.       The winter Isotherm of 36 h°, again, corre
sponds very closely with the summer Isotherm of 45°; passing through
Iceland, and then keeping a N.E. course which carries it far to the north
and east of the North; Cape, when       it,  too, forms     loop bringing
                                                             a                backit
to the coast of Russian Lapland.           Finally, the winter Isotherm of 32°
proceeds along  a    similar course from the Banks of Newfoundland to the
northernmost point of Iceland, and then onwards towards Jan Mayen,
beyond which   it   has not been traced.
   160.  That this remarkable course both of the Summer and of the Winter
Isotherms can only be accounted for by     N.E. flow of warm water, am

equally certain ; since, unless the warm stratum is of considerable depth, it
could not possibly retain that excess of temperature which it carries with it
into high latitudes. — If any further evidence to this effect were wanting, it
has been supplied by the recent observations made by Von Middendorf in
                                                     '
the Voyage of the Russian Corvette ' Warjiig between Archangel, Iceland,
and Nova Zembla, in the summer of 1870*; some of the most important
of which will now be cited : —
    a. The existence of alternating warm and cold bands, as affirmed by
Admiral Irmingcr, was confirmed.          On the 17th of June, 1870, a tempe
rature of 550-6 was observed off the coast of Norway, north of 60° ; and
in July a temperature of 54^° was observed in N. Lat. 69§°, nearly in sight
of the islands off Tromso, in N. Lat. 64° in the roads of Reikiavik, and
in N. Lat. 61^° on the meridian of the centre of Iceland.              On the other
hand, near the Lofoten Islands the surface-temperature fell to 4"° ; and a
minimum of 420,1 was observed in N. Lat. 64^°.
    b. The thickness of the warm stream is shown by the fact that in N. Lat.
G9j° and W. Long. 14°, the surface-temperature being 50°' 7, the tempera
ture at 40 fathoms was found to be still 460,4, and at 84 fathoms 45°"5.
    c. The North-Cape stream, hardly perceptibly cooled from 54o,0, runs
past the White Sea and the Knnin Peninsula toward the entrance of the
Kara Sea ; so that in the vicinity of Kolgujev Island (N. Lat. 68°) there
are still bands which have in July nearly the same temperature.
    d. On the meridian of the Kanin Peninsula, the North-Cape stream,
which may be there called the Kanin stream, has a breadth of more than
 2° of Latitude,    with a range of temperature between 55° and 47°*7.
The higher the temperature is on the surface, the more rapidly does it
 fall beneath it ; but at 30 fathoms it is still between 42° and 38°-7.         The
Kanin stream appears to divide at Nova Zembla ; its main branch going
onwards into the Kara Sen, whilst a side branch turns northwards along
the west coast of Nova Zembla.             Another portion, however, striking
against the Kanin Peninsula, seems to turn inwards along the east coast
of the White Sea, the temperature of which is moderated by it (especially
 with N.E., N., and N.W. winds) as far as Dwina Bay. The western
 coast  of the White Sea, on the other hand, is bordered by a cold stream,
 the temperature of which is probably the local temperature corresponding
to the region.     Thus, in passing round Cape Swatoi at the beginning of
July, the thermometer fell     to 42°-(i, and further south to 39°"9 ; whilst a
 month later,   H° further  north, on the same meridian, the temperature was
51°-1.
    e. It is considered by Von Middendorf              that   "the Gulf-stream can
 " still be detected at Kolgujev, not only by       the temperature, but also by
 " the blue colour      and high salinity      of the sea." — " We sailed there
 "  through water of so deep a violet-blue, that I was confident of finding it
 "  swarming with microscopic animalculse and plants.               My astonishment

"  was great when       I  could not detect any tiling under the microscope." —
As this distinctive blue colour has not been observed in the North-Cape
stream,    I  should be disposed to attribute it to the diffusion of the fine sedi
mentary particles brought down by the Dwina and Mezen rivers (Report
for 1870,    §§  98, 99).   The Specific Gravity of the water of the Kanin stream
being only      1 •025, it is high only in relation     to that of the water of the
White     Sea, which is   reduced by the large quantity of river-water discharged
into it.     At Cape Swiitoi, which    does not lie in the supposed Gulf-stream,
the Specific Gravity of the water was found to be l-026.
   /.  The Zoological researches of Th. Jarshinski (1869) along the Mur-
manian (N.E. Lapland) coast of the Polar Sea, are stated by Von Mid-
dendorf to prove the affinity of its Fauna with that of the Atlantic Ocean.
   y. The remarkable agreement of the temperature of the Air with that
of the Water, and the manifest dependence of the temperature of the Air
on that of the Water, induce Von Middendorf to adopt, without hesita
tion, the doctrine of direct heating by warm water. " We should have been
 " able," he says, " to determine by the temperature of the Air, without
" ascertaining that of the Water, whether we were or were not within the
" warm water of the extension of the Gulf-stream.               The direction of the
" wind had evidently but a subordinate influence on the temperature of the
" Air." — It is expressly stated by Von Middendorf, that when speaking of
 "currents" he does not intend to imply more than the result of Tempe
rature-observations, which indicate a flow of warm water from the west.
    16 1 . The Temperature-observations recently made by Messrs. Weyprecht
and Payer (§ 1 5) in still higher Northern Latitudes, show that this warmer
surface-layer rapidly thins off towards the north-east ; and that instead
of a rise of Temperature with increase of depth in the Polar area (which is
the doctrine still maintained by many Physical Geographers), there is a rapid
reduction,    — glacial water being found     at a less and less depth in proportion
to the Northing obtained, as I ventured to predict in my last Report
('Proceedings,' vol. xix. p. 190) would prove to be the case.
    162. Further, the observations collected by Dr. Miihry* relating to the
Temperature of the Western coast of Greenland, seem to indicate a
northward flow of comparatively warm water along that side of Baffin's
Bay, in antagonism to the Polar current which flows southwards on the
Labrador side. It is certain that the climate of the south-western coast
of Greenland is much milder than that of either its eastern coast or the
eastern coast of Labrador under the same parallels ; and the summer
Isotherm of 41° is carried northwards in Dr. Petermann's Chart nearly as
far ns Upernavik, while the summer Isotherm of 36|° extends in 70° W.
Long, to Smith's Sound, as in 10° E. Long, it extends to Spitsbergen.
According to Admiral Irminger, a distinct current can be traced as far north
as Lat. 64° or even 67° ; and this brings with it Mimosa and other tropi
cal products, — such as a mahogany log, found on Disco Island, which was

made into    a dining-table for the Governor of Holsteenborg.         Moreover it
has been noticed by several trustworthy observers, that icebergs often move
 northwards in Davis's Straits, in opposition to a southerly moving surface-
 current, as also against the wind.     And although it might seem anomalous
 for a warmer stream to be flowing beneath a colder one, yet the anomaly
 disappears when we bear in mind that the surface-current, being composed
in great degree of water which is the product of the liquefaction of icebergs,
 may have its salinity so reduced as to be specifically lighter than ordinary
 Oceanic water of higher temperature (§ 15).               Although this warmer
north-flowing body of water is assumed by Dr. Miihry to be a branch of
the   " Gulf-stream,"   there is a total absence of indication that it is derived
from any other source than the general North-Atlantic area.
    163. I come, lastly, to consider the question: — Whether           the North
 easterly flow of relatively warm water, by which the Climate of the
 British Islands, and still     more  that of regions lying within the Arctic
 circle, is ameliorated, is attributable to the persistence of the initial force
 of the Gulf-stream proper, supplemented by the general Easterly surface-
 drift of the North Atlantic ; or whether it is a larger and deeper move
ment, forming part of a General Oceanic Circulation sustained by difference
                   — As the direction of the Gulf-stream proper, where it is
 of Temperature.
last to be recognized as a distinct Current, is nearly due East, and as the
incidence of the Polar current off Newfoundland on its northern side will
tend to give it rather a southward than a northward direction, the sudden
northward deflection of the Isothermal lines on the eastern border of the
 Polar current,    and their course of parallelism to the Greenland coast
(which is as marked as the parallelism of the Gulf-stream to the coast of
the United States as far north as Cape Hatteras), do not seem explicable on
the idea of a vis ci tergo ; which must not only extend itself over the
vast Oceanic area that intervenes between        the eastern coast of Greenland
and Scandinavia, but must change the direction of its operation without
any assignable cause.      Still less can it be shown, on this hypothesis,
how a branch of the Gulf-stream should actually turn " round the corner"
westwards into Baffin's Bay, so as to pass fromW.Long.50°to"W.Long. 70°;
and this notwithstanding its excess of easterly momentum, which would
tend to carry any norM-moving stream in the direction of Spitzbergen.
Further, when     we take account    of the retardation   which the Gulf-stream
is known to undergo when flowing in the early             part of its course as a
compact and powerful current, it seems scarcely           conceivable that it can
long retain enough of its initial force to continue        to make its way, when
superficially extended over so vast a surface, against the retarding in
fluence of the increased friction to which that extension must subject
it with the watery bed over which it flows. And though it may be said,
in answer to this      objection, that its movement will be aided by the
prevalent surface-drift, yet the influence of this can only extend to a
very small depth ; and the advocates of the
                                                   " Gulf-stream " doctrine take

G38                          Dr. W. B. Carpenter      on the                 [June     13,
 their stand upon its prolongation as a " deep, warm, voluminous current."
 Under no other condition than this, indeed, can it retain its heat for
 any considerable duration, beneath an Atmosphere whose temperature is
 much below that of its surface (§ 155) ; for since, as we have seen (§ 142),
the Gulf-stream, even at its deepest and strongest, loses in winter Jifteen
degrees of surface-heat while passing from the Florida Channel to the south
of Nova Scotia, it must part much more rapidly with any excess it may still
retain, when its superheated      stratum   has been thinned out by superficial ex
tension,   and when the progressive       reduction of its movement to a rate per
day not exceeding its rate per hour in the most rapid part of its course,
prolongs its exposure from days to weeks, and from weeks to months.
    164. I conclude, then, that nothing save the general Northerly movement
 of a stratum of Water deep enough to retain an excess of heat through a
 lengthened period, whilst /lowing beneath an Atmosphere of lower tempe
 rature than its own, can account for the Thermal phenomena indicated iu
 Dr. Petermann's Gulf-stream Charts. Of such a movement it has been
                                                               '               '
 shown that the Temperature-soundings taken in the               Porcupine Expedi
tions afford very distinct evidence (§ 13). On the other hand, the very fact
 of its extension to so great a depth appears sufficient to negative the idea that
it is to be accounted for either by the visa tergo of the Florida current, or by
the drift-action of S.W. winds on the surface.
       II. On the Dardanelles and Baltic Under-currents.
    165. When discussing,       in the Report of the 'Porcupine' Expedition for
 1870,   the   Physical Theory of the Gibraltar Current, I endeavoured to
strengthen my case by showing the applicability of that Theory, mu
 tatis mutandis, to two other cases in which all the conditions of the
Gibraltar Current are reversed together, — an Under-current of the heavy
water of the German Ocean having been proved to flow inwards through
the Baltic Sound, beneath the outward surface -current of lighter Baltic
water; whilst the existence of a similar inflow from the .tEgean into the
Black Sea, beneath the outward surface-current of the Bosphorus and
Dardanelles,     might   be  predicated (I ventured to affirm, § 123) "on the
double ground of a      priori  and a posteriori necessity." — I much regret that
I  was not at that time acquainted with the experiments and observations
which had been made by Capt. Spratt on the Dardanelles Current some
                     * ; since, if they had fallen under
years previously                                               my notice, I should
have cited    them   as affording probative   evidence  of the truth of my position.
For although the conclusion which Capt. Spratt has himself deduced from
them is diametrically opposite to my own, yet the fallacy of that conclusion
   * In excuse for my ignorance of Capt. Spratt's inquiries on this subject, I   may point
out that  the * Travels and Researches in Crete,' in which they are published as an
Appendix, is not a work into which any one seeking information upon the Dardanelles
Curront would naturally look.

                       ' Shearwater'                                                  639

appears to me so readily demonstrable, that I should have thought it
sufficient to point out what I regard as the just interpretation of them,
leaving it to the scientific public to decide whether his or my view of the
case has the stronger claim to acceptance.
     16b". But  as Capt. Spratt has       made his experiments on the Dardanelles
Current the     basis of an assault*, not merely on the position I had ventured
to assume     (on  theoretical   grounds ouly) in regard to that current, but also
on the Under-current doctrine which I had put forward as experimentally
substantiated     in the case of the Gibraltar and Baltic Currents,               and, by
implication,    on the Doctrine       of  a General   Oceanic Circulation which the
inquiries I have recently had a share in couducting appear to me to justify,
it is necessary for me to address myself to a more formal refutation of his
arguments.
     167.  It  may be thought        presumptuous     in one who can only claim to
possess    a merely elementary knowledge of Physical Science, and a very
 limited   amount of practical acquaintance with inquiries of this nature, to
 call in question the unhesitating          dictum of    a Surveying Officer of Capt.
 Spratt's acknowledged ability and large experience, in regard to a matter
 lying completely within his own province.               For however simple the case
 may appear, it nyght naturally be thought more probable that some essen
 tial condition had been left out of view on my part, than that Captain
 Spratt's interpretation of his results should be precisely the reverse of
 that which his own data necessitate.              In order, therefore,    to secure my
 self against any such error, I have submitted the case to several Naval
 Officers who have made a special study, both theoretically and practically,
 of all matters relating to Currents ; and finding that their judgment en
 tirely accords with my own, I venture to believe that the validity of my
 chum to a complete reversal of Capt. Spratt's conclusion will be generally
 admitted.
     168. Dardanelles      Current.   —The     method of experimenting adopted by
  Capt. Spratt was so nearly the same as that followed by Capt. Nares
 (under instructions from the Admiralty) in the experiments on the Gibraltar
  Current, of which the detail has already been givtn, that it is only requi
 site to recall its two essential features. — A float or buoy was attached to a
 sinker resting on the bottom, so as to serve as a fixed point of reference ;
  this we shall call, as before, the anchored buoy.           To another float or buoy,
 exactly resembling      the  first,  was   suspended   at  any desired depth a
                                                                                    " cur
  rent-drag," offering a large surface of resistance to any current in which it
  might hang ; and the float which           supports   this we shall call (as before)
  the current-buoy.
     ] 69. Now    I  quite agree with Capt. Spratt, that if a surface-current
  flows past the "anchored buoy" and the "current-buoy" at the same
  rate, the current-drag suspended from the latter must be as motionless as
   the sinker to which the anchored buoy is attached ; but            I  differ from him

      170.   For    let  us   consider    (1)   the  condition  of    the  "anchored      buoy"
  lying in a surface•current that runs at the rate of (say) a mile per hour.
  The resistance offered to that current, not only by the buoy, but by the
  upper part of the anchoring line, puts that line on the stretch, so as to
 bring    a very considerable        strain alike on the buoy and on the sinker at the
  bottom.   — In   our own experiments in the Strait of Gibraltar, this strain was
  found to be so great, that a current of 1'25 mile per hour was sufficient to
  submerge a buoy capable of floating a weight of 100 lbs.; and when
 another buoy was attached to this, so as to keep it up to the surface, the
 strain of the current on the two proved so great as to lift and displace
 the sinker at the bottom, though it was a mass of iron weighing 1 cwt.
 — Let     us suppose (2) the "current-drag             "to   be freely    suspended    in per
fectly-still water,        at any depth whatever         above the bottom ; it is obvious
 that,   as the pressure       of  the surface-current      upon its buoy and suspending
 line is precisely      the same as in the preceding         case, such pressure will put
 a strain upon the line, which will draw the "current-drag" along through
 the still water, in the direction of the surface-current, but at a reduced
 rate  * ; the flow      of the current past the " current-buoy " being diminished
 by the amount of that motion.
     171. Now if this be admitted, it necessarily follows (3) that if a "cur
rent-drag" suspended from a buoy floating in a surface-current remains
motionless, — as shown by the equality of the rates of flow of the surface-
current past the " current-buoy
                                            "    and the "anchored buoy," — the strain
put upon its suspending line by the resistance of its current-buoy to the
surface-current        must be neutralized by the pressure in an opposite direction
of an Under-current meeting the " current-drag."
     172. And since, according to Capt. Spratt, this stationary condition of
the "current-drag"           was shown at all depths below 40 fathoms            in the Sea    of
 Marmora (even down to 400 fathoms), and at all depths below 20 fathoms
in the Dardanelles, whilst there is a rapid superficial OKf-current, running
in the Dardanelles at the rate of 2| miles per hour, it seems an irresistible
conclusion       that there is a deeper Under-current from 20 fathoms to the
bottom, running more slowly inwards from the iEgean into the Sea of
Marmora through the                Dardanelles,     and   thence     (it may be presumed)
through       the Bosphorus into the Black              Sea.   And this conclusion finds
complete      confirmation in the results of a comparison between the respective
densities      and rates of movement of the Dardanelles                    water at differeut
depths,     as  observed     by Capt. Spratt        himself.    For    whilst the progressive
    * It is not a little singular that Capt. Spratt admits this action (p.
                                                                               535) in a case in
which the " current-buoy
                               "
                                 continued    to move with the surface-current     at the rate of
01 knot per hour ; whilst refusing to admit it when the " curront-buoy " was stationary.


642                                 Dr. W. B. Carpenter           on the                             [June 13,
fishermen         of Constantinople,         as well as to    European residents, who amuse
themselves with the sport.
  Further, I learn from a very careful observer, that at a time when the
surface-current in the Dardanelles,  urged by a S.W. wind, was setting
inwards, as described by Captain Spratt, he noted that the s«6-surfacc-
movement, indicated by the direction of the water-weeds, was still out
wards     ; thus     showing        how    small    must be      the     quantity of *Egean                   water
carried       into the Black Sea by this agency.]
   174.       Gibraltar         Current. — As       the    experiments            and        observations        of
which     I   have given the details in the present Report furnish the best reply
to Capt. Spratt's criticisms upon the work of the preceding year, I should
have      left    criticisms entirely unnoticed,
                  those                          were it not that one of
 them is founded upon a misconception of the facts of the case, which, in
justice to my valued fellow-labourer Capt. Calver, I cannot leave uncor
rected.   It will be remembered that in two cases (Station 6-1) we actually
did obtain the evidence, which, on Capt. Spratt's own admission, would be
adequate (if valid) to establish the existence of an Under-current ; uamelv,
the movement of the boat from which the
                                             " current-drag " was suspended,
in a direction opposed to that of the surface-current in which the boat was
floating.        So determined,         however, is Capt. Spratt not to admit the cogency
of this evidence,              that, in order   to invalidate          it,
                                                                 he has recourse to the
hypothesis         that   instead of the boat being carried along                       by    the    "    current-
drag,"      it   was the "current-drag"                                of the
                                                   that was carried along               by   the action
wind and surface-current     on the boat, which he supposes to have been
allowed to drift "exposed nearly broadside on to an easterly wind, and
therefore following swell."    Now the'fact was, that the boat was carefully
kept      by
          the  two  men  in  her with her stern to the wind and that the                     ;
" current-drag "       was  shown     the direction of the line suspending
                                                   by
                   (as                                                                                           it
from the bow of the boat) was always in advance            the action of the of  it
                                                                                  ;
wind being so far from sufficient to neutralize that of the surface-current,
that    the men were obliged                occasionally    to use their oars to keep the boat
sufficiently up           to    the drag.       The whole       operation was most carefully
watched   by Capt. Calver from the deck of the       Porcupine,' which was
                                                                             '
kept  close to the beat during  the entire experiment; and as he assured me
that he considered its result to be most conclusive, and as    reported that             I
result expressly          on his authority,     I   cannot but think that Capt. Spratt was
scarcely justified in impugning the validity of the experiment, on no better
grounds than      mere surmise suggested by his own unwillingness to accept
                     a
its result.
   1/5. Baltic Current. — While                     professing     to disprove               the     conclusion
drawn     Prof. Forchhammer from his observations on the relative Specific
            by
Gravities of the upper and under strata of the water in the Baltic Sound,
Capt. Spratt altogether ignores the two facts by which the existence of an
inward Under-current               in   that channel has been demonstrated                         with   a   com-


 644               On the  'Shearwater' Scientific Researches.
 and line from yielding to the opposite motion of the fluid, as they would
have done had the ship been sailing at that rate through the water*.
   177. General Oceanic Circulation. — The animadversions which Capt.
Spratt has made upon what he terms
                                           " the universal Under-current Theory
so fascinatingly advocated by Maury and others, and more recently by the
late Dr. Forchhammer," have no real bearing upon the doctrine of a
General Oceanic Circulation sustained by differences of Temperature alone,
which   I  have recently been led to advocate.      I do not in the least call in
question the production of a horizontal circulation by Wind-currents ; on
the contrary, I have expressly pointed out, in the case of the Gulf-stream,
what   I  believe to be the mode in which that circulation is completed :
and  I   have no belief that, save under peculiarly exceptional conditions,
anything like a current can be produced by differences of Temperature
alone.    But    to the  question how the Temperature-phenomena which             I
have correlated are to be explained, except upon the supposition of a
continual movement of Polar water, however slow, along the Oceau-
hottom towards the Equator, involving as its necessary complement a flow
of Equatorial water towards the Poles, Capt. Spratt does not seriously
address himself; the Temperatures he cites being those collected in the
older voyages, to which he has applied a correction of 4°, which is in
adequate whenever it has reference          to depths beneath 1200 fathoms.
When the contrast I have drawn in the first part of my present Report
between     the Temperature-phenomena          of Inland Seas, — such as the
Mediterranean, the Red Sea, and the Sulu Sea, — with those of the Oceans
with which they respectively communicate, shall have been rationally
accounted for on any other hypothesis than that of a General Oceanic
 Circulation, the merits of the two explanations can be fairly discussed.
But as such a discussion will be far more satisfactory when that vast mass
of additional data shall have been collected which is likely to be furnished
by the Scientific Expeditions that are at present either in progress or in
preparation, I would suggest the expediency of postponing it until it can
be more profitably     resumed.    At present,   as I   have already said, I claim
for the doctrine of the General Oceanic Circulation no higher a character
than that of "a good working hypothesis," consistent with our present
knowledge of facts, and therefore entitled to be provisionally adopted for
the purpose of stimulating and directing further inquiry.

x      OBITUARY NOTICES OF FELLOWS DECEASED.
    James Yates         was   born  April 30th,    1789,   at his father's   pleasant
 residence   in the extra-parochial place of Toxteth Park, adjoining the
 borough    of   Liverpool. His father, John Yates, was the eloquent and
 highly respected minister of a Presbyterian congregation of ancient date,
 which included many of the most opulent and influential families of the
 town.    His mother was a member of one of these families ; she was the
 daughter of John Ashton, who had coal-mines near St. Helen's and salt
 works on the Mersey, and wishing to obtain a cheap and easy mode of
 conveying    his coal to the salt-works,       projected   the first canal in this
 country.
    The subject of this notice was educated in classics under the Rev. Wra.
 Shepherd, minister of the Presbyterian chapel at Gateacre.               In October
  1805, James went to Glasgow University, in company with Henry Holland
 (the present Sir Henry Holland, Bart.), who introduced him as a student.
 He   passed   three sessions    at Glasgow and one at Edinburgh, and took his
 M.A.    degree    in 1812.     He had already studied biblical criticism and
 ecclesiastical history     under   the   Rev. Charles    Wellbcloved,   tutor  of  a
 dissenting college at York.        He now became minister of a newly formed
 congregation     in  Glasgow,   and  declared himself a supporter of Unitarian
 Christianity.      This led to a controversy with the Rev. Ralph Wardlaw,
 the pastor of a large society of Independents.            His ' Discourses on the
 chief points of the Socinian Controversy,' and Mr. Yates's ' Vindication of
 Unitarianism,' excited       a good deal   of attention.    Mr. Yates  at this time
 also took up the subject of "total abstinence," in consequence of the
 many excesses witnessed by him in Glasgow,                He published some dis
 courses on the question, which helped to lead the way to what has been
 called the    "                             " but he had some doubt whether
                  temperance movement ;
 the taking of pledges of total abstinence is to be recommended.                  He
 thought a teetotaller better than a drunkard, but a temperate man better
 than either.
    In  1817,   Mr. Yates    became   minister of the new meeting-house which
 was built on the ruins of Dr. Priestley's chapel at Birmingham,                 and
 there remained until 1825.          On the 24th of February,      1824, he married
 Dorothea,    daughter of     John William Crompton,        a Brazil merchant, who
 survives him.       Accompanied by her he, in January 1827, visited Munich,
 and afterwards Berlin, Mr. Yates being anxious to study under some of the
 most renowned German professors.            He attended the lectures of Thiersch
 on Greek antiquities, of Rittcr on geography, of Bopp on Sanscrit, and
 some others.        He returned to England in April or May 1828, and took
 a house in     Upper Bedford      Place,  in order to be near his half-brother,
 Dr. John Bostock, F.R.S., to whom he was tenderly attached. In 1831
 Mr. Yates had the charge of a congregation in Little Carter Lane, Doctors'

Commons, from which, however, he retired in 1834, when his congregation
presented him with a piece of plate.
   From this time Mr. Yates devoted himself to scientific and literary pur
suits.   He became, as early as 1819, a Fellow of the Geological Society,
and of the Linnean in 1822.         He was one of the early founders of the
British Association for the Advancement of Science ; and at the termina
tion of its first meeting at York in 1831, he was chosen Secretary to the
Council, and continued to fill that office during some years.         He became
a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1839.         He took an active part with Dr.
Guest in the formation of the Philological Society in 1842.
   In looking over a list of Mr. Yates's publications, it is impossible not
to be impressed with the wide range of his subjects.            He has several
papers in the Transactions of the Geological Society for 1821, 1822, and
1825, and the Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal for 1831 and 1862;
various papers on antiquities and language in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic
Society for 1837, and in that of the Philological Society for 1842.      He has
various papers on theological and educational subjects in various journals ;
he contributed largely to Dr. Smith's ' Dictionary of Greek and Roman
Antiquities,' 1842, and published separately, under the title of " Textri-
num Antiquorum," an account of the art of weaving among the ancients :
part 1 was devoted to raw materials ; a second volume which was intended
to follow was not completed at the time of his death. He wrote in the
'
  Classical Museum,' in 1845, on Acanthion &c. of the ancient classics.
He wrote on the natural order Cycadaceee in the Proceedings of the Linnean
Society in 1849, and contributed a number of papers to the Archaeological
Journal. He also exerted his influence to get introduced into this country
an improved system of measures, weights, and coins; and in 1851 re
ceived the Telford Medal of the Institution of Civil Engineers, for an
essay on the subject. He also contributed information on the metric system
to the Statistical Section of the British Association.        He has published
a variety of papers in connexion with this subject, and was the principal
supporter of the British branch of the International         Association for ob
taining  a uniform  decimal  system  of  measures,  weights, and coins.
   As early as 1842 Mr. Yates showed symptoms of an overworked brain, and
was ordered by Dr. Tweedie to seek refreshment in travel. Indeed every year
he had, as it were, to evade the hay fever, to which he was an easy victim.
In 1848 he acquired the lease of Lauderdale House, Higbgate. Here
he passed the remainder of his life, beloved and respected by all who knew
him.     Here, too, he gave to scientific men those pleasant garden parties and
receptions which received additional interest from the historical associations
of the place. He had just completed his 82nd year, when he sank quietly
to rest, on May 7th, 1871, and was buried in Highgate Cemetery on the
11th, near the remains of his friend Henry Crabb Robinson.
   Mr. Yates took great delight in his garden, and in the cultivation         of
botany.    He  was justly proud of his   success in getting the Cycas to flower,

    Gkoiu;e      Grote     was born on the     1 "th of November,     170-1,   at Clay  hill,
near Beckenham, Kent.             His father was George Grote, son              of Andrew
Grote, who, in the middle of last century, came to England from Bremen,
settled as a merchant in the city of London, and on the 1st of January, 1766,
in conjunction with George Prescott, established the banking-house that
still bears their joint names.         His mother was Selina Mary, only daughter
of the Rev. Dr. Peckvvell, of Chichester, who belonged to the connexion of
the Countess of Huntingdon, and, owing to his eminence as a preacher,
was selected by her as one of her chaplains.                The wife of Dr. Peckwell
was an Irish lady, Miss Blossct, of an ancient French Protestant family
of Touraine, named De Blosset, some members of which came to this
country at the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, and purchased property
in the county of Meath.
    George Grote the younger obtained the first rudiments of learning from
his mother, who had an excellent understanding and good attainments,
especially in history, being at the same time severely pious.                 In his sixth
year he was sent to the Grammar School at Sevenoaks, kept by Mr. White
head.     In his tenth year he entered Charterhouse, then under the charge
of Dr. ltaine, an excellent classical scholar ; but nothing appears to have
been taught there besides the learned languages.              He had as companions
at Charterhouse, Connop         Thirlwall (Bishop of St. David's), the two brothers
Waddington        (one  the late Dean of Durham, the other late Under-Secretary
at the Home Office), Henry Havelock, and Cresswell Crcsswcll ; with the
first three he maintained a warm friendship through life.               He left Charter
house in his sixteenth year, a good classical scholar, having been uniformly
•it the top of his class.      During his holidays he was provided with a teacher
at home for French and Mathematics.
    In 1809,    on leaving school, he entered the banking-house            ns clerk, being
made a partner when, in 1815, he reached the age of twenty-one.                       While
devoting     himself   sedulously   to  business,  he employed    all his  spare hours in
reading and study.          He followed out his classical scholarship to a thorough
mastery of the great works of Greece and Rome.                   At the same time he
applied   himself     to  modern   literature,   both in belles-lettres   and in abstract
thought    ;  history in particular he always devoured with avidity.                  In no
very long     time   he   showed   a  decided    tendency  towards    the   Political   and
Mental Sciences, which tendency was fostered by his choice of companions.
In   business he became acquainted with Ricardo, who directed his mind to
Political Economy, and introduced him to the still more powerful ascend
ency of James Mill.          He has publicly acknowledged his great obligations
to Mill ; through him he became acquainted with Bentham, and contracted
an intimacy with Mr. John Stuart Mill, which was sustained through life.
 James Mill      was  himself  a competent Greek scholar, and an admirer              of the
                                                                             62

philosophy nnd the democratic institutions of Greece : Grote was affected
with the like sentiments. They were further agreed in bringing the ancients
into comparison with the best modern thinking.
    In 1820 Mr. Grote married Miss Harriet Lew in (second daughter of
Thomas Lewin, Esq., of the Hollies, Bexley, Kent), who, both in coopera
tion with him and by her separate works, will leave a mark behind her.
The year succeeding his marriage saw his first publication, an anonymous
pamphlet entitled
                      " Statement of the Question of Parliamentary Reform :
with   a reply to the objections of the       Edinburgh Review, No. 61." The
                           '
article in the ' Review        was written      by Sir James Mackintosh.        The
pamphlet    is  a clear and   forcible   argumentative   statement   of the  Reform
question, then beginning to be seriously canvassed.         About 1 824 he formed
the purpose of writing a ' History of Greece,' his own inclinations being
strengthened both by Mr. Mill and by Mrs. Grote.              In the ' Westminster
Review' for April 1826, he published an article of sixty pages on Grecian
History, containing a minute criticism of the misrepresentations of Mitford.
He afterwards acknowledged in the preface to his own History that the
first idea of it was conceived " at a time when ancient Hellas was known
to the English public chiefly through the pages of Mitford."
    About this time a small Society was formed for readings in philosophical
subjects, the meetings of which took place at Mr. Grote's house, in Thread-
needle Street, on certain days, from half-past eight till ten in the morning,
when the members had to repair to their respective occupations.                 The
members were Grote,      John     Stuart   Mill,  Roebuck,  William Ellis, William
and Henry Prescott, Eyton Tooke, Charles Duller, two brothers Whitmore,
and George John Graham (afterwards assignee in bankruptcy).                     The
mentor of their studies was the elder Mill.            The readings embraced the
logical treatises of Hobbes, Du Trieu, and Whately ; Hartley on Man ;
and, at a later period, Mill's ' Analysis of the Mind.'           These works were
read out paragraph by paragraph, commented upon by each member in
turn, discussed and rediscussed, until no one had any thing further to saw
    The logical discipline thus imparted       to these youthful students has un
questionably told in various ways upon            the mind and literature of this
country and the world.
    The death of his father in     1830 made him one of the two chief partners
in the banking-house.        Although strongly sympathizing with the Reform
agitation which had then commenced, he had not as yet taken a public
part in it.     He now came into prominence in the City of London move
ment.     In   1831 appeared his work      entitled "Essentials of Parliamentary
Reform," which      was characterized by his thoroughness and      vigourof thought
and language.       His "essentials" were as follows: — The first was an ex
tension of the suffrage, to commence with enfranchising whoever gave
evidence   of possessing £100      a year, to be followed    by further extensions
nccording to the advancement        of education.     The second essential was the
Ballot  ; the others were,   — reduction    in the number of the House
                                                                          (to about

  300),    equalizing  of constituencies, improved polling arrangements, and
  greater frequency of election.
      Placed at the top of the poll for the City of London, he took his scat
  in the Reformed Parliament in February 1833.            His public career is most
  noted by his motions on the Ballot, made every year, with one exception,
  from 1833 to 1839. His handling of this question was exhaustive; the
 ablest advocates     that succeeded  him have confessed      themselves unable to
  add either to the number of his arguments or to the cogency of his replies ;
 while the intense respect for individual liberty of action which animated
 his whole life, gave to a political question a high ethical tone. But this
 was only one out of many topics that he brought forward during his nine
 years' work in Parliament.       The Bank Charter, the Poor- Law Amendment
  Act, the Municipal Reform Act, the Corn Laws, the Irish Church, the Irish
  Coercion Bill, the Canadian Rebellion, the Civil List were among the great
 and stirring questions that called out his oratorical powers.         He sounded
 the first note on Church Reform and on the removal of the Jewish Disabi
 lities, and was always ready to chime in with every proposal for extending
 individual liberty, for improving education, as well as for contributing to
 the general well-being of the community.          His last important speech was
 (in 1841) on the Syrian question, producing       a very marked impression.
     In  1841 he retired from Parliament,     and in 1843    withdrew from active
 partnership in the banking-house, to devote himself to the composition of
 his 'History,' which he completed in twelve volumes iu 1856. The first
 two volumes contained an independent examination of the Homeric poems,
 an original view of the Spartan institutions and legislation of Lycurgus,
 and, greatest of all, an entirely new handling of the early legends.          The
 next two volumes detailed the rise of the Athenian Democracy, in which a
 distinction  was carefully drawn between      the institutions of Solon and the
 amendments of Cleistheues.        The fifth and sixth volumes traced the growth
of the Athenian Empire, and the commencement of the great struggle known
as the Peloponnesian War.         The same subject occupied two more volumes,
the seventh and eighth, which were concluded by the celebrated chapters
on the Sophists and on Socrates.         Some critics ventured the opinion that
the work had attained its climax, that the author had exhausted his subject
and himself, and could impart no new surprise.           The opening of the ninth
volume proved the rashness of the criticism ; in nothing did Mr. Grote's
peculiar powers show to better advantage than in recounting the advance
and retreat of the Ten Thousand.           He could now also point out to the
haters of democracy what Greece had gained by the substitution of the
Spartan headship for the Athenian ; and very soon came the reverses and
the prostration of that headship by the Thebans, under the leadership of
Epaminondas.        The extraordinary revolutions in Sicily — the career of the
Siculi tyranni, and their overthrow by Timoleon — formed a splendid theme,
and had ample justice done to it.        The eleventh volume was occupied with
the struggle against Philip of Macedon, in which the leading figure was

                                            VI
Demosthenes.        The author had vindicated the Athenians and their demo
cratic constitution    from many unfair aspersions ; he now exposed their
real vices and degeneracy, their growing reluctance to personal military
service and to the sacrifices of war.          The last and crowning exploit of the
historian was to unmask the world's conqueror and favourite, Alexander.
With the most ample acknowledgments of Alexander's military genius and
indefatigable activity, Mr. Grote has stripped his enterprizes and his con
duct of every other virtue or merit ; and in so doing has read a moral lesson
against that adoration of force which has always lent a powerful aid to the
oppressors of mankind.
    It has been common to express a regret that the history was not con
tinued down to the Roman conquest of Greece.                   The reason was charac
teristic of the author.      In the preface to the first volume he announced it
as   his purpose to exhaust the free life of collective Hellas ; and at the
close of the twelfth, having to relate the honours bestowed upon Demo-
chares, the nephew of Demosthenes, for acting on suppliant embassies to
the foreign masters of Greece, he said that when such begging missions
arc the titles to honour of Athenian citizens, " the historian accustomed
to the Grecian w-orld as described by Herodotus, Thucydides, and Xeno-
phon, feels that the life has departed from his subject, and, with sadness
 and humiliation, brings his narrative to a close."
    There is no doubt that        Mr. Grote     was  especially cast for an historian,
although in his time he played many parts. He had an intense interest in
human beings, and a strong passion for narrative ; he had read the history
 of every country that had a history ; while his memory for historical facts
 and dates was of the first order.        In his study of science, and especially of
 the moral and political sciences, he was strongly arrested by the modes of
 arriving at scientific doctrines, and by the struggles of the mind in the
 pursuit.   This more particularly qualified him to be the historian of
 philosophy.
                                     '                       '
    The original   scheme   of the     History of Greece comprised a full account
 of Greek literature and Greek speculation.              The chapters on Homer, on
 Lyric Poetry and the Seven Wise Men, on the Ionic Philosophers, on the
 Drama,    Rhetoric,   Dialectic,   and the Sophists, and, finally, o« Socrates
 were in fulfilment of the scheme. The remaining portion, including Plato
 and Aristotle, was postponed for a separate work.               " Plato and the other
 Companions of Socrates," the first instalment,             occupied nine years, and
 was published in 18G3.
    This great work brought into prominence characteristics of the author's
 mind that had been but little apparent in the ' History of Greece.'                  It
 comprises   a full  analysis  of all  the Platonic   writings,  with  a rediscussion of
 the numerous questions (Logical, Ethical, Psychological, and Metaphy
 sical) that are broached by Plato.             He introduces a marked division be
 tween two classes of the Dialogues,       —   the one class Socratic, or Dialogues of
 Search, whose conclusion        is usually     negative  ; the other class Dialogues
                                                                                         ;

                                                                               •
 of Exposition, wherein is announced         some   positive dogma.     The great
interest, in Mr. Grote's    eyes, attaches to the first, the Dialogues  of Search ;
never before were the peculiarities manifested by these put in such strong
relief.   They were the consummation of Grecian Dialectic, or free discus
sion and argumentation between opposing opinions, which had been begun
by Zeno, and was practised by Socrates in his indiscriminate                  cross
examination     of the Athenian citizens ; from Socrates it was adopted by
Plato.     "A   string of objections never answered, and of difficulties without
solution, may appear to many persons nugatory, as well as tiresome.              To
Plato they     did  not appear so.     At the time when most of his dialogues
were composed, he considered that the searcli after truth was at once the
noblest occupation and the highest pleasure of life."         This negative pro
cedure involved with it the assertion cf an unfettered judgment upon all
questions whatsoever ; in short, perfect toleration of differences of opinion.
For this Socrates cheerfully suffered martyrdom.          Plato also, in his nega
tive days, made noble appeals on behalf of freedom of thought.               From
intense fellow-feeling with the same cause, Mr. Grote dwells emphatically
upon this aspect of Plato.
                                  " The orthodox public do not recognize in
any individual citizen a right to scrutinize their creed, and to reject it if not
approved by his own rational judgment."
                                                 " ' Nomos'          and Custom),
                                                              (Law
'
  King of all,' exercises plenary power, spiritual     as well as temporal, over
individual minds, moulding both emotions and intellect according to the
local type." To the protest by Socrates and Plato against this despotism
in the ancient world, Grote, on every opportunity, adds an equally strenuous
remonstrance against the like despotism in modern times.
   From a very early period of life he had studied profoundly the influence
of men's feelings or emotions in corruptiug their sense of truth. Several
of his most famous disquisitions have consisted in the illustration of this
subject, more especially his handling of the Grecian Legends and his
chapters on Socrates.       As an historian of philosophy, he habitually traces
the operation of this bias, which he held to be very far from extinct in the
present day, although less often present in Physical science than in Ethical
and Psychological doctrines.
   At the age of 70 he commenced his work on Aristotle.            Neither he nor
any   of his  intimate friends could detect the slightest falling off in his
intellectual vigour, yet he was painfully conscious of a diminution in his
working pace ; so that after six years he had executed but a fraction of
his survey of the Aristotelian writing?.      What he has left amply maintains
                                   ' Plato.' He has exhaustively analyzed, in
his reputation gained by the
his peculiarly luminous style, the whole of the treatises comprised under
the ' Organon,' being all the works that have been the fountains of the
common scholastic logic — Categories, De Interprelalione, Analytica priora
and posteriora, and Sophistic Elenchi ; together with an elaborate account
of the large treatise, the Topica, seldom adverted to, but valuable in his
 eyes, as exhibiting the methodized Dialectical debate of the Athenian schools.
                                                                                    '

He 1ms also given an introductory sketch of the Metaphysica, together with
(i full abstract of the greater part of it.    Of the physical treatises which
he coupled with the Metaphysica, he has given an analysis of De Ccelo. He
had previously published a careful account of the peculiarly difficult and
important treatise De Anima.
     Mr. Grote was one of the original founders of the London University,'
afterwards called University College, and was an active member of Council
from the commencement, in 1827, up to the year 1831.           He entered with
zeal into the scheme,    as proposing to impart an education    thnt should   be
at once extensive and unsectarian.        He again joined the Council in 1849,
and from that time till his death took     a leading part in the administration
of the College.      In 18(i0 he became      Treasurer;   and on the death of
 Lord Brougham, in 18(i8, he was elected President. He has bequeathed to
 the College six thousand pounds, the interest of which is to be paid to the
 l'rofessor of Philosophy of Mind and Logic for the time being, on the con
 ditions that his teaching is satisfactory, and that he is not a minister      of
religion.

 (Jeorge Cornewall    Lewis,  and Henry Hallam.       From the date  of  his ap
pointment he gave unremitting attention to the business of the Senate, enter
ing into every question that arose, and taking a lead in the most critical
 decisions of the University during the twenty-one years of his connexion
 with it.    The first subject of great importance that came up after Mr.
 Grote's appointment was the admission of the Graduates to a position in the
 government of the University.      On the 20th of February, 1850, there was
 laid before the Senate     a declaration  and statement, signed by 361 Gra
 duates, desiring that the Graduates might be admitted into the corporate
 body. This was the commencement of a protracted agitation and struggle,
 terminated, in 1858, by the issue of a new Charter, which conceded what
 had been so long fought for.       Mr. Grote cordially supported the claims
 of the Graduates.      His aid in this cause was warmly acknowledged in a
 resolution of the Annual Committee of Convocation passed shortly nfter
 his death.
     On the  1st of February,   1854, a memorial was presented to the Senate,
 signed by eleven persons (including Sir Rowland Hill and his three
  brothers, and Mr. William Ellis), in favour of throwing open the degrees
  of the University to all classes, irrespective of the manner or place of
 their education.    On the 5th of April was presented another petition to the
  same effect, more numerously signed.         No notice appears to have been
  takenof these applications.    On the 19th of November, 1 850, the Senate
  admitted the London Working Men's College among the affiliated col
 leges of the University.      Mr. Grote opposed this step, on the ground
 that so long as the University required atteudance on classes, a line should

                                           IX
be drawn between those who could give up their whole time to study and
those that spent their day in industrial avocations.           He had been hitherto
favourable to the combining of certified class instruction with examina
tions as requisites to the degrees.        The admission of the Working Men's
College (carried chiefly by members of Senate opposed to the restricting
of the degrees to students in the affiliated colleges) shook his faith in the
value of the class certificates.     About the      same time    it became known to
the Senate that certificates were granted by some           of the affiliated colleges
on mere     nominal    studentship.    This completed the conviction in Mr.
Grote's mind that the degrees should be thrown open, and granted on the
exclusive test of examinations.         Accordingly, when the subject came up
in connexion with the Draft Charter, by which the Graduates were to be ad
mitted, he supported the insertion of a clause for abrogating the original con
stitution as to affiliated colleges ; which clause was carried in the Senate by
a large majority.      Many remonstrances followed this decision, especially
from the affiliated colleges. The Senate entrusted to Mr. Grote and Mr.
"Warburton the drawing up a report on these remonstrances, which was
presented to the Senate on the 22nd of July, 1857.               This report was Mr.
 Grote's composition, and contains an exhaustive discussion of the argu
ments of the remonstrants.
    On the 8th of July,    18f>7, while the Draft Charter was under discussion,
 a memorial     was  laid before the Senate,       signed by twenty-four men of
 science, Fellows of the Royal Society, suggesting the institution of degrees
 nnd honours for proficiency in mathematical and physical science.                  On
 the 14th of April,     1858, the Senate appointed a Committee to consider the
 propriety of establishing degrees in science ; of this Committee Mr.
 Grote was a member, along with the Chancellor, Mr. Warburton, Sir
 James Clark, Dr. Arnott, Mr.         Faraday, Mr. Brande, Mr. Walker, and
 Mr. Hopkins. The Committee            held a series of meetings, and examined
 the memorialists individually as      to their views and wishes, and afterwards
 drew up a report in favour of the    principle of degrees in science.       Being re
 appointed by    the Senate  to prepare  a definite  scheme,   the  Committee   agreed
 that there should be a Bachelor's Degree, which should rest on a broad
 and comprehensive basis of scientific acquirement, and a Doctor's Degree
 for eminence in special branches.         A draft-scheme for the     several Degrees
 was, at the Committee's request, prepared by Dr. Arnott. It was very much
 owing to Mr. Grote's advocacy that the Moral Sciences were retained in the
 programme, several members of the Committee being disposed to limit the
 subjects of examination to the Physical and Natural-History Sciences.
 On the 7th of July, the Senate, with one dissentient voice, adopted the
 report.    The degrees were instituted accordingly.           The other universities
 are slowly entering upon a similar course.
    On the 27th of February,       18G2, he succeeded      Sir John Lefevre    as Vice-
 Chancellor.
     It was a singular testimony to the largeness      of his views, that Mr. Grote's

life-long classical studies and associations left him free to appreciate
fully the great importance of science in education. In point of fact, however,
he combined with his own erudite pursuits an intense avidity for the physical
sciences,   along with the metaphysical, and they formed a considerable
portion of his reading to the last.         He uniformly resisted all proposals
to   limit the  study   of logic and  moral  philosophy, or to lower its posi
tion in the degrees where it had obtained a place ; and, generally, he
was an advocate for the breadth of culture maintained in the Matricu
lation and Degree Examinations, as contrasted with the restricted number
of subjects required for the Oxford and Cambridge degrees.
    lie bequeathed his library to the University.
    On the death of Hallam, in 1859, Mr. Grote became a Trustee of the
British Museum, and, as in the case of University College and the
University of London, he gave unfailing attendance on the meetings of
the Trustees, and sat on the most laborious          Committees.    In   1 S64 he
was also elected a Trustee     of the Hunterian Museum.       His election to the
Royal Society was in 1857.
    He was pressed by Mr. Gladstone to accept a peerage, that he might
take part in the business of the House of Lords ; but he declined to
enlarge the sphere of his active duties.
    The disease that cut him off made its appearance last December.            It
did not obscure his faculties or impair his usual tone of spirits, and he
received in his own house the Committees of the University of London,
transacted business, and conversed with his friends till the last three weeks
of his life. He died on the 18th of June, and on the 24th was interred
in Westminster Abbey.
    Mr. Grote's published writings, coupled with the harest outline of his
life and work, reveal the lineaments of a great character, the intellectual
and the moral ingredients supporting     each other.    In his public career, and
in his wide literary research, a clear, powerful, and originating intellect
was guided by the purest aims and the most scrupulous arts.          With scho
larly resources of language, his rhetoric is the servant of truth. At all points
merging his own self-importance, he never passes by opposing considera
tions, and does justice to every rival. The reverse of sanguine as to human
progress, he yet laboured for every good cause that satisfied his mind, —
science, education, and the self-acting   judgment of the individual. Differing
in many points from the prevailing opinions of the time, he avoided giving
needless offence, and cooperated with men of all shades of doctrine, political
and religious.    In the depths of his character there was a fund of sympathy,
generosity,   and  self-denial rarely equalled among men ; in the exterior, his
courtesy, affability, and delicate consideration of the feelings of others were
indelibly impressed upon every beholder ; yet this amiability of demeanour
was never used to mislead, and in no case relaxed his determination for
what he thought right.        Punctual and exact in his engagements, he in
spired a degree of confidence and respect which acted most beneficially on

all the institutions and trusts that        he took a share in administering        ; and
his loss to them must be accounted a           positive calamity. — A. B.
    Dr. Augustus       Waller was the son of Mr. William Waller, of Elver-
ton Farm, near Faversham in Kent, and was born on the 21st of December,
1816.     The family left England to reside at Nice, where Mr. Waller died
when his sou was only fourteen years old.              The son came to England, and
lived for some time with Dr. Lacon Lntnbe, of Tewkesbury, but afterwards
resided with and studied under Dr. William Lambe, who was a well-known
vegetarian    ; and the youth was brought up to the age of eighteen on a
purely vegetable diet, his father having been a strict disciple of Dr.
Lambe.
    Augustus Waller went through his course of medical study at Faris,
and took his degree         of M.D. in that University in 1840, when he was
twenty-four years of age.            In 1842 he entered upon general medical
practice  at   Kensington,    and  two  years later married Matilda, only daughter
of John Walls, Esq., of North End, Fulham, who survives him.
    But while steadily following his vocation            as a medical man, his mind
was irresistibly bent on scientific investigation, and what time he could
spare from attendance on patients was employed in carrying on original
researches in physiology and physiological anatomy.                Accordingly during
this period of his      career he published      several important contributions to
those sciences, two of which         obtained a place in the Philosophical Trans
actions * ; and he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1851.
    Meanwhile his scientific pursuits came to engross more and more of his
time and thought, and, after a few years, he resolved to give up his prac
tice, which had already become considerable, and to devote himself to
science as the main occupation of his life.              In pursuance of this deter
 mination, and with a view to meet with more favourable opportunities of
 carrying on his scientific work, he left England in 18;") 1 and took up his
 residence for some time at Bonn. The influence of his more favourable
 position soon became mauilest.          In association with Professor Budge, he
 engaged in experimental inquiries on the influence of the nervous system
 upon the motion of the iris, by which it was shown that the influence of
 the cervical portion of the sympathetic nerve in maintaining the dilatation
 of the pupil is derived from a particular region of the spinal cord ; and fresh
 light was at the same time thrown on the constitution and central relations
 of that nerve. These researches were made known in three memoirs pub
                  '
 lished in the Comptcs Rendus' for 1831 and 1852, in the joint names
 of the authors, and were honoured with the award of the Monthyon Prize
 of the Academy of Sciences for 1852.             Dr. Waller subsequently carried on
    * " On the Minute Structure of the Papilla? and Nerves of the Tongue of the Frog
 and Toad," Phil. Trans. 1849; and "Experiments            on the Section of the Glosso
 pharyngeal  and  Hypoglossal   Nerves  of the  Frog, and  observations on the alterations
 produced thereby   in the Structure of their Primitive Fibres," Phil. Trans. 18jO.

 11is experimental    investigations independently,        and had an important share
 in the discovery of the influence of the sympathetic nerve on the contrac
 tility of the blood•vessels of the head ; and he first demonstrated,                   by
 positive experiment, the relation of the cilio-spinal region of the spinal
 cord to the nerves governing these vessels.
     In the ' Comptes Rendus' for 1851 Dr. Waller gave an account                     of a
 New Anatomical Method of investigating the nervous system.                      When a
 nerve is cut across, the distal portion undergoes disorganization            ; its fibres
 become entirely altered in their microscopic            characters, and may thus be
 distinguished from those of uninjured nerves.                 Dr. Waller took advan
 tage of this effect    of  section as a means of tracing and discriminating the
 fibres of a given     nerve when      mixed with fibres of other nerves in their
 peripheral distribution.        Moreover he showed that this method            might be
 used to elucidate the functions       of nerves ; for the disorganization      of nerve-
 fibres consequent on their section involves the loss of their functional pro
 perties, and accordingly, when a nerve contains fibres from two or more
 sources, its function may be analyzed, as it were, by the separate section
 and disorganization     of its different tributaries, and the consequent elimina
 tion of the special operation      of each from the general effect.
     The introduction of this method must be regarded as one of the most
 valuable contributions of recent times to the advancement of our knowledge
 of the nervous system ; and it was not only happily applied by himself in
several neurological     investigations,   but it has been eagerly and successfully
taken up by others, who gladly acknowledged               its authorship, and have re
                       " Wallerian method." In the course of these researches
cognized it as the
 Dr.    Waller also discovered       that the nervous ganglia exert a certain in
fluence    in maintaining the integrity of nerve-fibres          which are connected
with them.       In recognition of his merit in devising and applying this new
method of investigation,       the French Academy of Sciences conferred on him
the Monthyon        Prize for the year 1856, and the President and Council
of the Royal Society awarded him one of the Royal Medals for 1860.
     From Bonn Dr. Waller went to Paris to continue his labours ; but he there
 contracted a low form of fever with severe cerebral symptoms : this was in
 1856 ; and he was so much prostrated            by the effects of this illness, that he
 was    for a long time      quite  incapacitated    for work.      lie accordingly re-    The
 turned    to England, and passed the succeeding two years in comparative
repose;     but, his health having improved, he accepted the appointment of
Professor of Physiology in Queen's College, Birmingham, and the place of
 Physician to the Hospital, and again resumed his scientific investigations.
These appointments,        however, he did not long retain.        Threatenings of the
heart-affection   which eventually       proved    fatal  to him, induced     him again
to seek for quiet, and, after two years' longer stay in England, ho retired to
Bruges, and afterwards to the Pays de Vaud. With renewed promise of
health and activity, he in 1808 took up his abode in Geneva with the pur
pose of practising there as a physician.           In the cultivated scientific circles


                                             XIV
he entered Christ        Church, Oxon., with the advantage of the personal
friendship of Cyril Jackson, the Dean.            At that time Conybeare and Peel
were conspicuous members of his College, and the University was leading to
eminence Bucklaud, Keble, and Whately.                 Dr. Kidd had been for some
years   an  admirable   teacher   of  Chemistry,   and  to this attractive subject (to
which his attention had first been drawn by Dr. Isaac Milner, who was
Dean of Carlisle when his father was Bishop of that diocese) Mr. Har-
court clung with affectionate fidelity through all his subsequent life.
    Soon after leaving the University (in 1811) Mr. Harcourt began his
duties as clergyman at Bishopthorpe, close to his father's residence, and
speedily manifested the good effects of his Oxford career by associating
himself with the movement then beginning in Yorkshire, in favour of
institutions    for the cultivation of science.        He constructed a laboratory,
and became       greatly occupied      in  chemical  analysis, not a little aided and
encouraged in this pursuit by his early friends, Davy and "Wollaston.             The
latter explained to him some of the methods of qualitative analysis on a
small scale, in which he was unrivalled.              The great ideas of the former
lie kept steadily in view.          From Buckland and the brothers Conybeare
he acquired a settled       partiality for the then rapidly advancing science of
 Geology.
    In  1821 the famous cavern          of Kirkdale was opened in Yorkshire, and
zealously explored by Buckland.              Some of the treasures of this rich re
 pository   of prehistoric   life-forms    were  divided among several explorers in
Yorkshire, and three of these, viz. Mr. Atkinson, Mr. Salmond, and Mr.
Thorpe, concurred in a resolution to reunite them in one collection, as a
basis for a Yorkshire museum of natural history and antiquities.                Of the
institution which was established in consequence of this arrangement, the
 "Yorkshire Philosophical Society," Mr. Harcourt was chosen President,
and by all the means at his disposal extended its influence, and animated
 and directed its energies.
     The geology of Yorkshire had begun to attract attention ; and one of
 the earliest engagements for public lectures was contracted in 1824 with
 Mr. Smith, the author of the first geological map of the county, as well
 as of the first map of the strata of England and Wales.                  In 1826 Mr.
 Phillips   was   appointed    to  be  the  keeper  of the  Yorkshire   Museum,   then
 contained in a small house ; but from this time it grew so rapidly as to
 require the erection of a spacious building, with library, lecture-room, and
 laboratory, at a cost of ^£9000.            During many years Mr. Harcourt and
 his younger friend just       named     might be often met engaged in geological
 explorations*.      The laboratory, now removed to Wheldrake, was never
 unemployed     t;  the monthly meetings of the Society heard always from

the President      some useful notices of the progress of science, and efforts,
by no means      unsuccessful,   were made to spread through Yorkshire a spirit
of local inquiry, which is still active in that large natural district.
   It was fortunate for the       British Association that its constituent meeting
was,   by  advice   of Sir   David    Brewster, arranged at York, by the ready
zeal of a Society so active and under such good auspices.                At this meet
ing (in 1831) the general plan of proceeding, and the essential            basis  of the
Association, were drawn up by Mr. Harcourt, and proposed                    on the part
of the Society which      he represented.      Discussed and accepted by a body of
367 members, among whom Murchison was conspicuous, they have re
mained practically the same, though in many points improved by experi
ence through forty years of work.
    Over   this   increasing    enterprise   Mr. Harcourt, as General Secretary,
watched     with unceasing       vigilance for several years, and found many
occasions for the employment of his personal influence in furthering the
advancement of science, both by consultation with its acknowledged
leaders and by appeals to the members of the Government.                        Elected
President of the Association at Birmingham in 1839, he took occasion to
discuss very fully the history of the discovery of the composition of water,
supporting     the claim of Cavendish         by original documents, which were
published in the annual volume.            Not less remarkable in this address was
the resolute vindication of the claim of science to entire freedom of in
quiry into the constitution of nature, and a high-minded rebuke of the
narrow     views which      refused to accept geological and astronomical truths
on account     of  a supposed conflict     of these with particular passages in the
Bible — passages ef matchless grandeur and beauty, but not destined to
teach or control the teaching of the principles of natural science.             Breath
ing, as we do now, the freer air of advancing inquiry, there may be some
 danger of forgetting the obligations we owe to churchmen such as Har
 court and Conybeare, who boldly employed their great influence to resist
 the heavy pressure of well-meaning but ill-reasoning theologians, who
 sometimes appeared to forget that they were not endowed with " super
 natural knowledge of the mysteries of nature,"
    One of the subjects to which Mr. Harcourt directed his attention with
 success was the effect      of heat on inorganic compounds.           With a view to
 extensive experiments on        the  effects of high heats in a manageable form,
 he began the construction of a furnace for burning hydrogen gas under
 great pressure ; and by the aid of Sir William Fairbaim and the late
 Mr. Bryan Donkin, this furnace was provided with pressure-gauges, and
 became a safe and manageable instrument.                It was employed for many
 years  in   the  processes   of  fusion   required  for   the production of various
 kinds of glass for optical uses*.         Following similar ideas, he assisted as a
 Member of a Committee of the British Association              in the examination of
 furnace-slags, on which the Report was presented by Dr. l'ercy-f.                    As

                                              XVI
early as in 1834 another train of researches on the same general subject
was set on foot by Mr. Harcourt, when he made arrangements for trying
the effects of long-continued heat on rocks and minerals. For this purpose
the furnaces of Low Moor, in Yorkshire, were employed by placing under
them a large and varied series of rocks and minerals, and artificial mixtures
selected and weighed to represent various natural crystals interesting to
geologists in connexion with metalliferous veins and metnmorphic rocks.
The furnaces being usually kept in action for several years, it was expected
that the long-continued and moderate heat would be sufficient to fuse
some metals, and probably cause new combinations of oxides, silicates, or
sulphides.
  These operations gave indeed such results ; and though, contrary to ex
pectation, the direct influence of high temperature was found to be too
great, the conglutination of sand to quartzitc, the formation of iron veins,
the occurrence of cavities lined with a web-like silicate, and what was
almost a chaos of changes and displacements, showed the power of the
agencies employed.  It is much to be desired that those curious experi
ments should be repeated with precautions which are suggested by those
on record*.
  Accustomed    to the use of the gas-furnace, Mr. Harcourt turned it to
experiments on transparent compounds of fusion, which might be made to
have refractive indices beyond the ordinary ranges, combined with scales
of dispersion more favourable to achromaticity. In this he was guided by
the trials of Faraday to prepare glass for optical purposes. Many years
since, the writer, who was often helpful in this way, ground one of the
earliest of the Harcourt glasses into a lens, and found it indeed a highly
refractive clear substance, but too much traversed by strise to be of
practical use.
  When,          some   years since, Mr. Harcourt removed his residence to the
family     seat      at Nuneham, near Oxford, he constructed furnaces of a
different kind for the carrying on of these experiments, and followed them
with the zeal, resolution, and patience which had always characterized his
firm and well-regulated mind.     At an age when most men cease from
continuous literary and scientific work, he with failing sight, but perfect
memory, was indefatigable in training an assistant and superintending his
work   ;       many new combinations with substances untried before,
           making
and now selected for quality of fusion, resistance to atmospheric vicissi
tudes, range of refraction and specific action on different rays of the
spectrum.         Thus it   was hoped     finally to acquire glasses of definite and
mutually compensative            dispersions, so as to make perfectly achromatic
combinations.    After innumerable trials, and the production of glass of
extremely various quality, Mr. Harcourt, continuing his inspection to the
last, had the satisfaction of believing that, though he could not remain to
witness    it,   a   good result had   been   assured, and that Professor Stokes, to

 whom all the specimens were submitted for scrutiny, would be able to
construct a lens of sufficient size to be fairly tried, and thus crown the
long-continued labour with a permanent benefit to science.
    It was hoped that a      full account of these experiments might have been
prepared by the author of them, for his strong mind felt little of the
weight of eighty years and overruled the bodily infirmities of age.                 But
it was a character of the man never to cease experimental or literary
research till he was satisfied; resolure to contend with difficulties till all
were overcome, and too truly a lover of knowledge, with faith in its
progress, to be hasty in publishing views on account of their novelty,
which might be made valuable by proofs of their truth. Prof. Stokes has
already presented to the British Association a notice* of these researches,
and to him we must now look for further records of a work to which he
lias cheerfully contributed a large amount of valuable aid.
    The scientific pursuits of Mr. Harcourt were followed in the midst of
great occupation as a clergyman, not only in charge of his parish, but open
to perpetual demands for help in public institutions of an educational and
charitable character.        The York School for the Blind, founded in honour
of Wilberforce, the Yorkshire Hospital, the Castle Howard Reformatory,
experienced the benefit of his guidance ; indeed hardly any great move
ment in Yorkshire in favour of useful learning and comprehensive
Christianity   was   carried on without        his help, often given when his own
health required cessation from labour. At many public meetings for these
objects his place was to preside — a duty for which his thoughtful words
and dignified presence, and a certain natural union of gentleness and firm
ness, admirably    qualified him.
    Though   never    a person of robust health, Mr. Harcourt was not much
troubled by positive illness till towards the close of his life, when he
became confiued to a home rich         in books and monuments of art, surrounded
by a cheerful family, to which the graceful hospitality which had become
a habit of his life brought many additions from the large range of his
personal friendships and the more limited circle of men devoted to litera
ture and science       resident in his own neighbouring University.             He had
been elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1824.                His death occurred
at Nuneham in      April 1871. — J. P.

Newton, and one not likely to be soon replaced.              Though none of his dis
coveries were as brilliant     as  Davy's decomposition      of the alkalies, or Fara
day's magneto-electric induction, yet they ranged over a wider field than

beauty of science, and stimulating and guiding its pursuit.
     He was born March 7, 1 792, at Slough, a spot consecrated by the work
of his illustrous father ; an only child, he grew up with nothing to weaken
the effect of the glorious pursuits and magnificent objects with which he
was familiar.       He was educated at home, but most successfully. He was
 a  good classical scholar, a poet, an accomplished draughtsman, an excel
 lent musician ; he spoke fluently several foreign languages, and was well
 versed in their literature.       In 1809 he entered St. John's College, Cam
 bridge, through which he passed with the highest honours, graduating as
 Senior Wrangler above Peacock. In conjunction with Peacock and another
 distinguished man of the following year, Babbage, he took an active part in a
 controversy then raging at Cambridge.            From reverence to the memory of
 Newton, from limited intercourse with the continent, and perhaps from
 national prejudice, British mathematicians had advanced scarcely a step
 beyond their great master ; and it was scarcely possible for them to do so
 while they retained the Fluxional notation.
      If we compare the treatises of Fluxions which at the time in question
  were current in the University with the French or German text-books on
  the same branch of analysis, we must be thoroughly ashamed, and almost
  disposed to admit the contemptuous statement of an Edinburgh reviewer,
                                                                                        '
  that there were in Great Britain only four men who could read the Me-
  canique Celeste,' and that three of them were Scotchmen*.                    In all such
  transitions, besides   the  effect of   habit, the   adherents of    an  old  theory are
  often bound to      it by personal feelings,      as  if the giving up their former
  convictions implied some intellectual inferiority ; and it may happen that
  the champions of the new one do not bear their triumph meekly.                          At
  Cambridge, however, the struggle was not long ; for "Woodhouse, the ori
  ginator of the movement, was powerfully seconded by Herschel and his
  friends even while undergraduates.           From them came the memoirs of the
  Analytical Society, the translation of Lacroix's ' Differential and Integral
  Calculus,' and the examples of the same calculus, which virtually decided
  the question.      The treatise on the calculus of finite differences which this
  last volume contains, and which was the work of Herschel exclusively, is
  specially valuable.      Henceforward he entered on a wider field of labour,
  where the limits of this notice do not permit us to follow him ; for of him
  it may be said, as in Goldsmith's epitaph, " Scientioe nullum non genus
  tetigit, nullum quod tetigit non ornavit."           For sixty years he enriched the
  Royal and other Societies with memoirs, precious not merely for the truths
  which they reveal, but for their suggestive character and their lucid de
  velopments.      Their number and quality might seem great enough to over
  task the energy of most men, yet they were supplemented by several sepa-
     * Probably   he meant  by the three, himself, Brougham, and Ivory ; of Ivory this
  was true, but the competence   of the other two for such n feat is very questionable.

and other contributions    to periodical literature t.         Out of this wonderful
collection a few specimens may be selected.
   Of all his writings, that which has been most universally             admired and
whose influence has been most widely felt is the " Discourse on the Study
of Natural Philosophy," which in 1830 appeared in ' Lardner's Cabinet
Cyclopaedia.'  For power and elegance of language, for clearness of illus
tration,  for sound and far-sighted judgment, this little book cannot be
surpassed.    Of course the progress of research enables us now to see further
in some directions than he could then anticipate, and the principles enun
ciated in the first chapter have roused the ire of some of the philosophists
of the day. They, however, are proof against the cavils of such rash specu
lators, for they are in perfect unison with the noblest aspirations and highest
intuitions of human nature. Of his purely physical works the astrono
mical portion must hold the first place as a stupendous monument of un
wearied labour, guided and enlightened by high theoretic anticipations and
consummate skill.
   As his father's greatest triumphs were achieved in the regions of double
stars and nebulae, it was natural that his thoughts should be turned in the
same direction, and that he should be impelled to complete as far as pos
sible what Sir William had left imperfect.     As early as 1821 he is found
associated with Sir James South in forming a Catalogue of Double Stars,
which appeared in our 'Transactions' for 1824, and was honoured with our
medal.    This union of labour was soon interrupted.    South moved his
observatory to Passy in quest of a clearer atmosphere than that of Black-
man Street.    Herschel also went to the continent.   His friend Babbage
had been overwhelmed by a domestic calamity, and Herschel abandoned
his own pursuits to aid time and change of scene in alleviating the affliction
of his companion J.
   On his return to Slough he resumed the double stars, and by 1832 he
had observed 5075 of these objects, a large portion of which were new to
astronomers.    Most of these were observed with the 20-feet Herschelian
reflector ; and only they who have experienced the difficulty of obtaining
good measures of a double star even with a steady equatorial can rightly
appreciate the merit of such work performed with an instrument mounted
                                                             '
as this was (see the drawing of it in the frontispiece of the Cape Obser

submitted to     for publication.

assistance except from his aunt, the celebrated Caroline Hersehel) required
much time and labour.
     His catalogues differ     from those of his father in one important par
ticular : they give the place of an object by its right ascension and polar
distance for 1830, so that it can be easily found by a graduated instru
ment ; whilst Sir William gave only its distance and angle of position with
                                                                     mere estimates —
respect to the nearest of Flamsteed's stars, both of them
a plan which, besides its uncertainty, was necessarily tedious.
     But along with this great work he was engaged with the revision              of his
father's catalague of nebulae and the discovery of new ones ; and here the
 boon which he conferred on astronomy was still greater, such, indeed, as
 none but himself could have bestowed, for his telescope far exceeded any
 then existing in illuminating power.           His earliest publication on this sub
ject was the fine monograph and drawing of the nebulee in
                                                                         Orion, dating
 from 1824 ; but this       was   nobly  followed    out  by  his  great  Catalogue of
 Nebulte, which appeared in our Transactions for 1833.                It contains 2307
 nebulee and clusters, of which       more    than  500  were  discovered  by himself.
 In this also the right ascension and polar distance of each object are given
 for 1830, and it is enriched with many admirable drawings of such as offer
 some striking peculiarity.       As might be expected, some of these have been
 found to omit details which are shown by the instruments of greater power
  which have     been since constructed ; but     their general accuracy is acknow
  ledged by all conversant in this kind of observation ; and their value is
  shown in more than one instance by enabling subsequent observers to detect
  changes in the nebulas *.
      The memoir which accompanies this catalogue is of high interest, full of
  vivid    description,   of far-reaching views, and enlightened           speculation.
   Having so thoroughly explored        the northern      sky, he might     have rested
  well satisfied with his work ; but he felt the importance of extending it to
   the southern hemisphere, and of leaving to posterity a complete survey of
   the heavens, which, as made by the same observer and with the same
   powerful telescope, would be a record to which future observers might
   refer with confidence.      With this view, and by his unaided resources, he
   removed, in the beginning of 183-1, his family and instruments to the Cape
   of Good Hope, where he remained for four years, observing with intense
   activity, and exerting on the leading spirits of that colony an enlightening
   influence, the effects of which are still felt there.          The results which he
   obtained were given to the world, not in separate memoirs, but in one volume,
   published in 1817 by the munificent aid of the then Duke of Northumber
   land.     It contains catalogues of 2102 double stars and 1707 nebulre, with
    elaborate drawings of many of the latter and minute surveys of the stars
       * In compnring these drawings with the present appearance of the nebula*, the tele
    scope used should be made equiluminous witli the 20-fcct ; for this purpose in a New
    tonian the aperture should =3314, in an achromatic — 16'8ti.

adjacent to them.       Some idea of the labour thus expended may he gained
by the fact that for the two
                                  " Magellanic Clouds " 1 143 stars, nebulae, and
clusters were carefully measured, and 1203 stars for the great nebula in
Argo.     Of the splendid monograph of this wonderful object which he has
given it is impossible to speak too highly, especially as, notwithstanding
some conflicting testimony, the comparison of it with recent observations
gives reason to believe that this nebula has undergone surprising changes
in the last thirty years. Independent of these precious catalogues the
volume is like a perfect gem ; besides the charm of its style, it is a rich
treasury of varied knowledge.        As an example may be named the section
on the causes which injure the action of reflecting telescopes, the chapters
on astrometry, on Halley's comet, and on the solar spots ; they all bear
the stamp of a Master's hand, and contain suggestions all striking, and of
which some have since been applied with the best results to practice.           His
labours on nebulae were completed much later in life by a general catalogue of
them containing 5079, which appeared in our 'Transactions' for 1864. Tin's
includes all contained in his former catalogues and all discovered by others
up to that time.      It contains the places for 1860, and their precessions for
 1880 ; so that it will be easily available for observers to the end of the
century, and will long be their Manual of Nebulae.
    His contributions to optics rank next to his astronomical in importance
and number; but we shall only mention two, which gave a great impulse
to the progress among us of this branch of physics.          The first is a remark
able   memoir    on  the  aberrations   of   compound  lenses  and object-glasses,
                           '
which appeared in our Transactions' for 1821 . Before it opticians (at least
in this country) corrected the spherical aberration of their object-glasses
by empirical rules, and its theory was given in rude and unsymmetrical
forms.     By a happy choice of symbols and an elegant analysis he presents
the theory of aberration in all its generality, and in as simple a manner as
the nature of the question admits.          He gives examples of the application
of his theory to the construction of aplanatic doublets, and then to that of
object-glasses.     In discussing this he considers the dispersive power as
composed of several terms, of which the first only is taken into account by
opticians, and the rest constitute the irrationality of the spectra.           This
 defect cannot be removed in a double object-glass unless the dispersive
powers of higher orders are proportional to the first ; and he recommends
 that the attention of future inquirers should be directed to the discovery
 of such a medium (a result which there is reason to believe has at last
 been obtained by the combined        investigation of the late W. Vernon Ilar-
court and    Professor   Stokes).
    The condition which he assumes for correcting the spherical aberration
 is, that the compound shall be aplanatic for near as well as remote objects.
 He tabulates the results for the various crown and flint        glasses then used
 in England with a completeness which leaves nothing to be desired. It may
 be feared, however (notwithstanding the popular explanation of his method

                                                xxu
which he afterwards published in the sixth volume of the ' Edinburgh
Philosophical Journal     that this paper has had little influence on the
                                '),
practice of British workmen, who then and now arc far behind the require
ments of the age in the knowledge of geometry.

applies each of them to explain the laws of reflection and refraction and
the phenomena of Newton's rings and diffraction fringes, states the ob
jections to each, and shows the superiority of the latter as irresistible.
 He next describes with singular clearness the phenomena of Polarized
 Light (not few of which were discovered

 effect of mechanical force on the optical properties of transparent media.
    In other departments of science      must suffice to notice his investiga

                                                 is         that on several  oc
casions he gave powerful aid to the establishment of those simultaneous
magnetic surveys which, under the auspices of Sir Edward Sabine, have
thrown such light on the study of terrestrial magnetism.
    It remains to say few words as to his personal character for man,
                            a                                                    ;         a

                                           if
which should regulate morals and the duties of life. Herschel could abide
this test.   He was deeply and unostentatiously religious         exemplary in
                                                                             ;
all the social relations.         If
                              his devotion to his father might seem exces
sive,it should be remembered what         man that father was. Far above

the petty jealousies which haunt meaner minds, he was always ready to
do the fullest justice to the labours of others, regarding them as fellow-
labourers in    a   great work, not as rivals         ;   and when    it   was his lot to be
engaged in controversy, which he avoided as much as possible, he never
allowed   itto hurry him into any thing unworthy of Christian gentleman.
                                                                  a
A  beautiful trait in his character was the interest he took in those who, as
yet unknown, were beginning to climb the ascents of science, and the en
couragement he was always ready to afford them.           One instance of this
which it  was the writer's lot to witness struck him so much that he ventures
to mention     here. At an early meeting of the British Association
               it                                                      rough-             a
looking man brought forward       paper on the strength of iron unaccustomed
                                       a                                    ;
to such an audience, his presence of mind failed, and he sat down muttering

                                       xxni
" I   can't go on."    He sat down next to Herschel, and another paper was
proceeded with ; hut Herschel after a little began to whisper to him : at
first, in his agony of confusion, he seemed not to hear ; but Herschel per
severed,   asked what his views were, spoke well of them, and, as his coun
tenance brightened, asked leave to look over his paper, and having done
so, encouraged him to bring it forward next day.       But for this wise kind
ness that man might have relapsed into obscurity ; but, as   it was, he became
ultimately   a  Fellow of our Society, and one of the highest authorities in a
very important branch of mechanical engineering.
    Herschel married Miss Stewart in 1829, and had a large family, of whom
two sons are well known to us — Professor Alexander hy his study of Me
teorites, and Captain John, attached to the Indian Survey, distinguished
by spectroscopic observations of the sun and other heavenly bodies.
    He was created a Baronet in 18.38. In 1850 he, as Newton before him,
was appointed Master of the Mint.         That establishment was undergoing
an important change, its emancipation from the old Corporation of
Moneyers ; and the whole of its reorganization devolved on him. He also

"I   can't go on."      He sat down next to Herschel, and another paper was
proceeded with ; but Herschel after a little began to whisper to him : at
6rst, in his agony of confusion, he seemed not to hear ; but Herschel per
severed, asked what his views were, spoke well of them, and, as his coun
tenance   brightened, asked leave to look over his paper, and having done
so, encouraged him to bring it forward next day.           But for this wise kind
ness that man might have relapsed into obscurity ; but, as it was, he became
ultimately a Fellow of our Society, and one of the highest authorities in a
very important branch of mechanical engineering.
   Herschel married Miss Stewart in 1829, and had a large family, of whom
two sons are well known to us — Professor Alexander           by his study of Me
teorites,  and Captain John, attached to the Indian Survey, distinguished
by spectroscopic observations of the sun and other heavenly bodies.
   He was created a Baronet in 1838. In 1850 he, as Newton before him,
was appointed Master       of the Mint.      That establishment was undergoing
an    important change,       its   emancipation from the old Corporation of
Moneyers ; and the whole of its reorganization devolved on him.             He also
introduced an important check, which, however, has been discontinued since
his successor's death.      The official assays were controlled by others, made
by two unofficial chemists, those whom he employed being Graham and

   William Baird, M.D., F.R.S., F.L.S., &c, was the youngest son of
the Bev. James Baird, and was born at the Manse of Eccles, in Berwick
shire, in 1803.      He   was educated at the     High School of Edinburgh, and
afterwards     studied medicine and surgery in the University of that city,
and in Dublin and Paris.
   In   the year 1823, Dr. Baird, having previously made a voyage to the
West Indies and South America, entered the maritime service of the East-
India Company         as surgeon, and remained in that service until 1833.
During     this period he visited India and China five times, also other
countries ; and in all his voyages availed himself zealously of the oppor
tunities for studying his favourite science of Natural History which his
position presented      to him.      In 1829 Dr. Baird assisted in the foundation
of the well-known        Berwickshire Naturalists' Club (to the publications of
which he was afterwards a frequent contributor). The admirable example
afforded by that institution has led to the formation of similar Associations
    VOL. XX.                                                             d

in other parts of the United Kingdom, and has thus contributed greatly to
advance the knowledge of the natural history of particular districts, as
well as to spread a taste for this attractive science generally throughout
the country.
   On quitting the East-India Company's service, Dr. Baird practised his
profession    in London for some years, until, in 1841, he accepted an ap
pointment in the Zoological Department of the British Museum, where
he remained until his death, on the 27th of January, 1872.
    Dr. Baird's qualifications as a zoologist were of a high order, and his
published writings are numerous          and   valuable : they consist chiefly of
scattered    papers on     various  subjects  in the ' Edinburgh Philosophical
Journal,'    ' Loudon's
                           Magazine of Natural History,' and its successor
' The Annals and                                                  '
                        Magazine of Natural History,' iu the        Zoologist,' and
the ' Proceedings of the Zoological Society.'
   His most important work, however, is the ' Natural History of the
British Entomostraca,' published by the Ray Society in 1850.               It con
tains an excellent     account  of the structure, physiology, and habits of the
minute    Crustacea    which swarm in such abundance in our fresh and salt
waters, and is justly regarded as a work of great ability and research.
   He was also the author of a popular ' Cyclopaedia of the Natural
Sciences,' published in 1858, and of a valuable paper "On Pearls and
Pearl Fisheries," as well as one " On the Luminosity of the Sea."
   During the latter years of his life his attention was principally given to
the Entozoa, of the known species of which he had, as early as 1843,
drawn up a catalogue, which was published by the Trustees of the British
Museum. Numerous papers on the same subject were also contributed by
                                                             '
him to the * Proceedings of the Zoological Society             and the ' Transac
tions of the Linnean Society.'
   Latterly he was engaged in preparing a new and general catalogue of
the Entozoa,     comprehending     the information acquired up to the present
time.    With this object he had accumulated a vast amount of material,
and, had he lived to bring his undertaking to a close, it would have doubt
less supplied a most valuable contribution to science.
   But it is not merely by his publications that his great attainments must
be judged.      His knowledge of the various branches of Natural History was
extensive   and   accurate, and his readiness in imparting it to others will long
be remembered by those who were in the habit of studying in the British
Museum.
   As a man of science he was highly regarded by scientific men, and he
was greatly esteemed for his genial and kindly nature by all who knew
him.    In private life especially he was much beloved, on account of the
unvarying amiability of his disposition and the kindliness of his manners.
   Dr. Baird was a Fellow of the Linnean Society, and Member of the
Imperial and Royal Botanical Society of Vienna. He was elected into the
Royal Society in 1867.

    Wilhelm Karl Ritter v. Haidinger                   was the fourth and youngest son
 of Bergrath Karl Haidinger, one of the earliest cultivators of Mineralogy
 and Geology in the Austrian Empire, Professor of Mathematics                  and Me
 chanics in the Mining Academy of Schemnitz, who afterwards held an
 office in the   Mint and Mining Department in Vienna, and was the author
      —
 of: Dispositio Rerum naturalium Mussei Csesarei Vindobonensis ; on cer
 tain rare fossils     ;  on the minerals of the Wieliczka Salt-mines           ; on v.
 Bom's method of amalgamation               ; sketch of a systematic classification    of
 rocks ;   and  on the    minerals    sapphire, ruby,   and  spinelle.
     W. K. Haidinger was born in Vienna on the 5th of February, 1795, and
 was educated in the Academic Gymnasium of that city.                    In the autumn
 of   1812 he went to Gratz         in order to profit by the teaching of Mohs, who
 in that year gave his       first   course of lectures on Mineralogy at the Johan-
 neum ; and about the end of the year 1817 followed him to Freiberg, shar
 ing in his mineralogical researches, and making many new observations
 on the characters of several mineral species, which were never published
 separately in his own name.                  In May 1822 he accompanied Count
 August     Breunner     in a   journey,   undertaken    in the interests of science, to
  France and England.              In the autumn of 1823 he went to live in the
  house   of Mr. Thomas Allan, Banker in Edinburgh, who was the pos
 sessor of a fine collection of minerals ; and from the summer of 1825 till
 the autumn of 1826 he travelled with Mr. Allan's son Robert through
 Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, North Italy, and France.                            In
  1825 he published an English              translation   of the  Treatise on Minera
 logy by      Mohs,     with    many     additions   and  improvements.      During the
 years 1822-1827 he contributed to the Transactions of the Royal Society
 of Edinburgh, the Memoirs of the Wernerian Society, and Brewster's
 and Jameson's Journals no less than forty papers on the geome
 trical   and  physical characters of minerals, including several newly dis
 covered and described for the first time by himself.                In 1827 he joined
 his brothers Eugen         and      Rudolph     in the  management of a flourishing
 porcelain manufactory which they had established at Elbogen in Bohemia
in 1815; his eldest brother, Moritz, a lieutenant in the Austrian
 army, had died in 1809 of wounds received at Landshut.                     For thirteen
 vears he took an active part in conducting the business of the porcelain
 works, but not without maintaining an uninterrupted connexion with
 Natural Science by making many communications to the Bohemian Aca
                                            '
 demy     of  Science,    Poggendorft's        Anualen,' the ' Zeitschrift fur Physik,'
edited by Baunigartner and v. Ettingshausen, and a periodical bearing the
same name edited by v. Holger ; and in 1&2'J he published a work en
titled " Anfangsgriinde der Mineralogie."
     In April 18-10 he was appointed to succeed Mohs (who died at Agordo
in the Venetian Alps on the 29th of the preceding September) as lecturer
on Mineralogy and Custodian of a newly formed collection of Minerals,

ruary, 1843.    He gave seven courses, the last being in 1849. During
this period he made     one of his chief objects to encourage the members
                          it
of his class, consisting chiefly of mining students, to undertake original
investigations.  In the year 1843 he ascertained the existence of trichoism
in andalusite from Minas Geraes and in diaspore from Schemnitz, and
constructed his " Dichroiscopische Loupe" for exhibiting the contrast of
 colours between the two fields of oppositely polarized light when certain
coloured   crystals are viewed through it.    On the 1st of April 1844 he
 discovered the remarkable phenomenon of the " Polarisationsbiischel,"   or
 Haidinger's  Brushes as     more

logical knowledge of the whole Austrian Empire. This institution gave                   a
powerful impetus to the culture of the natural sciences throughout the
Austrian Empire.      During the seventeen years that Haidinger presided
over     he strove with painful accuracy to acknowledge the services of every
        it,
one of its Members who laboured under his direction.       Through Haidin
ger's exertions the Geographical Society of Vienna was established in De
cember 1855, and he became its first President.  To his influence also may
be traced the origin     of the   " Werner    Verein
                                                       "   for the geological examination

" Societa Geologica " of Milan, afterwards enlarged into the " Societa,

preserved to the day of his death a wonderful elasticity of mind, which not
only enabled him to take a lively interest in every new discovery made
by others, but to continue his own scientific labours.                     He died, after a
short illness, on the 19th of March, 1871, at Dornbach near Vienna,
and was buried in the cemetery of that place on the 22nd.
    He was the author of at least three hundred and twenty papers on
the characters of many new minerals, mineralogical optics, pleochroism,
pseudomorphs, geology, meteorology, and on the freezing and break
ing up of the ice of rivers.           During the years 1859-1870 he wrote a
number of remarkable memoirs on meteors and meteorites.                         These are
for the most part        to be found,      in addition to the Journals and Trans

upwards      of   a hundred    learned     Societies,    Knight of various Orders, in
 cluding the Austrian Order of Franz Joseph and the Prussian of Pour

 1856.     On the 29th of April, 1850, a Gold Medal, subscribed for by
 numerous friends, in recognition of his merits as the founder of a new
 scientific era for Austria, was presented to him. On the 5th of February,
  1865, the seventieth anniversary of his birthday, his bust in marble, the
 cost of which was defrayed by the subscriptions of residents in almost

    Heinbich Gustay-Magnus,                   elected Foreign Member of the Royal
  Society   in   1863, was  born  on  the    2nd   of May, 1802, in Berlin, where his
 father, Johann Matthias Magnus, had founded a large mercantile establish
 ment.      At an early age he exhibited great aptitude for the study of Mathe
 matics and the Natural Sciences, and was fortunately sent to a school in which
particular care was bestowed upon instruction in the subjects which chiefly
interested him.        The   easy circumstances of his family having enabled him
 to select     the career   that best suited his tastes and capacity, he deter
 mined to devote       all his powers to the cultivation of Chemistry, Physics,
 and Technology.         He entered the University of Berlin in 1822.            Under no
 obligation to hurry through his Academic studies, he employed the fol
 lowing five years in attending lectures on Chemistry, Physics, and Mathe
 matics.       He also worked diligently in the University Laboratory, and

occupied his vacations in making mineralogical and technological excur
sions.    He had resolved to qualify himself as a teacher of Technology, but
was unwilling to undertake any definite duties without first seeking to
complete his education by studying in other Universities.              Accordingly
in 1828 he went to      Stockholm,    where  he  worked   under Berzelius, and had
the good fortune to lay the foundation of a warm and life-long friendship
with his master; and he visited Paris in 1829 and attended the lectures
of Gay-Lussac,     Thcnard, and other eminent chemists and physicists.            In
 1831 he obtained his habilitation as a teacher of Technology          and  Physics
in the University of Berlin, and laboured as a teacher with unexampled
success for nearly forty years.        He devoted the utmost care to the arrange
 ment of his lectures, and spared neither trouble nor expense in procuring
diagrams, models, instruments, and other requisites for their illustration.
 In 1834 he became Extraordinary Professor in the University.                In the
same year he passed several weeks in Paris for the purpose of inspecting
various manufactories, especially those of chemical products.           In the fol
lowing year he came to England and visited various manufacturing esta
blishments    in Worcester,      Birmingham,     Manchester,   and Liverpool. On
the 27th of January,       18-40, he was elected a Member of the Berlin Aca
demy.      In the earlier part of his career he lectured on Chemistry at the
 Gewerbeschule during the absence of Professor Wohler ; from 1832 to
 1840 he lectured on Physics at the Artillery and Engineer Academy             ; and
from 1850 to 1856 on Chemical Technology at the Gewerbeinstitut.                  In
 1845   he became    Ordinary Professor.       In 1861 he was elected      " Rector
magnificus"     of  the   University.     His services  to the Academy were not
                                                                 '
limited to the publication of original researches in the Monatsberichte'
and 'Abhandlungen;' he devoted much time and labour to its financial
affairs.    He gave the first impulse to the establishment of the Humboldt
foundation for aiding scientific travellers.        He was a Member of the Sec
tion of Physics and Chemistry of the Prussian Society of Arts, and one of
the twelve Naturforschende        Freunde, and for many years took his share in
the scientific labours of that Society.         He was a Member of the Jury in
the London and Paris Exhibitions of 1851,            1855, 1862,   1867.   In 1865
he represented Prussia in the Conference on weights and measures, which
held its session in Frankfort.       The deliberations of this Conference finally
led to the adoption     of the  Metric   System throughout Germany.
    In the autumn of 1869       he visited England,    attended the Meeting of the
British Association at Exeter,        and then passed some weeks in the Isle of
Wight ; but travelling and change of air no longer produced their accus
tomed restorative effects.      After returning to Berlin his labours were often
interrupted by    serious  indisposition.    For months his vigorous constitution
struggled against the encroaching sickness.             With a sense of duty that
overcame    the most violent pain, he continued to lecture on Physics, though
with many interruptions.         On the 25 th of February he lectured for the
 last time.   During    the  month of March he was seldom able to leave his

                                           XXIX
bed, but his intellect remained        unclouded.     He regarded his approaching
end with composure, and died on          the 4th of April, 1870.       He was buried

jects,  extend   over a  space  of not  less than  forty -five  years. Almost all of
                                          ' Annalen,' and the most
them appeared in Poggendorff's                                            part also in
the publications of the Berlin Academy of Sciences.                 His first memoir,
published in 1825, while yet a student, was on the reduction of the
 oxides of cobalt, nickel,     and iron by hydrogen, and on the spontaneous
inflammability     of  these   metals in a state of fine division.         In 1827 he
published    researches    on  the solubility of sulphur and selenium, without
oxidation,    in sulphuric acid.       Between 1827 and 1833 he investigated
the combination of platinous chloride with the elements of ammonia,
the composition of sikrosmine, brochantite, vesuvian, the diminution of
density of vesuvian after fusion, and discovered sulphovinic, sethionic, and
 iseethionic acids and their salts, and, conjointly with Amermuller, periodic
 acid.    He experimented on the gases contained in blood, the exhaustion
 of soils, and   on the    nutrition of plants.      He   also   invented   a maximum
thermometer, and employed it to find the temperature of an artesian well
 at Riidersdorf, and afterwards, in an improved form, to find the tempera
ture of a similar well at Pitzpuhl.         He undertook researches on the boiling
of mixed fluids, and the temperature of the vapour of saline solutions.
 Between 1841 and 1844 he carried out a most important series of experi
ments on the expansion of atmospheric air, hydrogen, and other gases,
and on the pressure of the vapour of water at temperatures between 6° C.
  and 104° C.       Without being aware that Magnus was engaged in these
 researches, Regnault was occupied with the same investigation ; and the
 results obtained by these two experimenters were published almost simul
taneously.      Their close agreement affords a striking proof of the care with
which they observed and the excellence of their methods, and affords a gua
rantee of the accuracy of the determination of the expansion of air and the
pressure of the vapour of water, data of the utmost importance in physical and
chemical investigations.        He made observations on electromagnetic pheno
mena and thermoelectric currents, on the forms of streams of spouting
 fluids, the deviation of rifled balls from a vertical plane, the condensa
tion of gases on the surfaces of solids.          His later researches were mainly
on the transmission of heat through gases and vapours, the differences
of the nature of the heat radiated from smooth and rough surfaces, and
the polarization of heat.          His last communication to the Academy of
  Sciences was made on the 11th of October, 1869.
     He was Corresponding Member of the French Institute, and actual or
  Corresponding Member of many other Academies and learned Societies.
     The preceding outline of the life and labours of Magnus is extracted
  from a Biography      by Professor Hofmann read before the Chemical Society

                                          XXX
    Sir  Roderick        Impey     Murchison, Bart., K.C.B.,        &c. — Among
the recent losses sustained by the Society we must place in the foremost rank
that caused by the death of Sir Roderick Impey Murchison.                It would
not  be easy to define precisely     the place which he held among us.      With
out   claiming to stand on the highest platform of scientific iutellect, a
patient gatherer of facts rather than a brilliant generalizer from them, he
yet gained by common consent the position of a leader in the common
wealth of science, under whom men of all ranks, even though of higher
ability and greater attainments than his own, were willing to serve.             It
was not merely his achievements in geology which gave him that pre
eminence ; he owed nothing to success in other branches of science, for he
seldom travelled beyond what he knew to be his proper domain, nor to
grace of literary style.        He wrote only on geological and geographical
subjects, and that too in a plain matter-of-fact way not likely to attract
readers    for whom      the   subject-matter had not previously possessed      an
interest.     His influence sprang from his personal character — noble-hearted-
ness, indomitable energy, great tact and courtesy, and an influential social
position,    which enabled him to befriend science and scientific men, and to
gain   for  them   increasing consideration in society.
    Descended from a line of ancestors who had attached themselves to the
fortunes of the Earls of Seaforth, Murchison was born on February 19 th,
 1792, at the little estate of Tarradale, in Eastern Ross-shire, purchased by
 his father, who earned a small fortune as a medical practitioner in India.
While still a child he was removed into Dorsetshire, and spent nearly the
whole of his boyhood in England.           He received his general education at
Durham Grammar School, and being destined for a military career, was
sent to the Military      College of Great Marlow for the requisite professional
training. When only fifteen years of age he obtained a commission in the
36th regiment of foot, and sailed for the Peninsula under Sir Arthur Welles-
ley. He went through the brief campaign which terminated with the Con
vention of Cintra, and carried the colours of his regiment at Vimiera.          In
the succeeding campaign under Sir          John Moore, which    began   at Lisbon
and ended at Corunna, he underwent           great hardship, and was one    of the
footsore stragglers      who   narrowly escaped capture  by the French towards
the end of that retreat.
    After the army returned to England, Murchison again went abroad on
military duty, but being with the troops in Sicily, saw no more active
warfare.      At the peace of 1815 he quitted the army, and married the
daughter of General Hugonin.
    For the next ten years of his life he spent his time chiefly in England.
He was much attached to field-sports, and used to speak of this as the
fox-hunting period of his career.        Yet under the influence of his amiable
and intelligent      wife he made    some long journeys through the continent,
specially     devoting   himself to the study of art in public and private
collections,    and making copious notes on this subject.


               '
published Siluria,' which has gone through several editions, he recast
the original work, introducing much detail regarding the extension                    of
Silurian and older Palaeozoic rocks into other countries ; but while, in the
later   publication, the      results given were necessarily often the work of
                                             '
other observers,     the ' Silurian System       remains a monument of the inde
pendent     labour of a mind quick in observation, sagacious in inference,
patient    in the accumulation of data, and full of that instinctive appre
ciation   of the value of facts not yet fully understood which is near akin
to genius.
   Upwards of a hundred memoirs in the Transactions of Societies, chiefly
on British and Continental Geology, addresses without number to Societies
and Associations, besides more than twenty memoirs written in conjunction
with other authors, remain as a monument of his industry.                  But to this
mass of work must be added what he published in separate volumes — the
' Silurian                                     '
              System,' with its successor         Siluria,' and his splendid volumes
     '
on Russia and the Ural Mountains.'
   From the time when he began to devote himself to geology, Murchison
continued     to be one of the most active men of science of his day.            Living
chiefly in London, and coming daily in contact with men of every science,
he took a prominent part in the work of more than one learned Society.
In summer or autumn he usually made a tour for geological research, either
in this country or on the continent, and continued this habit up to within
two years of his death.          In his Russian exploration he was absent from
England for two or three years.
   Of   the honours     heaped upon him from all          parts of the world it is not
necessary to speak.        There was hardly an Academy anywhere which had
not enrolled him among its Associates.        He was elected a Fellow of ihe Royal
Society    in  1826,  and  in   18-19 the Copley Medal was awarded to him for
his three great works, 'On the Silurian System,' 'On the Geology of
Russia,' and 'On the Structure of the Alps.'               In 1855 he succeeded Sir
Henry     de  la Beche   as  Director-General      of the  Geological Survey of Great
Britain, an office which he held to the time of his death.                On his return
from Russia he had received the honour of knighthood, and at a later
period he was nominated a K.C.B. and raised to the dignity of a baronet.
   Sir Roderick Murchison was distinctly and specially a geologist.                 The
attachment which his early Silurian labours had given him to Palaeozoic
rocks never waned ; and though led now and then to make and record
observations on later formations, he seemed always to return to the older
deposits as his natural domain.            He was not a palaeontologist, yet no
geologist    could use more skilfully than he the data furnished by palaeon
tology. This faculty he acquired in the Silurian region, and it continued
to mark his work in the field both at home and abroad : it enabled him to
applv to distant countries the principles which he had so successfully used
in his own. Perhaps the leading idea of his scientific life should be regarded
as a desire to establish     the order of succession       among   rocks.   It was this

desire which    he so successfully     realized in the Silurian   region ; and it
seemed to be always present with him in every district to which by choice
¦er accident he might      be led.    He had a singularly quick eye for the
geological structure of a country, seizing often with striking accuracy, from
what to others seemed but slender evidence, the leading features of the
grouping of the rocks.
    No notice of his life and labours would be in any measure adequate if
it did not allude to the prominence with which during the last few years of
his life Sir Roderick's name was brought forward by the chivalrous devotion
with which he maintained the belief in the safety of Dr. Livingstone.         Yet
this was only one of innumerable examples of his tenacious friendship and
active benevolence.       As President of the Geographical Society (a Society
which is in a sense his own creation) he had many opportunities of be
friending not only the cause of geography but the personal interests of
travellers ; and it gave him a genuine pleasure to make use of these oppor
tunities.    It will be long ere the recollection will pass away of his stately
courtesy   of  manner, suiting well that military bearing which dated from
the old school of Wellesley and Moore, or of the kindliness which made
him shrink from allowing even ingratitude to alienate his friendship. — A. G.
    Colonel  William Henry Sykes            was  born in 1790.    His father was
Samuel Sykes, Esq., descended       from an old Yorkshire family, of which he
was the representative.      At an early age Colonel Sykes entered the    military
service of the East-India Company, and as a young officer of the Bombay
Army bore his part in the active military operations carried on in India in
the early years of the present century.         He was present at the memorable
siege  of Bhurtpore    under Lord  Lake.      He  served in the Deccan from 1 SI 7
to 1820, and was in command of a regiment at the battles of Kirkee and
Poona, and took part in the capture of the Hill Forts.           Throughout his
active military career he enjoyed the confidence of the distinguished com
manders under whom he served, as well as the esteem and regard of his
brother officers.     In 1824 he was appointed Statistical Reporter to the
Government of Bombay, and finally quitted India in 1831.             In 1333 he
was promoted to the rank      of Colonel ; but having returned to England he
thenceforward applied himself to the pursuits of civil life.       The knowledge
he had acquired of Indian affairs, and the reliance placed on his intelligence
and integrity, led to his being twice elected on the Board of Directors of
the East-India Company; and when the vast dominion they had so long
administered was about to pass under the immediate government of the
Crown, the Company gave a further proof of their confidence in Colonel
Sykes by appointing him their Chairman at that important epoch.            Mean
while he was (1824) elected Lord Rector of the Marischall College of
Aberdeen, and three years afterwards was chosen to represent that city in
 Parliament, and enjoyed the entire confidence of his constituents to
 the end of his life.    As a Member of the Legislature he was an advocate

of economy, peace, and social progress, and in the divisions of the House
of Commons, from which he was not often absent, his name was almost
invariably to be found on the extreme liberal side. •
   During his life in India, as well as afterwards at home, Colonel Sykes
was a zealous scientific observer.       His favourite pursuits were zoology,
meteorology, and fossil geology ; and numerous contributions by him on
these subjects, especially the first, are to be found in the Proceedings of the
Zoological, Asiatic, and Geological Societies, and in the Reports of the
British Association, of which     he was one  of the most active members, both
in the Sectional Meetings and in the deliberations of the Council. One
of his most considerable papers on Indian Meteorology was published in
the Philosophical Transactions for 1850.         Another subject which largely
engaged   his attention, both  in  India and at  home, was Statistics.  He was
one  of the founders of the Statistical Society of London, and continued to
take a lively interest in its work ; in 1863 he was elected President.      He
was also President of the Royal Asiatic Society, and Chairman of the
Society of Arts.     He became a Felb'v of the Royal Society in 1834, and
was more than once elected on the Council.           Colonel Sykes married, in
1824, Elizabeth, youngest daughter of William Hay, Esq., of Renistoun ;
he died at his residence in London on the 16th of June, 1872.
