observed at Kerguelen, the reason is mentioned why it was not deemed
advisable to take magnetic observations at sea during the voyage ; the
results, therefore, in this paper are entirely confined to the determina
tions of the Dip, Intensity, and Declination of the earth's magnetic
force at the several places at which we landed.          On our outward
journey we had no opportunity of using our      instruments,  except at the
Cape of Good Hope, but on our return we were much more fortunate,
as H.M.S. "Volage"        made a stay of at least two days at Point de
 Galle, at Bombay, Aden, Port Said, and Malta, and we utilised all
 these opportunities except the first.     From Malta, the Rev. W. Sid-
greaves and myself returned to England by Sicily, Italy, and France,
and, taking our magnetic instruments with us, we were able to observe
at Palermo, Naples, Rome, Florence,          and Moncalieri.   As we had
previously    made a  complete survey   of  France  in 1868  and 1869, we
thought it too early to repeat the observations.         The instrumental
corrections and constants have already been given in the former paper
on Kerguelen, it will, therefore, suffice to refer to that communication
 for any necessary details.

      The long sea voyage, with its great variation of temperature, was
 very trying for the delicate portions of the instruments, and as we
 found that No. 1 Needle had been slightly injured by rust, it was
 never used during our home journey.                        In the last column of Table          II
 the daily mean values of the dip are entered, but it was only at Cape
 Town and at Bombay that observations could be taken on more than
 a single day.           Needle No. 2 seems to read about 30" higher than
 No. 3, but no correction has been applied to either, as the amount is
 considerably less than the usual errors of observations.

     The values of the dip at the Cape of Good Hope, from 1751 to 1851,
  have been      collected in vol. i of the Cape Magnetic Observations, and
   -
  these   give,

                   for the yearly increase in the south dip of the needle,
              from 1751 to 1840,             5'45 from 1841 to 1846, and          -  5' 58
  from 1843 to 1851. The quantity in Table              III  shows that this decrease
  in the acceleration is still continuing.
     The inclination observed at the College in Bombay is very extra
  ordinary, and would at first sight appear to have been entered incor
  rectly. The result, however, agrees perfectly with the observed angles,
  and as two complete observations were taken with Needle No. 3, and
  these fairly agree, it may be supposed that the instrument was stand
  ing at the time over an unsuspected mass of iron capable of deflecting
  the suspended needle, through an angle of nearly a degree. The paper
  by Mr. C. Chambers, in the Phil. Trans, for last year, gives 19° 8,-5 as
 the most probable value of the dip for January 1st, 1871, at the Colaba
 Observatory, with a secular change of + i'-9.                 This magnetic element
  would, therefore, appear to be altering more rapidly at present than its
 mean rate of change during the last 30 years.                  The angle observed in
 1875 is very slightly in excess of that computed for the same epoch
 from the data of Mr. Chambers.
     The low value of the secular change at Rome is quite exceptional,
 but if we compute this quantity for the epoch 1849 from the figures
 given in Sir E. Sabine's report, we again obtain                   - 2' '09, showing
 that, if there be an error, it is due to local causes.
                                The Magnetic Intensity.
    At each station the horizontal component of the magnetic force was
determined absolutely by vibrations and deflections, and the total
intensity deduced from the horizontal force combined with the clip.
The magnets employed throughout were the same as those used at
Kerguelen, and no departure             from the usual methods was ever found
necessary.

    The tables of Sir Edward Sabine (Phil. Trans., 1868) furnish very
few details from which to deduce the secular variation of the intensity
at the above stations.
    The total force at the Cape Observatory in 1845 was 7-58, and this
combined with 7"7152, the value for 1874, will give + 0 0047 as the
annual change.        In the Cape Magnetic Observations,, vol. i, we find
 + 0-0066 as the corresponding value for 1848.
    Taking the mean of the observations at Bombay in 1845 and 1847,
and also the mean for 1856 and 1867, we find 8'285 and 8 505 as the
values of the intensity for the epochs 1846 and 1861-5.               Comparing
this last value with 8-5633 of 1875, gives a yearly change of
 I- 0-0043, whilst the apparent change in 1854 was + 0-0142. Turning
now to the Colaba results from 1867 to 1873 we see that, for January
1st, 1871, the absolute value of the total force was 8-5391, with an
annual change of + 0'0064. This would make the magnetic intensity
8-5663 for April, 1875, which agrees well with the observed value.
The mean annual acceleration from 1861 to 1875 is considerably less
than the value deduced from the observations of the last few years.
   The intensity, 9-27, observed by Caligny at Malta in 1839, com
bined with that of 1875, makes the annual variation — 0-0052.
   At Rome, 9-6575 in 1849 gives also an annual variation of — 0*0052 ;
but at Naples, 9-55 in 1845, makes the yearly change only — 0'0033.

 G            Rev. S.  J. Perry on Magnetic Observations       [Jan.  10,
are necessarily affected by many possible sources of error, when the
work has to be done in the course of a long and difficult journey. The
carriage of the instruments by land and sea ; the frequent packing and
unpacking ; the great variations of temperature ; the shortness of
time at each station, scarcely allowing sufficient attention to be paid
to choice   of locality or examination of instruments ; all tell more
against the magnetic declination than against the other elements of
terrestrial magnetism.
    As we were detained a considerable time at the Cape of Good
Hope, it was thought advisable to examine thoroughly all the instru
ments, and to take a very complete set of observations at the Cape
Observatory, in order to make this well-known station the point of
departure for all our work in Kerguelen and elsewhere.            It was
fortunate that this could be done leisurely, as we found on examina
tion that the declination magnet was useless, the bar not being
magnetic, nor capable of retaining a sufficient amount of magnetism to
rtecure accurate results.  On July 30th the bar was magnetised by aid
of large permanent magnets, and then subsequent declination observa
tions led to most unsatisfactory results. On August the 19th a coil was
made use of to magnetise the same bar, but two series of readings then
taken with the needle, and with the Observatory magnet, shewed the
utter untrustworthiness of our needle. As the Rev. W. Sidgreaves,
though most kindly assisted by the Government Astronomer, Mr. E. J.
Stone, was unable to magnetise satisfactorily our reversible declination
needle, we were forced to substitute in its place the vibration magnet.
The latter not being arranged for rapid revei-sal, the zero of the scale
was very carefully determined both at the Cape Observatory and after
wards at Kerguelen, and the scale value accurately tested.
    The method of observation usually adopted, was to fix the position
of a well defined distant mark, by aid of sun or star transits, with the
 Simms' theodolite, and then to note the bearing of the magnetic needle
 with respect to the same mark with the Jones' unifilar. At Florence
 the confined space, and still more the badness of the weather, made it
 advisable to trust wholly to the unifilar, and therefore no fixed mark
 was used, but the position of the magnet was referred directly to that
 of the sun, observed by aid of the mirror attached to the instrument.
 The same method was used at Moncalieri, and the corrections for the
 displacement of the mirror, deduced from the latter observations,
 served to correct the single reading at Florence.        The necessary
 correction for any error in the mirror is explained in a former paper
 on the magnetic survey of the west of France (Phil. Trans. 18b"y,
 p. 43).
    The chronometer    made use of throughout the whole     series of ob
 servations was a good pocket instrument from Greenwich Observatory,
 Maurice G144.    It was compared on every possible occasion with the

1878.]              during Transit     of   Venus Expedition.                       7
standard clocks of fixed observatories, and at otter times with, the
chronometers kept on board H.M.S. "Volage."                No direct observations
were taken with the transit theodolite to check the error and rate of
the chronometer,      bat these depend entirely on the comparisons.                It
will not be necessary to give in full the details of each comparison,
but all the requisite information is contained in the following table.

 When the journey through Sicily was commenced, the chronometer
 was altered to approximate local times.                The great change in the
 daily   rate   between  Naples     and   Borne    will not affect the results at
 Borne, as the declination was measured from the standard mark at
 the Boman College Observatory.                Before reaching Moncalieri the
 chronometer appears to have met with an accident which entirely
 altered its rate, but the double comparison at this station renders
 this change of less moment.

10         Kev. S.   J.  Perry on Magnetic Observations,    etc.   [Jan. 10,
At the Observatories of the Cape, of Colaba at Bombay, and of Rome, it
was only necessary to enter the approximate local mean time under
the heading, " Chronometer," as the declination at these stations was
measured from the standard marks.          The bearing of these magnetic
marks    is respectively  0° 31' 51", 0° 26' 26", and 21° 26' 54"  E. of the
Astronomical North Point.          At the remaining stations the sun's
azimuth was computed for the honr angle of the sun given by the
chronometer, except at the college of Bombay, where it was found
more convenient to observe the stars Aldebaran and Capella, instead
of the sun. The observations marked with an asterisk were taken
with the needle of the Cape Observatory.         The computed altitudes of
the sun for the three observations at Moncalieri, were 63° 3' 33" "60,
63° 48' 57" 69, and 64° 29' 17"-78.     This difference of altitude being so
slight makes the correction for the perpendicularity of the mirror
much less reliable than it might otherwise have been.
    The declination observations at the Cape of Good Hope date back
as far as 1600, and the mean yearly amount of the secular variation
for the first 240 years was found to be + 7'"66 W.            It then dimi
nished, and was + 0'-49 from 1841 to 1846, +1'-41 from 1843 to
1848, and 2'"16 from 1846 to 1850.        The renewed acceleration in the
annual variation seems to have lasted but for a short period, as a
comparison of the mean value for 1874, with 29° 14'"62, the mean for
1848, gives only 1''68 as the annual change.
    From observations of this magnetic element at Bombay in 1845,
1856, 1867, and 1875, we notice a gradual easterly motion of the
needle, it being at .the above dates 0° 13' W., 0° 19' B., 0° 42' E., and
0° 56' E., shewing a decreasing yearly change of 2,,91, 2'"09, and 1''75.
The amount of the mean annual variation given by the series of
monthly observations at the Colaba Observatory from 1867 to 1873 is
 1''77, which may be considered identical with the above:
    At Aden the heat of the sun was so great that it was imprudent to
remain long near the theodolite whilst taking the solar observation,
the declination was therefore obtained under very disadvantageous
circumstances, and consequently less weight can be attached to the
result.    This is apparent also from the abnormal increase in the secular
acceleration.     Thus the declination which was 5° 2' W. in 1834,
became 4° 15' W. in 1857, the annual             variation being, therefore,
 — 2' 04; whilst in 1875 the angle observed was 2° 19' 39" W., which
increases the yearly change to — 6' "41.
    The declination in 1875 at Malta, combined with the value
15° 20' W., obtained in 1834, gives a yearly change of — 4''76; and
the angle 13° 49' measured at Borne in 1852-5, along with the value
found in 1875, makes the annual variation — 5,-95.         For the remain
ing stations I am unacquainted with any published values of this
element of the earth's magnetic force, but the careful series of

     The developments which    have recently given to Professor Cayley's
                                                       I
   second method of dealing with invariants (the first method being that
   which has been exclusively used by Professor Gordan), has led me
   through the theory of the Canonical Generating Fraction to the
   following results, showing that the degree and order of the funda
   mental invariants and co variants to a quantic or system of quantics
   are snbject to algebraical limits of    very simple kind, and   think   a                                     I                  it
   right  that these results should not be  withheld  from the knowlege of
   those who are pursuing another and, as         seems to me, much more               it
   arduous and less promising direction of inquiry into the same subject.
      By order     mean the dimensions of a derived form in the coeffi

   cients of its primitive (Clebsch and Gordau's grad), and by degree the
   dimensions in the variables (Clebsch and Gordan's ordnung).

  reduces to a single linear function or a single quadratic) the degree of

any irreducible       covariant to the system       has for    a superior    limit
    Thus,    ex. gr., where    there is but one quantic, the   limit is — — or
        , according as the degree is n odd or v even.
   Secondly, as to order.
    As the expressions become somewhat complicated when there are
several quantics,      I shall confine myself to a statement applicable to a
single    quantic, distinguishing between the three cases when n (its
degree) is evenly even, oddly even, and odd.

and for the latter       (» +  2H"~3)    .

                                           3ns-6«-12        ,  (» + 2)  (3»-8)'—
the limits for the two species are •— ¦         —        and  —*
respectively.
    G.   When n is any odd number greater            than 3, the order of the
                                 .3-
invariants has for its limit             +    (n— 3), and when it is any odd
                                   it
number      greater   than unity, the order of the covariants         has for its

   Further investigations will, have good reason to believe, lead to
considerably lower limits than those given for cases B and G.
   Although morally certain the three formula? A, B, C cannot be con-
sidered at present apodictically established, the formula respecting
the limit to degree may, I believe, be regarded as admitting of a com
plete demonstration.          There exists, however, a superior limit to the
orders of the fundamental invariants or covariants, which may be
regarded as subject to direct demonstration even in our present state
of knowledge ; this when n is even is n' — 2»i — 3 for invariants,
and «a — n — 4 for covariants ; and when n is odd, the corresponding
limits are 2«s— 3»— 5 for invariants, and 2?i*— 2«— 5 for covariants.
But I have no moral doubt whatever of the validity of the formulae B
and G as they stand, and next to none of the validity of formula A.

III.  " On the Structure and Development of the Skull in the
      Common Snake (Tropidonotus natrix).              By W. K. PARKER,
      F.R.S.    Received October 15, 1877.
                                 (Abstract.)
                          I
   For several years past have taken every opportunity to work at the
skull of the common snake, but sufficient materials for completing a
memoir upon it have not turned up until lately.
   Last year, however, at the request of my friend Mr. P. H. Carpenter,
Dr. Max Braun, of Wiirzbnrg, kindly sent me about fifty early embryos
of reptiles ; these were of four kinds, namely, of the common snake,
the blind worm, the nimble lizard, and the gecko.
   These invaluable embryos, added to what I have for many years been
collecting, will enable me to bring before the Society a yearly tribute
of a paper on the skull of these instructive types.
   Lying at the very base of the gill-less Vertebrata, and possessing a
skull at once the simplest, and yet the most curiously specialized, the
snake is a type well worth careful study.        I have found it so in my
own division of work.
   My guide in this piece of work has been Rathke, whose observations
on the early stages of the skull appeared first, in translation, in this
                                   " Croonian Lecture."
country, in Professor Huxley's
   For many years past I have known that the key to the meaning of
the skull in the whole series of the
                                        " Sauropsida " — reptiles and birds
in one huge group — was to be found in that of the serpent.            I have
freely used it as such, and  my   nomenclature   of the parts   of the  grow
ing bird's skull is based on that of the snake's, although, until now, I
have not been able to publish more than a mere abstract upon its
characters.
   For convenience' sake,   I have   divided my subject into seven stages,
the first of these being illustrated by embryos with a very delicate
vesicular head, bent down upon the neck, and whose entire length,
supposing them to be uncoiled, was barely three-quarters of an inch in
length.     The last stage is the adult, whose skull, once interpreted,
will greatly help in the interpretation of all the skulls that rise above
and around it.
   As to the finished skull, it is easy to judge beforehand that the
cranial part must be a very solid and relatively small box, and that the
facial part must be free and elastic to the utmost degree.
   All the morphological specializations that take place in the head of
the embryo steadily lead to this result ; but the superstructure is mar
vellously unlike the foundations that were at first laid.
   As to the general embryological study of the snake's embryo, it
may be remarked that it is almost exactly like that of the bird's.

Comparing my own observations on this low tyj>e with the results
given of the study of the chick in Foster and Balfour's excellent work,
I  find that few paragraphs in it would need any material alteration,
and that the fignres would mostly serve very accurately if in that work
the word chick were to be exchanged for that of make embryo.
   The development of the vesicles of the brain, the organs of special

across my path, to say nothing of the rest of the growing germ, all are
developed similarly in the snake, below, and in the bird, above.
   Like all the Vertebrata above the fishes and amphibia (" Ichthy-
opsida "), the embryo of the snake has the folds and clefts behind the
mouth few and small; yet there is no change of pattern, and the
rudiments of three pairs of gill-arches with their clefts can be made
out.

   But no embryo have studied shows more clearly that all the folds
that lie about the mouth, before and behind, as well as those that form
the mouth itself, belong to one category.
   Whilst the brain is merely a row of three vesicles, and the rudiments
of the sense-capsules are three folds, or unclosed vesicles, the sides of
the head grow downwards as a series of folds parted by deep notches
or clefts.
   These clefts are the " naso-lacrymal
                                             " in front of the
                                                                 rudimentary

and the three    " hyo-branchial  " clefts behind that.
    The first folds lie under the fore-brain ; these are the " fronto-nasal
           " or                              "                    "
processes        flaps ; the second are the    maxillo-palatine ; the third,
 the mandibular ; the fourth, the hyoid ; and the fifth, sixth, and
seventh are rudimentary branchials, that never give off branchial fila
 ments or plicae.
    The cavity of the mouth is formed by the absorption of the meso-
blast that lay in the angle of the bead — bent double upon itself — just
below the end of the notochord.
   The walls of the mouth are formed by the maxillo-palatine rudi
ments in front, and the mandibular rudiments behind ; below, the floor
of the face is suppressed ; at the sides, the right and left cleft form the
right and left angle of the mouth.
   The visceral folds develop but little cartilage; an outgrowth from
the anterior ends of the trabeculee grows downwards and backwards
into the fronto-nasal process. It represents two visceral rudiments,
the axis of the pre-maxillary arch ; but this flap is single.
   The maxillopalatine folds develop no cartilage, but become rich in
" parosteal " bones.
   Each mandible        develops a large quadrate and a long articnlo-
meckelian cartilage.
   All the cartilage seen on each side behind the lower jaw is a small

                (" hyo-maudibular "), which becomes the stem of the
 " columella auris ;" but the " branchial " folds develop no       cartilage in
them, and soon are lost in the sides of the neck.
    There is but little cartilage developed in the cranium. The ear-
 capsules are large, long, and become solid cartilage before they ossify,
 and the simple nasal roofs chondrify and never ossify.
    There is a large cartilaginous occipital ring or arch, but the
 sphenoidal regions, which have exceptionally autogenous alas, are very
 feeble and small.
    The trabecules, which are manifestly mere outgrowths of the para-
 choidal tracts, develop into long terete rods of cartilage, but do not
 ossify at all in front of the pituitary space.
    They coalesce in the internasal region, and coalescing also with the
 descending laminae of each nasal roof-cartilage, they form a low septnm
nasi.
    There are two pairs of " extra- visceral," or labial, cartilages.

    Both in the cranium and face there is a copious growth of very per
fect bone developed in the sub-cutaneous stroma.           In the cranium the
frontals quite, and the parietals almost,    meet   below.    Thus the trabe-
culae are excluded from taking part in the formation of the front part
of the cranial cavity.

sauropsidan    skull.
   The occipital condyles are confluent at the mid-line, so as to form a
rounded single surface, with a dimpled middle part.
   The auditory capsule acquires three bony centres that do not unite
with each other, but with the nearest bones of the cranium.
   Thus the prootic coalesces with the alisphenoid, the epiotic with the
superoccipital, and the opisthotic with the exoccipital.
   The colnmella and stapes are one bone, not distinct as in the
batrachia.    The union takes place very early.
   The mandible opens very far back, behind the occiput, and as the
quadrate passes over the stylo-hyal, the two become ankylosed together.
   For the palate a new bone appears, namely the " trans-palatine ; "
but the meso-pterygoid is not distinct from the pterygoid in the
ophidia.    It occurs in Anguis fragilis.

 IV. " Observations       on  the Nervous System of Aurelia aurita."
        By Edward Albert Schafer, Assistant Professor of Phy
        siology in University College, London. Communicated by
        W. Sharpey, M.D., LL.D., F.R.S. Received October 31,
        1877.
                                  (Abstract.)
    The author describes the nervous system of Aurelia as consisting, in
 addition to the lithocysts and certain tracts of specially modified epi
 thelium in their neighbourhood, of an interlacement of nerve-fibres
  covering the whole of the under surface of the umbrella and lying
  between the ectodermal epithelium and the muscular sheet.                Each
 nerve-fibre presents near the middle of its course a nucleated enlarge
  ment in the shape of a bipolar nerve-cell, which is thus interpolated in
 the course of the fibre.      With regard to these nerve-fibres it is re
  marked — firstly, that they are of limited length, seldom exceeding four
  millimetres ; secondly, that they never come into actual continuity
  with other fibres, although they frequently run closely parallel for a
 certain distance, and often form extremely intricate interlacements by
 the coming together of a number of fibres. The fibres occasionally
 branch.      They are described as ending generally by finely-tapered
  extremities, which are in close contact with the substance of the mus
  cular fibres, but sometimes the termination of the nerve is dilated into
 a flattened nucleated expansion, probably a primitive form of motorial
  end plate.
    The structure and relations of the lithocysts are then treated of.
  The lithooyst is described as consisting of an ectodermic covering and
 an endodermic core, the two being nearly everywhere separated by a

1878.]                Prof. Pedler on Cobra Poison.                    17
thin layer of the jelly-like mesoderm.      The ectodermic covering con
sists, except over the free end where the cells are simple and flattened,
of long columnar, ciliated cells, the fixed ends branching into delicate
fibres, which form a stratum underneath, the epithelium.       A similar
condition of the ectoderm is described as met with in two depressions
of the surface, one being situate above, and the other below, the litho
cyst ; and the resemblance which the elongated epithelium cells with
the subjacent granular-looking, but in reality fibrous stratum, exhibits
to the developing central nervous structures in the vertebrate embryo
is pointed out.      These parts, in fact, probably represent the first
beginnings phylogenetically — of a central nervous system.
             —                                                   Some of
the cells of the ectodermic covering of the lithocyst are pigmented,
and these cells are provided each with an excessively long and fine
(sensorial) filament instead of -with vibratile cilia.
    The endodermic core of the lithocyst consists of a prolongation from
the nutritive canal of the margin, which at the terminal part of the
lithocyst is continued as a solid projection, the cells of which contain
calcareous crystals or otoliths.
    A small lithocyst is further described, in which the otolithic pro
longation of the nutritive canal penetrated the ectodermic covering,
and projected freely into the surrounding medium.

system of Geryonia and Cunina, and to a recently published preliminary
 notice by Oscar and Richard Hertwig, of the structure of the nerve-
 tracts and sense-organs in various other genera of Medusas.

     On my arrival in India my attention was strongly directed to the
  enormous number of deaths, annually resulting from the bites of
  poisonous snakes.     Statistics of the deaths from such causes are

 collected   by the various Provincial Governments of India, but as
 might    be expected    the difficulty of obtaining correct returns is very
 great, and it is certain that the number registered is far short of the
 real mortality resulting from this cause. Even with such incorrect
 returns, however, as many as 11,416 deaths in India from the bites of
 poisonous snakes were reported during a single year,* and it is pro
 bably within the mark to say that in the whole of India the annual
 number of deaths from snake bite is not less than 15,000.
     Experiments without number have been made with a view to dis
 cover an antidote for snake virus ; but although many so-called reme
 dies have been reported, it has been found on closer examination, that
 none of them have been of the slightest efficacy either in modifying
 the action of the poison, or in any way tending to save life.               The
 nearest approach to success among these unsuccessful remedies appears
 to have been the system of artificial respiration, suggested by Sir J.
 Fayrer, and extensively experimented with by the Snake Poison Com
 mission at Calcutta, whose report was published in 1874,t and who
 found that, although life might be prolonged by the use of artificial
 respiration after poisoning by snake virus, in no case was there any
ultimate hope of saving life by this means.
    So far as I am acquainted with their results, the researches of other
chemists have been hitherto unsuccessful either in elucidating the
nature of the poison, or in ascribing any composition to the active
principle which must be present.           This want of success is the only
justification of my bringing the result of my own researches before the
Royal Society at all ; while the great practical importance of a satis
factory solution of the problem will, I hope, be accepted as my apology
for laying my work before them in its present incomplete form.
    Of all the snakes in India the cobra (Naja tripudians) is the cause
of the largest number of deaths, and the experiments here described
were all made with cobra poison, extracted from the snakes in my
own presence, by the usual method as described in published memoirs
on the subject of snake poisoning.         As may be imagined, the supply of
cobra poison which is obtainable is very small, each snake yielding
only from one to three grains of solid poison ; so that, in all my expe
riments, I have been continually hampered with the extreme difficulty
of procuring a sufficient amount of the poison to work with on a
satisfactory scale. In submitting my results to the Society, I must at
the outset state that it is possible that after further experiments       I may
have to modify some of the results here given.
   The liquid poison, which, when extracted from the cobra, has a
slightly alkaline reaction, was found to have a specific gravity of T095

at 23°    C, the experiment being made on the average poison collected
from     16   snakes on November 26th, 1874.             Whether evaporated in
dry air, or in vacuo, or at 100° C, the fresh poison gave nearly the
same amount of solid residue, the mean quantity being 28 28 per cent.,
the poison       extracted    from one batch of snakes in the rainy season
 (July) giving       27' 74 per    cent., and the poison from 16 snakes on
November 24th, after the cessation of the rains, giving 28 82 per cent.
    As these samples were taken the first during the hot and moist
rainy season, when these snakes are most active, and yield the largest
 quantity of poison, and the second during the cold season, when they
are very sluggish, and yield only small quantities of virus, it may be
hypothesised that throughout the year there is very little change in
the actual amount of solid present in the liquid poison shed by the
cobra.
    I  have tested the fresh liquid poison with polarized light, but found
that it was optically inactive.
     With reference to the action of time on cobra virus, my own conclu
 sions do not altogether agree with results previously obtained ; thus, in
the report of the Snake Commission above referred to, it is stated that
 the poison undergoes no change by being kept               ; but, from my expe-
 perience,    I have found, that although the poison        will not alter if kept
 for two or three months only, yet if it be kept for a year or eighteen
 months, it alters in its properties very materially, becoming insoluble,
and indeed losing to a considerable extent its poisonous action.                In
fact,   I  gradually collected a considerable quantity of the poison, with
 a view to experiment on a larger scale ; but, on commencing work, I
 found the poison almost inert, and perfectly valueless for any scientific
investigation on the subject, and in this way lost much time, and a
very considerable amount of material extremely difficult to procure or
replace.
    The poison dried in vacuo over sulphuric acid was analysed, and the
mean result was found to be : —

    The composition of crude cobra poison then approaches rather
 closely to the known composition of the various kinds of albumin, but
 the amount of nitrogen in the virus is rather in excess of that con
 tained in egg albumin.
    On testing the cobra poison qualitatively,        I  found that it contained
 a considerable proportion of a substance which gave all the tests of
 ordinary animal albumin,* and the amount of this substance was
 estimated by precipitation with strong alcohol, 0'5403 gram of fresh
 cobra virus treated in this way gave -0935 gram dry albumin, and
 '0584 gram of a substance, which was gummy and amorphous in
 appearance.     The albumin on testing was found to be slightly poison
 ous, and from its physiological action I concluded that it could not
 contain more than from one-fiftieth to one- hundredth part its weight of
 the poisonous principle.      The portion soluble in alcohol was excessively
 poisonous.     It appears,   then,   that in the poison obtained from the
 cobra there is about 17-3 per     cent,   of albuminous matter, and 10-9 per
 cent, of poisonous matter only, or that about 60 per cent, of the solid
 cobra poison is of an albuminous nature, and only 40 per cent, at the
 most is pure poison.      I have endeavoured, by the use of solvents, both
chemical and mechanical, to separate out some crystallizable principle
from the poison ; but although I have used a great variety of liquids,
I   have not yet succeeded in obtaining anything but indications of
crystallizable matter, and I have now given up all hope of separating
any distinct principle from the poison by this method. Diab/sis through
parchment paper was tried, in the hope of separating some principle,
and about half a gram of the solid poison, dissolved in water, was
allowed to dialyse for five days ; at the end of that time the liquid from
the interior of the dialyser, when evaporated, gave an amorphous
gummy mass, which had all the physiological properties of cobra
poison ; the liquid, outside the dialyser, when evaporated, gave a
residue the greatest part of which was like gum, but a few apparent,
crystals could be detected.       This was tested physiologically, and was,
if anything, rather more poisonous than the ordinary virus, and I was,
    * Dr. Armstrong
                     (Proc. Roy. Soc., xxi, 863) had already noticed that the liquid
poison when kept contains albuminous matter, but the poison that he examined had
already begun to uudergo decomposition. The chemical composition of the poison,
as determined by Dr. Armstrong, Bhows a much smaller proportion of carbon and
nitrogen than that found by me in the fresh poison. As       I  hare mentioned, the
poison does not keep well either   as  a liquid or a solid, hence the disagreement
of the results.

therefore, unable       to obtain any       satisfactory   result by the aid of
 dialysis.
    I have satisfied myself by numerous experiments that the reported
 remedy for snake bite, ammonia, has no action chemically upon the
 poison, but that, if anything, the addition of this substance to the
 poison before hypodermic injection rather increases the rapidity of the
action of the poison, and in no instance does it induce any modification
 of the poisonous action.
    Whilst experimenting with the poison, it struck me that it was pos
 sible that, as in the case of many organic poisons, the nitrogen might
 be in the triad condition, and that it might be possible to modify the
 poison by the action of ethylic iodide or other substances, as has been
 done in the case of some alkaloids.           Ethylic iodide was digested with
 the poison, and the residue, which had iucreased in weight, when phy
 siologically tested, was found to be very much less active than usual,
 although still poisonous     ;  the sample    taking about five times as long
 to  kill as fresh cobra poison.      Another sample of poison was treated
 with hydrochloric acid, and evaporated spontaneously, and the residue
 was very much less active than ordinary poison, and I have found that
 even the addition of a small quantity of this acid to a solution of the
 poison before injection materially retards the poisonous action ; for a
 quantity (3 milligrams) of poison, which under ordinary circumstances
 would kill a chicken in about half-an-hour or forty minutes, after the
 addition of 0 '2 c.c. of "hydrochloric acid took 1 hour 6 minutes to pro
 duce the same effect.          The poison treated with hydrochloric acid,
 when evaporated very slowly in vacuo, shows distinct traces of crystals ;
 but there still remains a large quantity of amorphous soluble matter,
 from which, when working on a small scale, as from the nature of the
subject    I was obliged to do, the crystals cannot be separated.
    As hydrochloric acid has some apparent chemical action on cobra
poison, I tried the effect of a number of chemical compounds on this
substance, and by a natural sequence of ideas, having found that
hydrochloric acid had a tendency to act in the required direction,
amongst them        I  employed platinum tetrachloride,           and found that
this yielded excellent results, and gave indications of what might              be
 called a chemical antidote.
    The following is      a typical experiment.        A quantity of fresh cobra
poison    was  precipitated  with   alcohol,  and  the  precipitate of albuminous
matter well washed, then dissolved and tested, and found to have very
slight poisonous action only, the alcoholic filtrate was then acidified
with hydrochloric acid, and a solution of platinum tetrachloride added,
when a small quantity of a yellow amorphous precipitate was formed ;
the solution on evaporation in vacuo yielded a semi-crystalline residue,
from which the excess of the platinum salt was removed by washing
with dilute alcohol; O'l gram of the solid platinum compound, which

appeared to be very insoluble in water, was administered internally to
a chicken, and had no poisonous action ; and the solution containing
the excess of platinum salt when injected into a chicken had no action
whatever.
   Here, then, was a case in which, apparently, the poisonous action
of the virus had been destroyed or neutralized, for the albuminous
precipitate certainly did not contain more than from one-fiftieth to
one-hundredth part of its weight of poisonous material.
   I have endeavoured to obtain a sufficient quantity of the poison to
give me enough of the platinum compound for the determination of
its composition, but up to the present time I have only succeeded
in making one complete analysis ; the numbers which I have obtained
are as follows   : —
    •2,r>83  gram    of platinum        compound     yielded    -3065     gram C02,
¦0996 gram H30 and '0418 gram platinum.                 From this it follows that
C = 33-42 per cent., H = 4 28 per cent., Pt. = 1618 per cent. Also
'0946 gram platinum compound yielded '1462 gram ammonia plati
num chloride, therefore, N = 9'69 pur cent.                Unfortunately, I have
been unable to determine the amount of chlorine, but if the com
pound has the ordinary composition of Cl6 for Pt., the amount of
chlorine present would be 17-42 per cent., and we should thus get: —

   Judging from such insufficient data, it would be impossible to assign
with certainty any formula to this compound.                  It will be seen that
I have appended the percentage composition calculated for PtCl4
(CnH^NiOvHC^j ; but, of course, I do not imagine that I have as
certained the true formula of the poisonous principle ; I merely throw
it out as a suggestion that its composition may be something near
C^HosNjO,, or the double of this.
   From the experiment described above, it will be seen that the addi
tion of the solution of platinum tetrachloride caused a marked change
in the physiological action of the poison ; and it should be borne in
mind, that my main object in these experiments was the discovery of
          •

an antidote         (if possible) rather than the solution of the purely chemical
 question.
    The experiments which I have made to investigate the physiological
 portion of the subject, naturally divide themselves into three distinct
 series : the first, in testing the action of graduated doses of the pare
 fresh poison hypodermically injected into animals ; the second, in the
 injection of cobra virus mixed with dilute aqueous solution of plati
 num tetrachloride ; and the third, in the action of the platinum salt
 on animals previously poisoned by fatal doses of the virus.
    In my preliminary experiments, I assured myself that fresh cobra
 poison mixed directly with a small quantity of solution of platinum
 tetrachloride almost entirely loses its poisonous properties.                     In order
 to investigate this thoroughly, I selected chickens as good subjects to
 work on, and first ascertained the action of pure fresh cobra poison in
 various quantities, hypodermically injected, on these animals.                         The
 summary         of  the  results   which   I obtained   are  shown    in  Table  A, whilst
 the details of the experiment are described in an Appendix* which
 contains the description of most of the more important physiological
 experiments made during this investigation.

                                                      insensible for 12 hours.
    From this table, it appears that a quantity of                     milligram of pure
dry   cobra      poison    is sufficient  to  kill with   certainty   a  healthy chicken,
while 2V of a milligram, when injected, produced such an effect, that
for twelve hours the life of the chicken was despaired of ; in larger
doses the action of the poison is proportionately more rapid, until with
a few milligrams death results within a few minutes.
    A second series of experiments was then tried, by taking solutions
of weighed quantities of the same sample of cobra poison as was used
in the first series, mixing with known weights of platinum tetrachlo
ride, and injecting. The experiments are subdivided into two classes,
according to slight variations in the method of working ; in some

cases   the mixture of the poison and platinum salt was allowed to
stand  for  a short time previous to the injection ; and, in the remainder,
the injection was performed a few seconds after the platinum solution
had been added to the poison.               The results are shown in Table B,

with the injection performed a short time after the mixture was made ;

    The first section of this table shows that almost any quantity, how
 ever large, of cobra poison mixed with the platinum salt, may be
 injected into chickens without producing any poisonous action ; in the
 fourth experiment, for instance, enough poison to kill 120 chickens
 was injected into one chicken, and although the animal became drowsy
 and was evidently much upset by the injection of a large volume of
 liquid, the symptoms which were developed were not those of cobra
 poison, and the animal in the course of a day or two recovered its
 usual health and strength.            In the case of No. 5, Table B, enough
 poison to kill 150 chickens was injected, and death resulted in fifteen
 hours ; but the death apparently resulted from the effect of the shock
 to the system of the chicken, caused by the injection of such a large
 volume of liquid as was necessary.                The same remark also applies to

 1878.]                   Prof. Pedler on Cobra Poison.                            25
 Experiment 6, where enough poison to kill 225 chickens was injected,
 and death resulted from the setting in of diarrhoea, and from the
 subsequent exhaustion, in 50 hours 6 minutes after the performance of
 the hypodermic injection.           In the experiments of injecting the mixture
 of the cobra poison and solution of platinum tetrachloride immediately
 after it was made, the results are not quite so satisfactory, but they
 still show that large quantities of poison (enough to kill 180 chickens
 being used in Experiment No. 1) may be injected, and that the fatal
 result does not take place until after the expiration of a period very
 much longer, as a rule, than would be the case without the use of the
 platinum salt. I have not thought it worth while to experiment with
 small quantities of poison in this manner, as the result of the first
 section conclusively shows that, if the platinum salt has time allowed
 to act upon the poison, the poisonous action of the virus is entirely
 destroyed.       Before finally accepting this conclusion, I thought it
 advisable to try a similar set of experiments on other animals, such
 as dogs ; and, as will be seen below, the experiments which have been
 performed have entirely borne out the conclusion above arrived at.
    In the report of the Snake Poison Commission already referred to,
a number of experiments have been made on the action upon dogs of
graduated doses of cobra virus, and in the following table will be
found a summary of the principal results : — ¦

   From this table it appears that from a quarter of a grain (-0162
gram) to a sixth of a grain may be looked on as a fatal dose to an
ordinary sized dog, while any quantities larger than this will produce
a very rapidly fatal effect.

as before,  I  used weighed quantities of the dried fresh poison dissolved
in water,     and added known quantities of a standard solution of
platinum tetrachloride ; the results of these injections into dogs are
shown in the table below, and in no instance did they show the slightest
indication of any physiological action whatever.            These animals were

    If  we accept the conclusion        that £ grain of cobra poison hypoder-
mically injected will kill       a dog   under ordinary circumstances, in the
three experiments under notice the quantities of cobra poison used
were sufficient to kill three, six, and eighteen dogs respectively ; and yet
in no case did the dog show the slightest indication of cobra poisoning.
I have not tried larger quantities than three grains of poison, as the
volume of liquid which has then to be injected becomes inconveniently
large ; even in Experiment No. 3 in Table D no less than four or five
separate hypodermic injections had to be made, to the great incon
venience of the dog experimented upon.                 From these results I think
it may safely be said, that the compound which cobra poison produces
 when brought into contact with an aqueous and dilute (5 per cent.)
 solution of platinum tetrachloride is quite inert and physiologically
 inactive, though of course it does not follow that this substance can
 be used as an antidote in cases of snake poisoning.                    I
                                                                     If may be
 allowed the expression, platinum tetrachloride appears to be a chemical
 antidote to cobra virus, but whether it will be found to be a physio
 logical antidote can only be settled by extensive researches.
     Next, then, with a view to ascertain tentatively whether platinum
 tetrachloride can be used as an antidote, in the ordinary sense of the
 word, to snake poisoning, I have tried two sets of experiments de
 scribed below. The results which I have obtained from this third series
 of experiments, although interesting and to a certain extent hopeful
 in their nature, have not, I am sorry to say, iu any case shown that
 life can be saved by this means. As a preliminary step in the eluci
  dation of this very important question, I have made some experiments
  on fowls and dogs by first hypodermically injecting known quantities
  of poison more than sufficient to kill, and after a definite interval
  injecting known quantities of the standard solution of platinum tetra
  chloride, at or near the same spot where the first injection was per

formed.       By the experiments of other investigators on tlie subject of
snake poisoning, it has been found that the rapidity of the absorption of
cobra poison is quite marvellous, and from the beginning clearly saw   I
that this would be the cause from which in all probability all experi
ments for the discovery of a true antidote would fail. So far as                  I
could ascertain the non-success of the experiments about to be de
scribed appeared to be due to this cause ; I first experimented upon
chickens in the manner described above, and found that in two cases
 out of three life was prolonged to a very considerable extent, but               I
did not succeed in preventing death.

 kill in about an hour and         a half, but in the experiment in question it
 killed in one hour and five minutes. This showed me a defect in my mode
 of working, in fact by injecting the platinum solution into the same
 orifice as the poison, and to about the same depth beneath the skin, I
 had merely driven the poison along before the second solution, and
 thus diffused it more rapidly through the system, naturally causing
 death to result in a shorter time than would have otherwise been the
 case.    I should here mention that the same remark applies to some of
 the experiments I made on dogs described in the next table.                     In
 Experiment No. 3 in Table E, the amount of poison injected into the
 chicken was enough to kill three or four chickens, and would under
 ordinary circumstances have killed in from an hour and a half to one
 hour and forty minutes.            In this case to avoid the defect in Experi
 ment No. 2, the platinum solution was injected rather deeper than the
 poison, and the result was that the animal lived for eleven hours forty-
 seven minutes, or more than seven times as long as would have been
 the case had no platinum salt been injected.                 This was of coarse
 encouraging, and seemed to promise that the platinum salt would in
 certain circumstances       be useful.     The experiments made on dogs are

     The platinum salt does not in these instances appear to have been as
  efficacious as in the experiments on chickens, and as previously men
  tioned I believe that the want of success was owing to the rapidity
'
  with which the poison is absorbed and diffused through the system,
  preventing any chance of the platinum salt coming in contact with the
  virus.     This must prove a serious obstacle to the efficacy of any
  remedy.       I confess that from my own experience of the rapidity of
  the absorption of this poison,           I  have considerable doubt as to the
  possibility    of an  antidote   to  snake  poison ever being discovered, for in
  a few seconds after the actual bite of a snake the poison is absorbed
  by the blood, and carried by it to all parts of the system, and thus the
  task of overcoming or neutralizing the virus is rendered extremely
  difficult if not practically impossible.
     In making the experiments described in the last two tables, I have
  been seriously hampered with the want of knowledge as to the physio
  logical action of platinum salts in general, and of the platinum tetra
  chloride in particular ; and although            I  have searched through every
  available authority, I have been unable to find any results hearing
  however slightly on this subject.           To work out the problem before us,
  we must begin with selecting suitable living subjects for experiment.
  We must then ascertain what is the physiological action upon these
  animals of the platinum salt and of the cobra poison separately, both
  when administered           internally and when injected hypodermically.
  Having settled these preliminary questions, we must proceed to test
  the applicability of the platinum salt as an antidote to the cobra virus
  by injecting hypodermically into similar subjects the smallest dose,
  which our preliminary experiments have shown to be fatal, and sub
  sequently administering the platinum salt in various ways.
     As my own physiological knowledge and surgical skill ate very
  slight, I have asked Dr. E. Lawrie to join in the investigation above
  sketched out, and we have already commenced our experiments, the

results of which we hope to submit to the Society in a subsequent
communication.
    I do not, of course, lay any claim to have discovered an antidote (in
the true sense of the word) to cobra poison, but I think that the experi
ments ahove described prove the inertness of the platinum compound
of cobra virus, and that this may be deemed a sufficient ground for
making more extensive researches on this subject. Nor do I at present
venture to make any practical suggestions in connexion with the above
facts as to the treatment of cases of snake bite, for until we are
acquainted with the physiological action of platinum compounds this
would be premature.       The responsibility of recommending any change
in the recognized methods of treatment would be very great, and it
would be worse than rashness to deal with a subject of such vital
importance without having a thorough knowledge of the effects likely
to be produced by our actions.
    Before concluding my paper I must tender my thanks to Mr. R. H.
Wilson, C.S., officiating magistrate of the 24 Pergunnas, for kindly
assisting me in procuring live cobras for the extraction of the poison,
and to my assistant, Balm Poolin Bohary Saor, for much aid rendered
during the progress of a work not always pleasant to the feelings, and

 II. "On      Repulsion resulting from Radiation. Part V." By
        William Crookes, F.R.S., V.P.C.S. Received December 3,
        1877.
                                 (Abstract.)
    This paper commences with an experimental         investigation of the
amount of repulsion produced by radiation on disks of various kinds,
 and coated with different substances.      The torsion apparatus for this
 purpose consists of a straw beam, suspended by a fine gl^ss torsion
 fibre.   At one end of the beam is a rod hanging downwards, and
capable of taking six experimental disks in a vertical row. The other
 end of the beam is furnished with a pan and adjustible weights, to
 balance the varying weights of the disks submitted to radiation.        A
 standard candle, at a fixed distance from the disks, supplies the radia
 tion, and the amount of movement under its influence is measured by a
 ray of light reflected from a mirror on the beam to a graduated scale.
 An appropriate arrangement of screens enables any selected disk to be
 experimented on without the others being affected, and a standard
 lampblacked disk being always present, the results are capable of
 intercomparison. The beam, torsion fibre, disks &c, are sealed up in
glass, and the whole apparatus is attached to a mercury pump, capable
 of carrying the exhaustion to any desired point.

30                    Mr. W. Crookes       on Repulsion             [Jan. 17,
   The experimental powders are mostly chemical precipitates, laid on
the surface of mica or pith disks as a water paint, no cement being
nsed to promote adhesion.         In other cases the substances are pnnched,
cut, of filed into the shape of disks, 17"25 millims. in diameter.
   The exhaustion, which has to be effected after each change of the
experimental disks, is carefully brought to the same degree both by
actual measurement on a McLeod gauge, and by getting the same re
pulsion on the standard         black disk. In this way all the different
results are fairly comparable one with the other.             The presence of
aqueous vapour      must  be   specially guarded against by means of tubes
containing phosphoric anhydride.
   The effect of residual gas in tending to equalise the amount of
repulsion on variously coloured surfaces is shown in an experiment
with pith disks, one being lampblacked and the other retaining its
natural white snrface, the standard candle being at the same distance
in each case. When the exhaustion is good enough to cause a fair
repulsion, the ratio between the amplitude of swing (measured by the
index ray) when the black is exposed and that when the white is
exposed is as 100 : 55'5 ; at a little higher exhaustion the ratio is —
                    Black    :   White    : :  100   : 42'5  ;
at a still bettor exhaustion (at which the experiments are usually tried)
the ratio is — ¦
                    Black    :   White    : :  100   :  35.
   The results of the quantitative examination of the repulsion resulting
from radiation when falling on about 100 different substances are given
in fourteen tables. Each table is in three columns, the first consisting
of the names of the substances experimented on ; the second the
amount of repulsion observed, reduced to the standard of 100 for
lampblack ; the third column gives the repulsion observed when a
water screen is interposed, reduced to the same standard.
   Table I gives the results of the examination of black powders.       Com
pared with lampblack = 100, these have an average value of 92'2,
which becomes 99-l by the interposition of water.
   Table   II  contains white powders.        These have an average value
of 33'5, which is reduced to 8'3 behind water.              The powerful ab
sorption for the invisible heat rays which white powders exercise is
somewhat remarkable.           Assuming that the nltra-red rays from a
candle are almost entirely cut off by a water screen, the comparatively
strong action (33"5) produced by the naked flame must be mainly due
to the absorption of the invisible heat rays ; and when these are cut off
by water the action is diminished nearly fifty times. With black
powders the water only diminishes the action about eleven times.
   Table    III  gives the red powders.         Amongst these precipitated
selenium is noteworthy. To the naked flame its value is 35'8, but

1878.]                resulting from Radiation.                       31
¦when a 'water screen is interposed the action becomes 69'5, in com
parison with standard lampblack = 100. Omitting selenium, the mean
action on red powders without a water screen is 32-2, and with a water
screen, 24"9.
   Table IV gives the brown powders.        Amongst these, peroxide of
thallium is remarkable as being repelled under the influence of radia
tion to a greater extent than any other body hitherto examined, its
value being 121-7, in comparison to lampblack = 100. Brown powders
behave most like black, the averages of the columns without and with a
water screen being 92-7 and 94"5.
   Table V gives the yellow powders. Among these anhydrous tungstic
acid resembles scarlet selenium in its anomalous action, the figures
being without water 50'8 and with water 72'2. The averages of the
other yellow powders are 35"7 and (behind water) 13-8.
   Table VI gives green powders.       These show some discrepancies,
which will be referred to farther on.
   Table  VII   gives the blue powders.      The action on these is of
interest, as showing a much stronger proportionate action behind a
water screen than with no screen, the averages being 5o-8 and 65     '2.
   Table VIII  gives the action on dyes and colouring matters of organic
origin. Among these may be noticed saffranin, and a product of the
decomposition of chlorophyll, which act differently to the others.
   Table IX gives the action on metals prepared in different ways and
coated with lampblack, mica, &c. Curious results are shown with iron
and with gold, the former metal chiefly absorbing the invisible heat
rays, whilst the latter metal is  principally acted on by the luminous
rays.
   Tables X and Xa give the results of an examination of various
silver salts in their sensitive and non-sensitive state to light. The
chloride, bromide, and iodide of silver, in their different states, are
exposed to the standard candle after being submitted to the action of
magnesium light, sunlight, and daylight.          The results show how
readily  a change  in the  state of the surface
                                             is  detected by an increased
amount of repulsion under the influence of radiation.
   Table XI gives the results of an examination of selenium disks.
These are of two kinds, the vitreous and the crystalline.     The latter   is
in the state  most  sensitive to light action.  With the crystalline disk
results have been obtained which seem to show that the impact of
light on its surface produces a superficial disturbance there and in the
adjacent gaseous molecules, which takes some time to subside. This
is connected with the change in electric conducting power of crystal
line selenium — change which, when the element
                a                                    is  transferred from
light to darkness, takes some time to subside.
   Table XII gives the results of the action of radiation on various
substances   which do not come under any of the foregoing headings,

 32                 Mr. W. Crookes on Repulsion                    [Jan.  17,
such as pith, mica, charcoal, glass.      The complicated nature of these
actions is well shown in the results given by three pith disks, the first
being plain white, the second lampblacked on the front, and the third
lampblacked on the back.       The first is repelled with a power of 17'7,
the second (the standard) with a power of 100, whilst the third is not
moved at all.    The repulsion exerted on the white surface must be the
same in each case, but the pressure of lampblack behind the pith
causes a radiation of heat from the back surface, which produces
molecular pressure just sufficient to neutralise the pressure in front.
    Experiments are shown in this table with mica, both plain and
roasted, and covered on one side or the other with lampblack.            The
results cannot well be described in abstract.
    To show that physical condition has more effect in causing repulsion
than chemical composition, results are given with various kinds of
charcoal.    It is shown that the repulsion suffered by cocoa-nut shell
charcoal is much less than that by white pith, being only 11"6 against
17"7.    At the same time, a radiometer made of cocoa-nut shell char
coal, lampblacked on one side, is only moderately sensitive, instead of
being superior to one made of pith lampblacked on one side.              The
low figure shown by the charcoal       is  caused by its density enabling it
to conduct heat from one surface to the other.        Molecular pressure is,
therefore, generated on both the back and front surfaces, and the
figure given is simply the difference between the two opposing
actions.    Experiments show that this explanation is correct.
   Besides water, other screens are used to filter the radiation of the
candle before it falls on the disks.       Water is, however, preferred for
several reasons.    It is almost perfectly opaque to the invisible heat
rays, and, therefore, its employment allows easy discrimination be
tween actions    due to heat and to heat and     light combined  ; secondly,
it is colourless, and having no selective action on any visible ray of
light, it can be used in conjunction with any coloured powder without
complicating the results.      Alum acts in a similar manner to water ;
coloured solutions act as water with a superadded action due to their
colour.    Very thick plates of glass have less action on the invisible
heat rays than a thin layer of water.        Sulphate of copper in so weak
a solution as to appear only slightly green, has a very strong action
when artificial light is used, as it cuts off the lowest visible red rays
as well as the ultra red.
   After having given the tabulated results of the examination and dis
cussed the different actions, the author finds that the substances ex
perimented on may be divided into two classes.
   1. In which the repulsion behind water is greater in proportion to
the standard than when no screen is present ; and 2, in which the
repulsion in proportion to the standard is less behind water than when
no screen is present.      Amongst class 1 may be mentioned copper

tungstate, saffranin, scarlet selenium, and copper oxalate ; these are
more affected by light than by invisible heat.      Amongst class 2
may be mentioned    pale green chromic oxide, persulphocyanogen,
hydrated zinc oxide, barium sulphate, and calcium carbonate ; these
substances   are    more    acted on by the ultra red        rays    than    by the
luminous rays.
   From the results given in these tables, the author has been led to
the construction of several radiometers which afford ocular proof of
the general correctness of the indications given by the water screen.
Thus, a radiometer made of pith disks coated on alternate sides with
chromic oxide and precipitated selenium, moves in one direction to
the naked flame of a candle and in the other direction when a water
screen is interposed.      A similar radiometer coated with saifranin
and hydrated zinc oxide does not move at all when exposed to the
naked flame, but revolves when a water screen is interposed.            A
radiometer coated with thallic oxide and Magnus's green platinum
salt moves strongly when no screen is interposed, but is stopped by a
water screen.     Many other instruments having similar behaviour to
the above are     described, and their actions discussed and explained.
The following experiment is given ; a pith radiometer, coated with pre
cipitated selenium and chromic oxide, is exposed to the radiation from
a colourless gas flame from a Bunsen burner, coloured intensely green
by thallium.    To the eye, by this light, the chromic oxide looks nearly
white and the scarlet selenium black.           The rotation due to the
superior repulsion of the chromic oxide           is,
                                                  however, apparently as
strong as when the non-luminous flame         used.
                                             is      This       proof that
                                                                is   a
the train of reasoning the author has employed on former occasions               is
correct, viz., that certain substances have an absorptive action on rays
of dark heat opposite to what they have on light, and that an optically
white body may be thermically black, and vice versa.            Here, for
instance, chromic oxide          optically green and thermically black,
                                  is
whilst scarlet selenium      thermically white.

    The author next examines the amonnt of repulsion produced when
 polarised light    allowed to fall on a plate of tourmaline suspended in
                   is
 vacuo in a torsion balance.    It was considered possible that the repul
 sion might vary according to the plane of polarisation of the incident
ray. Three separate sets of experiments are given in detail, and the
results discussed     the final decision being that the special action
                        ;
originally thought possible does not exist in a degree appreciable with
the present experimental means.

                                       is
action of radiation on radiometers, the vanes of which consist of
metallic plates, either bright on both sides or blacked on one side, and

i.e. the black side is repelled.     If   one of the outer corners of each
plate is turned up at an angle of 45°, so as to keep the blacked surface
on the concave side, the positive rotation is either diminished, stopped,
or converted into negative rotation, according to the amount of surface
of the plate which has been turned up.
    When the plates are kept flat, but the supporting arms are bent so
as to present more of one side than of the other to the bulb, as shown

of the arrows, even when there is no difference between one surface
and the other.       It is shown that the favourable presentation of the
surface of the vanes to the inside of the bulb has more influence on the
movement than has the colour of the surface.               Experiments are
 described with radiometers of the form shown in fig. 1, and made of
thick and thin mica, pith, aluminium bright on both sides, and alumi
nium blacked on one side. The action of light and of dark heat is
given.     The negative rotation set up in the fly when it is cooling from
a high temperature, and the anomalous behaviour of the " favourably
             " radiometers when immersed in hot air or hot water, are
presented
examined.      It is found that when a hot metal ring is applied to the
equator of the bulb, the direction of rotation is always positive ; and
that when a hot ring of a smaller diameter is applied to the top or
bottom of the bulb the direction of rotation is always negative.          The
direction of movement when the hot rings are removed and the fly is
cooling is positive with the aluminium vanes, and negative with the
thin mica and pith vanes.
    The positive rotation, when the bulb is heated equatorially, is inde
pendent of the material of which the fly is made.        It is caused by the
hot ring of glass generating molecular pressure, which radiates towards
the centre, and strikes the sloping vanes, driving them round as if a
wind were blowing on them. The other movements of these " favour

ably presented         radiometers are explained in the paper, but it is
difficult to reproduce the explanations in abstract without the aid of

   vanes, the  author describes experiments with metal and other cones,
   cylinders, and cups. An abstract of some of these results was given in
  the Proceedings of the Royal Society for November 16, 187t>, No. 175,

  page 313, but it was stated that the
  seemed incapable of accounting for some of the movements there
  observed.     Further experiments have now cleared up this difficulty,
  and all the various movements are now seen to agree with this theory.
  The movement which appeared most anomalous was the attraction
  observed when a candle was allowed to shine on the hollow side of
  a cone or cup-vaned       radiometer, the light being screened off the re
 treating   side.    When   light falls on the hollow side of a cone-shaped
  vane, some is reflected and lost, but some is absorbed and is converted
  into heat of temperature.       Aluminium being a good conductor of heat,
 and the thickness of metal being insignificant, it becomes equally
  warm throughout, and a layer of molecular pressure is formed on each
 surface of the metal.       At a low exhaustion the thickness of this layer
 of pressure is not sufficient to reach from the metal cone to the side
  of the glass bulb.       As the exhaustion increases, this layer extends
 farther from the generating surface, until at a sufficiently high
  exhaustion the space between the side of the glass bulb and the ad
 jacent portion of the metallic cone is bridged over, and pressure is
 exerted between the two surfaces.         The more favourable presentation
 offered by the cone causes the pressure to be greatest between the
 glass bulb and the outside of the cone ; the vanes are, therefore,
 pressed round by a force which is really acting from behind, although
 the movement looks as if the candle were attracting them.
     A radiometer, the fly of which is furnished with four bright alumi
 nium cups, rotates in the light as well as a flat vaned instrument
 blacked on one side. Experiments are described with one of these
 instruments      attached   to the mercury pump, and the observations of
pressure and revolutions per minute under the influence of a standard
candle are tabulated and drawn as a curve, taking the rarefaction of
 the air iu millionths of an atmosphere as abscissas and the number of
revolutions a minute as ordinates.        The curve, which is traced through
the dots representing observations, shows a gradual increase in the
sensitiveness of the instrument to light, up to about 50 millionths of
an atmosphere ; then the action keeps with little variation to about
30    millionths, thence it rapidly sinks, until at about 1 millionth it
is less than -£gth. of the maximum, and at 0'2 millionth the radiometer
refuses to turn even when five candles are put near it.
    The concluding portion of the paper is devoted to an examination
of the movements produced in highly rarefied gases, when thin mica
vanes suspended horizontally, and sloping like the vanes of a windmill,
are exposed to the action of a ring of platinum, placed just below
them, and rendered incandescent by a current of electricity.             The

object has been to produce the molecular pressure by a very intense
heat which would not have to pass through glass, and to allow it to act
on vanes which are turned in the most favourable position for rotating
under the influence of the molecular pressure.     The direction is called
positive when it is the same as would be produced by a wind blowing
from the platinum wire, and negative when it takes the contrary direc
tion.   In the apparatus most experimented with a rotating disk of
mica is supported on a separate pivot, immediately over the mica
vanes.    The normal or positive movement of this disk is in the
opposite direction to that of the vanes ; thus, if the positive movement
of the vanes is in the direction of the hands of a watch, the positive
movement of the disk is in the opposite direction.
                                  Fio. 2.
    With the apparatus full of air at the normal pressure the direction
 of rotation, both of the vanes and disk, is positive when the platinum
 wire is ignited. This is probably due to the ascending current of hot
air.
    At a pressure of 80 millims. the disk does not rotate. The vanes
 rotate positively, but slowly.
    At 19 millims. no movement whatever takes place. The disk and
 vanes are as still when the wire is heated as when it is cold.
    At 14 millims. the disk remains stationary. The vanes move
slowly in the negative direction.                   •
   At 1 millim. the disk rotates in the positive direction slowly, whilst
the vanes rotate negatively rather fast; both disk and vanes now
rotate in the same direction.

   At a pressure of 706 millionths of an atmosphere the direction
keeps the same as at 1 millim. in each case, hut the speed is greater.
   At 294 millionths, the speed of the disk and vanes is exactly alike,
both rotating together in the same direction.         Up to this pressure and
at some distance beyond, the vanes have been gradually diminishing
whilst the disk has been increasing in speed. At a pressure of 141
millionths the disk rotates rapidly, positively, but the vanes do not
rotate at all. At a little higher exhaustion than the last, viz., at 12!)
millionths, a great change is observed.          The vanes, which were still,
now rotate in the positive direction at a speed of 100 revolutions
a minute, whilst the disk rotates positively as before, but with a little
diminished velocity. It is probable that some of the speed of the
disk has been quenched by the rapid movement of the vanes in the
opposite direction, as the author has previously shown* that the
viscosity of air at a rarefaction of 129 millionths of an atmosphere is
only a little less than its viscosity at the normal density, and hence
the vanes, at a speed of 100 revolutions a minute, must exert a con
siderable drag on the opposite rotation of the disk.
    As the rarefaction increases above this point, the speed of both the
disk and vanes increases, till they exceed 600 revolutions a minute.
At the highest rarefaction attained (0'4 millionth of an atmosphere),
there is no apparent diminution in speed.
    These experiments have been repeated in a more elaborate series
with an apparatus of great complexity.              It is impossible without
drawinsrs to give an idea of the various arrangements by which data
are secured, but it may be mentioned that at each pressure observa
 tions can be taken on the velocity of rotation of the disk and vanes,
 the viscosity of the residual gas, the repulsion exerted by a standard
 candle on a black mica plate, and the appearance of an inductive
 spark through a tube furnished with platinum wires.             Different gases
 can be experimented with, and a series of observations are given with
 hydrogen gas as well as with air.
    The author concludes his paper by showing that the ordinary ideas
 of a " vacuum
                   " are
                           very erroneous.      Formerly an air-pump which
 would diminish the volume of air in the receiver 1,000 times was said
 to produce a vacuum.        Later a " perfect vacuum " was said to be pro
 duced    by chemical absorption and by the Sprengel pump, the test
 being   that  electricity would not pass ; this point being reached when
 the air is rarefied 100,000 times.      According to Mr. Johnstone Stoney,
 the  number    of  molecules  in  a cubic  centimetre of air at the ordinary
 pressure is probably something like 1,000,000000,000000,000000                (one
 thousand trillions).     Now   when   this number   is divided   by  0'4  million,
 there are still left 250,000000,000000 molecules in every cubic centi-

  Whilst pursuing certain investigations upon the comparative                  his
tology of the brain, the authors of this article have been enabled to
demonstrate certain facts with regard to cortical lamination, and to
show the disposition and significance of certain elementary constituents,
the importance of which, they believe, justifies their publication.

                      Types  of Structural Lamination.
  Meynert enumerates five distinct plans, according to 'which the
various layers of the cortex are disposed, of which the more extensive
formation is his five-laminated type, which he regards as that charac
teristic of the cortex of the vault and a portion of the gyrus fornicatus.*
It is with regard to this type of structural lamination that the observa
tions now to be recorded deal ; and it is hoped that they will tend not
only to point out how errors have crept into the descriptions of some
writers, but also to reconcile conflicting opinions upon this subject.
We regard the ascending frontal convolution as affording the most
suitable representation of the typical lamination of the motor area, and
our descriptions, therefore, apply more directly to this region than to
the remaining gyri at the vertex.
   It is premised that at least one authority of note, Baillarger, differs
from Meynert in his description of this type of lamination, enumerating
the layers as six in number, whilst Meynert notices five only.
                    Typical Lamination of the Motor Area.
   The following description of the lamination of cellular elements in
the ascending frontal convolution will suffice to convey the result of
 our observations.
   First Layer. — A pale narrow band, extremely dejicate and friable, is
seen in sections to form the extreme limit of the cortical layers.       The
histological  tissues  composing  this formation  are  connective, nervous,
and vascular.      The connective does not differ essentially from that
universally present as the basis of the cortical substance. It consists of
minute fibrils, interlacing, anastomosing, and forming, by an intricate
plexiform arrangement, a dense felt-like bed, possessing great powers
of elastic distension.    In the areola betwixt these fibrils, a finely mole
cular base may be detected, which, appears greatly altered by the
employment of various reagents.         In this matrix distinct connective
cells are observed, including one or more nuclei within an investment
of most delicate protoplasm, and from which, when seen under favour
able circumstances, numerous minute branches radiate into the sur
rounding neuroglian network. In sections obtained from preparations
hardened by chromic acid two forms of cellular elements are observed :
   (o.) Cells that in diameter vary from 6/t to 9/t, the delicate proto
plasm of which is almost invariably shrunken up or destroyed by the
re-agents employed, appearing, therefore, like free nuclei, except when
examined by fresh methods of preparation.          These elements assume
the direction taken by the vessels of the cortex, and frequently are
seen in large numbers along the perivascular sheaths.

three nuclei,     and   assume   a  spheroidal or flask-like configuration         in
situ;    when,    however,   seen near the frayed-out margin of a teased
preparation, they are found to give off numerous radiating processes.
Aniline black (for which nervous elements have a great affinity) stains
their nuclei, investing protoplasm and its extensions so uniformly and
faintly, that it is with some difficulty they are recognised, complete
differentiation from the faintly-tinted matrix being scarcely attainable.
In form, reaction to staining agents, and still more as regards their
modifications by disease, they are undoubtedly proved to be connective
elements.      "VVe find occasionally    that these elements proliferate freely,
 assume the most quaint forms, and produce a dense matting of fibres.
 Such a condition, truly a sclerosis, is figured in a paper recently con
 tributed to the Royal Society by one of the authors.*                      No other
 cellular elements appear in the first layer of the cortex ; the angular
 and fusiform nerve-cells alluded to by some writers have had no
 existence in specimens we have examined by the fresh and hardened
 methods.      They are probably elements of the connective group, pos
 sibly identical with the larger nucleated bodies just described, the
 appearance of which is greatly altered by the methods of preparation
 employed.       The elements found in the first layer, therefore, are neu
 roglia corpuscles and perivascular cells. Both varieties are shown in
 the drawings accompanying this paper.               (Vide Plato 1, First Layer.)
     Second Layer. — This consists of a series of closely aggregated pyra
 midal and oval cells, of small size, whose apical processes are arranged
 radially to the surface of the cortex.           Numerous other processes arise
 from the basal angles, and radiate outwards and downwards from the
 cell, including an extensive area in their distribution.                Their mea
 surements vary from 11/* to 23/» in length, and from 6/t to 9/« in
 breadth. Their nucleus is comparatively of large size, often measuring
  4/i to 6u in diameter, sometimes assuming the pyramidal form of the
 enclosing cell, when it may attain a length of 9/t. With the exception
  of their pigmy size and extremely crowded aggregation, no differences
  are apparent between them and the larger elements of the third layer.
  (Vide Plate 1, Second Layer.)
      Third Layer. — The reddish-grey band coinciding with the second
  layer, as seen by naked-eye examination, appears abruptly marked off
  from the pale layer subjacent to it.               On microscopic examination,
  however, it is found that the line of demarcation can be only approxi
  mately obtained, as the elements of both overlap each other very
  irregularly.      The distinction between these two layers near their
  common boundary must depend upon a two-fold condition, viz., the
  gradual increase in size of the elements of the third layer and their

more distant grouping.        It will be seen      in traversing the full depth
of this layer (Plate 1, Third Layer) that the cells almost uniformly
increase in size from above downwards, yet small pyramidal bodies, no
larger than those at the commencement of the series, are found occa
sionally at all depths, side by side with the larger nerve-cells.           The
configuration of these cells is by no means uniform. They often assume
the pyriform rather than the truly pyramidal form, having their
larger basal extremity marked by numerous dentations, from whose
projecting points delicate branches are thrown ofE on all sides. Their
apical process is directed radially to the surface of the cortex, and can
be traced up into its second layer.            Each cell contains a nucleus
and a distinct nucleolus.      The basal or axis-cylinder process is rarely-
seen, as it is necessarily divided, in most cases, by the oblique direction
which it takes to reach the radiating fibres of the medulla.              These
cells vary greatly in dimensions : those in the uppermost regions of
this stratum measuring 12u by 8/t, their nucleus being 7p by
 whilst those in parts bordering upon the subjacent layer average 22/t
in length, and the largest cells even attain a size of 41/t by 23/t.
    Fourth Layer. — We have now entered upon highly debatable ground,
including the chief topic we have proposed for consideration.             Much
confusion appears to have prevailed with regard to the characters and
relationships of this and the subjacent layers.                Thus, Meynert*
describes the fourth layer as constituted of irregular angular cells,
forming a stratum immediately superincumbent on his fifth layer of
spindle-cells.   Baillarger, on the other hand, enumerates six cortical
 lawyers, of which Meynert's angular and spindle-cells form his fourth
 and sixth respectively.     After considering fully the views of various
 writers on this subject, we find ourselves unable to agree with most of
 them regarding this type of lamination.                The layer immediately
 beneath the third undoubtedly consists of angular cells which in size,
 form, and branchings are accurately described by Meynert.                 They
 resemble, on a small scale, transverse sections of large pyramidal
 cells, numerous branches being given off from all sides of the cell, and
 rarely are they seen extended radially towards the surface of the
 cortex. Now we find this stratum of angular cells intersected by a layer
 of immense ganglionic cells, which run about midway through the
stratum, and it is distinctly affirmed that these angular cells are found
freely above and below this important formation (Plate 1, Fourth Layer).
 On turning our attention more especially to these ganglionic cells,
we find that they differ very materially from any of the elements
already described.      The enormous dimensions to which they attain,
averaging 71ti in length by 35/t in breadth, stamp them as the most
notable objects in the whole depth of the cortex, whilst in special cells
the not unusual length of 126/*, shows that they occasionally rival even

  the large multipolar cells in the anterior column of the cord.                  It will
  naturally be asked how Meynert could have overlooked this important
  layer of cells.        Our explanation is, that whilst failing to regard them
 as a layer distinct from the third, yet the existence of these individual
 elements was recognised by him, as he states that the cells of the third
  layer progressively augment till they attain the length of 40^.* As
 the largest cells of the third layer, however, but rarely attain such
 dimensions, we presume that he had in view the elements to which we
 now allude, probably regarding the depth at which they were placed as
 an exceptional condition.          Bail larger, on the other hand, whilst recog
 nising the layer, has also, we think, fallen into the error of misplacing
 it in the order of cortical lamination. The error consists essentially in
 placing these cells on too low a level, in fact, between the angular and
 spindle cells, whilst the many hundred specimens examined by us
 enable us to localise this series midway down the band of angular ele
 ments, a position        maintained with singular uniformity.             Dr. Majorf
 follows Baillarger in regarding the cortex of the vault and that of the
 central lobe as consisting of six layers. MierzejewskiJ and Betz || follow
 Meynert, and refer to a five-laminated type, but the large cells of the
 cortex more particularly have been made the subject of special study
 by both writers. The position of these great cells being such as we have
 described, one of two schemes must be accepted as representing the
 normal lamination of this region.                Either the layer of angular cells
 above these great elements must be regarded as a series separate from
 those below the same, thus making the "type common to this region of
the cortex consist of seven laminae, of which the great cells referred to
constitute the fifth ; or, on the other hand, these latter cells with the
belt of angular elements above and below may be regarded as a single
layer, and termed the mixed or ganglionic series.                   W e incline to the
latter as the preferable arrangement, for, apart from the consideration
that the former plan introduces an unnecessary multiplication of the
series of layers, there remains the important fact that the series of
large cells alluded to is not a constant layer.             Indeed, there are exten
sive portions even of the ascending frontal gyrus when these elements
are wholly absent.
     At these sites the angular elements present the appearance of a single
undivided belt. We are thus compelled to regard this remarkable
layer of cells as an intercalated series, and regard it as preferable still
to adhere to Moynert's five-laminated type, assuming the fourth layer
(which we term the ganglionic layer) to be subject to the modification
above alluded to.          Far more important considerations,           however, than

  a character     as to warrant us considering them apart, after having com

  examination of the deepest stratum.
      Fifth Layer. — This series consists of fusiform or spindle-shaped cells,
  arranged in columns by the interposition of bands of medullary fibres.
  (Plate 1, Fifth Layer). They average in size 25/t by 9/t, the largest
  attaining the dimensions of 32ii by 13/<. Their nuclei are almost
  invariably oval, and measure from 11/t to 13** in length by 6/t to 9/i
  in breadth. As remarked by Meynert,* these cells are not strictly
  bi- polar, as a large proportion throw off several branches, whilst a very
  frequent form gives off a lateral branch from the projecting side of the
  cell midway between either extremity (Plate 1, Fifth Layer).                        These
  cells are arranged in columns as above stated, their long axis lying in
 the plane of the intervening medullary fibres, but along the base of a
 sulcus their long axis lies horizontally to the surface of the cortex,
 suggesting the belief that they belong to the connecting or arcuate
 system.       An extensive series of observations was made with the object
 of calculating the varying number of cells in the third and fifth layers
 at different points along the ascending frontal convolution, and it was
 found that the average number of pyramidal cells in the quarter-inch
 fieldf was fifty-seven, the average number of spindle cells was forty.
 The extremes were respectively thirty-three to ninety-nine, and twenty-
 one to seventy-three.            Although at some sites, therefore, the propor
 tion may increase to three times what it is at other sites, no relation
 ship could be traced between these variations and the alternating
 thickness and dense groupings of cells in the remaining layers. For
 convenience of reference we subjoin a table of measurements of the
 cells of the different layers of the cortex in the ascending frontal

                    Ganglionic  Cells of the Fourth Layer.
   Three years ago Professor Betz* published the results of a series of
observations which had for their object the more accurate description
quantitatively and qualitatively of the histological elements of the
cortex.    His results were of much interest and importance.         Professor
Betz terms these great cells        " giant pyramids," and gives a short
account of their anatomical distribution in man and the higher apes.
The important conclusion arrived at by Betz was that the "giant
pyramids," in their form and distribution, have the significance of
motor cells. We have thought it highly desirable to make a critical
examination of the relationship which these ganglionic cells bear to
the extensive area defined as the motor area by Ferrier. We shall con
sider these cells under the four heads of Form, Size, Processes, and
Distribution.
   1st. Form. This is very variable, as may be seen by reference
to Plate 2.     The pyramidal form is frequent, whilst a plump body
elongated    towards    either pole approaching      in contour somewhat
the fusiform character is very typical of these cells.             The truly
fusiform, or bi-polar cell, is more rarely met with except in the region
of the first frontal convolution. The cell itself is devoid of a cell-
membrane, and its protoplasmic contents extend for some distance into
the very numerous branches arising from it. To this may be attributed
the great irregularity in marginal conformation, for the more numerous
the branches arising from a cell the more irregular will its outline be.
No other nervous elements in the cerebral cortex assume such fantastic
outlines, or give rise to so many branching processes.            Considering
their dimensions and their numerous connections, we may be justified
in regarding them as among the most highly integrated anatomical
units in the cerebrum.         Each cell contains a large round or oval
nucleus enclosing a nucleolus.       They are peculiarly prone to pigmenta
tion — patches of pigment being found in the protoplasm            of most of
these cells as a constant and normal constituent, just as it is found
universally present in the multipolar cells of the cord.         Their imme
diate environments have been already considered in a paper alluded to
above ("Relationships of the Nerve-cells to the Lymphatic System").
   2nd. Size. The measurement of a large number of these cells from
the same site in the ascending frontal convolution gave us an average
length of 60/4 — an average diameter of 25/4, the extremes being 30/4
and 96fi for length, 12/» and 45/4 for breadth.     Taking, however, a very
large selection of cells from various points of this convolution the
average length was 71fi, the average width was 35/4, the extremes
varying from 36/4 to 126/4 for length, and from 24/4 to 55/4 for breadth.

The breadth of these cells was again tested by their measurement in
several sections cut at right angles to their long diameter.         In this ease
156 cells averaged 35/t.          The nucleus averaged 13/t long, by 9/i
broad, the extreme length 20/1, extreme breadth 12/i.
    3rd. Processes.   The average number of secondary processes* arising
from ninety of these cells was seven, the largest number observed was
fifteen.    Sections across the long axis of the cell, however, occasionally
brought into view as many as eighteen, and exhibited the cell as
occupying the centre of an extensive area over which its branches
spread, radiating outwards and downwards from all points of its
margin. From this mode of branching it will, of course, be apparent
that the absolute number of processes given off by a single cell
cannot be determined with any degree of certainty, and that state
ments with regard to the comparative number of such in man and
the lower animals must be received with extreme caution, as the
number exhibited will vary with the direction of the section and the
methods employed for examination.            It will be readily conceived how
the fresh method of preparation described by one of the authors of
this paper.f brings into view a far larger number of processes than
are observed by other methods of preparation.
    4th. Distribution. The facilities afforded by the ether-freezing micro
tome,* have enabled the writers to examine in rapid succession and
under most favourable conditions extensive portions of the same brain
in a perfectly fresh state, and with but little trouble a series of convo
lutions may thus be sliced from end to end and the sections examined
eeriatim.    The results of such an examination have been to demon
                                                               "
strate the very important fact that these " giant cells are distributed
over certain definite areas which are remarkably constant, and it
appears to the authors that these cell-groupings are especially and
exclusively a characteristic feature of the motor area, as defined by
Ferrier. That these giant cells may be found in isolated positions at parts
not included in the motor area the writers do not question ; but they
have not succeeded in finding any large groups or distinct areas of such
elements in portions of the cortex at a distance from this region of the
motor centres. The present investigation has been limited to a portion
of the motor area, viz., the ascending frontal and two upper frontal
convolutions ; but it is hoped that this attempt to sketch the topogra
phical distribution of these cells may prove but the introduction to a
more complete and accurate investigation of the histology of individual
convolutions.       Such an investigation must eventually be made if
scientific precision is aimed at by the histologist in the field of cerebral

  pathology.      The scheme (Plate 3) appended to this paper represents
  the distribution of these cells as determined from a thorough micro
  scopic examination of the left ascending frontal, and two upper frontal
 convolutions of eight human brains, in all of which the arrangement
 of these cells was remarkably uniform.
     The broad upper extremity of the ascending frontal convolution,
 limited above by the longitudinal fissure and below by the lower line
 of origin of the first frontal, was found to present two large groupings
 of these cells. The first group (fig. 1, A —-D) includes some of the
 largest cells in this formation, and is distributed over the posterior or
parietal aspect of the gyrus adjacent to the ascending parietal convo
 lution. This group disappears towards the summit of this lobule, so
 that the anterior or frontal half of a section usually shows none of
 these cells present.
 Fig. 1. — Left ascending frontal and two upper frontal convolutions, seen from above.
           The letters refer to the parts from which sections figured in the scheme
           were taken.
    The second group (fig. 1, E — G) appears near the lower point of
 origin of the first frontal, and is found along the frontal aspect at this
 point — none being found posterior or along the parietal side. The
first group referred to occupies the upper two-thirds of this portion of
the ascending frontal, and limited almost exclusively to the aspect
adjacent to the ascending parietal, corresponds to the areas 2 and 4 in
Ferrier's drawings.* In the scheme several sections through this area
               —
 (Plate 3, A D) represent the exact number and distribution of these
cells at different levels from above downwards.                   The lower group
 (Plate   3, E),   which    takes  a  position  forwards     near   the first frontal,
appears to correspond closely to another motor area (No. 5 of Ferrier).
The cell-groupings here are entirely on the frontal half of the convo
lution, but at slightly lower levels, as at F and G they are observed
to spread over the vertex of the gyrus and appear at its posterior
aspect (Plate 3, F— G).

 frontals  presents     almost     invariably a marked sinuous flexure, the
 ceutral portion of      which      often forms a tolerably plump lobule.             A
large area is represented by the parietal aspect of the upper two-
thirds of this region in which the cells are large and numerous,
extending beyond the vertex of the convolution (Plate 3, K), but,
sloping backwards at a lower level until they finally disappear
(Plate 3, M). Thus from the points M to N no groupings of these
cells were discoverable.           Again, the remaining third of this region,
and the portion immediately connected with the second frontal con
volution, show a separate grouping of these great cells (Plate 3,
N— O). The latter group commences posteriorly and spreads beyond
the vertex of the convolution. The two separate areas last described
(H — M and N — O) occupy approximately the circles 6 and 7 in Ferrier's
figures.*    The posterior extremities of the superior and middle frontal

          of the two upper frontals (R — S) admitted into the scheme for examination.
          The letters, as in fig. 1, correspond with thoso of the scheme (Plate 8).
 convolutions exhibit a very extensive area of these cells, which, how
 ever, rapidly disappear as our sections extend forwards.                   It is to be
 observed that this extensive group of cells can be followed back into
 the ascending frontal convolution, communicating therefore with the
 series which at the origin of the frontals have been seen to occupy the
 anterior aspect (Plate 3, R and S).
    To recapitulate, we have presented to us a series of distinct group
 ings of these great cells arranged chiefly along the parietal aspect of

the ascending frontal convolution, interrupted by two groups which
occupy the frontal aspect at the origin of the superior and middle
frontals, and which at these points appear to run into an extensive
area disposed over the posterior third of the two latter convolu
tions.    That portion of the ascending frontal marked P (on the chart
of the convolutions) has a group of these cells situated along its
parietal aspect.        The portion intervening between the two lower
frontals we have excluded from our scheme, relegating it to a later
period, when it will be described in common with the rest of the
motor area. Meanwhile we would draw attention to the fact that
these cells diminish in size towards the lower extremity of the ascend
ing frontal, as they also do in the areas included in the frontal gyri, as
shown by the following table : —
                                                 Average Size of

  Left ascending frontal (lower extremity) . . .   35y  x 17/jl    41/x x  18/»
   In the area at the posterior end of the first frontal (fig. 1, R), the
cells assume an elongated contour, a very large majority approaching
the spindle form.        It is necessary to add that the limits of these areas
is not always sharply defined, as occasionally these cells graduate off
into smaller and yet smaller elements of the same character, until they
eventually disappear.         In many instances this fading off at the margin
is very noticeable.        In  other cases, when these ganglionic cells are
absent their position is occupied by a series of cells of uniform size,
but, whilst exhibiting the general characters of the greater elements,
they do not exceed in size the smaller cells of the third layer.            These
elements,     however,     invariably occupy the same level as the large
ganglionic cell, and we regard them as undeveloped representatives of
this series. Within the areas specified these large cells are grouped
closely together in twos or threes, and often assume the arrangement
of a belt one cell deep. To recapitulate, then, we find these cells form
an interrupted series differing thus from the continuous layers above
them, and that groupings of cells are thus distributed over certain
areas of the cortex closely corresponding to several of the motor
centres of Ferrier.        Again, we find each group is in itself constituted
of numerous secondary groups of cells, " the nests " of Betz, which
differ much in the number of cells forming each group.             It must also
be noted, that although the giant size of these cells in the upper half
of the ascending frontal constitutes a most characteristic feature — the
all-important fact to bear in mind is their interrupted distribution, as

 this feature      still predominates      in other portions of the motor area
 where the size of the cells no longer warrants us in calling them giant
 cells, their position in the order of lamination, their general form and
 distribution in clusters sufficing to identify them as the same elements.
    This disparity in size between these elements in the fourth layer of
 the motor area induces us to reject the term giant cell as applied
 generally to this formation, and to call them in preference the gan
 glionic cells of the cortex.         Their close resemblance to the ganglionic
 cells of the spinal cord has been fully recognised by Beta and other
 observers.

 IV. Note        on the      Bright Lines in the Spectra of Stars and

         December 31, 1877.
     Owing to absence from England in April last,              I have only just become
 acquainted with Dr. Huggins' paper, in reply to that by Mr. Stone, on
 the above subject.           As Mr. Stone has again directed attention to the
 matter,     I am anxious to say that           I  agree with him so entirely* that
 two years ago       I searched for indications of a large chromosphere in
 the case of a Lyree and some other stars.              I believe  I have had glimpses
 of bright lines at F and b, but if this discussion had not arisen should        I
    *  I  append an extract from a lecture on the Structure of Nebula; and Stars,
 which    I  gave at Manchester in the autumn of 1876 (" Manchester Science Lec
 tures"), to show the perfect accord there is between us. "There are nebula? and
 star* with spectra so similar that if one had the evidence of the spectroscope alone, it
 might bo impossible to decide which was nebula and which was star. Now this
may be a little startling to some of you, and therefore it is only fair   I should explain
it. The stars, you know, are so remote from us that in the most powerful telescopes
 to which spectroscopes     are applied, they appear only as the finest points of light.
Now     these points of light, it is not absurd to imagine, may in some instances be two
 millions, or perhaps even three millions, of miles in real diameter. We know that
 our own sun, which is certainly not the largest star in the heavens, is nearly one
 million miles in diameter; that is to say, the true sun, the true stellar nucleus, is
 one million miles in diameter.         Now when I dealt in my second lecture with the
 physical constitution of the      sun, I pointed out that the sun which we see, the sun
 whii h sends us the majority of the light we receive, is but a small kernel in a
 gigantic nut, so that the diameter of the real sun may be, say, two million miles.
Suppose then that some stars have very large coronal atmospheres ; if the area of
the coronal atmosphere is small compared with the area of the section of the true
 disc of the sun, of course we shall get an ordinary spectrum of the star ; that is to
say, wc shall get the indications of absorption which make us class the stars apart ;
we shall get a continuous spectrum barred by dark lines.             But suppose that the
area of the coronal atmosphere is something very considerable indeed, let us assume
that it has an area, say fifty times greater than the section of the kernel of the star
itself ; now, although each unit of surface of that coronal atmosphere may be much
less luminous than an equal unit of surface of the true star at the centre, yet if the
area be very large, the spectroscopic writing of that large area will become visible
side by side with the dark lines due to the brilliant region in the centre where we
can study absorption ; other lines (bright       ones) proceeding from the exterior por
tion of that star will be visible in the spectrum of the apparent point we call a star.
Now it is difficult to say whether such a body as that is a star or a nebula. We may
look upon it as a nebula in a certain stage of condensation ; wc may look upon it
as a star at a certain stage of growth."

   V. " On the relative ' Facility of Production' of Chemical Com
          binations."         By Sir B. C. Brodie, Bart., D.C.L., F.R.S.
          Received November 21, 1877.
                                           (Plate 4.)
      A   circumstance        which cannot fail to impress the student of
  chemistry    is  the     extreme    paucity of chemical substances.            The com
  binations of which he can conceive are innumerable, but those which
  he can realize are few — a mere sprinkling from the sea-shore sand —
  and, making tho fullest allowance for human incapacity, it yet
                                                                                   appears
  that there are natural facilities and natural obstacles in the way of
  making certain compounds which are independent of our skill and
  power.
      It is my object to show that among these is to be reckoned that
  relative "facility of production" of chemical substances which depends
  on the mathematical laws of combination which are inherent in the
                                                                                       very
  nature of chemical combination and unalterable.                             I

 relative facility with which the units of matter may be constructed
 and taken to pieces, owing to the relation of these units to the number
 and kinds of the simple weights of which they are made up ; and                           I
 propose to consider in what way, if any, this unequal " facility of
                " is
 production             connected with these mathematical laws.                 Is it true
 that, as a matter of theory, there arises from these laws any
                                                                                   greater
 facility for the production of one compound than of another, or do all
 stand on the same level ? and, further, does experience tally with the
 conclusions of theory ?
     In my second Memoir,* on the Calculus of Chemical Operations, I
have shown that the unit of every chemical substance is to be re
garded as constituted by the performance of the several operations

52                      Sir B. Brodie             on the relative              [Jan.   24,
elusion   that chemical events occur by the transference to and fro
among the units of matter and space of certain portions of matter
to (a) . w (x) i w (f) .    .   . , there termed simple -weights, which are
the results of the performance of the operations a , % > F ¦ ¦ • ! the
same unit therefore may he constructed in various ways corresponding
to the differences in order in which these simple weights are trans
ferred so as to build up the same unit of matter.             Some explanation
is necessary on this point.
   There is nothing in the laws of combination (and these alone we
are now considering) from which we can infer the performance of any
one of these operations taken singly to be essentially easier or more
difficult than the performance of any other ; that is to say, the facility
of constructing the unit « is the same as that of constructing the
      f
unit ; but when we consider combinations of more than one operation
the case is different. The combinations of the operations a and f taken
two and two together are as, af, and f" ; the combination a2 is unknown,
af is the unit of water, and fa the unit of oxygen.          Now, there is only
one way in which the unit f2 can be produced, namely by the suc
cessive performance of two operations f.             Similiarly, there is only
one way in which a1 may be produced.              But there are two ways in
which the unit af may be produced, namely by first performing the
operation f on the unit of space and then the operation a, in which
case the unit af is the result ; and also by first performing the opera
tion a and then the operation f, which results in the combination fa.
These two results (so far as our present pnrpose is concerned) are
identical, as follows from the commutative law af = fa demonstrated
in Part I.* We hence say that the " facility of production " of the
unit af is twice that of the respective units a' and                The ternary

carbon benzene a'x" as 126 to 84. The measure of the " facility of
production"" of a unit of matter being in all cases that number which
expresses the different ways in which the operations may be permuted
by which that unit is made. It is important to observe that the
comparison which is here effected is that between the " facility of
               " of the units of
production                               homogeneous substances, namely units
severally composed of the same number of simple weights.                      Thus we
                           "                              "
can compare the              facility of production           of valerylene a4** and
benzene a3**, but we have no means of effecting this comparison be
tween the unit of valerylene aV and the unit of propylene aV.
     That this " facility of production

                                                   is among the causes which de
termine the existence of certain units of matter to the exclusion of
others can hardly be denied, as a speculative truth, by anyone who
admits that these units are built up from simple weights in the manner
I   have described, but the action of this cause might be so veiled from
our view, by the action of other causes, that we might never be able to
detect it by the isolation of its effects.           The verification of a scientific
theory is effected by comparing             the   results   indicated by that theory
with the actual results of experience, and no physical theory can be
regarded as demonstrated unless it can stand the test of this com
parison. The system of combinations which in the present instance
lends itself most readily to this verification is the system of hydro
carbons.       This system contains some eighty-eight combinations, and,
 although    limited     as regards the full attainment of the object in view,
 is yet far more extensive than any other similar binary system. The
 composition, too, of the several units of the system is well determined.
 The gaseous density of the hydrocarbon being, in numerous cases,
 ascertained by experiment, and, where this is not the case, being
 determined by reasoning, generally of a very conclusive character.*
     Before proceeding further, 1 will give a list of the hydrocarbons to
 be considered, and their symbols.             For facility of reference, they are

    With the view of effecting            a comparison between the hydrocarbons
actually produced         and their relative "facility of production," as in
dicated by theory,       I  have constructed the following map.                  The nature
of this map will be readily understood from inspection.                        So far as the
numbers are concerned, it is the arithmetical triangle of Pascal. Each
square contains a number, and the symbol of a hydrocarbon.
                                                                                     " A line
drawn so as to cut off an equal number of units from the top hori
zontal row and the extreme left-hand vertical column, is called a base.
The bases are numbered, beginning from the top left-hand corner.
Thus, the tenth base is a line drawn through the numbers 1, 9, 36,

  84, 126, 126, 84 36, 9, 1."*         These numbers, it will be observed, are
 the numerical coefficients        of the several terms in the expansion of
  (n + *)9 and the symbols in the corresponding             squares the symbols
 corresponding       to those  coefficients.    Thus, for example,  in the case of
 the fourth base, which passes through the numbers 1, 3, 3, ] , we have
  (a + *¦)' = a3 + 3a'/c + 3a*2 + k*. The numerical coefficients, as is
 well known, express the n amber of ways in which the letters in the
                                                                " facility of pro
 corresponding symbols may be permuted.               NoWj the
 duction" of the hydrocarbon varies with the number of these permuta
 tions, so that in each square the symbol is associated with the number
 expressing its
                    " facility of production." If experience be concordant
 with theory, the actually existing hydrocarbons which appear on the
 several base-lines (between which it is our object to effect the com
 parison in question) will be found in those squares in which the
 highest numbers appear.            Now, if a perpendicular be let fall upon
 any base from the upper left-hand corner of the square in the top
 horizontal row, this line will either pass through the square con
 taining the greatest number or will pass between two such squares, the
 numbers equally diminishing on each side. The perpendicular drawn
 through all the bases will be termed the axis or main diagonal of the
 system.
     The squares in which the actually existing hydrocarbons               appear
 are in the map shaded; there are no known hydrocarbons corre
 sponding to the plain squares. If we follow the course of the axial
 line, it will be perceived that, up to the twentieth base, the squares
 through which the axis passes and the squares which lie immediately
 to the right and to the left of the axis, with one exception, are coloured
grey, so that, up to this point, all the hydrocarbons which have theo
retically the greatest

produced.       Further, a close inspection will show that there is a decided
tendency in the system to approximate to this central line.
     It does not follow, from these considerations, that " facility of pro
duction " should be the only cause determining the actual existence of
the hvdrocarbons.        The case is not so simple as that of drawing white
and red balls from an urn or cards from a pack.                 At one time the
efforts of chemists may be mainly, although even unconsciously,
directed to filling up one part of this system ; at another time to filling
up another part ; efforts which may have their origin in testing the
truth of speculations or possibly in the discovery of some one method
or one hydrocarbon ;t but the remarkable fact remains that, notwith
standing the operation of these multifarious causes acting in various

directions,  the paramount influence              of this " facility of production "
should still be apparent as the one cause which determines the general
aspect of the system.
   The causes I have mentioned would obviously determine an unequal
growth of the system and preclude a perfectly symmetrical arrange
ment, at any given time of observation, of the cluster of hydrocarbons
around the axial line.     How far this inequality is due to accidental
causes, and how far to the operation of permanent causes acting in one
direction, is impossible, from the slender data we possess, to say, but
the chemist should ever be alive to the detection of permanent devia
tions, in the form of the actual system, from the form indicated by
theory, for in such observations lie our best means of detecting the
existence of other causes affecting its growth, besides that predominant
cause which has been here discussed.

 1878.]                          of the  Thyroid Gland.                             57
 animals.       In  the tortoise   a network of lymphatics can be injected, of
 which      the smaller     ramifications run between almost all individual
vesicles.       The homogeneous or granular material which I have de
scribed in the lymphatics of the dog's thyroid, has been observed in
the same vessels in other thyroid glands, e.g., in those of horse, man,
sheep.       It occurs in both injected and uninfected glands. The quan
tity varies much in different glands of the same animal, it being
sometimes present in large quantities, and at other times appearing to
be entirely absent.        These observations so far merely confirm the results
arrived at in the dog.             In the thyroid gland of birds, however, a
different arrangement of parts takes place.              On injecting the thyroid
gland     of  a pigeon by    the  method    of puncture with Berlin bine, it be
comes swollen, and the injection is seen running in the jugular vein,
with which the gland is in close apposition.* Examination of sections
of the gland shows that the injection has entered vessels containing
blood-corpuscles.          The same vessels become filled on injecting in like
manner with nitrate-of-silver solution.              To ascertain whether by the
puncture        method    the   blood-vessels really become injected, another
gland was injected with Berlin blue from the lower part of the carotid
artery, the artery at the same time being secured above the gland. In
this case, in which the injection had entered the capillaries and veins,
it was evident that these were the same system of vessels which were
injected by the method of puncture.               I may, therefore, state that on
repeated injections       of  the thyroid gland   of the pigeon, both with Berlin
blue solution and with nitrate of silver by the method of puncture, have        I
been   unable to inject any system of lymphatic vessels, but have always found
 the injection in the blood-vessels of the gland-.       In the thyroid gland of
 this bird the blood-vessels            present the following characters : — The
 capillaries, as usual, form a network running between the individual
 gland-vesicles, but in proportion to the size of the vesicles (which in
 this gland are as a rule small), they do not appear so minute, nor to
have     such    complicated ramifications as in the case of mammalia, but
resemble       more the distribution of the lymphatics in some of those
animals.        The veins frequently surround, either partially or entirely,
the arteries which they accompany.             Immediately under the capsule of
the gland numerous large veins are seen, and in the fibrous capsule
itself,   I  have noticed layers of blood-corpuscles,         which appear to be
contained in blood-vessels communicating with the veins of the interior.
 Once or twice I have noticed in the large veins on the surface of the
gland (under the capsule), in addition to blood-corpuscles, and perhaps
coloured injection, a greater or less quantity of a material of homo
geneous aspect, presenting an appearance similar to the material seen
   *  It will  be remembered that on injecting  the dog's thyroid gland in a similar
 manner, the    injection was seen emerging from the gland in lymphatic vessels which
ran to neighbouring lymphatic glands.

58               Mr. E. C. Baber on         the Minute Structure          [Jan.   31,
in the vesicles, and also to that described above in the lymphatics of
the thyroid gland of the dog and other mammalia.                     In the thyroid
gland of the rook no system of lymphatics is injected by the method
of puncture, but the blood-vessels, presenting an appearance very
similar to those in the pigeon, become filled.           Since the publication of
my researches on the thyroid gland of              the  dog, I have become ac
quainted with P. A. Boechat's thesis on the structure of the thyroid
gland (published in 1873), in which he describes the lymphatics of
this organ.                       I
                I regret that was not previously aware of his researches,
but it is satisfactory to find that the results of our independent ob
servations on this subject are very similar.
   Epithelial Cells. — In the thyroid gland of several animals                I  have
observed in the epithelial cells numerous very fine parallel stria}, running
in the direction of the long axis of the cell, i.e., from the summit (or
free extremity) of the cell down towards its base.                 I can sometimes
trace this striation running apparently the whole length of the cell from
apex to base ; at other times it is only visible for a greater or less dis
tance near the summit of the cell.            I have observed it most clearly in
the thyroid glands of the skate, tortoise, pigeon, and kitten.                    Be
tween the epithelial cells of the thyroid gland a reticulum may often
be observed.      I have noticed it more especially in the tortoise, skate,
kitten, &c. Recently Otto Zeiss * has described a reticulum between
the epithelial cells of the thyroid gland.
   Parenchyma.— The large round cells described in my previous paper
in the thyroid gland of the adult dog, and there named " parenchy
matous cells," I have since observed in dogs aged five and nine weeks
respectively. In the thyroid gland of the cat parenchymatous cells are
present in considerable numbers, although not nearly so numerous as
in the dog. Parenchymatous cells are also seen in the thyroid of the
rabbit.    In the thyroid gland of the pigeon large groups are frequently
seen consisting of cells, which are larger than the adjacent epithelial
cells, round or oval in shape, and provided each with a single spherical
or oval-shaped nucleus. They resemble very much the parenchymatous
cells seen in the dog.
    Undeveloped Portions. — In the thyroid gland of the adult dog bodies of
considerable size are frequently seen, which differ entirely in structure
from the rest of the gland.           They are rounded or flattened in shape,
usually situate on the surface of the organ, and possess the following
structure.     They consist of a solid mass of more or less cylindrical rows
of cells, which are much convoluted and interlace in all directions.
Between      them run      capillary blood-vessels,     and   also probably some
                 These
                          " cylinders " are composed of cells resembling
lymphatics.                                                                       epi

cylinder, next to the capillaries, being arranged at right angles to the
long axis of those vessels.          Each cell is provided with a nucleus,
usually oval in shape.      In very few, if in any, of these cylinders have I
been able to detect any central canal.          In the dog I have always
observed these
                   " undeveloped portions " as distinct bodies, not con
tinuous    with the normal       gland tissue, but separated from it by
layers   of connective   tissue, and     frequently lying in depressions on
the surface   of the gland.     They appear to be portions of gland, whose
development has become arrested at an early stage, and there is no evi
dence to show that they undergo any further development subsequently.
    In the kitten similar undeveloped portions are seen, but in this
animal they may sometimes be observed to be continuous with the
ordinary gland tissue.      In this case a formation of vesicles from the
cylinders of cells appears to be taking place by the growth into them
laterally of processes of connective tissue with blood vessels, and by
their excavation into vesicles.        In the kitten the cylinders are less
convoluted than in the dog, and throughout the gland the fully formed
vesicles frequently appear grouped in rows, w-hich have a more or less
parallel arrangement.       Somewhat similar, but shorter, cylinders of
cells are seen in the thyroid of the pigeon, scattered throughout the
gland.     I may mention that in the thyroid glands of fcetal pigs
(measuring about 2j inches in length) before the formation of vesicles
has    taken place,   I have seen cylinders presenting an appearance
similar to those above described.
    In sections of the glands of young dogs (aged about five weeks and
three months respectively)       I  have observed that the vesicles are very
much branched, and present numerous hollow ramifications.               In the
thyroid glands of numerous other dogs of different ages, I have with
equal certainty ascertained that the vesicles presented very few, if any,
of these hollow branches.       These much-branched vesicles are doubt
less the hollow branched cavities (tubes) of Zeiss, which he obtains by
floating them out from portions of the fresh gland of young animals.
In glands in which the vesicles present this appearance, the walls of the
vesicles are frequently inflexed so as to form numerous projections into
the interior, as already described by Verson and myself.            Zeiss has
repeatedly endeavoured to inject these hollow-branched        cavities by the
method of puncture, but without success.           Neither have I, in all my
injections, ever succeeded in filling any such structures, which must
surely have been the case if the hollow-branched cavities were in com
 munication with one another to any extent, for it seems almost impos
sible to suppose, as Zeiss does, that the contents of these cavities
 can prevent the injection from running into them, whilst we know that
 the viscid contents of the lymphatics have no such effect.          I  am of
 opinion that these hollow branched cavities do not communicate with
 one another to any extent, and that, in the dog at least, they merely

farm a stage in the growth of the gland.         In the mature state of the
organ in this animal      I consider that the vesicles, as usually supposed,
consist of cavities     more or less spherical    in shape, which are not in
communication      with one another.
    The points mentioned in this note, together with others connected
with the subject, will be fully discussed in a future paper.

        M.A., LL.D., Treas. and V.P.R.S.            Received November 22,
        1877.
    The principal object of the following communication is to describe
 an instrumental arrangement which has proved very convenient for the
 production of steady strifB. The first attempt which was made nearly
 two years ago (February, 1876), consisted in charging a Leyden bat
 tery of nine large jars by means of an induction coil, and discharging it
 gradually through a vacuum tube. This was effected by connecting
 one terminal of the tube with the outside of the battery, and present
 ing the other terminal, made pointed, to a knob connected with the
 inside, at suitable distances. The following effects were then observed :
     (1.) When the interval between the terminal and the kDob was
 considerably greater than striking distance, the appearance in the tube
 was cloudy and apparently unstratified, or showed only famt indica
 tions of stratification.     It was, in fact, very similar to that produced
 by attaching    one  terminal   of the tube to one of an induction coil, and
 carrying the other to the earth.
     (2.) When the interval was within striking distance, the usual jar-
  discharge without stratification or dark space took place.
     (3.) When the interval was slightly greater than striking distance,
  but not so great as in the first case, a bright stratified discharge was
  observed. The proper motion due to a decline in tension was shown by
  a revolving mirror, and by a careful but rapid alteration in the distance
  during discharge, the motion could be arrested or even reversed. The
  duration of the whole, although long compared with a single flash from
  an ordinary coil, did not exceed half a second.
     This experiment gave reason to hope that if a condenser of suflicient
  capacity were constructed, the discharge might be prolonged, and even
  varied, so as to allow an actual study of its various phases to be made.
     The next attempt was made during last summer with some con
  densing plates, constructed for cable purposes, and kindly lent to me
  by Messrs. Latimer Clark, Muirhead, and Co. The results were in
  every way calculated to encourage further steps.
     At the suggestion of Mr. De la Rue, and with the assistance of his

1878.]       Mr. W. Spottiswoode on Stratified Discharges.               61
battery for the purpose of testing the instrument, the same firm con
structed for me condensers of which the following are the particulars.
Each condenser is contained in a box, and has a capacity of 13'8 micro
farads, subdivided into ten sections, each section containing forty sheets
of tinfoil, 18 in. X 13 in., insulated from each other by eight sheets of
parafined tissue paper. The superficial area of foil in each box is 1,300
square feet, and that of parafined paper 14,166 square feet.         It was
found that these condensers        could easily be charged with a 4-inch
induction coil, worked by two Grove's, or even bi-chromate, cells. A
much smaller coil would certainly suffice if the coil were made with a
thick secondary, since \- to |-inch sparks are all that are required. In
order to charge the condenser, one terminal of the coil was carried to
outside of the condenser, and the other to the other with an inter
vening air spark.       The object of the air spark was twofold : first to
ensure that the tension of the electricity was sufficient to give the re
quired charge to the condenser, and, secondly, to prevent the latter
from discharging itself back through the secondary of the coil.        After
some trials, it was found that the air spark might, with great advan
tage in steadiness of action, be replaced by a vacuum-tube which offered
 sufficient resistance : such, for instance, may gonerally be found among
 those prepared for spectrum analysis, although these differ very widely
 in resistance.    Lastly, the condenser was furnished with a safety dis
 charger, consisting of a brass sphere and a point adjustable in distance
 from one another, so that the condenser might discharge itself at a
 suitable tension ; i.e., before the tension rose high enough to break
 down the insulation of the plates.
     The discharge through the vacuum tubes on. which experiments were
 being made was effected either by leading the two sides of the con
  denser directly to the terminals of the tube ; or more often by leading
  one direct, and the other through the intervention of a resistance coil,
  such as was described in the Proceedings of the Royal Society for 1875,
  pp. 461 — 2.    By altering the length of the resisting column as the
  tension  in the condenser declined, the charge could be delivered through
  the tube at any required rate.
      By this arrangement a steady stratified discharge can be maintained
  for one, two, or more minutes, according to the nature and pressure of
  the gas contained in the tube. In one case, with a nitrogen tube of 30
  inches in length and 2 in diameter, a special fixed phase was maintained
  for upwards of five minutes with one of the hoxes above mentioned.
      Speaking in general terms, the same connexion between resistance
   in the circuit and the flow of the striae as had previously been noticed
   with the indnction coil and rapid contact-breaker (Proceedings of the
    Royal Society for 1875, pp. 458 — 9) was observed with this method;
   but the phenomena were exhibited with greater distinctness,           and
    could be examined more at leisure.

62           Mr.  W. Spottiswoode      on Stratified Discharges.    [Jan.  31,
    In particular, with     the nitrogen tube above mentioned, and other
similar tubes, the direction of the flow reversed itself as the charge in
the condenser became more exhausted. This was apparently due rather
to a diminution in strength of current, or quantity of electricity pass
ing through the tube, than to fall in tension, inasmuch as any particular
phase could be maintained by gradually diminishing the resistance in
the circuit as the tension declined.      The penultimate phase was a for
ward flow from the positive terminal, the ultimate a fixed condition of
striffi.    When sufficient resistance was interposed in the circuit, these
stria? showed a faint indication of fissure into pairs of lamina?, and
even actually broke into pairs by forward jerks.           Very shortly after
this the column became blurred, and the discharge then finally ceased.
It should be further mentioned that by a suitable increase or diminu
tion of resistance in the circuit the flow could be reversed again and
again at pleasure.
    It has frequently been noticed       that in some tubes the column of
stria?   shows a tendency to mobility, while in others it is comparatively
fixed ; in one case it appears to be in a position of unstable, in the other
in a condition of stable, equilibrium. The former may generally be
exemplified in hydrogen and nitrogen vacua, the latter in carbonic
acid, hydrochloric acid, and other vacua.                              I
                                                  Experiments which have
recently      made with another, in some respects yet more powerful,
method,      tend to bring out the connexion between these two classes,
but I    reserve an account of them for a future occasion.
    Pursuing this subject further, I repeated the same experiments with
an 18-inch, instead of a 4-inch coil, using as a battery either six large
bichromate of potash cells, or, with still better effect, a large Gramme's
machine, worked by steam.          The results were in every way satisfac
tory.      Tubes  in  which with the  4-inch coil the striaj were at best only
imperfectly developed, or in which it was impossible to maintain the
 discharge for any appreciable time, were illuminated successfully in
both respects ; and in many cases the supply of electricity from the coil
to the condenser could be so regulated as to maintain special phases for
 an indefinite time.      The change of tint from pale salmon colour to
violet-gray    in  (impure?) carbonic acid vacua, due to increased tension,
as observed by Mr. Do la Rue with his great battery, were here dis
 played with great brilliancy.
      The advantage of the 18-inch over the 4-inch coil consisted not so
 much in the tension as in the quantity of electricity given off to the
condenser at each secondary discharge ; and it seems probable that a
 coil specially constructed with very thick primary and secondary, and
 capable of giving sparks from ^ to \ inch in length, would be the most
suitable instrument for the purpose. It would, of course, be necessary
 that the condenser should have sufficient capacity to act as a fly-wheel
 during the intermittence of the supply from the coil.

III.   " On the Expression of the Product of any two Legendre's
      Coefficients by means of a Series of Legendre's Co
      efficients."    By Professor J. C. ADAMS, M.A., F.R.S. Re
      ceived November 22, 1877.
   The expression for the product of two Legendre's coefficients which
is the subject of the present paper, was found by induction on the
13th of February, 1873, and on the following day I succeeded in
proving that the observed law of formation of this product held good
generally.    Having considerably simplified this proof,   I now venture
to offer it to the Royal Society; and, for the sake of completeness,
 I have prefixed to it the whole of the inductive process by which the
theorem was originally arrived at, although for the proof itself only
the first two steps of this process are required.   The theorem seems to
deserve attention, both on account of its elegance, and because it
appears to be capable of useful applications.
   As usual let Legendre's «th coefficient be denoted by P., then P.
may be defined by the equation
                                 1     <f
   It is well known that the following relation holds       good between
three consecutive values of the functions P, viz. :
                       (n+l)P,+l=(2n + l)nV.-nV,*-!

where the law of the terms is obvions, except perhaps as regards the
succession of the factors in the several denominators.
   With respect to this it may                 be observed       that the factors in the
denominator of any term Pp are obtained by omitting the factor 2p + l
from the regular succession of five factors (n+p — 3) (n+p— 1)
(n+p + 1) (n+p + 3) (n+p + b).
   For instance, where p=n+4,                    2p +   l = 2n + 9,         so  that the       factor
2«+9 is to     be omitted,      and we have        2« + l,     2n+3, 2n + 5 and               2a +  7,

r being an integer which varies from 0 to w.
     The fundamental property of the function A is that

     We may interpret A(w) when m is zero or a negative integer, by
 supposing this relation to hold good generally, so that putting m=U,
 we have

 and henco the value         of   A(w)    when m is a negative        integer will    be
 always zero.

  above.

  In this expression r is supposed to vary from 0 to in, but it may be
  remarked that if r be taken beyond those limits, for instance if
  r=— l,or r=m + l, then in consequence of the property of the func
  tion A above stated, the coefficient of the corresponding                        term
   will vanish.    Hence practically we may consider          r to  be unrestricted    in
   value.

   The principle of the process employed in the above proof may be
thus stated :
   Every term in the value of Q„ gives rise to two terms in the value
of /<Qm or in that of (2w + l)/tQ„; one of these terms is to be sub
tracted from the corresponding term in (m + l)Qm+1, and the other
from the corresponding term in mQ,.,, and it will be found that the
two series of terms thus formed identically destroy each other.

    Professor Helmholtz remarks, at page 603 of the fourtb edition of
      " Tonempfindungen," that a film of
his                                                     soapsuds and glycerine forms,
when caused to occupy the orifice of one of his " resonators," an
extremely sensitive means by which to make visible the vibrations of
the air within its cavity.
    While I was engaged in verifying this observation, my notice was
attracted to the parallel bands of colour which traversed the film, and
it occurred to me to examine whether the forms of these bands were
affected by the sonorous vibrations which agitated the film.                             A few
rough      trials  having   convinced       me   that they  were   so   affected,     I at once
proceeded to submit the phenomena which presented themselves to a
closer examination.
    Having caused a film to adhere to the circular aperture of a Helm
holtz resonator, and allowed the fluid to drain off until the interference-
colours became visible,           I  set the resonator, nipple downwards,                  in a
stand, so that the film was exactly horizontal, and then stroked with a
resiued bow a tuning-fork of the same pitch mounted on its resonance

  box and placed near the resonator. With a tenacious film and uniform
  bowing, this resulted in the formation of a fixed figure, consisting of
  coloured     bands,     straight   or curved, symmetrically arranged, and
  generally accompanied by one or more colour- vortices rotating in
  opposite directions.        A single sweep of the bow usually sufficed to
  call out such a figure from a previous state of colour-chaos, and, when it
  was once established, careful bowing would keep it fairly steady for
  some little time.       While, however, its form remained thus constant, its
  colours underwent a progressive series of changes as the thickness of
  the film gradually diminished.          Presently there would come a complete
  break-up of the figure, often accompanied by a violent rotation of the
  whole film, after which a different figure, generally of a simpler form,
, would     establish itself, to be in its turn, provided the film only held
  out long euough, replaced by another and still more simple figure.
  Sometimes, but much less frequently, the changes of form occurred
  without a separating interval of disorder, the incoming figure sup
  planting its predecessor with kaleidoscopic abruptness,                  The most
  in+cresting    feature   of these figures   was their  stationary  colour- vortices,
  arranged pairwise, and churning round and round with a velocity
  which seemed limited only by the loudness of the sound at command,
  and by the capacity of the film for bearing the strain put upon it. The
  fixed bands, viewed at any one instant, mostly presented a surprising
  degree of complexitj', with entire symmetry in the arrangement both of
  form and of vividly contrasting colour.                 The general effect may,
  perhaps, be compared to that of an elaborate
                                                          " set-piece " of fireworks,
  in which turbines of coloured flame play a conspicuous part.                But the
  great   chavm    of the experiment lay in watching the successive changes
  of form and hue which, beautiful from the very outset, became, as the
   film neared its moment of dissolution, surpassingly gorgeous.            It would,
   I think, be difficult to point to a more splendid series of phenomena in
   the whole range of physical optics.
      To give anything like a complete representation of the colour-
  appearances observed would severely tax the utmost resources of pic
   torial art. The illustrations* appended to this paper are meant only
   to convey a general notion of the phenomena which presented them
  selves. The memoranda for them were carefully taken down during
  actual observation of the experiments, so that, in their broader features,
   the figures given may be safely depended on.                 Minute accuracy of
   detail could not, in dealing with such wayward phenomena, be secured,
   except by a greater expenditure of time than was feasible.               I propose
   to make a few remarks on some of the colour-figures produced by the
   mode of experimenting described above.
      Gentle bowing, and a film not too thin, usually called out fig. 1, in

   kindly placed his skill and scanty leisure at my disposal.

1878.]          Films under    the   Action of Sonorous Vibrations.   73
which    bright concentric rings contrasted with a differently tinted
ground, while the whole was surrounded by a margin of mixed
colours in an unorganised condition.        Stronger bowing, or the pro
gressive thinning of the film, would then establish fig. 2, the most
typical and persistent of the whole series.      Here concentric circular
bands were enclosed by others approximately square, and these again,
together with four sets of irregularly flattened ovals symmetrically
disposed, by other square bands, inclined at 45° to the former ones.
Outside the latter were four pairs of colour-vortices, with stationary
tadpole-shaped nuclei, rotating in the alternate directions shown by
the arrows.    Nearly the whole space included between the outer square
and the edge of the film was occupied by colours whirling in circular
or slightly elliptic orbits.  The contrast between the fixed and moving
portions of this figure was always extremely striking and beautiful.
   In fig. 3, a set of fixed concentric rings separated adjacent pairs of
vortices.
    Figs. 4 and 5 presented a pentagonal arrangement with five pairs
of vortices.   The dotted space in the latter figure appeared speckled
over with minute air-bubbles.
   Fig. 6 belonged to a less regular class of forms.
   Fig. 7 was only once observed.    Its central rings were inclosed in a
scries of triangular bands, outside which were three sets of flattened
ovals similar to those in fig. 2, but each containing a single vortex
rotating about      a   nucleus.
    Fig.  usually showed itself only when the thinning of the film was
            8
far advanced.   There was a flow of colour along the dotted lines in
the direction of the arrow, which subsequently       divided into two
streams, and, after passing outside the two sets of flattened ovals and
through the channels separating them from a third irregular crescent-
shaped series of bands, united again opposite the protuberance in the
concavity of the latter, and went on performing the same circuit.
 When the film had become excessively thin, this figure frequently
showed nothing but the two tadpole nuclei, with an oval vortex about
each, whose longer diameter was not much less than that of the film
itself.
  In all the preceding figures the axis of symmetry was evidently
determined by the direction in which the sonorous vibrations reached
the film.
   The results which have been as yet described were obtained from
films clinging to the circular orifice of a resonator. A simpler mode of
proceeding is to form the film on an aperture cut in a piece of card
board or thin sheet of metal, and place this upon the open end of a
resonance-box, into which its appropriate tuning-fork has been pre
viously screwed. The box             is,
                              ot course, to be held steady, with its
opening horizontal, while the fork       thrown into vibration.

operating in this manner with apertures of various shapes,       I  obtained
a large  number    of distinct figures : a few of the least  complex have
been selected for illustration.
   In figs. 9, 10, 11, the aperture used was an equilateral triangle ; in
figs. 12, 13, 14, a square. The general character of these results will,
after the explanations already given, be readily understood on inspec
tion of the diagrams. Their axis of symmetry depended on the position
of the film with reference to that of the tuning-fork.
   When larger apertures, or a fork and box of higher pitch, -were
used, the resulting figures became rapidly more complex, and forms
were readily obtained in which the whole film was covered with an
uniform pattern consisting of some single figure analogous to one of
those already described repeated over and over again.           With very
acute sounds the separate figures became too small for recognition and
too numerous for counting.
   The resonance of an air-cavity is, as is well known, not limited to
supporting a note of one single degree of pitch, but can also reinforce
other notes, provided they are not too far distant from its proper or
fundamental tone. It was therefore to be expected that colour-figures
could be obtained from a film in the mouth of a resonator by employ
ing sounds other than that to which its cavity was tuned.       In putting
this to the test of experiment I found it convenient to replace the
sounds of mounted tuning-forks by those of my own voice.            The film,
formed as at first in the orifice of a resonator, showed itself sensitive
to very slight differences of pitch. When the note sung was some
where in the neighbourhood of the resonator's            proper tone, the
smallest sharpening or flattening which my voice could produce led
to an instantaneous and unmistakable change of figure.           Moreover,
the limits of pitch on either side of the resonator's own note, within
which permanent figures could be obtained, were considerably wider
than those between which audible reinforcement          by the resonator
itself occurred.
   In order to test the capacity of two figures corresponding to tones
of different pitch for coalescing into a regular resultant-form,     I placed
a film symmetrically with respect to the open ends of two resonance-
boxes belonging to forks forming consonant intervals with each
other.    By exciting either fork separately a steady figure was
obtained, but the coexistence of their sounds caused an immediate
tumultuous movement from which no permanent joint form emerged.
There seemed to be an absolute incompatibility between the tw-o
figures which made all compromise impossible.          Desirous of ascer
taining whether this repugnance extended to the case of sounds all
but identical in pitch, I used a pair of unison forks, one of which had
been slightly flattened so as to beat about twice per second with its
fellow.    Some very interesting phenomena were the result.        The fixed

 1878.]        Films under      the  Action of Sonorous       Vibrations.           lb
 portions of the approximately identical figures due to either fork by
itself, took up, while both were sounding, a swaying movement about
their mean position ; one complete oscillation of figure synchronizing
exactly with each beat* heard. The resonance-boxes had, in this expe
riment, been placed with their openings exactly opposite each other,
and the film, which was rectangular in shape, midway between, but in
a   horizontal plane slightly above them. The swaying motion was, under
these    circumstances, on the whole rectilinear, as though each fork
alternately gave the entire figure a pull in its own direction. The
behaviour of the vortices was still more remarkable.                  With vigorous
and equal      bowing they rotated several times in one direction during
the first     half of each beat, and the same number of times in the
opposite direction during the second half of it.              If, instead of occupy
ing the relative positions above described, in which the forks when
sounding singly gave rise to antagonistic vortices, they were both
placed on one side of the film, the result was rotation during one half-
beat and inaction during the next, followed again by similar alterna
tions, bnt the direction of rotation remaining constant throughout.
In this case the vortices moved most rapidly during the maximum
and rested during the minimum of intensity.                    But in others it was
not so, and I even observed instances where in one part of the figure
the rotation coincided with the maximum and the quiescence with the
minimum, while at another part of it the exactly contrary state of
things prevailed.
     In every experiment hitherto described the film was either acted on
by the resonance of a spherical air-cavity, which practically reinforces
"nlv the fundamental tone of a compound sound in unison with it ; or
else the vibrations         employed were exclusively ihoso of a mounted
tuning-fork which follow the pendulum law.                  Hence no other kind of
 movement was transmitted save that which gives rise to what Helm-
 lioltz calls a " simple tone."        In order to examine the effects produced
 by composite sounds, it was desirable to let their vibrations act ou a
 film unconnected with any resonant cavity. For this purpose one end
 of a caoutchouc tube of large bore was fitted into a metal ring fixed in a
 horizontal plane on which the film-bearing discs could be placed. Notes
 of the human voice, of tuning forks, organ pipes, &c, being sounded
 into the tube, either directly or through a funnel in the shape of an
 ordinary ear-trumpet, their effects on films of various forms and sizes
 could be conveniently observed.              A very wide field for research was
 thus opened up, which I do nut propose to enter upon here beyond
 simply mentioning one result obtained in this manner which possesses
 an independent        interest.     When two notes, identical in pitch and
     * The
            absence of an English   equivalent for the German Schwelung, which denotes
 the whole   phenomena from one maximum of intensity (Schlag) to the nest, is most
  inconvenient, and makes itself very perceptible here.

were alternately sounded, two perfectly distinct figures were obtained,
each presenting    itself again and again for many alternations the
instant its own note was sounded, and remaining constant until that
note ceased.    By this apparatus, therefore, permanent pictures of the
relative quality of musical sounds may bo secured.
   I content myself here with a description of the phenomena T have
observed, and make no attempt at determining the mechanical condi
tions under which they occur.    It may, however, be worth while to
remark that the most striking feature of the figures above described,
the vortices,   can be exactly    reproduced    with the caoutchouc tube
apparatus by gently sucking a little air through       taking care that the

and that its other end  is not completely closed by the disc and film.
   Before concluding  I    wish to draw attention to some allied phe
nomena described by      Mr.   E. B. Tylor in "Nature," for May, 1877,
p. 12.    Distinct patterns were obtained by him, but            it   would

mode of experimenting adopted by him on that occasion suggested the

 1878.]              Comparison   of Standard Barometers.                  77
 from time to time indirect comparisons have been made by persons not
 connected officially with either.
    Attention has recently been drawn to the subject by the publication
of a memoir by Dr. H. Wild, Director of the Central Physical Observa
tory, St. Petersburgh, entitled
                                     " Ueber normal-Barometer und ihrer
Vergleichung," in which the author states (p. 100) that the standard
barometer of the Royal Observatory reads 0"465 m.m., or 0 018 inch
lower than that of the Kew Observatory, arriving at that conclusion
by means of somewhat circuitous comparisons.           Professor Mohn, of
Christiania, in 1876, writes also that he finds the difference Kew — -
Greenwich to be + 0'49 m.m., or + 0'019 inch.
    In 1869 the late Colonel Strange made        a comparison between the
two standards     by means of a barometer which he had conveyed from
the one observatory to the other, the results of which are stated by him
to be as   follows : —
   By comparison No.      1  Greenwich  lower than Kew    0 009 inch.
                      „    2       „          „           0006     „

   In consequence of     these statements the   Kew Committee made appli
cation to the Astronomer Royal for permission to make a direct com
parison between the two instruments, and received from him a courteous
consent to their proposition.
   Accordingly, having selected four barometers — Adie       655, Adie 657,
                            C                              C
Negretti and Zambra —— , and Negretti and Zambra --— , all standards
on the     -Fortin principle — as suitable instruments  for the purpose,     I
made arrangements       to convey them to Greenwich and back safely in a
 carriage.
    On  April   23rd, 1877, Mr. Baker and     I  made a set of observations
of the two large Kew standards, constructed by the late Mr. Welsh ;
Newman 34 [the working standard of the Observatory], Adie 655 and
Adie 657, and subsequently of Newman 34, and the two Negretti and
Zambra standards.
    The latter we also compared        again  on the morning of the 24th,
before   starting for Greenwich.
    Having carefully packed the instruments, accompanied by an assist
ant,   I   went to the Royal Observatory, and there suspended the
barometers in the large room of the Magnetic Observatory, facing and
about eight feet distant from the standard barometer (Newman 64).
    After leaving the instruments about an hour, in order that they
 might assume the correct temperature of the room, which did not
 differ greatly from that of the external air at the time, we made a set
 of twelve readings of all the four instruments and of the Greenwich
 standard, myself and the assistant      reading them alternately,   the tem

 perature of each barometer      being also noted by the observer  at the
time of observation.
    On the 2.5th and 26th of April Messrs. Ellis, Nash, and other Green
wich observers made a set of nine comparisons, and on the latter day
Messrs. Baker and Foster, two Kew observers, went to Greenwich and
 made twelve comparisons of the five instruments, and then dismounted,
packed, and brought them back to the Kew Observatory, again sus
pending them in their places.
    On April 27th the four hack barometers (to use a term bappilv
 suggested by Mr. Galton) were again read twelve times with the Kew
standard of reference barometer, Newman 34, by the same three Kew
observers.    The result of this set of comparisons shows the mean
 difference between Kew and Greenwich to have been (Greenwich —
 Kew)= + -0016 inch.
                               2nd Comparison.
    The four hack barometers were again on the 1st of May compared
at Kew with Newman         34, and then conveyed to Greenwich, where
they were put up in the same place as before, and read again in a
similar manner to that employed on the occasion of the previous
visit.
    On the 1st the Kew assistants made twelve sets of readings ; on the
2nd and 3rd the Greenwich observers made twelve sets of comparisons.
On the 4th we made a like number of sets, returning the instruments
subsequently to Kew, where they were read on the 5th with the Kew
standard of reference.
    The result of the second series of comparisons gives a mean dif
ference (Greenwich — Kew) + 0-0007 inch.
                               3rd Comparison.
    Before making this comparison the tube of Adie G55 was accidentally
broken, and having been repaired and refilled, its index error was

having   been removed   from the Observatory by the makers, two     other
instruments, also by Negretti and Zambra, Nos. \ 903 and f          1105,
were selected with which to make the comparisons.
    On the 14th May these four barometers were all compared ten     times
with the Kew barometer (Newman 34), the observers being the         same
as before.
    The next day they were taken to Greenwich, and hung up in the
usual place.     Due time having been allowed for them to become
settled, and the temperature equalised, ten sets of readings were made
precisely in a similar manner to the previous ones.

 1878.]            Comparison   of Standard Barometers.                     79
    On the 16th the Greenwich observers made eight sets of readings,
on the 17th seven sets, and on the morning of the 18th two sets.
    Later on the same day Messrs. Baker and Foster made twelve sets,
carrying the barometers again back to Kew, where, on the 19th, twelve
sets  of observations were finally taken.
    On the 23rd the Kew barometer (Newman 34) was again compared
with the two Normal barometers of the Observatory, and its correction
found to be — 0 007 inch, the same as determined on April 23rd.
    The readings at Greenwich on the 17th May were taken at a time
when the pressure was rapidly falling, and a storm passing over the
Observatory    ; and on the 18th its effect had not completely passed off.
the wind being high and the temperature changing somewhat quickly,
    The observations made on these two days were discordant from
these causes, and have therefore      been left out of the comparison, and
the   result of the third    series of observations      gives the difference
               —
(Greenwich        Kew) + 0'0014 inch.
    We then have the following determinations      : —
    Mean difference from 1st series of 128 comparisons + 0'0016 inch.
                       „ 2nd        „     144         „       + 0-0007   „

                        Final mean of     344         „      .+ 0-0012   „
    This value is unchanged      if  we weight the determinations      propor
tionally.
    A correction of — 0'006 inch has been applied throughout to the
readings of the Greenwich standard ; this correction having been made
by the   Astronomer Royal to all the readings of that instrument since
August 30th, 1866 (when the long sliding rod, after removal, was re
placed), to make them accord with the old Royal Society standard's
indications.
    Throughout the observations the temperatures of all the portable
barometers were observed by means of thermometei-s fixed to the
middle of their brass tubes, having the bulbs in immediate contact
with the mercurial column.
    The errors of these thermometers were all carefully determined at
 Kew, and every reading has been corrected to the Kew standard.
    The Greenwich standard barometer is provided with two thermo
meters — a large one with a bulb approximately of the same diameter
 as  the barometrical column, and placed about half way up, but at a
 distance of 1'25 inches in front of it — and a small thermometer not
 divided   on its stem, whose bulb is immersed          in the cistern  of the
 barometer itself.

they were made.
  As the position of the Greenwich, standard barometer precludes its
being read by daylight, two gas burners are used to illuminate it at
the time of observation, one being fixed at the level of the pointer in
the cistern, the other at the barometric height.      The flame of these
burners is raised only at the instant of observation.
   The gas lights being immediately behind the barometer, and
distant about six inches, somewhat heat      and               it,

   When, however, the gas burners were turned on full, the tem
perature of the upper part of the barometer became much increased,
a  rise of 7'1° taking place in five minutes, whilst the thermometer
attached io the barometer was only affected to the extent of 0o-8.
   Great care was exercised in turning down the lights immediately
after reading during the periods of comparison, so that       assumed                   it   is
that no instance of such a great irregularity in the distribution of

    If the readings of the thermometer be corrected for index errors
only, as is the case nnder ordinary circumstances when observations
are made, the difference between the Greenwich and Kew standard
barometers is reduced by the amount of (0o-5 X 0 0027 =) '0013 inch,
and the two barometers differ only by the amount — 0-0001 inch, that
is to say they virtually agree.
                    I
    In conclusion would beg to express my thanks to the Astronomer
Royal and Messrs. Ellis and Nash for the courteous manner in which
they afforded us every facility and assistance in carrying out these
comparisons, and to Messrs. Baker, Foster, and Constable for the
assistance they have given in the reduction of the observations, as well
as in the actual comparisons.
    The tables containing the detailed observations are preserved at the
Kew Observatory for reference.
    Note. — Since the effect of the gas burners upon the Greenwich
barometer has had attention called to it, Mr. Ellis has fitted opal
glass screens between the gas-jets and the barometer.        By this means
the temperature is rendered much more equable round the instrument.

        at Owens College,      Manchester.      Received November 28,
        1877.
    1.  The Observatory at Trevandrum was supported by His Highness
the   Rajah of Travancore, and its Director was Mr. J. A. Broun, F.R.S.,
who has recently published the first volume of the results of his
 labours, giving the individual observations of magnetic declination,
and deducing from them conclusions of great scientific value.
    Among the other results published by Mr. Broun, are the diurnal
ranges of the magnetic declination at Trevandrum, for each civil day
 in the eleven years, 1854 to 1864.     (Table LVIII, page 163.)
    In one respect the treatment of the declination observations at Tre
 vandrum differs from that pursued at the Kew Observatory, inasmuch
 as   in the former place, where disturbances are little felt, the diurnal
 ranges are from all the observations.

     It will be noticed from this table that the annual variation of
     3.
the declination-range at Trevandrum      very different in character
                                                              is
from its annual variation at the Kew Observatory.
     The chief feature of the annual variation at Kew     the small value                is
 of the range at the time of the winter solstice.
    On the other hand, the chief features of the annual variation of
 declination-range at Trevandrum are two minima, nearly correspond
ing in time to the two equinoxes, and two maxima, one large, some
 time in August (after the summer solstice) and        smaller one about             a
 the time of the winter solstice.    These features have been already
 remarked by Mr. Broun, who has likewise pointed out that the
 character of 'the diurnal variation of the declination at the summer
 solstice is at Trevandrum the opposite of its character at the winter
 solstice — the change from the one type to the other taking place about
 the equinoxes.     He has likewise pointed out, as        result of this                a

  1878.]                      Declination at Trevandrum.                                         83
  change     of type, that about the times of the equinoxes there is not
 only a small average value           of the range, but likewise an uncertainty
 about    its character, as it sometimes appears to be of the one type and
 at other times changes to the other type.
                            B. Variations of Long Period.
    4.   In  order to investigate the long-period variation of the Trevan
 drum declination-range,          I  have treated these observations precisely in
 the way in which the Kew declination-ranges                           were treated (Proc.
 Roy.    Soc, March     22, 1877).       By this method proportional values of the
declination-range        at Trevandrum have been obtained corresponding to
weekly points        for   each year, and it is believed that these values are
freed from any recognised inequality depending either on the month
of the year or on the relative position of the sun and moon.                               If this
method should be found to furnish nearly the same results in the case
of two observatories so widely apart as Kew and Trevandrum, and
with such marked differences in the annual variation of the declina
tion-range, we may conclude that this separation of inequalities has
been successfully          accomplished.          The proportional values of the
Trevandrum declination-range are given in Table II.

    points, the mean value of the range for the whole series for each

   6. The results of Tables           III and  IV   are exhibited    in the diagram
which accompanies this paper.
   In    fig. 1 we have a curve representing           the nine-monthly values of
spotted area.
   In   fig. 2 we have the Kew and in fig. 3 the Trevandrum declina
tion curve represented           by nine-monthly values of the proportional
numbers.
   In fig. 4 we have a curve representing the mean between the pro
portional numbers of Kew and those of Trevandrum.
   From these figures it will be seen that a lagging behind the sun
is a feature both of the Kew and the Trevandrum curves, while
generally the prominent points in the Kew and Trevandrum curves
agree well together in point of time.
   On the whole it would appear that by taking the mean of the pro
 portional numbers for the two stations, we get a curve that represents
 the solar curve better than one derived from a single station.
    The whole period compared together represents both for the solar
 curve (fig. 1) and the mean curve (fig. 4), a series of three smaller
 periods, one extending from B to C and embracing the maximum ;
 another extending from C to c, and a third from c to e ; and this is as
 far as the observations common to both stations allow us to go in
 point of time.
    7. It may be of interest to compare, by means of the tables, the period
 between the solar minimum of 1855 and that of 1867, with the period
 between the corresponding declination-range minima. The first of these
 declination minima occurred at Trevandrum (the Kew observations
 not having then begun) on February 15, 1856, and the second of

1878.]                Declination at Trevandrum.                      87
them occurred    at Kew (the Trevandrum observations having been
discontinued)   on August 15, 1867.     The period is thus one of eleven
years and six months.
   On the other hand, the sun-spot period is that between September
15, 1855, and March 15, 1807, being likewise eleven years and six
months.
     C. Variations which seem to depend on  Planetary Configurations.
   8. In a paper on the Kew declination-range already alluded to, it
was shown that the planetary periods of most frequent occurrence
appear to be well indicated by the results of sixteen years' observa
tions.   Indeed, for the two periods of shortest length — that of
Mercury about the sun, and that of Mercury and Jupiter, it was found
that half of the observations gave a result of the same character as
the whole sixteen years.
   From this we might conclude that these periods will probably (if
they have a real existence) be indicated by the Trevandrum observa
tions.
   It will be seen from the following tables that the Trevandrnm
declination-ranges give results for these two planetary periods very
similar to those given by the Kew observations.

III.  " Note on the Value of Euler's Constant ; likewise on the
      Values of the Napierian Logarithms of 2, 3, 5, 7, and 10,
      and of the Modulus of common Logarithms, all earned to
      260 places of Decimals."           By Professor J. C. Adams, M.A.,
       F.R.S. Received December 6, 1877.
   In       " Proceedings of the Royal
        the                                 Society," vol. xix, pp. 521, 522,
Mr. Glaisher has given the values of the logarithms of 2, 3, 5, and 10,
and of Euler's constant to 100 places of decimals, in correction of
some previous results given by Mr. Shanks.
   In vol. xx, pp. 28 and 31, Mr. Shanks gives the results of his
re-calculation of the above-mentioned logarithms and of the modulus
of common logarithms to 205 places, and of Euler's constant to 110
places of decimals.
   Having calculated the value of 31 Bernoulli's numbers, in addition
to the 31 previously known,       I was induced to carry the approximation
to Euler's constant to a much greater extent than had been before
practicable.                        I
                For this purpose likewise re-calculated the values of the
above-mentioned logarithms, and found the sum of the reciprocals of
the first 500 and of the first 1000 integers, all to upwards of 260
places of decimals.      I also found two independent relations between
the logarithms just mentioned and the logarithm of 7, which furnished
a test of the accuracy of the work.

   On comparing my results with those of Mr. Shanks, I found that
the latter were all affected by an error in the 103rd and 104th places
of decimals, in consequence of an error in the 104th place in the deter-

                    g^.
Mr. Shanks were found to be correct to 202 places of decimals.
   The error in the determination      of log,  10,  of course entirely vitiated
Mr. Shanks' value of the modulus from the 103rd place onwards.                As
he gives the complete remainder, however, after the division by his
value of log, 10,   I was enabled readily to find the correction to be
applied to the erroneous value of the modulus.             Afterwards   I tested
the accuracy of the entire work by multiplying the corrected modulus
by my value of log, 10.
   Mr. Shanks' values of the sum of the reciprocals of the first 500
and of the first 1000 integers, as well as his value of Euler's constant,
were found to be incorrect from the 102nd place onwards.

where B„    B2, B„ &c., are the successive Bernoulli's numbers.
   Then if Euler's constant     be denoted by    E, we shall have
                          E=S.+R.-^-log.n,
and the error committed by stopping at any term in the convergent
part of R. will be less than the value of the next term of the series.
     I have calculated accurately the values of the Bernoulli's numbers
as far as BK, and approximately as far as B100, retaining a number of
significant figures varying from 35 to 20.
   When «=1000, the employment of the numbers up to BM suffices to
give the value of R^ to 265 places of decimals.             When «=500, it is
necessary    to employ the approximate         values up to    B71, in order to
determine R^,    with  an equal degree of    exactness.
   In   order to reduce   as   much as possible the number of quantities

which must be added together to find &m and SIOOO, have resolved the
reciprocal of every integer up to 1000 into fractions whose denomina
tors are primes or powers of primes.
   Thus Sjo,, and SIOOO may be expressed by means of such fractions,
and by adding or subtracting one or more integers, each of these

   This mode of finding SM and S1000 is attended with the advantage
that if an error were made in the calculation of the former of these
quantities, it would not affect the latter.
   The logarithms required have been found in the following manner : —
    Let log — =a, log     2^=6,     l°g§Q=c, log-^=d, and log^=e.
   Then we have
     log 2=7a—2b + Sc,       log3=lla-36        + 5e, log 5=16a-46 + 7c.
   Also                 log   7=\ (39a-10&+17e-d)             j
or again,                   log 1— 19a—     46 + 8c +   e,
and we have the equation of condition,
                                a— 2b+c=d+2e,
which supplies a sufficient test of the accuracy of the calculations by
which a, b, c, d, and e have been found.
                     Since log   ™= -log
                                              (l-^)

If we have settled beforehand on the number of decimal places which
we wish to retain, and have already formed the decimal values of the
reciprocals of the successive integers to the extent required, then the
formation of the values of a, 6, c, d, and e, will only involve operations
which, though numerous, are of extreme simplicity.

nerve,      even when      the nerves were        alternately      stimulated so      as   to
relieve one another.
   In 1875, Tarchanoff and Puelma* stated, " Si l'on excite longtemps
un des pneumogastriques              du chien avec des courants forts jusqu'à
épuiser complètement            son  action  sur le cœur, ce qui se manifeste par
le retour de ses battements et si l'on passe immédiatement à l'excitation
de l'autre, on n'obtient pins d'arrêt du cœur, et même on n'observe au
cune altération de son activité : et pourtant le nerf excité en dernier
lien n'est alors, on le conçoit, nullement épuisé." From this experi
ment they concluded, " que chacun des pneumogastriques                          met en jeu
tout l'appareil modérateur            situé   dans les parois dn cœur          ; et qu'une
fois cet appareil épuisé par l'excitation d'un pneumogastrique,                        il ne
peut être mis en activité par l'excitation de l'autre."
     In 1876, Tarchanofft published observations on the frog, in which
he states that the behaviour of the frog's heart to vagus-stimula
tion is quite different, in respect of the mutual influence of the two
nerves, from the behaviour of the heart of dogs or rabbits :                           " J'ai
vu alors que si l'on attend pour exciter le second pneumogastrique
que le premier ait été épuisé par l'excitation, l'arrêt du cœur s'obtient
                                    "                          "
de la façon la plus nette ; and he concludes                      Que chez les mammi
fères les denx nerfs aboutissent à un appareil modérateur commun,
tandis que chez la grenouille chaque nerf aboutit à un appareil indé
pendant."
    Between the publication of Tarchanoff and Puelma's note and the
publication of Tarchanoff's later observations on the frog, the authors
 of this paper undertook to check Tarchanoff and Puelma's statement
 respecting mammals, and to extend the method of experiment to frogs.
 In the case of mammals, dogs and rabbits were used. They were
 rendered insensible by chloroform or ether, or subcutaneous injections
 of hydrochlorate of morphia. Their vagi were exposed in the neck
 and divided; and the peripheral ends loosely tied by ligatures.
 Arrangements were made to rapidly shunt an induced, interrupted cur
 rent from a Du Bois-Beymond's induction coil, from one vagus into the
 other, the peripheral ends of the nerves being laid over fine platinum
 electrodes for the purpose.           In all the experiments save one a Daniell
 cell was used to induce the currents. A cannula was placed in the
 femoral artery (in one case in the carotid artery) and connected with
 a kymograph, which wrote upon a moving sheet of paper.
    In the case of frogs, the brain, and sometimes the spinal cord, were
 destroyed by pithing ; a stout glass rod was thrnst down the gullet ;

the vagi were exposed and placed each on a pair of fine platinum elec
trodes ; and preparations were made for shunting an interrupted
current, by means of a commutator, from one nerve into the other,
just   as in the case of mammals.          Sometimes the heart was watched
directly and notes made.           At  other times care was taken to register
 the heart's rate, the lapse of time and the moments of stimulation.
 The heart's rate was indicated by means of Marey's Myographe du
caeur,* the time by an electromagnet           and Ludwig's Unterbrechungsuhr,
 and the moments of stimulation by a marking key, each holding a
 pointed lever against a smoked revolving cylinder.
     The general result of the experiments made by the authors of this
 paper, is the following : In all the animals hitherto examined (viz.,
 dogs, rabbits and frogs), if one vagus be stimulated powerfully so as at
 first to arrest the heart, and if after the heart has recommenced to
 contract, the current be at once shunted to the other vagus, arrest again
 occurs : in some cases, however, on again reversing to the vagus first
 stimulated, no effect is produced.          This result may be formulated as
 follows: Stimulation        of one   vagus never annuls, or even prejudices,
 the inhibiting powers of the other vagus, unless when the inhibiting
 apparatus has been recently under stimulat ion for some time.             It  would
 therefore seem that Tarchanoff, in asserting the mutual prejudicial
 action of vagus-stimulations in mammals, and denying it in frogs, has
 missed one half of the truth         in the  case  of the former, and the other
 half in the case of the latter.
     In illustration of their      statement     of results of experiments,      the
 authors append a reduced kymographic tracing of a dog.                 The animal
 was a young terrier, and the experiment was made in the manner
 above described.       The arterial cannula leading to the kymograph was
 introduced into the femoral artery.
     The upper line is the tracing of the kymograph, the middle line is
  the line of no pressure, and the lower line is divided into intervals of
  five seconds.     The tracing reads from left to right. Quite at the left
  of the figure a small portion of the normal tracing is represented.
  At 2h. 25m. 15s., a stimulus was thrown into the left vagus, the
  secondary coil being 6 cm. from the primary. At once the heart
  stopped and the blood-pressure fell.          The heart recommenced, and at
  2h. 25m.   32s.  the  current   was   shut  off from the nerve. It remained
  off about 10 seconds, and at the expiration of that interval the current
  was thrown into the right vagus.            Again the heart stopped, and re
  mained motionless until 2h. 26m. 25s., a period of 43 seconds, the
  current, of course, passing the whole of the time.               The heart then
  began to beat, and the blood-pressure rose towards the normal rapidly.
  At 2h. 26m. 53s. the current was shunted out of the right vagus into
  the left, the nerve first stimulated, and once more the pulse ceased and

  the pressure   fell.  At 2h. 27m.    15s.  the pressure quickly rose,- not
  withstanding the continued stimulation ; until at 2h. 27m. 45s. the
  current was broken and the experiment brought to a close.
     It seems to the authors that the generally accepted theory of the
  connection of the vagus nerves with a common intermediate apparatus
  is fully competent to cover the facts established by A. B. Meyer,
  Tarchanoff and Puelma, and themselves. Each vagus abuts against a
  common nervous apparatus, through which every inhibitory stimulus
 must pass to reach the cardiac muscle.               It is only necessary to
 suppose   — and the supposition, as it will be shown, is not gratuitous —
 that the exhaustibility of the vagi is far greater than that of the com
 mon mechanism they lead to, in order to gain a consistent view of
 the facts.   When one vagus is stimulated with a strong current, the
 heart, after a longer or shorter period of diastolic rest, gradually
 escapes from the inhibitory influence of the stimulus. This escape
 must not bo supposed to be due to the gradual exhaustion of the whole
 inhibiting apparatus, but merely to that of the vagus which is stimu
 lated.    The heart escapes, not because its guard is enfeebled, but be
 cause the warrant for detention miscarries.          On shunting the current
 into the other vagus, the intermediate apparatus is at once roused and
 the heart stopped.
     So much greater   are the enduring powers of the intermediate ap
 paratus that, even in the mammal, where, presumedly, they are more
 easily exhausted than in the frog, the intermediate apparatus seems
 capable of tiring out relay after relay of reinvigorated vagi. Indeed,
it would appear to be next to impossible, by the most careful and
jndicious alternate stimulation of the vagi, to cause exhaustion of the
intermediate apparatus ; for, after stimulating the vagi alternately a
few times, the interval during which each vagus can hold the heart in
check becomes too brief for the recovery of the resting vagus. Never
theless, when this stage has been reached, it is always possible (in the
frog) at once to stop the heart by applying an induced, interrupted
current to the sinus venoms, even if the current so applied be weaker
than that passing previously through the vagus nerves.
    But, although the authors believe that the intermediate apparatus
can, in health, easily wear out the organised attacks of the vagi,
particularly in the case of frogs, yet they think it not improbable
that, in conditions unfavourable to the restorative processes, the in
termediate apparatus     may occasionally     succumb     to successive vagus-
stimulations, especially in the case of mammals.            They are, however,
convinced that the latter alternative very rarely occurs.
      The assumption of such enormous powers of endurance for the in
termediate mechanism is not gratuitous.           As long ago as 1869, A. B.
Meyer* pointed out that the heart of the frog could be inhibited

for hoars    by carefully applying interrupted currents to the sinus
venomu;    and although the authors of this paper, in repeating the
experiment, have sometimes   failed to inhibit indefinitely — as did also
Meyer
       — they have always found it possible to stop the heart for very
long  intervals by stimulating the sinus venosw ; even with weaker
currents than had just before sufficed to exhaust simultaneously      the
inhibiting powers of both vagi.

       Natural    Philosophy in the Royal Institution.   Received

  In " Poggendorf 's Annalen for 1836, Franz Schulze described an
experiment which has attained considerable celebrity.    He placed in a
flask a mixture of vegetable and animal matters and water ; through
the cork of the flask two glass tubes passed air-tight, each being bent
at a  right angle above the cork. He boiled the infusion ; and while
steam issued from the two glass tabes, he attached to each of them a
group of Liebig's bulbs, one group being filled with solution of caustic
potash, and the other with concentrated sulphuric acid.        Applying
his mouth on the potash side, he sucked air daily through the sul
phuric acid into the flask.   But, though the process was continued
from the end of May till the beginning of August, no life appeared.
   In this experiment, the germs diffused in the atmosphere are sup
posed to have been destroyed by the sulphuric acid, and doubtless this
was the case.    Other experimenters, however, in repeating the experi
ment of Schulze, have failed to obtain his results.    The experiments
of Dr. Hughes Bennett arc a case in point, to which I might add
certain fail ures of my own.   Schulze's success    perhaps, in part to
                                                     is,
be ascribed to the purity of the air in which he worked         possibly,
                                                                 ;
also, to extreme care in drawing the air into his flask    or,
                                                           ;     it

that the peculiar disposition of his experiment favoured him.  Within
the flask, as shown by his diagram, both his glass tubes terminated
immediately under the cork, so that the air, entering by the one tube,
was    immediately sucked into the other, thus failing to mix completely
with the general air of the flask.
  At a very moderate rate of transfer,     found, in 1869, that germs
                                            I
could pass unscathed through caustic potash and sulphuric acid in
succession.   To render the experiment secure, the air-bubbles must
pass so slowly through the sulphuric acid, that the floating matter, up
to the very core of every bubble, must come into contact with the
surrounding liquid.      It   must, of course, touch the acid before     it   can
be destroyed.
                                                                     h   2

     Reflecting on this experiment, and knowing that a sealed chamber,
  simply wetted within, suflices to detain the floating matter coming
  into contact with its interior surface,   I thought that the same must
  hold good for the air-bubbles passing through a group of Liebig's
  bulbs.   Every bubble, in fact, represents a closed chamber of infini
  tesimal size, and it seemed plain that if the walls of this chamber were
 formed of water instead of sulphuric acid, the floating matter would
 be effectually intercepted.     This was a conclusion arrived at last
  summer, in the Alps.      On my return to London        I tested the con
  clusion, and found it verified by experiment.
     Two large test-tubes, each about two-thirds filled with turnip in
  fusion, were so connected together, that air could be drawn through
 them in succession.     With a view to their sterilization, the tubes were
 subjected for a sufficient time to the action of boiling water, and
 permitted to remain afterwards in a room kept at a temperature of
 90° Fahr., until it was evident that sterilization had been complete.
 Two narrow tubes, passed through the cork of each test-tube, in the same
 manner as in Schulze's flask, and it was so arranged that the tube which
 delivered the air should end near the surface of the liquid, the exit
 tube in each case ending immediately under the cork.         Two series of
 Liebig's  bulbs,  charged  with  pure water,   were  attached to the two
 unds of this arrangement; one series being connected with a large-
 receiver, placed on the plate of an air-pump, and the other left open
to the air. The connection between the receiver and the adjacent
series of bulbs being first cut off by a pinch-cock, the receiver was
exhausted, and, by carefully loosening the pinch-cock, a very slow
passage of the air through the test-tubes was secured.          The rate of
transfer was, however, such, that the air above the infusions was re
newed twenty or thirty times in twenty-four hours.              At the end
of twelve days, during which this process was continued day and night,
the turnip juice was perfectly pellucid and free from life.       Two days'
exposure to ordinary air sufficed to render the infusion muddy.
    After twelve days the pinch-cock was opened, so as to allow a
momentary inrush of the external air, which was immediately checked
by the reclosing of the cock.     Three days afterwards, the infusion of
the test-tube, into which the air first entered, was muddy and crowded
with life.    The contamination did not reach the second test-tube,
which remains to the present hour intact. Other experiments of a
similar character have been executed with precisely the same result.
I  will not occupy the Society's time by describing them. Suffice it to
say, that they completely verify the conclusion that, in Schulze's ex
periment, water may be substituted for sulphuric acid and caustic
potash without any alteration in the result.

III.   "Experimental Contribution to the Etiology of Infectious
       Diseases with special reference to the Doctrine of Contagium
       vivura."      By E. Klein, M.D., F.R S. Received February 4,
       1878.
    The present communication has for its object to bring before the
Royal Society the results of an experimental inquiry * into the etiology
of an infectious disease of the pig, known as Hog Plague, Mai Rouge,
Red Soldier, Malignant Erysipelas, or also Typhoid Fever of the Pig.
There are English and continental writers who describe the disease as
Anthrax or Splenic Fever of the Pig. I shall show, however, conclu
sively, in my Report to the Medical Officer of the Local Government
Board, that it is neither typhoid fever nor anthrax, but is an infectious
disease of its own kind, which          I propose to call
                                                             " Infectious Pneumo-
Enteritis of the Pig " (Pneumo-enteritis contagiosa).
    Like other infectious diseases, the " Pneumo-Enteritis " possesses an
incubation period, followed by constitutional disturbance and certain
anatomical changes. These latter are invariably affections of the lung,
of the intestine, and of the lymphatic glands, not only of those of the
organs of respiration and alimentation, but also those of the inguinal
and lumbar regions.           In the lung the changes are those known to
pathologists as lobular pneumonia.                 In the alimentary canal the
mncons membrane of the large intestine is chiefly affected, being the
seat of smaller or larger ulcerations.            There is generally also inflam
 mation of the serous membranes, especially the peritoneum, leading to
.in exudation of lymph into the serous cavity. The skin is occasionally
affected with greater or smaller red patches.
    There are hsemorrhagic patches to be found in the lung and serous
membranes, the endocardium, and the muscle of the heart, the mucous
membrane of the intestine (especially duodenum and large intestine),
the tongue, and occasionally also the liver and spleen, only seldom in
the skin and kidney.
    In anatomical respects, therefore, the Pneumo-Enteritis bears un
doubtedly a great resemblance to anthrax or splenic fever. There
exists, however, a marked difference between the two diseases in the
incubation period, the general pathology, f and especially in the ana
tomical character of the spleen and blood. In splenic fever we find the
spleen invariably enlarged, being the principal organ of the affection,
   * This being part of a larger  research  carried out for the medical officer of the
Local Government Board.
   + In splenic fever the period of incubation ranges from between a few hours to
several days, in pneumo-enteritis it varies from two to five days and more. Splenic
fever is easily transmissible to man and the domestic animals, whereas the transmissi-
bility of the pneumo-enteritis is much more limited. Hitherto     I have succeeded in
communicating it to rabbits, guinea-pigs and mice, although only with difficulty.

102                                  Dr. Klein on      the                      [Feb. 14
whereas in pneumo-enteritis it is only occasionally changed. And, like
wise, the blood presents entirely different characters in the two
diseases ; in pneumo-enteritis it is not different in any marked degree
from norma] blood, whereas in splenic fever it is of dark colour — laky,
and does       not coagulate at all, or only imperfectly so.                 Besides,   the
blood in splenic fever contains the now famous Bacillus anthracis,                     and
hence its conspicuous infectious property, whereas in pneumo-enteritis
the fresh blood does not, as a rule, contain any foreign matter, and in
most instances does not possess any infectious property.
    Another disease with which pneumo-enteritis bears a great resem
blance on account of certain anatomical characters, viz., inflammation
of serous membranes, lung, intestine, and lymphatic glands, haemor
rhage     in lung, serous membranes, endocardium muscle of heart, in.
testinal mucous membrane, and other organs — is specific septicaemia.*
    The resemblance, however, is not greater than to splenic fever,
although the differences are not less well marked.                        Besides others,
there is this great distinction, that in pneumo-enteritis the contagion
spreads by simple cohabitation, and through the air, which it neTer
does in septicaemia, as in this the virus always requires a broken surface
through which to enter a healthy individual.
    Pneumo-enteritis        is occasionally described as malignant erysipelas
(mal rouge, red soldier), but this is in so far inadmissible, as the affec
tion of the skin in the former is a very inconstant symptom, and in
milder forms of the disease is invariably absent. More recently the
pneumo-enteritis has been regarded as typhoid fever of the pig. From
a purely anatomical point of view, the resemblance between real, i.e.,
human, typhoid fever and pneumo-enteritis                    is very slight indeed, so
slight, in fact, that to          mention    it requires    a  total oversight of some
of the most prominent symptoms, e.g., inflammation of lung and serous
membranes, enlargement of inguinal, lumbar, and bronchial lymphatic
glands, haemorrhages in the endocardium and muscle of the heart in
pneumo-enteritis on the one hand, swelling and ulceration of the lym
 phatic glands of the small intestine, swelling and inflammation of
 spleen in real typhoid fever on the other hand.                        The resemblance
 seems to be limited solely to the fact that in both diseases ulceration
 occurs in the intestine.             But the distribution, the nature, and the
 development of these ulcerations is totally different in the two diseases.
    Having said thus much as a prefatory explanation,                   I proceed   to state
 the results of the experiments.t

    f  In all my experiments of inoculation the materies morbi was used in minimal
 doses, i.e., a drop of fluid matter, or in the case of solids a particle of less than the
 size of a pin's head.     In both cases the materies morbi was diluted or suspended
 respectively in a few minims of boiled saline solution of       i per cent, in order to in

    The experiments refer to the following series : —
    1. Experiments showing that the fresh blood of diseased animals
does not, as a rule, contain the virus, as it fails to produce the disease
when introduced into a healthy animal.
    Four animals were inoculated (at different times) with fresh blood
of diseased animals. They remained healthy. When subsequently
inoculated with virus-containing matter, they became smitten with
the disease.
    In a fifth instance, however, fresh blood did produce infection.
[And this same blood proved active after having been kept sealed up
in a capillary tube for several weeks.] This blood was obtained from
a very severe case with copious peritoneal exudation, in which were
found peculiar abnormally largo coarsely granular cells; the same
cells were also present in the blood ; so that it appears probable that
the blood became charged, by absorption during life, with matter
from the peritoneal exudation.             This latter always contains the virus
in   an active state.
    2. Experiments showing that fluid as well as solid lymph of the
diseased peritoneum contains the virus in a very active state.
    Six successful inoculations with fluid peritoneal exudation.
    There is no difference of activity to be noticed between fresh
exudation and one that had been kept sealed up in a capillary tube
for   several weeks.
    Solid lymph obtained from the peritoneal cavity of diseased animals,
having been dried at a temperature of about 38° C, proves very
active.
    3. Experiments showing that parts of the diseased lung, ulcerated
 intestine, and also diseased spleen, contain the virus in an active state.
Diseased parts of lung or intestine, that were dried at a temperature
of about 38° C, retain their virulence unaltered.
    In all cases of pneumo-enteritis the trachea as well as the bronchi
contain frothy blood-containing mucous matter, possessed of infectious
property.       It must be, therefore, supposed that the breath of a
diseased animal is charged with the poison.                      On account of the
diseased state of the intestine also,          the  dung    is to  be regarded as in
fectious.
    4. Experiments showing that infection is produced                  by cohabitation
crease its bulk and thus to facilitate its introduction.   The inoculation was invariably
 carried out by injection  into the  subcutaneous   tissue by means of a fine canula of
a hypodermic syringe, necessary care being taken that this had been previously
thoroughly cleaned and disinfected.       After and before inoculation the animals have
always been kept isolated and in clean and disinfected places.        In order to insure
reliable results (viz., that the disease in a particular case was really a consequence
of the inoculation and not of infection through other sources) care was taken that
 those who attended the isolated animals were not the carriers of infection.

                                    Dr. Klein on     the                     [Feb.   14,
with a diseased animal,            or by keeping healthy animals            in a place
whence a diseased animal had been removed.
    5. Several experiments were made to see whether feeding healthy
animals on matter obtained from the diseased organs (intestinal ulcers
especially) produces the disease.           The experiment was always attended
with success, if an abrasion existed in the mucous membrane of the
mouth or pharynx ; this was usually the case when the matter had
to be introduced into the mouth while the animal was being held by
assistants.
    There were, however,           two   cases   which appear to prove that           the
disease cannot be produced by simple feeding.
    This was, unfortunately, at a time when             I  was not acquainted, yet,
with the fact that in many animals the disease is of so mild* a form
that it can hardly be recognized in the living.                I  did not make any
post-mortem       examination     of  those  two   animals.
    But since then        I  have made two other experiments, in which the
virus was brought directly into the stomach, by means of an india-
rubber tube introduced per fauces et cesophagnm.                       In both these
instances the animals became diseased and their intestines were most
conspicuously affected.
    From the last three          series of experiments       we may conclude that
the principal mode by which contagion of pneumo-enteritis is carried
out, is through the instrumentality of the air and the food.
    6. This series comprises experiments to prove that the virus can be
cultivated artificially, i.e., outside the body of an animal ; in the case
of splenic fever it has been successfully done by Dr. Koch.
    The experiments are seven in number, (a), two refer to cultivations
started with fluid peritoneal exudation ; (6), in the five others the
virus had been obtained by cultivation of dried lymph of the peri
toneum of an animal suffering from the disease.
    (a.) The cultivation of the viros for the first two cases was carried
out thus :
    Fluid peritoneal exudation of a diseased animal had been collected
and sealed up on November 6, in a capillary glass tube.                         On the
following day there was present a small clot due to coagulation.                        A
 minute speck of this clot was removed with the point of a clean
 needle, and with it was inoculated a drop of fresh aqueous humour of
a healthy rabbit.         This drop had been placed on a thin covering-glass,
 which, after the inoculation, is inverted over a small " cell," made by
 fixing a glass-ring* on an ordinary glass-slide.              The covering-glass is
 fastened on the glass-ring by means of a thin layer of pure olive-oiL
    * The   glass  ring I  used is O'S to 2 millimetres high, about 2 mm. thick, and
 about  1 8 mm.   wide.   If the preparation is to be observed on the hot-stage of the
 microscope, instead of the ordinary glass-slide, one of only 0"5 mm. thickness is chosen
 in order to bring the preparation more rapidly up to the desired temperature.

The preparation was then kept in the incubator for twenty-four hours
at a temperature of 32-33° C. After this time it was used to in
oculate a new drop of humor aqueous in a similar manner as the one
just described. We will call this the second generation.
   This new specimen was placed in the incubator and kept there at a
temperature     of 32-33° C, for further twenty-four hours.           In the
same manner a third generation was started by inoculating a fresh
drop of humor aqueous. After having been kept in the incubator
for several days it was used to inoculate two animals at different times.
Both animals became smitten with the disease.
    (6.) The other five experiments were carried out with virus culti
vated from solid lymph of the peritoneum of a diseased animal.            The
lymph had been dried at 38° C (See Series 2). A small particle of
dried lymph is crushed into fine powder. With a granule of this a
drop of fresh humor aqueous is inoculated in the same manner as above
described.   — First  generation.
   After having been kept in the incubator for two or three days at a
temperature of 32-33° C, it is used to inoculate a second generation,
care being taken to use a trace only of the fluid part and not to come in
direct contact with the original granule, which may be still discerned
in the preparation.
   The specimen representing the second generation is kept in the in
cubator for a day or two. It is then used to inoculate a fresh prepa
ration. — Third generation.       And, finally, this is used for establishing
a fonrth generation.      After having been kept in the incubator, a part
of it is used for inoculating two animals, the inoculation being carried
out at different times.      Both these animals become smitten with the
disease.
   Another portion of this fourth generation was used to start a fifth
generation, then a sixth, a seventh, and an eighth generation.          With
this three animals were inoculated at different times.             All three
animals became diseased in due time.
   In order to correctly interpret tbf results of this last (6th) series of
experiments, it is important to mention that inoculation with dried
lymph, diluted far less than would correspond to the third generation
in the last-named experiments, is followed by a negative result.
   The microscopic examination of the cultivated liquids proves that
these are the seat of the growth and development of a kind of bac
terium, which has all the characters of bacillus subtilis (Cohn).         The
bacillus  in our  case is a very fine and   delicate  rod, thinner than  both
that described by Professor Cohn in hay-infusion, and the bacillus
anthracis so thoroughly investigated by Dr. Koch.
   Our bacillus differs also in other respects from that of bacillus an
thracis, inasmuch as it possesses a moving stage, the bacillus anthracis
described by Dr. Koch is non-moving.           Like bacillus snbtilis of hay

and bacillus anthracis,  our bacillus grows under favourable conditions
into long leptothrix-like filaments, which occasionally form more or
less complex convolutions.
   In these filaments highly refractive spores make their appearance.
These become free after the disintegration of the original filamentous
matrix. The fully developed spores of our bacillus differ from those
of hay-bacillus and anthrax-bacillus by being more distinctly cylin
drical and much smaller.* According to Professor Cohn (Beitrage
zur Biologie der Pflanzen II, 2, 1876, p. 264) the long diameter of the
spores of bacillus of hay and also of anthrax — for both are identical
in morphological respects (I.e., p. 275) — amounts to 0-0015— O0022 mm.
or "ibmo* of an inch, whereas the spores of our bacillus are little less than
O'OOOSmm. or           of an inch in their long diameter,          At first f                  I
misinterpreted the spores, regarding them as a kind of micrococci,
and only after repeated observations have I succeeded in tracing them
through their different stages of development.
   After many failures — owing to the introduction and development of
bacterium termo — I succeeded at last in obtaining, already in the
second generation of original virus, a pure crop of bacillus and its
spores. With these I started several separate cultivations, in which the
germination of the spores into delicate bacillus, the swarming stage,
the rapid multiplication by division, their growth into long apparently
smooth filaments, and, under sufficient access of air, the formation
of the bright cylindrical spores in them could be distinctly traced.t
     •In the figures accompanying Dr. Koch's paper on bacillus anthracis (Beitr. i.
Biologie d. Pflanzen         1876) the spores are represented in many places as more
                      ii,   2,
or less spherical in shape.
     t In convolutions of filaments the outlines of these latter become gradually lost
after the spores are formed. The spores appear now to be embedded in a trans
parent gelatinous matrix.       At the edges of such masses or where they are in               a
sufficiently thin layer, the linear arrangement of the sporcf can be still recognised.
But      there undoubtedly

ground substance for the spores and fibres.        Professor Cohn mentions         c, p. 263)

is not the highly refractive spore which directly produces the bacillus, but that the
hyaline gelatinous envelope surrounding each spore elongates so as to form the
bacillus, while the bright spore-matter itself gradually diminishes in size and finally
disappears.    From priori reasons
                      d               it impossible to assume that this can be so, viz.,

that the gelatinous envelope should grow into the bacillus   for Cohn proved beyond

become, under these conditions, deprived of its germinating power.          Direct ob

   Seeing that splenic fever, pneumo-enteritis, and specific septicaemia
possess a great affinity in anatomical respects, and seeing that in
splenic fever and pneumo-enteritis the materies morbi is a definite
species of bacillus — the difference of species being sufficiently great
to account for the differences in the two diseases — we may with some
probability expect that also the third of the group, viz., specific septi
caemia, is due to a bacillus.      This, however, remains to be demon
strated. It seems, finally, justifiable to speculate whether or not we
have in these three varieties of disease " a variation of species " in
the sense of the evolution theory.

       graphy."         By J. Norman Lockyer, F.R.S.        Received

   The results obtained by the Eclipse Expedition to Siam have lead
me to think that, possibly, the method of using the Coronal atmosphere
as a circular slit, suggested by Professor Young and myself for the
Indian Eclipse of 1871, might be applied under very favourable condi
tions, if the prism, or train of prisms, hitherto employed, were replaced
by one of those reflection gratings with which the generosity of
Mr. Rutherfurd has endowed so many of our observers.
   To test this notion I have made some experiments with a grating,
which    Iowe to Mr. Rutherfurd's kindness, containing 17,280 lines to
the inch. The results of these observations           I
                                                  have now the honour of
laying before the Royal Society.
   In front of the lens of an ordinary electric lamp, which lens was
adjusted to throw a parallel beam, I introduced a circular aperture, cut
in cardboard, forming an almost complete ring, some 2 inches in
interior diameter, the breadth of the ring being about              \
                                                              inch. This
was my artificial eclipse.
                                                            I
   At a distance from the lamp of about 13 yards, mounted a 3J inch
Cooke telescope, of 54 inches focal length.       Some distance short of
this focus    I placed  Mr.  Rutherfurd's   grating, and, where the first
                           I
order spectrum fell, placed a focussing screen. To adjust for sharp
focus, in the first instance, the grating was so inclined to the axis of

states (1. c, p. 265) " Die Sporen schwollen etwas an und trieben an einem Ende einen
kurzen Keimschlauch."

the telescope that the image of the ring reflected by the silver surface
adjacent to the grating was thrown on to the screen.     This done, the
grating was placed at right angles to the axis, and the spectrum of the
circular slit, illuminated by sodium vapour and carbon vapour, photo
graphed for the first, second, and third orders on one side. The third
order spectrum, submitted to the Society with this communication,
showing the exquisite rings due to the carbon vapour flutings,
was produced in 42 seconds.     The first order spectrum, also sub
mitted to the Society, was produced in the same period of time, and
was very much over-exposed.     Tt is, therefore,          I
                                                  think not expect
ing too much that we should be able to take a photograph of the
eclipse, in the third order, in two minutes ; but let us make it four.
Similarly, we may hope for a photograph of the second order in two
minutes, and it       think, highly probable also that photograph of
                     is,

the first order may be obtained in one minute.
   It clear then that, by mounting photograhic plates on both sides
       is
of the axis, one solidly mounted equatorial of short focal length may
enable us to obtain       large number of photographs, with varying
                            a
lengths  of  exposure,  of  the next eclipse.     have insisted upon the

during the whole of totality, the instrument must not be violently dis
turbed or shaken while the eclipse      going on.
                                            is       think, however,
                                                       I               is  it
quite possible to obtain several photographs, of the lower order spectra,
without any such disturbance.     The same plate may be made to record
three, or even four, exposures in the case of the first order in an
eclipse of four minutes' duration, by merely raising or lowering it
after a given time, by means of a rapid screw or other equivalent
contrivance, so that a fresh portion of the same plate may be exposed.
Similarly, the plates on which the spectra of the second order are to
be recorded may be made to perform double duty.
  If  one equatorial thus mounted were to be devoted to each quadrant
of the  coronal atmosphere,       it   is
                                 certain,  think, that most important

 I. " On the Alteration of the Thermal Conductivity of Iron
      and Steel caused by Magnetism." By Herbert Tomlin
      son, B.A., Demonstrator of Natural Philosophy, King's
      College, London.         Communicated       by Professor Stokes,
      Sec. Roy. Soc.      Received December 17, 1877.
   The writer has, for several months, been engaged in experimenting
on the   alteration of the electrical and thermal conductivity of iron
and steel, produced by magnetism, with the intention of determining
such alteration in absolute measure.         But as, before the complete
determination of the data sufficient for the purpose, a considerable
time must elapse, he would venture to offer to the Society, in a pre
liminary note, some results which have already been obtained by him.
   In these experiments, the apparatus chiefly employed to impart
magnetism consisted of an electro-magnet, with soft iron cores, 1 inch
in diameter and 5 inches in length, surrounded by cotton-covered
copper wire, -rVtti of an inch in diameter, having a resistance of nearly
1 ohm, and a coil constructed       as follows : — a thin tube of polished
tin, 1^ inch internal diameter and 4£ inches long, was covered with
vulcanised caoutchouc to a depth of -j^th of an inch, and on this
was wound 3 lbs. of cotton-covered          copper wire, ^gth of an inch
diameter, followed by 3 lbs. of wire, -nrth of an inch in diameter.
Inside the first tube was placed a second, 1 inch internal diameter, con
nected by ebonite with the first at the two ends, the second tube being
concentric with the first, and of the same length, so that, between the
inner tube and the outer, should be interposed a layer of air nearly
£th of an inch in thickness.     This arrangement was employed to pre
vent the heat from the magnetising coil reaching the bars placed
inside ; also, to prevent ingress or egress of heat ; the bars used with
the coil were covered with vulcanised caoutchouc, so that they lay
with their axes coinciding with the axis of the coil.
   To measure the heat conducted along the bars two sets of thermo
elements were constructed.        The first was made up of two small
strips of copper, £  inch long  and  \ inch broad, of small thickness.   To
these was soldered about 1 foot of silk-covered german-silver wire
 ¥V*h of an inch in diameter, the copper strips being also connected

 110          Mr. H. Tomlinson on Thermal Conductivity              [Feb. 21,
 with a galvanometer by copper wires, well covered with caoutchouc,
 one end of each being soldered to the copper strips, so that either one or
 both the copper strips with the soldered German-silver wires could be
employed as a thermo-element.        In case it was found convenient to use
only one of these, the other was kept well covered with sawdust.
 These elements    will be called  the G. S. elements.       The second con
 sisted of two small thermo-piles, each of 12 elements, of antimony and
bismuth, and were each fitted into india-rubber tubes, so that they
conld be inserted into small wooden boxes, containing water, so as to
fit water-tight. Sometimes these, like the G. S. elements, were used
separately ; at others, were made to neutralise         each others effect on
the galvanometer.
    With these elements, a delicate Thomson's reflecting galvanometer,
having   a resistance   of 2 ohms, was employed, the scale being placed
about 6 feet from    the  mirror of the needle.
    In the circuit of the magnetising current, a tangent galvanometer
was placed, the needle of which was suspended by a very fine platinum
wire, attached to a graduated torsion circle.          The two thick copper
wires which conveyed the current were each            27 centimetres   in dia
meter and 14 inches apart.
    A magnetometer was also employed to test the magnetism im
parted, but, as the readings will not be given in this paper, no de
scription of the instrument is necessary.
    To heat one end of the bars two large Leslie's cubes were employed,
having each two apertures projecting about 2 inches into the interior
of the cubes. The apertnres in one cube were inch square and placed
in one side of the cube, about 3 inches apart from each other, and
half way up the side. In the other cube the apertures were circular,
and \ inch in diameter, and placed in the centres of opposite sides
of the cube. Into these cnbes bars of square and circular section
were respectively inserted, and wafer filling the cubes was raised to
100° C.
    The first experiment was made on a soft iron bar,        \ inch square in
section.    The  bar   was  inserted   into the   Leslie's cube  with square
aperture, filled with boiling water, and into the other aperture was
inserted a brass bar of the same section.        The length of the iron bar
was about 10 inches, and of the brass one, 18 inches. One of the G. S.
elements was fastened on to the iron bar, and the other to the brass,
by caoutchouc bands, the elements being insulated from the bars by
thin paper. The G. S. elements were made to very nearly counteract
each others effect by sliding one or other of them up and down the
bars until the heat conducted by the bars to the elements was in both
the same as nearly as possible.         Underneath the bar was placed the
electro-magnet,   with   a piece  of  white  cardboard lying on the upper
extremities of the soft iron cores, so that the cores were about 3 milli

1878.]          of Iron and   Steel caused by Magnetism.               Ill
metres from the iron bar;      the bar was also propped by a wooden
support at the other end.     A preliminary experiment had been made
for the purpose of ascertaining whether the heat radiated from the
electro-magnet would affect the thermo elements to any appreciable
extent, and this was not found to be the case.
   The water in the cube was now kept boiling for about nine hours,
and after that time had elapsed it was ascertained that the flow of heat
from one part of the bars to another compensated the loss from radia
tion, and the light on the scale remained stationary.        (It should be
observed that, as it was impossible to cause one thermo-element
exactly to neutralise the other, a slight use of the adjusting magnet
of the galvanometer was made to bring the light near the zero of the
scale.) The current from a single bichromate cell was now sent throngh
the coil of the electro-magnet.     In a few moments the spot of light
began   to move   very slowly across  the scale in a direction indicating
that the flow of heat through the iron bar was being checked, and in
about fifteen minutes a deflection of about 25 divisions of the scale was
obtained ; the current of the cell was then stopped, when the light
began slowly to return, and finally settled in apparently the exact
position which it held before sending the current through the coil.
This experiment was repeated several times on the        same day, and on
several other days, but always with the same result as regards direction,
namely, showing a diminution of the flow of heat from longitudinal
magnetisation.
   As it was thought,  however, that the electro-magnet might when in
action perhaps produce an apparent diminution of flow of heat by
slightly disturbing the bar in its position in the aperture, though every
precaution had been used to prevent the chance of this, the bar in the
next set of experiments was securely soldered into the cube, and again
tested as before.   Here, again, some five or six trials gave the same
result, and seemed to show, most conclusively, that the thermal con
ductivity of soft iron is diminished by longitudinal magnetisation.
   As the method of observation, however, was tedious and would give
no idea of the amount of alteration of conductivity, other expedients
were now adopted.
   A piece of soft iron, BC, £ inch long, £ inch broad, and 2 milli
metres in thickness, was soldered, as in the figure, to two pieces of
brass, AB, CD, of the same breadth and thickness.

 112          Mr. H. Tomlinson on Thermal Conductivity          [Feb.  21,
    AB   was 2 inches long and CD 1 inch.
    The piece AB was also soldered to another piece of brass  AE, having
 a section f inch square, and length about 12 inches.
    The whole was placed inside a wooden box, 2 feet long, 1 foot wide,
 and 2 feet high, lined on the outside with tinfoil.
    AE passed through a circular hole, 2 inches in diameter, in the
 middle of one end of the box, and through two corresponding circular
 holes in a double screen of sheet tin, and thence into one of the
 square apertures of one of the Leslie's cubes. The electro-magnet was
 placed underneath BC, and two pieces of soft iron, about 3£ inches in
 length, £ inch in breadth, and about 2 millimetres in thickness, were
 placed on the ends of the soft iron cores, so as to be on the same level
 with BC, and distant from B and C about 2 millimetres, the pieces
 of iron being separated from the cores by a piece of white paper. In
 some experiments the pieces of iron thus used were carefully secured
 to the electro-magnet   by elastic straps, and, in others, by weights
 placed on them.     A preliminary experiment, made with the strongest
 current that was ultimately used with the electro-magnet, showed that
 neither were the iron pieces on the cores appreciably shifted on
 magnetising the coil, nor was the heat radiated from the coil sufficient
to produce any effect on one of the G. S. elements fastened by elastic
bands to the back of CD.        The other G. S. element was in this case
buried in sawdust, with which the box was now filled, so as to cover
completely the bars and electro magnet.      The sawdust also filled the
space between AB and CD, and the small portion of the brass bar AE,
which was between the box and the Leslie cube, was covered with
caoutchouc    and cotton wool.
    The lid of the box was now put on, and some time allowed to elapse
until the light remained steady on the scale.
    Boiling water was then put into the cube, and a burner placed
underneath.     Very shortly the light began to move across the scale,
showing that the heat had been conducted along the compound bar to
the thermo element, and then the number of divisions on the scale
passed over by the light was taken for each minute.       The adjusting
magnet of the galvanometer had in these and similar experiments to
be placed very low down in order that the number of divisions of the
scale passed over might not exceed 60 per minute.        When the light
reached one end of the scale the adjusting magnet was used to bring
it back again to the other.    In these and similar experiments it was
found that, after some time, either the number of divisions passed over
per minute increased or diminished very slowly or else remained
constant for some minutes.       The following observations were made
with the specimen in question, the light being near one end of the
scale.    The number of divisions passed over in consecutive minutes
was as follows (the magnetising current will be called M. C.) : —

The light was then near the other end of the scale, so the adjusting
magnet was employed to bring the light back again.                      The set of
experiments here given, the first of many, is rather an unfavourable one,
most of them giving results much closer together than those here given,
and, in several instances, the flow of heat would seem perfectly steady
for upwards of fifteen minutes.
   The observations of the first minute in each case were not taken, in
order to avoid error from very slight deviations of the galvanometer
needles caused by the action of the electro-magnet, which however was
placed at such a distance from the galvanometer, and in such a position
as not, in most cases, to produce any such deflection, and to give time
for the magnetism to produce its effect on the bar. It has been de
termined, that in experiments made in this manner, 1 minute seems
quite sufficient for the above-mentioned purpose.
   Taking A and C together, we obtain as a mean the number of
divisions passed over in 4 minutes with the M. C. not flowing 136 as
against 130 from B, with the current flowing ; again, from B and D,
with the current flowing, we obtained 121'5 as against 125, with the
current not flowing, so that, in both cases, there is a less mean flow
with the M. C. flowing than when it is not flowing.              The mean of this
particular set of experiments would give a decrease of flow, when the
bar is magnetised longitudinally, of about 3-6 per cent, of the whole
for a magnetising current, causing a deflection of the needle of the
galvanometer of 18'6°. The mean of all the observations for the
specimen, and for this current, gave a decrease of flow amounting to
3 3 per cent, of the whole.
   The electro-magnet was now turned through 90°, so as to magnetise
the iron transversely, and a similar set of experiments were made.
   Here, again, the result was most conclusive, and the mean of several
observations showed an increase of flow when the bar was magnetised
transversely, amounting to about 3'2 per cent, of the whole for the
same current strength.
   Thus, the decrease of conductivity in one case seems roughly to be

 equal to the increase in the other, but it is the intention of the author
 to make further researches into this part of the inquiry.
    The batteries employed in these and subsequent experiments were
 slight modifications of Daniell's batteries, which, though having a very
 small resistance, maintained a constant current for some hours. These
 batteries the writer hopes to have the honour of describing to the
 Society on a future occasion.
    Similar experiments were next made on a piece of hard steel, of
 similar dimensions to those of the iron, but the length of the brass bar,
 AB, was considerably shortened.
    The result of the experiments proved that there was a decrease of
 flow, amounting to about 4 per cent., of the whole, when the bar was
 magnetised longitudinally with a current producing a deflection of 18°
 on the tangent galvanometer, and an increase of flow when magnetised
 by a current of 10° C transversely, aanonnting to about 3 per cent, of
 the         (unfortunately, through accident at the time, the same
         whole
 magnetising current as used for longitudinal magnetisation could not
 be employed).
   This last result was rather unexpected, as, though Sir William
 Thomson has shown (Phil. Trans., Feb. 28, 1856) that the electric
  conductivity of hard steel is diminished when the steel is magnetised
  longitudinally, some experiments of the writer in the same direction
  (Proc. of Royal Society, June 17, 1875) seemed to show that, in the
  case of hard steel, the contrary effect is produced, while Joule has
  proved (Phil. Mag., 1847) that, while a bar of iron, or even steel
  which is so hard that a file will just touch

 G. S. elements being secured to one end and the other end inserted
 in a Leslie's cube. But here, again, there was undoubtedly a de
 crease of conductivity, when the bar was magnetised longitudinally.
 Of course, however, the mere fact of heating the bar at one end to
the temperature of boiling water would tend to soften the bar, and
the writer       not quite satisfied but that
                 is                               may be ascertained that,

 scribed   in the beginning of the paper, bat the effects produced were
 fonnd to be so much less for the hard steel than when the electro
 magnet was employed that it was found necessary to use the thermo
 piles, also mentioned above, and instead of employing the compen
 sating magnet to bring the light on to the scale to cause the two piles,
as much as possible, to neutralise each others effects. Accordingly the
 following arrangements were made : —
    Two bars of hard steel, S, each 3^ inches long and % inch in diameter,
 were soldered at each end to two copper rods, each about 4£ inches
in length and £ inch in diameter.        One copper terminal of each rod
was inserted, as in the figure, into a Leslie's cube, L, to a distance of
2 inches, and tbe other terminal into a small wooden box, varnished
inside witb shell-lac, and capable of containing about 120 cubic centi
metres of water.      The bars were well covered with caoutchouc ; KK
are double screens, PP the two thermo elements, so arranged as to
send their currents through the galvanometer       in opposite directions,
the wires connecting       them with each other and the galvanometer
being    well  covered  with   gutta-percha,  and passing through small
holes in the sides of the boxes.       The two compound bars were thus
made as exactly similar as possible, and also similarly placed, the only
difference being that produced by the magnetising cod, M, whose axis
coincided with that of the steel bar placed inside it.
                                          9
    The large boxes, B, were well filled with sawdust, and the lids
being put on, the whole affair was left for some time, until the light
remained steady on the scale. Boiling water was then poured into the
hole,  W, and   a burner lighted underneath the cube, whilst the aperture
at W, having been closed with a cork, the steam generated was allowed
to pass through a smaller aperture at A, connected by tubing with a
large vessel filled with water, for the purpose of condensing the steam.
   Both the small boxes had originally the same quantity of water
placed in them, and a previous experiment had shown that so exactly
similar was the heat conducted along the bars to the water in the

boxes, that when some two hours or so had elapsed, the rise of tem
perature of the water in each bos seemed as measured by an ordinary
thermometer, marked off in degrees centigrade, to be exactly the same,
namely, 10" C.
    But as the same experiment had shown that the pile in the box on
the left of the figure was very slightly more powerful than the other,
the water in the box on the right was diminished very carefully by
means of a small siphon, formed of india-rubber tubing, of very small
bore, which was kept closed by a pinch-cock at one end, the tube
passing through holes cut in the large box, through the sawdust, and
through a small hole cut in the lid of the small box, so as to dip
into the water.      The little siphon was always kept charged, and, by
means of the pinch-cock, any desired small quantity of water could be
extracted from the box.
   By this means it was found easy to make one pile so neutralise the
other that a very slight use (if any is necessary) of the adjusting
magnet was required, even when the magnet was near its most sensitive
position with respect to the galvanometer needle.
    On sending a current through the coil M, it was in a minute or so
seen that the conductivity of the hard steel was diminished by the
longitudinal magnetisation, and the amount of diminution was roughly
determined by finding the amount of water necessary to be extracted
from the box to again bring the light to the same slow rate of motion
(about 2 divisions per minute) which it had before passing the
magnetising cnrrent, and comparing this with the original amount
 of water in the box. The decrease of flow did not amount to 1 per
cent, of the whole, even with the strongest battery used (current
shown by the tangent galvanometer, 26°).
    This plan was found to be highly successful for determining whether
there was a diminution or not, but not equally so for determining the
amount     of decrease, owing to the great difficulty in this method of
 quickly makingthe light move at the same rate after magnetisation as
before.     Another method was therefore tried, which promises to give
 better results.
    The figure will perhaps best explain the plan now adopted          for
 making one pile completely neutralise the effect of the other.

    The same quantity of water was now put into each box, and the
 pile Pi being slightly more powerful than Pa, the shunt S was adjusted
 until there was little or no motion of the light on the scale.

 and thus the percentage of diminution of flow may be determined.
    A few resistance coils were very roughly constructed for use in the
 shunt, S, and an attempt made to ascertain the actual amount of
diminution of conductivity of the hard steel. This, again, appeared to
 be comparatively small, but as the coils used were not suitable for the
purpose, the result is not given.       But the writer has little reason to
doubt that, with resistance coils suitable for such thermo-electric
experiments, he will be able to measure, with fair accuracy, small
 variations of thermal conductivity in this way.
    It should be added that similar experiments to these were made
 with soft iron bars, both with and without copper terminals, but the
 result* of the experiments, of which altogether upwards of a hundred
 have now been made, show that in every case the thermal conductivity
 of soft iron is diminished by temporary longitudinal magnetisation and
jucreased by transverse magnetisation, whilst in the case of steel, of

 different degrees of hardness, at any rate, for the temperatures em
 ployed, magnetisation evidently produces the same kind of effect as
 with the soft iron. The amount of the alteration in the case of soft
 iron must have reached at least as high as 10 per cent., and may be
 greater.   The experiments which the writer has made on electrical
 conductivity have shown that this is also very appreciably altered
 by magnetism, at least 6 per cent., even when the magnetisation
 was evidently not complete (Proc. of R. S., June 17, 1875), and has
 some reasons for believing that the amonnt of alteration for thermal
 and electrical conductivity will be found to be not very different.       He
 hopes, however, to thoroughly investigate the whole subject.
    It should be mentioned here that Sir William Thomson (Phil.
 Trans., Feb. 28, 1856,) expresses a strong opinion that the experiments
 of Dr. Maggi on this subject, on which he says doubts have been
 thrown by others, would be found correct, basing his opinion on the
results of his own experiments on the alteration of electrical con
 ductivity by magnetism.       And, though the writer had some years ago
made some attempts in the present direction (unfortunately before
perusing Sir William Thomson's exceedingly valuable paper), he
 cannot conclude without expressing how greatly the suggestions there
thrown out have assisted him in these and other experiments.

                 Chloro-bromide of Ethylene (C.H.ClBr).
   The first step towards the direct formation of this and other chloro-
bromides is, of course, the preparation of the solution of chloride of
bromine.     This I endeavoured to prepare by a process analogous to
                 I
that by which had formed the chloride of iodine.*           I found, however,
that in passing the chlorine into the bromine and water, a larger
quantity of the former is carried off in the form of vapour.           I  con
tinued the passage of the gas, nevertheless, till all the bromine was
dissolved and the solution assumed a faint yellow tint. On conducting
olefiant gas into this, I obtained a very small quantity of an oily liquid,
part of which boiled between 106° and 110° Cent. Altogether, it is by

 no means a productive progress. I made an ineffectual effort to im
 prove it by surrounding the vessel containing the bromine with ice.
 This, however, only made matters worse, as it caused the formation of
 solid hydrate of chlorine and of bromine, which prevented the comple
 tion of the process.     After several unsuccessful experiments    I at last
 hit upon the following process, which answers remarkably        well : — 500
 grains of bromine are dissolved in 4 fluid ounces of a mixture of equal
 volumes of strong hypochloric acid and water. This solution is intro
 duced into a flask with a long neck, and surrounded with ice. Washed
 chlorine is then passed into it with repeated agitation, till it ceases to
 be absorbed.     In this way not a trace of bromine is lost, nor are any
solid hydrates formed during the passage of the gas. On conducting
defiant gas into this solution, which should be surrounded with cold
water and repeatedly agitated, I obtained a large quantity of an oily
liquid, which   I  separated from the acid solution, washed with dilute
potash,   and distilled. Almost the entire quantity passed over between
106° and 110°, most between 108° and 110°.
    The following analysis proves that this was the body in question in a
state of purity : —

    This process yields nearly   80 per cent, of the theoretical quantity.
                 Chloro-bromide of propylene (CsH,ClBr).
    This compound is prepared in exactly the Bame manner as the ethylene
compound.      The propylene gas was derived from iodide of allyl. The
process is very productive. I obtained a large quantity of an oily
liquid, boiling between 118° and 120°, which proved on analysis to be
pure chloro-bromide of propylene.
                       Chlor-dibrom   Allyl (C3H„BraCl).
    This compound may      be readily prepared by the action of the solution
of chloride of bromine upon bromide of allyl. It is only necessary to
leave these bodies in contact for two or three days at the temperature
of the air, and to agitate them repeatedly. The product distils between
197° and 199°.      It gave on analysis numbers agreeing perfectly with
the above formula.
                      Brom-dichlor   Allyl (C3H5Cl2Br).
   This body may also be formed by the action of chloride of bromine
upon bromide of allyl.       To secure the production of this, and not the
other allyl compound, it is necessary whilst agitating the reacting
 todies, to maintain them at a temperature somewhat below 100° Cent.

    On submitting the product to distillation, I found that the greater
 part passed over between 180° to 187° Cent.
    This proved on analysis to be pure brom-dichlor allyl.

    Many years ago ascertained that aeet-aldehyde enters into direct
 combination with chloride of acetyle, the compound CjHtOsCI being
 formed.*     I  now find that valer-aldehyde also combines directly
 with this body. Their union is determined in the following manner : —
 One molecule of valer-aldehyde is mixed with one of chloride of acetyle
 (the evolution of heat was observed when they came into contact), and
 the mixture is subjected in a sealed tube to the temperature of 100°
 Cent , for about three hours.      At the expiration of this time the tube is
 opened, and its contents subjected to distillation.       It commenced to
 distil at 115° Cent., and between that temperature and 145° a little
 more than half of the fluid passed over.         The remainder refused to
 distil, although heated to 300°. (A considerable quantity of hydro
 chloric acid gas was evolved during the distillation, and also when the
 sealed tube was opened.) On re-distilling I found that the greater part
of the distillate passed over between 118 and 128° Cent.             This gave
on analysis the following numbers, which agree pretty well with the
formula CSH10O.C2H3OC1 :—

   This compound       is a little lighter than water, its specific gravity
being 0'987 at 17° Cent.        It is gradually decomposed when brought
into contact with water, hydrochloric acid, acetic acid, and valer-
aldehyde being formed.
   The compound, which would not distil, was neutral to test-paper.          I
have not yet succeeded in rendering it sufficiently pure for analysis.
   I think we may now safely concludo that all the aldehydes of the
fatty series combine directly with chloride of acetyle, and that this
reaction is characteristic of this class of compounds.

    This salt is completely dissociated by water, a few drops even being
sufficient to separate the whole of the iodide of silver.           This reaction
 enabled me to analyse the salt with facility.
     It was only necessary to add water to a known weight of the salt
and filter.     The iodide of silver may then be determined on the filter,
and the calcium in the filtrate in the usual way by means of oxalate of
ammonia.        The water    I  had to determine by difference, as the heat
necessary to expel the water drove off at the same time some iodine
from the iodide of calcium.             A known weight of the salt, dried in
vacuo over sulphuric acid, did not lose weight when afterwards heated
for some time at 100° Cent.           It partially fuses at the temperature of
boiling water.
      Iodide of calcium forms several interesting double salts, which I am
at present engaged in examining.
  III.   " Further Note on
                                  Supersaturated Saline Solutions." By
       Charles Tomlinson, F.R.S. Received January 7, 1878.
    In  the paper which was read on the 20th of December last,           I stated
that during some years past           I had often recognised the existence of
a force   in the atmosphere, which seemed to exert a powerful influence
on    nuclei, in determining the sudden solidification of supersaturated
saline solutions.     I had   attempted    to identify this force with evapora
tion,   with desiccation,    wfth crystallisation, with electricity, and with
surface tension, and performed many experiments with this view, but
without success.     I  therefore determined to make daily observations on
the    action of oils, &c., on these solutions, taking the typical one of
sodic sulphate of a uniform strength (2 salt to 1 water), and to record
the results from day to day, with especial reference to the state of the
atmosphere. These observations have now extended over three or four
months with this general result, that with a southerly or westerly wind,
the action of oils is to throw down the seven-atom salt at temperatures
above that at which it is naturally formed.           The salt comes down on
shaking the solution in the flask.         In dull and damp weather it falls in
a powdery form ; in fine weather in crystals of the modified salt, and
the powder previously formed in dull weather grows into well-shaped
crystals.     Covered flasks with oil in contact with the solutions, have
thus been kept for days and weeks together, and although repeatedly

  122                       Mr. C. Tomlinson on                       [Feb.   21,
 shaken, the only effect was to increase the quantity of the modified
 salt, while the liquid portion remained supersaturated. With a northerly
 or easterly wind the oil determined the sudden solidification of the salt
 either at once, or on shaking the flask, with the usual rise in
 temperature.
    Daring the last three or four months, however, the occasions             have
 been bo rare on which the oils produced this last-named effect that,
 had I not had sufficient confidence in my published results,           I should
 have been disposed to agree with other observers in the conclusion that
 oils have no nuclear action on these solutions.        But those rare occa
 sions (rare in consequence of the prevalence of southerly and westerly
winds) when the oils did act with effect, satisfied me that, whatever
 the force may be which enables the oils to act, it is a true cause,
 capable of being discovered by continuing the observations.
    The contradictory nature of .the results will be understood        from one
example.      On the 18th of December the wind, which had long been
westerly   and  south-westerly, veered to the north-west, when        I  dropped
castor-oil into three flasks, placed in the open air, and the solutions
immediately solidified.     To meet the objection that an oil that has been
exposed to the air always contains minute particles of sodic sulphate,
or of a salt isomeric therewith,      I  rinsed out a clean bottle with hot
water, filled it half-full of the same, and poured upon it a little castor-
oil. The cork, which had been kept in hot water, was then inserted,
and the phial was repeatedly shaken, so that if any nuclear salt had
been contained in the oil, it must have gone into solution, in which
state, as I have already shown,* it is not nuclear. When the phial was
cold, some of the washed oil was taken up with a pipette (previously
kept in water), and dropped into six flasks, when the solutions all
became solid.      On the next day, and the day after, the wind was
westerly and south-westerly with a damp fog.             The experiment was
repeated exactly as on the day       before, but  now  the   oil no longer pro
duced solidification of the salt ; it only threw down a little seven-atom
salt when the flasks were shaken.
    In reviewing this long series of experiments, in connection also with the
singular activity of the drops of the solution exposed during the periods
of bright weather last summer, when the wind was often easterly, was        I
led to suspect that ozone was the force I had so long been in search of.
Accordingly a few days ago, when a damp fog prevailed, and the oils,
&c, were singularly inert, I put a bit of scraped phosphorus into a
wet tube, and then poured in some oil of cajuput.                In the course
of a few hours the oil became as singularly active as it had before
been inert.    The solutions immediately became solid as soon as a drop
of the phosphorised oil touched the surface, or on gently shaking

 the flask.     On the 4th and 5th of January the air was still, but dark
 with a wet fog, accompanied now and then by a small rain, a state of
 weather which experience had shown to be hopeless as to any nuclear
 action on the part of the oils ; but on these days drops of phosphorised
 oil of cajuput, castor-oil, and benzole produced the immediate solidifica
 tion of solutions of sodic sulphate and of alum. I may also add that
 a minute bit of phosphorus was eminently nuclear, and also newly
 prepared phosphoric acid, whether dry or in aqueous solution.
               (Addendum.)        Keceived January 22, 1878.
    In the series of observations referred to in the above note, the nucleus
 chiefly employed was oil of cajuput, with occasional reference to castor-
 oil and benzole. The reason why these^ three were selected was that
 after using them, the flasks could be easily cleaned by means of spirits
 of wine, preparatory to a fresh charge. Another reason was that, by
 working chiefly with one oil and with solutions of uniform strength, the
 results were more likely to be comparable than if a number of oils and
 solutions of different degrees of strength were used. The necessity
for clean flasks, as insisted on in my former papers, was abundantly
 confirmed, especially on days when the wind was northerly and north
easterly.     On such occasions, if any traces of the oil used in previous
experiments remained in the flasks, the solutions would often solidify
in cooling, or on being carried from room to room, although the mouths
of the flasks were covered with paper caps or small beakers.              The
 flasks chiefly used have oval bulbs of the capacity of 1^ oz., with stems
3 inches in length and about § inch in diameter.          Each bulb was filled
about half with the filtered solution by means of a small funnel with a
long stem, and this was dipped into water after each charge, so as not
to soil the neck of the next flask.       Each flask was then reboiled until
steam issued from the neck, when it was removed from the lamp, its
cover was put on, and it was then set upright in a rack to cool. These
narrow-necked flasks, if clean, retain the solutions admirably ; they
may even be left uncovered during many hours, and even days, espe
cially if the necks are inclined towards their support.        An uncovered
flask has thus remained a fortnight without change.
    Several eminent observers have stated with great persistency that
oils have no nuclear action on supersaturated saline solutions ; or if
they appear to be active, their activity is due to minute particles of the
salt in the air or in the oils themselves.       In order to get rid of these
supposed   nuclear  particles, I  distilled a number of active essential oils,
and found the distillates to be inactive, thus apparently justifying
the objection referred to.      I also found that ether, methylated spirits
of wine, wood spirit, naphtha, benzole, and a few other liquids, were

124                              Mr. C. Tomlinson on                         [Feb. 21,
active on certain days and inactive on others ; that when these were
active their fresh distillates were not, or at least that they required
time in order to become nuclear.                When first added to the solution,
the flask could be shaken, and a good deal of the modified salt would
be thrown down, and then perhaps after a half-an-honr or an hour's
repose the solutions would become solid, although the flasks were
covered again after the drops had been added to the solutions.                     I  also
found that different specimens of the same oil, &c, in separate bottles,
sometimes behaved differently on the same day, and even that an
active essential oil might be made inactive simply by filtering.
    But no sooner was I led to the conclusion that ozone, or an oxidised
condition, has a powerful influence on the nuclear action of oils, Ac.,
than the reason for the various contradictory results became plain to
me.      Supposing that other observers worked with what would appear
to be the best, that is, wi^h pure materials (Lowol, for example,
recrystallised his sodic sulphate, and used distilled water for his solu
tions), the fixed oils used by them would probably be recently refined
and the essential oils redistilled. Hence it is now apparent to me how
it was that they obtained negative results, while the very precautions
against the entrance of nuclei, as taken by M. Viollette and Mr. Liver-
sidge, were such as to deprive the oil of nuclear action, by cutting off
the influence of the external air.*
    In order to illustrate this influence more fully, I will describe a few
out of a large number of experiments that               I have recently made.
    An oil of turpentine, that had stood on my shelf during many years,
was found to be powerfully active. A portion of it was redistilled, and
the distillate had no action in solidifying the solution of sodic sulphate
(2 to 1), although the flask was repeatedly shaken during the day.+
   A portion of the distillate, contained in a dropping-tube, was taken
into the open air and allowed to fall drop by drop into a small clean
Ijeaker.     The oil immediately became active, several of the last-named
solutions becoming solid as soon as the oil reached the surface, or on
gently shaking the flask.
    But in such a case, as it has been affirmed over and over again, the
   * Mr. Liversidge
                        (" Fron. Roy. Soc," xx, 427) took up oil in a dropping-tube,
and then closed its upper opening, and passing the tube through a plug fitted it
tightly into the neck of the flask containing the supersaturated solution.           After
waiting an hour or two, lest any nuclear particles should have entered the flask, he
allowed a drop of oil to fall upon the solution.        Under such conditions he found
the oil to be inactive. Using the same method,      I found that the phosphorised oil of
cajuput, an oiidised oil of turpentine, ether, and absolute alcohol were active :
so also was glacial acetic acid, but not so promptly as the others.      •
   +  8th  February.    I hare  since noticed that during  a north or a north-east   wind,
the distillate of oil of turpentine may become nuclear while being transferred from
the condenser to the dropping-tube.         In some cases hydric peroxide may be the
force that conferB the nuclear action.

oil in falling through the air, must have caught up particles of sodic
sulphate, and these, and not the oil, formed the true nucleus.
   To meet this objection,   I took a portion of the same solution, con
tained in a wide-necked flask, to the same spot in the open air of my
garden, and with a clean dropping-tube, just taken out of water, raised
a quantity of the supersaturated solution, and allowed it to fall through
the air drop by drop into the flask. This was done repeatedly, a south
easterly wind blowing gently at the time, but the solution remained
unchanged.
   An old oil of lavender (marked " Mitcham ") was active. It was
redistilled and treated as in the preceding case, with the same results.
   Methylated spirits of wine were inactive during a south wind, but
soon became active on being allowed to drop through the air in my
garden. Benzole became similarly active, but not quite so readily.
    An old paraffin oil (marked " Belmontine ") was active. Its distil
late was inactive, but on adding to it a few drops of ozonised water, it
became active.
    A solution of sodic sulphate, to which some drops of oil of cajuput
had been added the day before, did not solidify, although the solution
had been repeatedly shaken in the flask. A few drops of ozonised
water were added, and the solution became solid on gently shaking
 the flask.
    Oil of sweet almonds was inactive ; but on being dropped through
 the outer air, it became active. About twenty old essential oils were
 all powerfully active.
    A piece of apple, cut from the centre of the fruit, was inactive ;
 several pieces, similarly cut and exposed to the air until they had be
 come brown, were active.
    Bits of sponge, which were described in my former paper       as being
 inactive, were found to be active during a northerly and north-easterly
 wind.     The same remark applies to charcoal.
    These experiments may suffice to show what is really the function
 of the air with respect to nuclei, and to account for and bring into
 harmony with a general principle a large amount of contradictory
 evidence on the part of many observers, which, during three-quarters
 of a century has disturbed this branch of physico-chemical science.
    Why the oils, Ac, in their oxidised condition are nuclear, and in
 their pure condition not, is a question which I am now endeavouring
 to answer.

   II.  " On the Reversal of the Lines of Metallic Vapours." By
         G. D. Liveing, M.A., Professor of Chemistry, and J. Dewar.
         M.A., F.R.S., Jacksonian Professor, University of Cam
         bridge.      No.    I.
      Since the celebrated paper by Kircbhoff, "On the relation between the
  radiating and absorbing powers of different bodies for light and heat,"
  in which he detailed the remarkable experiments of reversing the
  lines of lithium and sodinm by sunlight and by the vapours of those
  metals in the flame of a Bunsen's burner, and mentioned the reversal
  of the brighter lines of potassium, calcium, strontium and barium
  when the       deflagration of the chlorates with milk-sugar was used
  instead     of the flame of a Bunsen's burner, further researches in
 the same direction          have been made by Cornu, Lockyer, and Roberts.
  The method         adopted by Cornu, which had been previously used
 by Fouceult, is        ODe    of great ingenuity, dependent upon so arrang
 ing the electric         arc that the continuous spectrum of the intensely
 heated poles is examined through an atmosphere of the metallic
 vapours volatilized around them.           By this means Cornu succeeded in
 reversing several lines in the spectra of the following metals in addi
 tion to those above-mentioned, viz., thallium, lead, silver, aluminum,
 magnesium, cadmium, zinc, and copper.              He observed that in general
 the reversal began with the least refrangible of a group of lines, and
 gradually extended to the more refrangible lines of the group; and he
 drew the conclusion that a very thin layer of vapour was sufficient for
 the reversal.       It may be noted that in almost every case the lines seen
 by   him   to be  reversed     were the more highly refrangible of the lines
 characteristic of each metal, confirming generally the opinion expressed
by Stokes in a letter to Lockyer in the Proceedings of the Royal
Society for 1876, in which he introduces for the first time the idea of
the persistency of different rays with reference to temperature.
     The method adopted by Lockyer in the first instance was to view
the electric arc through the vapours of the metals volatilized in a
Btream of hydrogen in a horizontal iron tube.

  1878.]      on the Reversal of the Lines of Metallic Vapours.         133
     The iron tube had its ends covered with glass plates, and was heated
  in  a furnace supplied with charcoal. By this means he did not succeed
 in observing any new reversal of bright lines, but he noticed an un
 known absorption line which sometimes appeared when zinc was expe
 rimented on. He confirmed, however, the channelled-space absorp
 tion spectra observed by Boscoe and Schuster, in the cases of potas
 sium and sodium, and recooded channelled-space spectra in the case of
 antimony, phosphorus (?), sulphur (previously observed by Salet) and
 arsenic (probably).     "As the temperature employed for the vola
 tilization of the metals did not exceed bright redness, or that at which
 cast-iron readily melts, the range of metals examined was necessarily
 limited ; and in order to extend these observations to the less fusible
 metals, as well as to ascertain whether the spectra of those volatilized
 at the lower temperature would be modified by the application of a
 greater degree of heat," a new series of experiments were undertaken
by Lockyer and Roberts, in which the combined action of a charcoal
furnace and the oxy-hydrogen blowpipe was employed.               By this
means they obtained no new reversal of a metallic line, but they
observed channelled-space spectra in the cases of silver, manganese,
chromium, and bismuth. They observed, however, that the metal
thallium gave the characteristic bright green line, the light of the arc
not being reversed.
    In the above-mentioned experiments the coolness of the ends of the
tube, which acted as condensers of the metallic vapours, and the
inequality of density and temperatures necessarily produced by the
maintenance of a current of hydrogen in the tube, appear to us to
account for the complication and uncertainty of the results of the
observations.
    In  order to examine the reversal of the spectra of metallic vapours,
we find it more satisfactory to observe the absorptive effect produced
on the continuous spectrum emitted by the sides and end of the tube
in which the volatilization takes place.      For this purpose we find it
convenient to use iron tubes about half-an-inch in internal diameter,
and about 27 inches long, closed at one end, thoroughly cleaned inside,
and coated on the outside with borax, or with a mixture of plumbago
and fireclay.    These tubes are inserted in a nearly vertical position in
a furnace fed with Welsh coal, which will heat about 10 inches of the
tube to about a welding heat, and we observe through the upper open
end of the tube, either with or without, a cover of glass or mica.      To
exclude oxygen, and avoid as much as possible variations of tempe
rature, we introduce hydrogen in a gentle stream by a narrow tube
into the upper part only of the iron tube, so that the hydrogen floats
on the surface of the metallic vapour without producing convection
currents in it. By varying the length of the small tube conveying the
hydrogen, we are able to determine the height in the tube to which the

134                   Profs. Liveing and Dewar                    [Feb. 28,
metallic vapour reaches, and to prevent further displacement of the
vapour, and thus to maintain different lengths of the iron tube fall of
metallic vapour at a comparatively constant temperature for consider
able periods of time.
   By this means the following observations have been made np to the
present time.
   The first metal experimented on was thallium, one of the most
volatile of metals. On inserting some pieces into the hot tube, we had
at first great difficulty in avoiding oxidation at the upper surface, and
we observed no reversal.       However, after arranging the current of
hydrogen so as to keep the tube free from air, but without any rapid
movement of the gas, we succeeded in seeing the characteristic line
reversed, and maintained it so for a considerable time.
   The metal indium, closely allied in its behaviour and volatility to
thallium, was next examined, and although the amount of this metal
at our disposal was not large, we observed the bright blue line
reversed.    This was most plainly visible when that portion of the
vapour which waB nearest to the sides of the tube was looked through.
   We had great difficulty in preventing the oxidation of magnesium
in the tube, and in using tubes wider than half-an-incb did not
succeed in getting any reversal, but with half-inch tubes the 6 lines
were clearly and sharply reversed, also some dark lines, not measured,
were seen in the blue.      The sharpness of these lines depended on the
regulation of the hydrogen current, by which we could cool the upper
stratum of vapour at will.
   A piece of metallic lithium was introduced, and gave no resnlts.
Sodium was next added in the same tube, and this did not bring out
the reversal of the lithium lines.      Similarly, chloride of lithium and
metallic   sodium,   introduced   together, gave no better results. To a
tube containing potassium vapour, some lithium chloride was added,
 but no lithium line appeared.         On adding metallic sodium to this
 atmosphere, and more lithium chloride, the bright-red lithium line
 appeared sharply reversed, and remained well defined for a long time.
 It is worthy of observation that the lithium line was only reversed in
 a mixture of the vapours of potassium and sodium, and it seems highly
 probable that a very slightly volatile vapour may be diffused in an
 atmosphere of a more volatile metal, so as to secure a sufficient depth
 of vapour to produce a sensible absorption.       This would be analogous
 to well-known actions which take place in the attempt to separate
 organic bodies of very different boiling points by distillation, where a
 substance of high boiling point is always carried over, in consider
 able quantity, with the vapour of a body boiling at a much lower
 temperature.     It is a matter for future investigation how far chemical
 interactions taking place in a mixture of metallic vapours affect the
 volatility of a third body, and what relation, if any, this may have to

 snch phenomena as the increased fusibility of mixtures of salts of
 potassinm and sodium, and the well-known fluidity of the alloy of
 those metals.
     As we have had occasion to use sodium and potassium in our tubes,
 we have had opportunities of observing the absorption spectra of these
 metals, and we find that there is a great deal yet to be observed in
 regard to these spectra. Up to the present time, we have not observed
                                                " On a new class of
 any of the appearances noted by Lockyer,                           absorp
 tion phenomena," in the Proceedings of the Royal Society, vol. xxii,
 but ve have repeatedly noted the channelled-space spectrum of sodium
 described by Roscoe and Schuster in the same volume of the Proceed
 ings. "We observed in our tubes no channelled-space absorption by
 potassium, but continuous absorption in the red, and one narrow
absorption band, with a wave-length of about 5,730, not correspond
ing vith any bright line of that metal.
     With reference to the absorption spectrum of sodium vapour, we
may remark that it is by no means so simple as has been generally
represented.     The fact that the vapour of sodium in a flame shows
onlv the reversal of the D lines, while the vapour, volatilized in tubes,
shows a channelled-space        absorption corresponding     to no known
emission spectrnm, appears to be part of a gradational variation of the
absorption spectrum, which may be induced with perfect regularity.
Experiments with sodium, carried out in the way we have described,
exhibit the following succession of appearances, as the amount of
vapour is gradually diminished, commencing from the appearance
when the tube is full of the vapour of sodium, part of it condensing
in the cooler portion of the tube, and some being carried out by the
slow current of hydrogen.         During this stage, although the lower
part of the tube is at a white heat, we have always noticed, as long as
the cool current of hydrogen displaced metallic vapour, that, on looking
down the tube, it appeared perfectly dark. The first appearance of
luminosity is of a purple tint, and, with the spectroscope, appears as
a faint blue band, commencing         with a wave-length of about 4,500,
and fading away into the violet.       Next appears a narrow band in the
green, with a maximum of light, with a wave-length of about 5,420,
diminishing in brightness so rapidly on either side as to appear like a
bright line. This green band gradually widens, and is then seen to be
divided by a dark band, with a wave-length of about 5,510. Red
light next appears, and between the red and green light is an enormous
extension of the D absorption line, while a still broader dark spaco
 intervenes between the green and the blue light.         The dark line in
 the green (wave-length      about    5,510)  now   becomes   more sharply
  defined.   This line appears to have been observed by Roscoe and
  Schuster,  and regarded by them as coinciding with the double sodium
  line next in strength to the D lines, but it is considerably more refran

136     On the Reversal   of the Lines of Metallic Vapours.      [Feb.   28,
gible than that double line.     In the next stage, the channelled-space
spectrum comes out in the dark space between the green and bin.',
and finally, in the red.      Gradually the light extends, the channtls
disappear, the D line absorption narrows, but still the dark             Lne
in (he green is plainly discernible.      Lastly, there is only D      liies
absorption.    So far as we can judge, the blue and the streak of g*en
light at first observed are due to luminosity of the vapour itself, wlere
it is somewhat cooled, the later stages being mixed phenomeni of
absorption and emission.
    As the absorption line, with wave-length about 5,510, which we may
call for shortness the second absorption line of sodium, has not wen
distinctly recorded by other observers, we have endeavoured to race
it under somewhat different conditions from that of the vapour vola
tilized in white hot iron tubes. This absorption-line is easily seen
when a gas flame is observed through a horizontal glass tube, fbont
three inches long, containing sodinm volatilized in the middle oi the
tube by the heat of a Bunsen's burner, and equally well whether the
tube contains hydrogen or nitrogen besides sodium.           We have alsc
observed the same absorption line when a piece of commercial nag-
nesium ribbon (which always contains sodium) is ignited in a hori
zontal position, so that the metal melts and produces an elongated
 flame. It is of some interest to note that absorption lines of about this
wave-length, in the solar spectrum, are given by Kirchoff and Angstrom
not corresponding with emission lines of known elementary bodies.
    When potassium vapour is observed, whether in the iron tube or in
a glass tube, an absorption line is seen, with a wave-length of abont
 5,730, which is more refrangible than the yellow double emission line
 of potassium, and does not correspond to any known bright line of
 that metal.
    We reserve, for a future communication, the discussion of the identity
 or non-identity of these absorption lines with lines in the solar spectrum
 and the inferences which may be drawn from such determination.
    The method of observation we have described may be used to observe
 emission spectra as well as absorption spectra, for if the closed end of
 the tube be placed against the bars of the furnace so as to be relatively
 cooler than the middle of the tube, the light emitted by the vapours in
 the hottest part is more intense than that emitted by the bottom of
 the tube.    This succeeds admirably with sodium, but we have not
 specially observed  it with other vapours.

       Professor ARTHUR Gamgee. F.R.S. Received January 31,
       1878.
    The following paper contains a summary of observations made in
order to obtain data for a comparison between the blood-heart and
lymph-hearts of Frogs.               The comparison is to include the actions of
electrical currents and           of   the so-called cardiac drngs, atropia, physo-
stigma, mnscaria, antiar, &c. ; bat this paper will treat only of the
electrical portion of the work.
   Before proceeding to the collection of facts especially fitted for com
parison, the normal anatomical and physiological arrangements of the
lymph-hearts were examined ; and, as the result of this examination,
the author is able to confirm the discoveries of previous observers in
the   following points : —
   1.    The lymph-hearts of Bana temporaria are muscular sacs, whose
walls consist of branched, anastomotic, transversely striated muscular
fibres, abundantly nucleated (Leydig,* Waldeyert).                  A cursory exami
nation failed to discover any ganglionic nervous elements among the
muscular fibres themselves, their absence having already been noticed
by Volkmann        J   and Waldeyer ; § but nerve-ganglia are said to be found
near the hearts, in their connective tissue environment (Waldeyer). ||
    2. The lymph-hearts beat with a mean rate of 60-70 a minute, and
are independent in their rhythm of one another, of the blood-heart,
and of the respiratory movements (J. Miiller)^" . But the normal pul
sation is not quite regular, being occasionally broken by sudden pauses
or by periods of increased rapidity of beat. These interruptions seem
 to be partly due to movements of the animal, but in part to hitherto
 undefined causes.
    3. The hearts receive nerve-fibres from the spinal cord, which de
 scend in the second and tenth spinal nerves respectively for the anterior
 and posterior pairs of hearts (Volkmann,** Eckhard,ff Schiff XX)-

  4.  The normal rhythm of the heart is dependent on the soundness
of certain regions of the spinal cord, viz., for the anterior pair, of the
region opposite the 3rd vertebral body (Volkmann*), for the posterior
pair, of the region opposite the 6th.   This statement is a correction
of the view commonly held in respect of the spinal region concerned
in the rhythm of the posterior hearts ; for all previous observers seem
to have followed Volkmann in saying that the region of the 8th verte
bral body is that implicated.
  If these regions are injured, or  if the nerves proceeding from them
to the hearts are intercepted, either the hearts are brought to rest per
manently, or their natural pulsation is disorganised and reduced for a
long time to more or less irregular fluttering. These spinal centres
seem capable of inhibition by strong sensory (afferent) stimuli, even in
the absence of the encephalon.
   5. The natural pulsation of the lymph-hearts is constantly controlled
from an encephalic inhibitory centre in the optic lobes, separation from
which       therefore, at once followed by increased rate of beat
             is,
(Suslowa.)t    This inhibitory centre     said by Goltzis   to be ronsed  J
into stronger action by powerful mechanical stimuli proceeding along
the vagi from the heart, or proceeding from the abdominal viscera in
the Klopfofirsuch.
  6.  The disorderly contractions that follow division of the lymph-
cardiac   spinal nerves may give place to a regular pulsation
(Eckhard,§ Schiff,|| Heidenhain ^f). The restoration does not usually
take place until after many days, but when established, the rhythmical
beating     independent of the spinal cord, not ceasing, like the pulse
              is
of normal lymph-hearts, when the central nervous system       destroyed          is
(Goltz,** Waldeyerft)-      The  cause  of these    movements   not yet            is
fully understood     but the movements themselves are abolished by

cation either of common non-polarizable              electrodes or of electrodes of
platinum wire.
                I. — Action    op  Induced Interrupted Currents.
     a. On the lymph- cardiac muscle detached        from its nerve (as an ordinary
voluntary muscle may be detached) by means of curare. — The electrodes
were laid on the back after the removal of the skin, as close to the
posterior lymph-hearts as possible.               Under these circumstances the
lymph-hearts behave exactly like the surrounding striated muscles, not
differing from them to any remarkable extent, either in minimal sti
mulus or in mode of contraction.
     b. On the lymph-cardiac spinal nerves after anatomical separation from
the lymph-cardiac         spinal centre. — The spine and cord were snipped
through at the level of the 7th vertebra, and one non-polarisable elec
trode was applied to the exposed lower end of the cord; while the
back of the 8th vertebral          arch was removed, and the other electrode,
well moistened         with normal saline solution, was introduced at the
window so made.            Or a pair of platinum electrodes were slipped be
neath the abdominal branch of the tenth spinal nerve running to one
of the posterior hearts, the heart having previously been brought to
rest by division of the same branch near the coccygeal foramen. Under
these circumstances          the lymph-cardiac muscle-nerve preparation be
haves like any ordinary muscle-nerve preparation, except that it pos
sesses a    much larger minimal stimulus.
     If contact    between nerves and electrodes were not very perfect in the
 spinal canal, or if currents near the minimal stimulating point were
employed,      the usual firm tetanus of the lymph-hearts became broken
 into a series      of explosive, beat-like, or twitching movements.           But,
 under    similar   conditions,    ordinary muscle-nerve preparations re-act in
 a  similar manner.
     c.  On the    lymph-cardiac spinal centre separated from the encephalic
 inhibitory centre. — -The frog was decapitated, and all the spinal nerves
 were divided except the tenth.               Windows were cut into the back of
 the spinal      canal, opposite the 5th and 8th vertebrae, and into the
  windows well-moistened non-polarizable electrodes were pushed.                  Or
 the spinal canal was opened from the 5th to the 8th vertebras, and
  platinum electrodes         slipped beneath the cord or made to touch
  the cord lightly one at each side at the level of the 6th vertebra.
  Under these circumstances             slight currents, strong enough to con
  tract    at the     same    time    the   ilio-coccygeal   muscles,   slowed   the
  lymph-hearts ; stronger currents inhibited the hearts in diastole, and
  still stronger currents caused a tetanic systole of the hearts like the
   simultaneous tetanus induced in neighbouring nerve-supplied muscles.
   The strong currents sufficient to cause in this manner prolonged
    diastolic inhibition of lymph-hearts still dependent            on their spinal

140       Mr.   J.  Priestley on Batrachian Lymph- Hearts.              [Feb.  28,
centres, are also of a strength to cause powerful tetanus of the same
lymph-hearts when applied to their nerves in the spinal canal, as des
cribed under    6.
   It should be noticed that the same explosive, pulse-like movements
occurred here as under 6, when the conditions were similar.
   This action of the interrupted induced current on the lymph-cardiac
spinal centres is not abolished by the local or systemic exhibition of
solutions of atropia.
                      II.  Action of Constant Currents.
   The currents were applied to the structures tested by means of
non-polarizable electrodes of ordinary form.
   a. On the lymph-hearts brought to rest by separation from their spinal
centres. — After operations       involving extensive bleeding, separation
from their spinal centres is, in nearly all cases, followed by permanent
stand-still of the dependent hearts.         In the experiments described the
frogs  were   decapitated     and   eviscerated,  all the spinal nerves except
the tenth were divided, and the thighs amputated in order to obviate
any disturbing muscular movements.            The electrodes were applied to
the base of the back near the heart to be examined, sometimes in a
direction laterally across the heart, and sometimes in the longitudinal
axis of the heart ; or the heart was carefully excised with its surronnd-
ing connective tissue, placed upon the clay of one electrode, and
lightly touched with the point of the other.                In the latter way of
experimenting      no  attention  was   paid to  the  relation  of the current to
the axes of the heart, on account of the small size of the organ in
B. temporaria.      Under these circumstances with various strengths of
battery from 2-3 small Daniell's cells to 16-18 Grove's, nothing but
ordinary opening and closing contractions could be- caused.
   b. On the lymph-hearts still beating in normal dependence              on their
spinal centres. — The electrodes were placed either on the lateral or the
longitudinal axes of the hearts, as in a. Under these circumstances,
in whatever direction the current flows, the pulsation of the hearts is
hampered or inhibited, the hampering affecting rather the depth than
the frequency of the beats.
   c. On the lymph-cardiac spinal centres. — The well-softened electrodes
were pushed in at windows opening into the spinal canal through the
5th and 7th or 8th vertebral arches, after the frog had been decapitated
and the spinal nerves, except the tenth, all divided ; or one electrode
was placed on the upper end of the cord exposed in decapitation, while
the other was placed in the window through the lower vertebral arch.
   a. On the acting spinal centre. — Different results were obtained accord
ing to the direction and strength of the current, varying from complete
stand-still in diastole to pulsation much more rapid than normal ; but
all seem capable of explanation by the aid of the known laws of

electrotonus, the known effect on the neutral line of varying battery
power, and the assumption of a stimulating influence of the current
per se, which may counteract the depressing effects of the anelectrotonic
state.
   fi.On the spinal centre exhausted by the effects of operative proce
dure, exposure, etc. Restoration to activity follows the passage up or
down the cord of a current for 1-2 Grove's cells. Such restoration
the author does not think         possible to attribute in every case to the
                                 it
presence  of  favouring  katelectrotonus       must be set down to stimu
                                               ;   it                        a
lation by the current per se.
   7. On tlie spinal centres    hearts inhibited by stimulating with strong
                                of
Nad solutions the upper exposed end of the cord of decapitated     a
frog.   The electrodes were inserted into the spinal canal through
windows in the 5th and 7th or 8th vertebral arches. Under these
circumstances the hearts cannot be set going by passing a current
through the spinal centres, unless, perhaps, when the current           very  is
Btrong (from 5-6 Grove's) and then only when the anode
                                ;                                  above the

spinal centres, and, therefore, in a. position to intercept the descending
inhibitory stimulus by means of the anelectrotonic state which                       it
induces.

I. "On the Photometry of the Magneto-Electric Light" By
     Captain W. de W. Abney, R.E., F.R.S. Received February
       5,   1878.
   At intervals during the last three years it has been my duty to
ascertain the value of the illuminating power of different sources of
light, which have been brought before Government for military pur
poses.       As there is nothing secret in the results obtained, it seemed to
me    that    I    might communicate         them to the      Royal Society,              I   have
obtained permission so to do.
  There are certain difficulties to       be overcome which affect the
measurements, as         it will        that the question of colour enters
                                   be evident
largely into them, which are not so great when lights produced by
comparatively low temperatures are in question.
   My first attempt to obtain a comparison of the value of any two
lights was made by the method of extinction, that                      is,
                                                             by introducing
between the'light    and  the eye    screen
                                         a   graduated in opacity.     After
comparing this method with that which          have recently adopted,
                                                        I                am               I
not inclined to quarrel with it.       Originally    employed a wedge of
                                                            I
green-black glass for the screen, but owing to a complication in the
results due to different coefficients of absorption for different parts of
the spectrum,      had resort to strips of photographically graduated
                    I
glass,  the necessary black colour being obtained                      by
                                                              toning with                        a
platinum salt, and a consequent deposition of platinum black.          With
a couple of these slips back to back, and with the ends showing the
greatest opacity placed together, a graduation was obtained varying
between nearly total transparency and an opacity sufficient to cut off the
direct rays of the strongest sunlight even when the eye was in its most
sensitive condition.     These strips being cemented together, and the
relative opacity of every division of a small scale having been ascer
tained, they were caused to pass in front of a narrow slit which was
open to the light to be tested.        When all trace of light had dis
appeared readings were taken, and from the series the value of the
light calculated.    The great defect in this method        the variation in
                                                                  is

 be excessively cautious to take the readings         under precisely similar cir
 cumstances, and also to check them from time to time by the extinc
 tion of some standard light.           Thus    I    found that the maximum
 sensitiveness of the eye was practically attained after it had been
 excluded from the light for two minutes.            Readings taken before that
 interval had elapsed were invariably too high, while afterwards they
 were    fairly equable.
     •The annexed series shows this result.     The readings were commenced
 after exposure of the eye      to an ordinary reading lamp, and continued
 for more than ten minutes.

      A similar form of instrument was made for Sir Charles Wheatstone
                                                                 I
  without his knowledge of the existence of mine ; but am unaware of
  the results he obtained.
      In the diagrams which accompany this paper I have given the curve
  of intensity of the magneto-electric light generated by a machine,
  similar to that to which reference will subsequently be made, and it
  will be noticed how close is the agreement between it and the curve
  which indicates the intensity of the blue light.
      Later it was my endeavour to compare the values of the different
  coloured components radiated from any source of light, and my
  original apparatus consisted of a double spectroscopic arrangement
  by which the lights from the two sources entered by different slits into
  the spectroscope, and to the eye the spectra appeared vertically one over
   the other.    After screening off all of the two spectra except a narrow
   strip, and by applying a telescope with a divided lens, as will shortly
   be described, the intensities of the two strips were equalised by widen
   ing or narrowing one or other of the slits. The ratio of the widths of
   the slits gave approximately the values of the different intensities of
   the light in the particular part of the spectrum.           For light giving a
   continuous spectrum this method answered admirably, and             I beheve it
    was on the same principle that Lord Rayleigh measured the relative
, values of sky and sunlight;       but for lights whose spectra were' discon
    tinuous the method failed owing to the labour it involved.                 This
    method was then abandoned, and another was sought which should
    integrate two or three parts of the visible spectrum.
       In my hands Bunsen's method of photometry has always been un
                                                                     I
    certain, perhaps through some personal obliquity, though believe that

1878.]        the Photometry  of the Magneto-Electric Light.          159
with other persons the   same uncertainty has been observed. Rumford's
                                           I
method has never been a favonrite, but believe that if the following
modification of it be adopted, there can never be much difficulty in
comparing lights of similar colours.    The problem which I set myself
was to obtain shadows of equal size, and to place them side by side as
seen by the eye.     The following plan accomplishes this : —
    In an opaque screen of some half metre square two equal slits of
about half a centimetre in width and 7"5 centimetres in length were
cut parallel to one another, the lengths being vertical.      These slits
were separated by 7"2 centimetres, and were covered with a diaphanous
screen, white tissue paper being apparently the best substance to
employ, though ground glass was also tried. The tissue paper was
placed at a small distance from the opaque screen, so that the texture
 was invisible when the borders of the slit were sharp when viewed by
an observing telescope.     A rod of a centimetre in diameter was placed
in front of the tissue screen, and so arranged that the shadows thrown
by the two sources of light entirely covered the slits. The movable
light was caused to travel along a scale fixed at such an angle as to
ensure this always occurring.      The necessary precautions were taken
to ensure that the shadows falling on the screen were at equal dis
 tances from the centre of the rod.
     In order to cause the two shadows thus thrown to approach each
other, a divided lens of about 16 centimetres focus was made to form
the objective of a telescope, and by carefully separating the optical
centres of the two halves (see figure) when the line of division was
 kept in a horizontal position, the images of the two slits could be
 caused to approach one another, and could be viewed in the same field
 by an eyepiece. By turning the telescope in its Y's the same result could
 be obtained, though in this case the image seen of the one slit would
 be formed by the opposite half of the lens to that which formed it in
 the first observation.   Measurements were taken with standard lights,
 till the adjustment was found which gave equal illumination of both
  sides of the lens.  When the opaque screen, the telescope, and the head
 of the observer were carefully shielded from all extraneous light, the

observations are singularly accordant.     The following observations
made with a standard candle and a paraffin lamp, the light traversing
a red medium, will give an idea of the correctness of the results : —

  If there be any drawback to this method, it is that an assistant is
required to alter the distances of the movable light.
  I may also remark that there are shades of light between which it
is sometimes difficult to judge. If too bright the requisite diminution
can be obtained by using diaphragms in the telescope, and by altering
the magnifying power of the eye-piece.       If too dark, an addition to
the    light which reaches the slits may  be given by giving them an
equal  amount  of illumination from an  independent source.
   To secure the separation of the different portions of the spectrnm,
resort was had to absorbing media.                           I
                                         After many trials came to the
conclusion    that nothing seemed preferable to red glass, which absorbed
practically every part of the spectrum except the red end, and an
ammoniacal solution of copper sulphate.      These two absorbing media
were employed in the experiments which I am about to describe ; very
little of spectrum is left unaccounted for, and the results obtained are
sufficiently striking to record.
    A red glass was obtained which had sufficiently plane surfaces, and
a cell with parallel sides was used for holding the copper solution.
The absorbing media were placed between the rod and the opaque
screen, and absolutely parallel with the latter.
    The following is an outline of the experiments to which the atten
tion is to be drawn. The primary object was to ascertain the relation
between the horse-power expended, the light produced, and the number
of revolutions of the armature.      The machine employed was of the
Gramme form, and weighed somewhere about 17 cwt.             It had three
pairs of vertical coils, one of which was used for magnetization.      To
work    it,what is  known as  the steam sapper was employed.     Thisis   a
road locomotive from the shops of Aveling and Porter, of Rochester,
and   is adapted to driving machinery by applying a band to the          fly
wheel.     It works fairly steadily when not overtaxed. An indicator
was attached for taking diagrams from which to calculate the horse
power expended.       The number of revolutions of the armature was

   1878.]      the  Photometry     of the Magneto-Electric Light.          161
  taken by a velocimeter,     and a large tangent galvanometer was inserted
  in the circuit, the diameter of the arc being 33 times that of the
  needle.  An automatically working electric lamp having perfectly dry
  square carbons    of £ inch side was the source of light, and was placed
 at fixed distances    of 75, ] 50, or 50 feet from the measuring apparatus
 as circumstances required.         It gave a steady light when the engine
 worked regularly, and the brilliancy of the light was not increased
 by altering the distance apart of the carbons.            When a series of
 readings was to be taken, the horse-power expended in driving the
 machine    with the collecting brushes up was found, and then the
 brushes   turned down, and the light allowed to burn for ten minutes
 before any measurement          was taken.    The number of revolutions of
 the armature was then approximately ascertained, and a diagram taken
 when the velocimeter was applied to the machine.            The readings of
 the galvanometer       were recorded by an assistant working under my
 colleague, Captain Armstrong, R.E., and then measurements of the
illuminating power taken by myself and checked by an intelligent
assistant.    The light transmitted through the red medium was first
measured, and then through the blue. If the first and last of the read
ings compared favourably with each other, the series was taken as
worthy of confidence.         If, on the other hand, great fluctuations were
observed, which was sometimes the case owing to the occasional irre
gularities of the motive power, and to impurities in the carbons them
selves, a fresh set of readings was taken.       As often as possible readings
were taken through the blue and red media at the same number of
revolutions per minute of the armature.           This was not always prac
ticable, or even necessary.       This will explain the reason of the variable
revolutions recorded in the tables.        I may remark that the revolutions
were always taken at the commencement and end of each set of read
ings, and if these were tolerably close the mean was taken as the correct
value for the mean of the readings.          With any great variation, say of
more than ten revolutions, the readings were rejected altogether.            It
was found difficult to make a comparison with a standard            or pair of
standard candles, owing to the small distance from the screen they
sometimes occupied ; hence an intermediate light from a paraffin lamp
was made use of, which before and after each series of readings was
compared with the standard candle.           The variation of the lamp light
was very small, ranging from 10'23 to 10'05.              The light from the
electric lamp was admitted into the observing-room through an aper
ture in the wall of about 18 inches square, and great care was taken
that any reflected light was cut off the screen.
    In addition    to the   optical readings, an endeavour was made to
secure a record of the actinic value of light.          Paper sensitized with
 silver chloride was exposed to the light at a distance of three feet
 from the carbon points, one strip was placed behind a cell filled with

 quinine sulphate, whilst another was exposed to the full action of the
 unshaded light.          The times of exposure varied between one and ten
 minutes.        The intensity of the actinism was measured by Roscoe's
 method, which need not be described.                The curve obtained from the
 paper exposed      behind   the   quinine   cell is  practically identical with that
 obtained optically from the blue components when any one point in
 the former cnrve is made to correspond to a point in the latter which
 has the same abscissa.         The following Table gives the results of the

   The following is      a  statement,   furnished me by Captain R.         Y.
Armstrong, R.E., of      the electrical conditions of the circuit.
             The resistance of the stationary wire     = 4'46 ohms.
                       „         „    magnetizing coil = 0"44 ohm.
     In the generator the resistance of the light-circuit coil = 0'24 ohm.
     The light coils were in divided circuit, as were also the right and
 left stationary coils.
      When driven at from 375 to 383 revolutions, the resistance of the
 voltaic arc was about 0"18 ohm ; the other resistances in the circuit
 were 0-7 ohm. The electromotive force of the machine when driven
at the above speed was 111 volts, a measure which has been arrived
at by Captain Armstrong from other experiments. The electromotive
force between 375 and 383 revolutions of the armature was assumed
to vary as the number of revolutions, an assumption which was borne
out as practically correct by other measurements made for the purpose.
 In   order to ascertain what effect the insertion of resistance had on the
current, the following experiment was undertaken by Captain Arm
strong with a smaller form of gramme machine, called Machine No. II.

readings, in the first case 1"1 ohm of total resistance, in the other 272.
    Table VI refers to these experiments, the curve marked A in the
Diagram V being that due to the first, B being that due to the second.
It will be noticed that practically the curve becomes a straight fine,
or, in other words, the electromotive force increases directly as the
number of revolutions of the armature, a result which might have
been expected theoretically.       It will also be seen that the current for
any given    number   of  revolutions  varies inversely as the resistance in
circuit, or, in other words, that the electromotive force for a given
number of revolutions is constant.
    In any results, therefore, which are given descriptive of the light
produced by any machine, the following should be noted : —
                    Number of revolutions of armature      ;
                    Resistance in circuit ;

different portions of the surface of the head previously examined in
 the condition of comparative cerebral inactivity.

to assisting in the diagnosis and localization of cerebral disease.

different portions of the surface of the head during increased mental
activity, any information could be obtained as to the comparative
importance of the parts played by different portions of the brain in
the evolution of thought and the different emotions,
i  To commence with the first of these ultimate objects of the in
vestigations,      easy to see that everything depends upon an accurate
                  it   is
knowledge of the normal relative temperatures of the different portions
of  the surface of the head, and the variations of such temperatures
within healthy limits. Without this knowledge             impossible to
                                                               it   is
come to any satisfactory conclusion as to the existence of localized
cerebral disorder by examining the temperature of the surface of the
head.
     So far as the writer      aware, Dr. Wm. A. Hammond,* of New
                                  is
York, was the first to indicate that a difference of temperature exists
between the two sides of the head in health.    In 1875, Dr. Hammond,
making use of-      thermo-electric apparatus, devised by the writer the
                       a
year previous, came to the conclusion, from observations made on                       a
large number of individuals, that the left side of the head has   higher     a
temperature    than  the right  side. Unfortunately  the notes furnished
by  Dr. Hammond, in the writer's possession, do not state the exact
locality examined, a matter of great importance as will be seen
further on.
   During the past year M. Brocat has brought forward experiments on
the same subject.    M. Broca, using thermometers, has also come to
the conclusion that the left side of the head has the higher tempera
ture.  The sources of error in M. Broca's method will be presently
noticed.
     Turning      now to the      of the ultimate objects of the present
                                  second
investigations, namely,           the connexion between
                                                    the relative share of
mental work done in       given part of the brain, and the relative tem

perature  of  the surface  over such part,      evident that here also
                                                   it   is                             a
thorough acquaintance with the relative temperatures of the different
portions of the surface of the head in the quiescent mental condition
isrequisite.
  As regards what has been already done on the subject of the relation
between heat and mental work,        may be summed up in
                                           it                 few words. a

 of the higher intellectual faculties, as well as different emotions, caused
 a perceptible rise of temperature in the head.              Merely arousing the
 attention could produce the same result. These results were published
 in June of 1867.*         Toward the close of the latter year, Professor
 Moritz Schiff, who had been working independently of any knowledge
 of what the writer had been doing, communicated to the Museum of
 Natural History of Florence results of a similar nature.                 In 1870
 Professor Schiff f published an account of a series of investigations
 made directly upon the brain of animals, which decisively proved that
 mental work is accompanied by elevation of temperature in the brain.
 Lastly, M. Broca has likewise arrived at the same conclusion by experi
 ments made, like the writer's, on the human subject, M. Broca, how
ever, using thermometers instead of thermo-electric apparatus.
    The present investigations were commenced in January, 1877, and
 have been continued almost without interruption to the present time.
 The first step to be taken having been decided upon, namely, a thorough
examination of the normal relative temperatures of the different por
 tions of the surface of head, the next point to be decided was the
 manner in which the examination could be best carried on. Preliminary
observations had satisfied the writer that experiments made upon the
heads of individuals taken at random could only lead to confusing and
contradictory results.       Accordingly, the investigations were limited to
a few selected heads, which could be measured and compared, and the
different circumstances, both internal and external, affecting which,
could be pretty well known.               Six subjects, three males and three
females, were selected.        The    next    question was the measurement of
the head, and its division into regions, and the subdivision of these
regions.     The following method was decided on : the head was divided
into three regions, designated respectively, anterior, middle, and
posterior.
                                 Anterior Region.
    The anterior region is bounded laterally by a line drawn upward, on
each side of the said, from the angle formed by the frontal and zygo
matic processes of the malar bone in a direction parallel to the plane
of the forehead,     taken over the frontal eminences and superciliary
ridges.
    The superior boundary is formed by the continuation in the same
plane, and junction on the top of the head, of the lateral boundaries.
    The inferior boundary is formed by a line passing horizontally across
the front of the head on a level with the summits of the supra-orbital
arches between the external angular processes of the two sides, and

thence continued by the outer borders      of the malar bones to the points
of origin of the lateral boundaries.
   The part of the head embraced by the anterior region is, therefore,
that which would be cut off anteriorly by a transverse and vertical
section, made parallel to the plane specified, between the angles formed
by the  frontal and zygomatic     processes of the malar bones of the two
sides.
                                Middle Region.
   The middle region is bounded anteriorly by the lateral and superior
boundaries of the anterior region.
   The posterior boundary is formed by a line passing over the top of
the head    parallel to the anterior boundary, uniting the extremities of
the mastoid processes     of the two sides.
   The inferior boundaries commencing at the terminations of the
inferior boundary of the anterior region, follow the upper borders of
the zygomatic processes of the temporal bones, pass behind the ears,
and follow the anterior borders of the mastoid processes to their
extremities.
                               Posterior Region.
   The posterior region has for its superior and lateral boundaries      the
posterior boundary of the middle region.
   The   inferior boundary is formed by the posterior borders of the
mastoid processes and by the superior curved line of the occipital bone.
   The longitudinal median line of the head divides each of the three
regions into right and left symmetrical halves.
   In the present communication we have only to do with the anterior
region.
   The anterior region is thus subdivided : —
   Commencing at the inferior boundary, each lateral half is divided
into six parts by five equidistant horizontal lines drawn from the
median line to the lateral limit.         The tracts thus marked off are
designated tiers, and are numbered from 1 to 6, commencing at the
inferior boundary. Further in each lateral half four equidistant ver
tical lines are drawn upward parallel to the median line, from the
lower limit to the superior boundary, thus dividing each tier into
smaller spaces. In the first four tiers these spaces are five in number;
but in the fifth and sixth tiers, the convergence, over the top of the
head, of the lateral limits diminishes the length of the tier, and re
duces the number of spaces to four in the fifth tier and to three in the
sixth tier. These spaces are designated districts, and are numbered
 from 1 to 5 outward from the median line.         The tiers are marked off
 by means of a string coated with coloured chalk.
    As the method of measuring off the tiers and districts by equidistant

 lines does not in every head bring a given space into exactly the same
anatomical    position, each case is referred to one head as a standard.
 The following are the measurements and anatomical positions of the
 tiers in the standard head.
    The height of the region measured on the median line is 125 mm.
 (4-92 inches), therefore, each of the six tiers measures 20-83 mm.
 (0"82 inch) vertically.    The upper boundary of the first tier touches
the summits of the superciliary ridges.         The upper boundary of the
 second tier passes through the centre of the frontal eminences.          The
 upper boundary      of the  third  tier  touches  the  upper  border, of  the
 frontal eminences.     The upper boundaries of the fourth and fifth tiers
have no anatomical landmarks, and their positions can be designated
only by their respective distances from the superior limit of the region ;
this latter touches the coronal suture on the median line, hence the
 upper boundaries of the fourth and fifth tiers are, respectively, 41'66inm.
 (l-64 inch), and 20-83 (0-82 inch) distant from the coronal suture on
the median line.
    The following are the measurements of breadth : —
    Total breadth measured on the horizontal portion of the inferior
boundary of the region 186 mm. (7-32 inches).
    Total breadth measured over middle of frontal eminences 186 mm.
(7-32 inches).
    Total breadth measured just above frontal eminences 176 mm. (6"928
inches).
    Total breadth measured at a distance of 2083 mm. (0-82 inch) from
the coronal suture on £he median line 120 mm. (4-72 inches).
    The breadth of each lateral half measured on the inferior boundary
line being 93 mm. (3'66 inches), each of the five districts will measure
on this line 18-6mm (0"732 inches). We have then 27 spaces a side
to examine, the maximum size of the space being 21 mm. (0'8 inch) by
19 mm.    (07 inch).
    With reference to the instruments employed, both thermometers
and thermo-electric apparatus have been used.            The writer does not,
however, think thermometers reliable in investigations of this kind ;
for the reason that they cannot be pushed down firmly enough upon
the surface    to empty the superficial vessels. The piles used by the
writer are set in paraffine in an ebonite casing so as to be at some
distance from the edges of the casing, and the whole bottom, — faces
of piles,   paraffine,  and   ebonite    edges, — rendered   perfectly flush.
Pressure with a pile so constructed empties the superficial vessels,
leaving the part pale and bloodless on the removal of the pile. It is
easy with such piles to empty the temporal artery and to test the
temperature     of parts lying beneath it without the least risk of the
temperature   of  the blood in the artery itself interfering.     The danger
of error in experiments such as those of M. Broca, is that the tempera

      Before leaving this part of the snhject it may be well to state that
the situation of M. Broca's       " frontal " thermometer seems to have been
in the neighbourhood of the 5th district, 1st tier, so far as the writer
can judge from the abstract of M. Broca's paper, which has come
under his (the writer's) notice.            Now, for this space, the writer's
results are, 68 in favour of the right side, and 32 in favour of the
left side ; but immediately adjoining is the 1st district 1st tier of the
writer's middle region, and, in the space specified, the figures arc 30
right, 60 left, and 10 neutral. M. Broca's thermometer may have
been in this space.        The examination of the middle region does not
enter into this communication, and the above remarks are made
principally to show within what narrow limits the balance of superiority
of temperature may shift from one side to another.
                    Quantitative comparisons of the two sides.
    The following is a summary of the mean results of 100 examinations
of each pair of symmetrically situated spaces.
    The mean difference of temperature is pretty nearly the same for
both sides of the head ; thus, the mean difference of temperature for
the eighteen spaces which are, on an average, of higher temperature
on the right side than on the left, is 0-255° C. (0-459° F.) ; while the
mean difference of temperature for the nine spaces which are of
higher temperature on the left side than on the right, is 0-2411° C.
 (0,433c> F.)    The greatest difference noted is in the 3rd district, 3rd
tier, left side, namely, 0-461° C. (0 829° F.) ; the smallest differences
 noted are in the 1st district, 4th and 5th tiers, and in the 2nd district,
 4th tier, all right side, the differences being each 0-076° C. (0136° F.).
 The extreme range of difference of temperature is therefore 0-385° C.
 (0-693° F.).     The mean difference of temperature of all the observa
 tions taken together, irrespective of sides, is 0-247° C. (0-444" F.).

  It will be seen from the above figures, that the difference between
spaces of adjoining tiers on one and the same side of the head  nearly                   is
as great as the difference between symmetrically situated spaces of
the two sides.   The order in which the tiers come, as regards their
temperatures,     as follows
                    is                  :

   From the above it can be seen that the mean difference between
districts is much less than that existing between tiers.              The order in
which the districts come, as regards their temperatures, is as follows : —
   4th district, 5th district, 3rd district, 1st district, 2nd district ; this
order holding good for both sides of the head.
   Lastly, if we take the three groups of examinations, namely, those
on the comparative temperature of the two sides of the head : those on
the comparative temperature of adjoining tiers on one and the same
side ; and those on the comparative temperatnre of adjoining districts
on one and the same side, we have the following values : —

   According to the above figures, superiority of temperature of a
given side of the head over the other, is a little less frequent of occur

I. "On Professor Haughton's Estimate of Geological Time."
        By George H. Darwin, M.A., Fellow of Trinity College,
        Cambridge. Communicated by J. W. L. GLAISHER, M.A.,
        F.R.S. Received February 19, 1878.
    In a paper     recently read before the Royal Society,* Professor
Haughton has endeavoured by an ingenious line of argument to give an
estimate of the time which may have elapsed in the geological history
of the    earth. The results attained by him are, if generally accepted,
of the very greatest interest to geologists, and on that account his
method merits a rigorous examination.              The object, therefore, of the
present note is to criticise the applicability of his results to the case of
the earth ; and    I conceive that my principal criticism is either incor
rect, and    will meet its just fate of refutation, or       else is destructive   of
the estimate    of geological time.
    Professor Haughton's argument may be summarised as follows : —
The impulsive elevation of a continent would produce a sudden dis
placement of the earth's principal axis of greatest moment of inertia.
 Immediately      after the earthquake, the axis of rotation being no
 longer   coincident  with the principal axis, will, according to dynamical
 principles, begin describing a cone round the principal axis, and the
 complete circle of the cone will be described in about 306 days. Now,
 the ocean not being rigidly connected with the nucleus, a 306-day tide
 will be established, which by its friction with the ocean bed will tend

180          Mr. G. H. Darwin- on Professor Haughton' s                 [Mar.   14,
to diminish the angle of the cone described by the instantaneous axis
round the principal axis : in other words, the " wabble " set up by the
earthquake   will gradually die away.
   Then by means of Adams and Delaunay's estimate of the alteration
of the length of day, which is attributed to tidal friction, Professor
Haughton obtains a numerical value for the frictional effect of the
residual tidal current. He then applies this to the 306-day tide, and
deduces the time required to rednce a " wabble
                                                    "
                                                      of given magnitude
to any given extent.
   He is of opinion that    if,
                              at the present time, the instantaneous axis
of rotation of the earth were describing         circle of more than 10
                                                    a
feet in diameter at the earth's surface, then the phenomenon could not
escape detection by modern astronomical         instruments.    From the
absence of any such inequality he concludes, after numerical calcula
tion, "
      if   Asia and Europe were manufactured per scUtum, causing a
sudden displacement of the axis of figure through 69 miles, that this
event cannot have happened at an epoch less than 641 ,000 years before
the present time, and that this event may have occurred at an epoch
much more remote."
  He then    passes    on to consider   the case where the elevation        takes
place by a number of smaller impulses instead of by one large one.
He treats first the case of " 69 geological convulsions, each of which
displaced the axis of figure through one mile," and where
                                                            " the radius
of the wabble "   is  " reduced from one mile to        feet in the interval
                                                              5
between each two successive convulsions " and, secondly, the case
                                               ;
where " the increase of this radius       is exactly destroyed by friction
during each wabble, so that the radius of      5feet continues constant."
   In the first case he finds that the total time occupied by the manu
facture of Europe and Asia                                              "
                                  27| millions of years, and also that no
                                  is
geological chaDge, altering the position of the axis of figure through
one mile, can have taken place within the past 400,000 years."          And
in the second case, he finds that the same elevation would occupy
4,170 millions of years.     A little lower he adds " It extremely im
                                                          :       is
probable that the continent of Asia and Europe was formed per saltum                  ,
and therefore our minor limit of time           probably far short of the
                                               is
reality."
   It appears from these passages that Professor Haughton of opinion   is
that a succession of smaller impulses at short intervals will necessarily
increase the radius of the "wabble ;" but           itnot very clear to me
                                                          is
 whether he means that the radius of the " wabble " would be the same
 by whatever series of impulses the principal axis was moved from one
 position to another.    Now, I  conceive that       by no means necessary
                                                    it   is
 that a second impulse succeeding a first should augment the radius of
 the " wabble;"  it   might, indeed, annihilate it.      admit that by pro

great as if the whole change took place by a single convulsion.                     But
where the impulses take place at hazard there will be a certain average
effect on the radius of the
                                   " wabble," which,       as  far as  I can see,  Pro
fessor Haughton makes no attempt to determine.                    It seems, therefore,
an unjustifiable assumption that sufficient time must elapse between
the successive impulses to reduce the radius of the wabble
                                                                 "          " to 5 feet,
for if the impulses took place more frequently they might tend to
some extent to counteract one another.              If this assumption is unjusti
fiable, then Professor Haughton's estimate of time falls with it.
    In my paper on the " Influence of Geological Changes on the
Earth's Axis of Rotation,"* I have considered the effects of a slow
continuous distortion of the earth.           The results there attained would,
of course, have been identical, had I considered the effects of a series
of infinitely small and infinitely frequent earthquakes.                    I  presume
Professor Haughton will agree with            me    in   thinking     this supposition
more consonant with geological science than the larger earthquakes
which he postulates.
    I will now show, from the results of my paper, that urithout calling
in any effects whatever of tidal friction, Asia and Europe might have
been gradually        upheaved      in 19,200 years, without leaving any

               sufficiently large to be detected astronomically, and, more
over, that at no time during the elevation could the
                                                                      " wabble " have
been detected had astronomers been in existence to make observations ;
and further, that under certain not improbable suppositions, this
estimate of time may be largely reduced.                     Let a be the angnlar
velocity of the principal axis relatively to the solid earth, arising from
the continuous elevation of the continent ; n the earth's angular
velocity of rotation ; C, A the greatest and least principal moments of
 inertia of the earth    ;      r = -—

    Then,  in  section 2 of my paper,       I  show that the extremity of the
 instantaneous axis describes a circle at the earth's surface in 306 days,
 and   that this circle passes through the extremity of the principal
 axis, and touches the meridian along which the principal axis is
 travelling with velocity a in consequence of the postulated geolo
 gical change.     Strictly speaking, the curve described by the instan
  taneous axis, is a trochoid, because the circle travels in the earth along
  with the principal axis ; but the motion of the circle is so slow com
  pared with that of the instantaneous axis along its arc, that it is more
  convenient to say that the instantaneous axis describes a circle which
  slowly changes its position. It must be noticed that this circle is
  unlike the " wabble

                             considered by Dr. Haughton, inasmuch as the
  extremity   of the   principal axis lies on its arc instead of being at its

circle is equal to      —.
    I  will now suppose that the geological changes begin suddenly from
rest, and proceed at such a rate that the variations in the position of
the principal axis are imperceptible to astronomical observation.              I
will suppose, therefore, that the extremity of the instantaneous axis
is never more than 5 feet distant from the extremity of the principal
axis.     Now, 5 feet at the earth's surface, subtends very nearly "05" at
the earth's      centre,   and, therefore,  to find a on this supposition,  —
                                                                             A*

    /i is an angular velocity of 360° in 306 days, and if we wish to
express a in seconds of arc per annum, fi must be expressed in those

    Therefore,    a is an angular velocity of 1° (or 69 miles) in 19,200 years.
    But, according to Professor Haughton, 69 miles is the displacement
of the earth's principal axis, due to the elevation of Europe and Asia ;
hence, at this rate of elevation, Europe and Asia would have been
heaved up in 19,200 years.
    Now, if the elevation be supposed to stop suddenly, then the in
stantaneous axis cannot, at the time of the stoppage, be more than
5 feet distant from the axis of figure, and it may even be coincident
with it. Therefore the stoppage cannot set up a " wabble " of more
than 10 feet in diameter, and it may set up none at all. But even this
maximum " wabble" of 10 feet, would, according to Professor Haugh
 ton, be imperceptible, and a fortiori the circle of 5 feet in diameter,
described in the course of the elevation, would be imperceptible.
     On any of the following suppositions, the elevation might be much
 more rapid, without increasing the residual " wabble " : —
     (1.) The stoppage of the elevation to take place at a time when the
 instantaneous axis is separated from the principal axis by a small
 angle.
     (2.) The elevation partly counterbalanced by simultaneous eleva
 tions in other parts of the world, so that the upheaval of Europe and
 Asia would not displace the pole of figure by so much as 69 miles.
     (3.) The elevation partly or altogether produced by the in
 tumescence of the strata immediately underlying             those  continents.

 reduced by the friction of the 306-day tide ; for we are by no means
 compelled to believe that that inequality of motion must always have
 remained as small as it is at present.
    It appears to me, from these considerations,     that the continents of
Europe     and Asia might have      been  elevated in very much less than
20,000 years, and yet leave no record of the fact in the present motion
of the earth. Therefore, if my solution of the problem is correct,
it is certain that Professor   Haughton's method can give us no clue to
the times   which have elapsed in the geological history of the earth.
II. " Some Experiments on Conductive Properties of Ice, made
       in Discovery Bay, 1875-6."            By Staff Surgeon R. W.
      Coppinger, M.D. Communicated by Professor Tyndall,
       F.R.S. Received February 21, 1878.
   In attempting    a series of experiments for determining the rate of
conduction of heat through sea and fresh. water ice, I have endeavoured
as closely as possible to follow the suggestions        made by Professor
Tyndall in page 34 of the        " Scientific Instructions for the Arctic
Expedition."                       I
                  With this view, have constructed the simple appa
 ratus shown   in the diagram. It consists of a wooden baseboard (F F),
 29 inches  in length by 9 in breadth, on which are fixed two upright

  184                      Dr. R. W. Coppinger on                  [Mar. 14,
  wooden battens    (NM), standing 24 inches apart, and connected above by
  a light crosspiece  (00). In the upright   battens, at 4 inches above their
 bases, are apertures 1£ inches square, for the reception of the bar of
 ice (AA) on which the experiment is made, while a series of thermo
 meters (DDDD) are placed 4 inches apart, secured above to the cross-
 piece   (00),  and having their bulbs imbedded iu the icebar below.
     For  the manufacture of ice-bars   I had constructed a strong copper
 tube, 29 inches long by l£ inches in sectional area, from which on being
 filled with water, and exposed to a low temperature, bars of fresh or
 sea-water ice were obtainable.      The removal of these bars from the
 mould was effected by the application of warm water to the outside of
 the tube, which, melting the surface of the ice-bar, allowed it to be
 extracted.
     The ice-bar,   being   placed in position, projects, when of its fall
 length, 5 inches beyond the upright batten (M), as shown in the figure.
 Below the projecting end is placed a spirit-lamp (B), fitted with a
 sheet-iron plate (C), curved in such a manner as to prevent the bare
 flame from touching the ice, and to divert the drops of melted ice from
 the wick of the lamp.       This lamp can be so placed that its heat will
 bear pretty accurately on the under surface of the bar at either 2, 3,
or 4 inches as desired from M. The thermometers being placed at
intervals of 4 inches apart, their distances from the source of heat are
 respectively 6, 10, 14, and 18 inches when the lamp is 2 inches from
the upright.      Their bulbs are sunk in holes bored in the ice, and are
packed in with powdered ice, so as to render the connexion with the
bar as perfect as possible without incurring the risk of the instruments
being broken.
    At all low temperatures the instruments used were Hick's spirit
thermometers.      Although these instruments were supplied to the ship
as of good reputation, their errors at temperatures below —10° differed
so mnch in each instrument for every few degrees of the scale, that        I
found it best in recording the rate of heat-flow along the ice-bar to take
the temperature actually indicated by each thermometer uncorrected,
and to note the range of temperature in each, assuming that its error
for every two or three degrees, at all events, was uniform.
    In the earlier experiments I noted the temperature every 5 minutes
for about 2 hours, beginning 5 minutes after the lamp had been
lighted ; but finding that interval too small to show any decided differ
ence in temperature,     I had recourse to 10-minutely, and ultimately to
15-minutely intervals. The entire duration of each experiment was
limited to one hour, as by that time so much of the projecting end of
the bar had melted away as to lessen the influence of the lamp upon it.
    In order to determine whether the rise in temperature indicated by
the thermometers might be to any extent due to radiation of heat from
the lamp rather than to conduction through the ice-bar, the thermo

meter     YY   was placed on the inner side of the upright M, having its
bulb exposed to the air and 5 inches distant from the lamp.                    Having
found from experiments           I  and  II  that a certain amount of radiation
really existed, a broad screen, composed of layers of lint and pasteboard,
was placed against the outer side of the upright M, and perforated, so
as to closely encircle the bar in its passage through.               This screen was
used in     III and subsequent experiments.
     In order to be free from draughts, and yet to be in a place of low
and     pretty uniform temperature, the observations were made in a
closed-in ice-building on the floe (that which was used as a theatre),
and the temperatures of the external air and of the air inside the
building were on each occasion noted.                It was found that whenever
the temperature        in the open air was below —20° F., the temperature
inside the building was about 10° warmer ; this difference being
accounted      for by the heat conveyed through the floe from the sea- water
beneath.
     From a mean of five experiments on fresh- water ice it appears that
in one     hour from the time when heat was applied, the temperatures at
the distances of 6, 10, 14, and 18 inches from the source of heat had
risen 4°-45, 1°78, l°-30, and 0°25, respectively.              This result furnishes
a rough method of estimating the absolute rate of conduction.                        It
would have been more satisfactory if in all cases the observations
could have been           continued   until the thermometers          indicated fixed
temperatures, but this was impracticable from the thawing of the end
 of the ice-bar ; and if but a very moderate heat had been applied, the
 changes in temperature would have been hardly appreciable.                    In most
 cases    but little change in temperature took place after the hour had
 elapsed, and in the case of experiment VIII, when a series of observa
 tions extending over two hours was carried out, the thermometer
 indicated no material change in temperature throughout the second
 hour.
      Table  VI  gives the results of a series of observations upon a bar of
 sea-water ice, the rise in temperature being respectively 4°, 2°, l°-5,
 andl-°5.
      It will be seen    that in Tables   I, II, and    III, the temperatures indi
 cated by thermometer YY are given, and that in                I  and  II its ranges of
 temperatures      are  respectively   4° and  2°-5.   In  III  the screen   to prevent
  radiation was used, and every precaution was taken that the tempera
  ture of the ice-house might be uniform throughout the course of the
  experiment.      In this case thermometer YY shows a rise in first hour
  of only 0-°25.     To exhibit this more clearly Table          VIII   (the first half
  of which is only a repetition of Table          III)   is given, when the results
  of observations extending over two consecutive hours are recorded ;
  and    from which it appears that the ice thermometers indicated almost
   fixed temperatures      from the end of the first hour. The temperature of

the house varied but half a decree during the coarse of the experi
ment, and the thermometer YY showed a rise of only 0°'75, which is
small    when compared with its short distance (5 inches) from the
flame. The results, therefore, afforded by Table              VIII      may be consi
dered highly satisfactory.
   I   refrain from making any general observations or drawing any
special conclusions as to the subject of this paper, but simply submit
the above few observations with the hope that in abler hands than
mine, the facts which they contain may be made to add something to
our knowledge of the conductive properties of ice.

 HI "      On the Function of the Sides of the Vessel in maintaining
        the State of Supersaturation." By CHARLES TOMLINSON,
       F.R.S.          Received February 21, 1878.
    Before aDy consistent theory can be framed of all the phenomena of
 supersaturated saline solutions, it is necessary to determine whether
 the sides of the vessel bear any, and what part, in maintaining the
 state  of supersaturation.
    It is remarkable that among the multitude of memoirs and papers
 that have been published on the subject of supersaturation                    generally,
and of special phenomena in particular, my reading should not have
made me acquainted with any special experimental                        researches con
ducted with the view of determining the point in question.
    In 1819, Gay-Lussac* seeing how easily a supersaturated solution
of sodic carbonate can be made to solidify, by merely shaking the
vessel, expressed his opinion that the state of supersaturation depends,
not on a chemical, but a purely mechanical force.                    " We cannot," he
says,
         "  fix the point at which supersaturation ends, since it is entirely
accidental in each experiment, depending, as it does, on the nature of
the vessel, its polish, its conducting power, and the agitation of the
air."
   In 1851 Lamyt arrived at the conclusion that the form, thickness,
and nature of the vessel, and the quantity of solution contained
therein, have no influence on the state of supersaturation.

    Lowel,* whose researches extend over about ten years, namely,
from 1848 to 1857, makes frequent reference, in the course of his
six memoirs, to the sides of the vessel. He is of opinion that the aspe
rities of the sides exert no action in determining crystallisation ; that
nothing certain can be affirmed as to the size of the tubes in producing
such an effect ; that it is not a mechanical action, as Gay-Lussac sup
posed ; that heat deprives the sides of their active, or as he calls             it,
dynamic power; that even in an open tube the sides are not in a
passive state that nothing
               ;                  positively decided as to the action of
                                   is
the sides.   He also refers to that mysterious unknown force which
holds the crystals in en abnormal state he also speaks of the inner

surface of the flasks recovering that particular property of determin
ing crystallisation which heat had deprived       of, the cause of which

unknown and in his last memoir he supposes that the sides determine
           ;
tbe formation of the normal salt by an action of contact.
I    have already expressed my opinionf that had Lowel worked with
chemically clean flasks and tubes, he would not have encountered so
many contradictory results, or have expressed so many uncertain and
conflicting opinions as those above quoted.
   In 1866 JeannelJ threw out an opinion that the state of snpersatura-
tion  ismaintained in closed vessels by reason of the attraction of the
sides and the saturation of the interior air. .
I    had long ago formed an opinion that the adhesion of the solution
to the walls of the vessel        an important function in maintaining
                                   is
the state of supersaturation     and
                                   ;     seemed probable
                                             it               this were so,
                                                                  if
that any force that could effectually detach the solution from a small
portion of the side, below the surface, would cause the whole system
to break down.
   The most obvious mode of experiment seemed to consist in rubbing
the interior surface with a clean wire. About five years ago      obtained
                                                                       I
a number of results in this way, but did not think them snfficientlv
important or trustworthy for publication. One source of fallacy soon
became obvious.     On moving the wire up and down in a nearly vertical
direction, a film of the solution       is
                                     being constantly dragged above the
surface, which film, in consequence of rapid evaporation, disengages             a
molecule of the salt, and this acts as a nucleus to the whole of the
solution. Attempts were made to prevent such an effect by tying a piece
of linen dipped in hot water loosely round the neck of the tube, and pass
ing the wire through the cloth into the tube, but the result was not
satisfactory; for unless the crystals could be seen actually to start
from the place rubbed and to spread from this point alone through the
solution, no fair conclusion could be formed as to the effect of the
rubbing. Friction with platinum, brass and steel wires seemed to

 have   little or no effect on solutions of sodio sulphate and sodic acetate.
 The most satisfactory results were obtained with magnesic sulphate ;
 but with this and other solutions the results varied with the state of
 the weather as the crystallising force varied, and also with the nature
 of the rubber, whether a glass rod or the wires just named.
     At length it occurred to me to line the tubes with some substance
 which is not wetted by the solution or imperfectly so.           Accordingly,
 two large     tubes (5 oz. and 3 oz.) were made chemically clean, and
 coated    with a solution of amber in chloroform. They were three parts
 filled with a solution of sodic sulphate (2 to 1), covered over, and left
 until the next day.        A stout platinum wire was taken out of hot
                                                                               '
 water and introduced into each tube, when moderately hard friction
 was made in a vertical line about one-sixth       or one-eightb of an inch
in length.       A crystalline brush immediately diverged from the part
rubbed, and spread all through the solution, the mass of which was
sufficient for the eye to note the details, and to convey the assurance
that crystallisation set in from the part rubbed and from that only.
    The advantage of using amber is that the coating, being transparent,
allows the progress of the experiment to be watched.                The same
advantage may, however, be obtained at less cost and trouble, by
means of resin, a small quantity of which, in powder, together with a
few drops of spirits of wine, heated in the tube over a spirit lamp,
enables the operator easily to spread a coat evenly upon the inner sur
face   by moving the tube about while it is still warm.
    A number of one-ounce tubes, coated in this way, were filled with a
stronger solution of sodic sulphate (3 to 1) than that before employed.
The   result was satisfactory : the solutions often became solid in cool
ing, and    always when the inner surface was rubbed with the platinum
wire.
    The experiment was also made comparative by placing an uncoated
by the side of a coated tube, and so leaving them to cool covered with
glass   capsules, or small beakers.       The solution in the coated tube
often solidified in cooling, and always remained liquid in the uncoated
tube.
    The results as obtained with supersaturated solutions of other salts
also showed      how greatly they depend for their stability on adhesion.
The system always broke down when a portion of the solution was
detached     from the side, by the rubbing action of the wire. The solu
tion of each salt, however, presented those characteristic features of its
own, which form one of the principal charms in the study of natural
objects. In the ammonia alum solution (1 to 1) the octohedral crystals,
 under the action of rubbing, seemed to bound forth towards the axis
 of the tube.     In the magnesic sulphate solution (3 to 1) the disengaged
 crystals were too minute to appear, except as a chalky- white line fol
 lowing the motion of the wire.       Zincic sulphate (3 to 1) formed small

 woolly-looking crystals after a slight rubbing, and although the wire
 was rapidly withdrawn as soon as the crystals began to appear, it left
 behind it a curious kind of trail, consisting of an axis of the form of
 the wire, repeating its bends and irregularities, while small acicular
 crystals started out at right angles to this line, and thickly studded
 it soon after the whole of the solution became solid. Zincic acetate
  (1 to 1) did not display crystals as soon as the side was rubbed, but
 slowly, in the course of half-an-hour or so, the part rubbed was oc
 cupied by a dense crop of beautiful crystals, the points of which
 passed beyond the axis of the tube.
      Sodic acetate solution does not readily yield to the effort of rubbing,
 except in certain states of the weather when the crystallizing force is
 strong ; but a case occurred to me some years ago which exactly suits
 my present purpose. Several flasks containing a highly supersaturated
 solution of sodic acetate, to which oil had been added without any
 nuclear effect, were emptied into a small, stout cylindrical glass, where
 it remained during some weeks without change, the layer of oil on its
 surface preventing it from absorbing moisture.               It was several times
 stirred with the finger without effect, for this, on being introduced,
 became coated with oil and so prevented contact.                  The finger was
 then pressed against the strong side of the vessel with a considerable
 amount of force and drawn slowly from the bottom upwards. The
 solution immediately became solid.            I attributed this effect at the
                                  I
 time to nuclear action, but now regard it as an excellent illustration
 of the point which I am seeking to establish.
      A supersaturated solution of sodic carbonate is very sensitive to any
 interference with its adhesion.       A speck of carbon or of ferrous oxide,
 coming to the surface within the tube, is sufficient, on cooling down
 the solution, to cause the salt to start from the speck in crystalline
 lines in all directions, producing immediate solidification.*
     In addition to amber and resin some tubes were coated with other
 substances, such as sulphur, shellac, stearine, and paraffin; but as
 some of these, in addition to the objection of being opaque, melted
 when the boiling solution came into contact with them, I need
not refer to them any further, except perhaps to paraffin, with
which an interesting result was obtained.               A large tube was lined
with paraffin and passed, telescope fashion, over a smaller tube, con
taining a nearly boiling solution of sodic sulphate.               When cold, the
tubes were slowly reversed, so as to pour the solution into the coated
tube ; but it solidified as soon as it came into contact with the paraffin.
If, however, it were poured in while still warm, the solution accommo-
    *  In the experiments which I had the honour  of exhibiting to the Society after
the reading of my first paper (28th May, 186S), a case of this kind occurred and was
pointed out by my late lamented friend, William Allen Miller, as "a very pretty
effect."

1878.]             the     Function     of   the sides   of   the Vessel,    §c.           193
dated     itself to the new             circumstances         and remained         liquid when
cold.
     The results of these experiments seem to point to the conclusion                            •
 that adhesion to the side of the vessel is one of the conditions under
 which the state of supersaturation        is maintained ; and that what
 ever interferes with this adhesion, must prevent supersaturation          or
 destroy it.
    This conclusion was tested by another mode of experiment, starting
 from the idea that if the solution were made to expose an amount of
 free surface, about equal to the surface of contact with the vessel, the
 adhesive force would scarcely be sufficient to maintain the state of
 supersaturation, and the solution in cooling would crystallise as in an
 open evaporating dish.      This is what really did happen in the case of
 ammonia alum (5 to 3).           The solution in three covered shallow
 vessels deposited     massive crystals in cooling, and when cold, the
 mother liquor was no longer supersaturated.        A solution of the same
 degree of strength was boiled in a flask and the opening plugged with
 cotton-wool : this deposited no salt in cooling, because the area of
 adhesion was greatly in excess of that of the free surface.      The solu
 tion under such conditions will remain unchanged for months.          In all
 cases the re-boiling of the solution in the flask into which it is filtered
greatly promotes adhesion, and, consequently, the duration of the
solution in the state of supersaturation.
    But to return. A similar crystallisation took place in the case of
sodic sulphate ; but that arose chiefly from the kind of vessel used and
the mode of covering           as will be noticed presently.

The boiling solution was poured into these glasses, which were
immediately covered with shallow glass vessels, inverted over them so
as to fit nicely and rest on their edges, or to fit with friction to the
sides.   The result was curious and interesting.      Instead of crystallis
ing   in cooling,  the  solution  relieved itself by throwing down large
quantities of the seven-watered salt in finely shaped masses, while the
liquid portion remained supersaturated.*          Next day these solutions
were taken into the open air and uncovered.          From a point at the
extreme edge of each, crystallisation set in and spread like a fan over
the surface and through the solution.      This was not    case of nuclear

this deposit and there was sufficient adhesion on the part of the remaining liquid
to maintain   a moderate    degree of supersaturation.

action derived   from the atmosphere (rain having fallen during some
hours and having scarcely ceased) but was due to another force. Last
summer, as noticed in my former paper,* drops of sodic acetate ex
posed on glass always started the crystallisation from the edge.           So,
in these wide shallow glasses in the open air, crystallisation set in from
the edge, or capillary curve, where the solution is most drawn out and
attenuated.    Now, supposing evaporation to be active all over the
surface, this thin portion, becoming thinner by the process, would be
the first to detach a molecule of the salt, and this, once set free, would
act as a powerful nucleus to the whole.          Lines, or rather thin planes
of crystals, diverge from  the point, and this so quickly as not to affcrd
time for the molecules to arrange themselves into crystalline forms.
   On one occasion the mass of seven-watered salt rose so near ihe
surface, that the solution resting on it was scarcely more than a film.
This, by evaporation, also disengaged a minute portion of the normal
salt, which acted as a centre of crystallisation.
   Solutions containing two parts of salt to one of water behaved
much in the same way as the stronger ones. A weaker solution, con
taining only one of salt to one of water, accommodated itself to the
conditions under which it was placed.               It did not deposit any
modified salt, and on being uncovered in the open air, crystallised from
the edge.
   In the case before referred      to, where the solution crystallised in
cooling, as in an open evaporating dish, namely, in the form of large
prisms of the normal salt, the vessel was a shallow dessert dish with a
scolloped edge, so that the protecting cover did not confine the air
over the surface of the solution, but allowed it to circulate ; hence, in
cooling down, the molecules were also in a condition to circulate and
gradually to arrange themselves into groups, ready to assume the
crystalline form when the temperature             had sufficiently declined.
Whereas, in closely covered      vessels, the  strong adhesion to the side
prevents this circulation and re-arrangement, the adhesion holding the
molecules in a forced state, bearing some kind of analogy to the glass
in Prince Rupert's drops and the Bologna phial.
   It must also be noted, that in the last case also, there was no
nuclear action ; for, had there been, the solution would have cooled
down to a certain point, and then have suddenly crystallised in closely
packed planes ; whereas, in the case now referred to, the crystals were
large and of the usual shape, while the mother liquor was no longer
supersaturated.
   Solutions of zincic sulphate and of magnesic sulphate (3 to 1 each)
in these covered shallow vessels, also threw down a good deal of the
modified salt, in the case of the zinc solution the monohydrated salt

 the remaining supersaturated      liquor in both cases became solid, the
normal salt being formed.         Sodic acetate solution (6 to 1^) poured
boiling into these large shallow vessels and covered over did not
change during twenty-four hours.         On being taken into the open air
and uncovered, the solutions remained some time in the liquid state,
but on touching the bottom of the vessel with the finger, they imme
diately became solid.
   The alum solution, before referred to, deposited       the normal salt in
large crystals, while the solution was still warm.       It  could not relieve
itself in any other way, because by its constitution it cannot form a
salt of a lower degree of hydration than the normal, that is, with
12 aq.,  and the throwing down of that in considerable masses, so as to
get rid of the state of snpersaturation       altogether, forcibly illustrates
the dependence of that state on the adhesion of the solution to the
sides of the vessel.
   The weather was mild while these experiments were in progress.
At lower temperatures the solutions would doubtless have been even
more sensitive.
   The result of these experiments satisfies me that the state of super-
saturation is dependent on the adhesion of the solution to the sides of
the vessel, coupled with the tension of the surface.        This tension may
be lowered, so as to throw more work upon the other force, which it
may be able to bear ; but anything that effectually detaches a' portion
of the solution from contact with the sides of the vessel, produces the
sudden crystallisation of the solution.
   If this view be correct, many of the phenomena of supersaturation
are accounted for, and the whole subject is far advanced towards that
obedience to law, which can alone invest it with dignity.

                                      I.
    The contact theory of voltaic action seems to have undergone no
 development since the date of Sir W. Thomson's experiment, which
 consisted in connecting a plate of zinc and a plate of copper by means
 of a drop of water, when it was found that the metals were brought to
 the same electric potential, although when metallically connected they
 were at different potentials.    He believed that any electrolyte would
 behave in exactly the same way as the water of his experiment, equal
 izing the potentials of any two metals connected by it. The electro
 motive force of a simple cell, ought, in accordance with the theory, to
 be equal to the difference of potentials between zinc and copper in
 contact.   A test founded on this deduction was very difficult to apply,
 because there was no exact determination of the difference of potential
 of zinc and copper in contact, Sir W. Thomson, in his experiment,
 having really measured the difference of potential between air at the
surface of a zinc plate, and air at the surface of a copper plate.      In
the absence of this test, the equality of the electromotive forces of
simple cells in which zinc and copper are the metals (the liquids being
water, dilute sulphuric acid, and sulphate of zinc) was held as a proof
of the theory.     Now it is known that when two pieces of the same
metal are dipped into any two liquids, which are diffusing into one
another, a difference of potentials is established between the metals,
and the electromotive force of a cell of this kind can in no way depend
on a difference of potentials due to metallic contact.   So that although
in such   a cell there is an action which is somewhat the same as the
action in a simple voltaic cell, the theory took no account of it what
ever.    In fact, the explanation of voltaic action given in the latest

   1878.]              Contact    Tlieory  of Voltaic Action.                 197
   treatises on  electricity is felt to  be incomplete,    even by the writers of
   such treatises, and the present investigation has been entered upon in
   consequence.
      Sir W. Thomson's result, and our own experiments lead us to
  imagine that when zinc and copper are immersed in water there are three
  successive states to be noticed : — At the instant of immersion the zinc
  and copper may be reduced to the same potential, so that the electro
  motive force   of the voltaic cell   E  is equal to the difference  of potential
  ZC between zinc and copper in contact           ; the zinc now becomes nega
  tive to the copper, so    that  E reaches   a limit which is greater than ZC ;
  lastly,  if a current   passes,  polarization occurs and the zinc becomes
  gradually less negative to the copper, E diminishing, therefore, from
 its maximum value.          But when a saturated solution of zinc sulphate
 is employed instead of water, the first state, if it exists at all, exists
 for so short a time that practically, zinc and copper in zinc sulphate
 are never at the same potential.          Thus (see Table X) when care is
 taken to keep the zinc and copper in a water cell well insulated from
 one another, E is found to increase from a value very little greater
 than    ZC, the electromotive force of contact of zinc and copper, to a
 limit, but in a zinc sulphate cell no such great increase is observed.
     In our present experiments we are not concerned with instantaneous
 electromotive forces of contact, a short time elapsing in every case
 between the contact and the determination of its electromotive force ;
and with polarization in the ordinary sense we have equally no con
cern.      In fact, our experiments relate to the maximum electromotive
forces of simple and compound cells.
     We find that zinc and copper connected by the electrolyte zinc
sulphate, dilute sulphuric acid, or water are not at the same potential,
the zinc being negative to the copper.           In the ease of dilute sulphuric
acid, where polarization cannot be prevented, the negative charge of
the zinc rapidly diminishes so that there is an instant at which the
metals are reduced to the same potential ; from Sir W. Thomson's
result we may suppose that there are two such instants.
     We did not measure the potentials of the surfaces which we mention
but really of air in the neighbourhood of these surfaces, but the dis
crepancies of our results are sufficiently small for us to neglect what
ever difference of potential may exist between a metallic or liquid
surface, and the air in contact with it.          In fact we have good reason
to believe that there is no great difference of potential between a
metallic or liquid surface, and the air in contact with it.
     Our experiments show, but not with as much accuracy as might be
desired, that the electromotive force of contact of two metals or two
electrolytes, or of a metal and an electrolyte is in each case a constant ;
that is to Bay,    if AB means the electromotive         force of contact of the

                  A, and the metal or electrolyte B (measured when
metal or electrolyte
A and B are not in contact with other conducting substances), AB
being identical with —      BA ;      then the total electromotive        force  of any
closed heterogeneous        circuit     composed      of the substances        A, B, C,
Nis:—
                             AB+BC+           &c.   +NA.
 The proof of this law is very important, as it is often denied without
experimental data.     Profesor F. Jenkin says : — " The following series
of phenomena occur when metals and an electrolyte are placed in con
tact : — 1. When a single metal is placed in contact with an electrolyte,
a definite difference of potentials is produced between the liquid and
the metal.    If zinc be plunged in water, the zinc becomes negative,
the water positive.    Copper plunged in water also becomes negative,*
but much less so than zinc. 2. If two metals be plunged in water (as
copper and zinc) the copper, the zinc, and the water forming a
galvanic cell, all remain at one potential, and no charge of electricity
is observed on any part of the system."
    It will also, we think, become evident that the natures of the
metals and    of the electrolytes determine the electromotive force of a
voltaic cell, just as the natures of the metals and the distribution of
temperature determine the electromotive       force of a thermo-electric
arrangement, and as the nature of the two metals zinc and copper de
termines the electromotive force of Sir W. Thomson's mechanical cell
in which copper filings fall from a copper funnel through a zinc                       in
ductor, in metallic connexion with the copper, into a copper vessel.
                                             n.
    At the surface of contact of two conducting substances there is an
 electromotive force of definite amount which tends to make electricity
 flow from one of the substances to the other.       For instance, at the
junction  of  zinc and copper  there is an electromotive force of 0-75 volt
which tends to cause electricity to flow from the copper to the zinc
across the junction.   This flow ceases when the potential of the zinc
is 075 volt greater than that of the copper, the difference of potentials
of the metals balancing the electromotive force of the junction.     It is
this difference of potential which is measured by the apparatus which
is described below.   When a substance                if
                                            is said to have a higher
potential than a substance N in contact with                  it,
                                                   we mean that this
state has been established in virtue of an electromotive force which
exists at the junction of the substances, and that the electromotive

    force of contact tends to produce a current of electricity from N to M
   across the junction.
       Sir W. Thomson's method of measuring the difference of potential
   between two metals in contact, which consisted in hanging a needle
   symmetrically over two similar plates of different metals, and observ
   ing its deflexions when it was charged, first positively and then nega
   tively, requires, in order to be accurate, all the delicacy of the arrange
   ment and even more complicated contrivances than those employed in
   the quadrant-electrometer.        It will be easily seen that a series of
   experiments for determining the difference of potentials between pairs o'f
  metals, pairs of liquids, and between liquids and metals, could only with
  the very greatest difficulty be carried out by a method which virtually
  requires the taking to pieces and refitting of a quadrant-electrometer
  for every experiment.        The authors' attention was, therefore, directed
  to devising a method of investigation in which a delicate quadrant-
  electrometer would be employed to measure the difference of potentials
 between two similar metal plates themselves acted on inductively by
 parallel and equidistant plane surfaces of the two substances in contact,
 the difference of potentials between which it was desired to measure.
 Thus let A and B be two insulated brass plates connected with the
 electrodes of the electrometer.         Let G under A and D under B be the
 surfaces whose      difference  of potential is to be measured.         A and B are
 both put to earth and then insulated.            G and D are made to change
 places   with   one  another,   G  now  being   under   B and D under A. The
 deflection of the electrometer needle will now give a measure of the
 difference of potential between G and D.*
     The apparatus, by means of which our idea has been carried out,
 has, by a process of natural selection, assumed the form shown in the
 accompanying drawing.           (Plate 7.)     The circular brass plates A and
 B, 20-4 centims. in diameter, are supported and kept insulated by
 means of artificially dried glass stems.         The leaden cups /, containing
 pumice stone moistened with sulphuric acid, slide in H by a bayonet-
joint, and may be lowered by the handles            J  so as to rest on the brass
plates when the instrument is not in use ; thus preventing access to
H of     the external air.
     The permanent adjustment for coincidence of the plane surfaces of
the brass plates is effected by means of three wood-screws in each of
the brass caps K; temporary adjustment for horizontality of the brass
plates is effected by means of a spirit level and three levelling screws

mining the electromotive force of contact between a metal D and a
liquid 0. VS is a screw-jack which enables the oblong wooden table
OS'O' to be raised to any level, and the table may be turned round
horizontally at any level. Three levelling screws, working in nuts in
the table, support the metal plate D, and three others, exactly similar,
support the porcelain vessel G which contains the liquid, so that the
upper surfaces of both G and D are in the same horizontal plane. A
binding screw a is soldered to the plate ; in the present case it holds
the metal strip E, which makes contact with the liquid ; E must have
been cut from the same sheet as the plate D.                        When there are two

  vessels  of liquid, contact is made between the liquids by wetting a
 piece   of cotton wick in one of the liquids and allowing its ends to dip
 below the    liquid surfaces.
    The brass rods 1?, insulated where they pass through the wooden
 frame by glass tubes and bone washers, are gauges which may be
 lowered or raised until their ends are at fixed distances below the level
 of the plates A and B.       By the reflections of these ends at the surfaces
 of the liquids or plates, we can judge of the position of the level sur
 faces C and D.       The wooden pegs 0 and 0', and a vertical slot in the
 stand at   WW",      enable a reversal of G and D to be made with accuracy
 and rapidity.
    The parts of the frame WWW" in view of the brass plates are
 covered with tin plates or tin foil, connected with the outside of the
electrometer.       A tin plate door, of which the hinges are seen at MM,
shuts up a metal box enclosing the whole apparatus, including the
electrometer,     short-circuit key, and connecting wires.        This bos is
permanently in connexion with the outside of the electrometer.             The
plug Z of the short-circuit key is kept connected with this cover
through a hole in which it may be withdrawn from its bed to insulate
the plates.
   We shall now describe a complete operation, to obtain the electro
motive force of contact between a metal and a liquid, for example.
Suppose the permanent adjustments to have been made, and that the
plates A and B are quite bright.         The plate D is cleaned and laid on
the  levelling screws B ; the porcelain dish containing the liquid is laid
on   the levelling screws Q. By turning S and the levelling screws
(0 moving in its slot), and by the use of a gauge gh of which the h
part represents      the distance apart determined upon for A and C and
B and I), we get the surfaces into their proper relative positions.        The
brass rod N' is now lowered until its end and its reflection at the sur
face of D seem to meet, and it is then made fast.          Before proceeding
rnrther, the insulation of the glass rods, the permanence of the zero
of the electrometer,       and the permanence of position of the needle
when the quadrants are insulated, are ascertained.         The strip E which
is quite bright is now bent to dip into the liquid, and the cover         If is
lowered.     Insulate by means of the key, and take the zero. Now, lift
the cover M, lower the table and reverse C and D ; raise the table
mtil the end of N and its reflection in the surface of the liquid nearly
meet; lower the cover and take a reading.             Now, short-circuit the
quadrants, insulate, and proceed to take a new reading.             Alternate
readings are on opposite sides of the zero.
   We found that when slight changes occur in the dryness of the air
inside the electrometer, there are changes in the zero which are probably
'lue to slight traces of moisture remaining on the suspension fibres of
the needle.      It is also to be remarked that when the quadrants of the

electrometer are insulated from one another, any slight change in the
charge of the instrument causes a motion of the needle.
   The hand must be trained to insulate the plates from one another.
After three months' practice our insulations are        so perfect that there is
seldom even a tremor on removing the plug, whereas in the beginning
of our experiments we often had in succession ten bad attempts at
insulation. A good insulation depends on the plug leaving both sides
of its seat simultaneously. This key gave better results than any of
the other arrangements at our disposal.
   We at first thought, from considering the change of capacity in the
quadrants (as the needle moved), that our measurements would be
more accurate when very small.        This is not the case, but it led us to
try a method of observation which may suggest itself.              We brought
the spot of light to zero in every experiment by acting inductively on
the insulated plates A and B by means of small plates placed over
them charged to a measurable difference of potential.                 We may
employ this method modified at some future time.
   The suspension fibres of the needle were tolerably near one another,
and the trap-door gauge was adjusted for as great a charge as it was
convenient to give to the jar, and as it was nearly unstable it indicated
extremely small changes of charge.           The relative positions of the
mirror 0, the lamp, lens, and scale* are shown in the lower right-hand
part of the Plate. The lens forms a virtual image of the wire of the
lamp-slit at GO centims. from the mirror Q', and the scale I*, which is
two metres from the electrometer, receives the image formed by the
mirror. We had supposed that no better definition of the slit could
be obtained by the use of a lens, but in reality great benefit was derived
from its use, our readings being much more accurate than they would
have been had the lamp-slit, without the lens, been put at 60 centims.
from the mirror. We consider that our readings (as far as the electro
meter itself is concerned) are fairly accurate to the one two-thousandth
part of a volt.

   To find the relative values of deflections of the electrometer neec
two brass plates were placed under A and B at the distance of 6'4 ma
We were able to give to the plates a difference of potentials equal tc
the electromotive force of a Daniell, or to any fraction of this. Reversal
is made by means of a key without any actual changes in the positions
of the plates.

   Thus the deflections are proportional to the differences of potential
between the lower plates, a result which could not have been anti
cipated.    At the distance of 16 mm., the results given in Table                  III
were  obtained,   and here again we find that the deflections are propor
tional to the difference of potential between the lower plates.

    The Daniell was occasionally connected with the electrometer
directly. It constantly gave the deflection 230'4. It was not a new
Daniell. Thus the ratio between the deflections obtained by two
methods of measuring a difference of potential, one by direct connexion
with electrometer, and the other by reversing the induction plates,
is 3'4, when the distance between the plates is 6'4 mm., 4"8 for 10 9
mm., and 6'8   for  1(5'0  mm.  Plotting three points on squared          paper
with these numbers as co-ordinates, and drawing the arc of a circle
through them, we found the approximate values of the ratios cor
responding with different distances given in Table V". This table was

   In subsequent experiments we used the distances 10'9 and 10'0 mm.
As the electrometer was twice taken to pieces, its quadrants being
altered in position, we took great care in the later experiments to
determine   the value of our deflections in each          case.

     It is to be observed that although there was a motion of the elec
 trometer     needle when the quadrants were insulated (shown by the
 great difference between every two successive readings), still the
 observations are sufficiently consistent, and when taken two by two
 they show that polarization has the effect of decreasing the readings.
 Taking the means of every two successive readings we have in the
 zinc sulphate,      1175,     8-3, 8 4, and     again, after the zinc is cleaned,
 10"75,    1<>8,  9-0.    In the acid this effect is even more marked,                the
deflections     diminishing rapidly from 10-0 to 3'9, and again from 9'15
to 6 0.      Thus we see that polarization in the ordinary sense, so far
from producing a difference of potentials between zinc and copper
joined by a liquid, in reality tends to reduce the difference of potentials
that already existed between them.
    The electrometer now began to show the existence of two faults,
imperfect     contact     between     the electrodes and the quadrants, and a
slight discharge       from the needle to the quadrants.                The instrument
was, therefore, taken to pieces, and the first fault rectified by the
addition of contact springs (in addition to the little weights previously
employed) between the electrodes and quadrants, and the second by
the needle and quadrants being cleaned.
    In observations made during the last four months on the constancy
of electromotive force of cells, we found that Latimer Clark's cell
when tested by an electrometer (kept in a perfectly constant state)
altered very little when its poles were kept insulated.                      The electro
motive force of this cell is known to be 1*457 volts, and we have used
it   as a standard      to determine     the changes        produced    in readings    by
changes in the positions of the quadrants.
    When we compared the electromotive force of contact                       of zinc and
copper with the constant cell, it was found in every case to be 0"75
volt at the temperature of 17° C. The deflections in the last two
tables might be reduced to volts if we knew the contact electromotive
force of zinc and copper at 10° C.

   A number of results have been collected in Table XI.                                The num
bers in a    vertical column below the name of a substance are the differ
ences of potential in volts between that substance and the substance
in the same horizontal row as the number, the two substances being in
contact.       Thus zinc is negative to saturated pure zinc sulphate, the
electromotive force of contact being 0-358 volt.

   From Tables          VI, VII,      and   VIII,    we see that when zinc and copper
are connected by an electrolyte the zinc becomes negative to the
copper, the difference of potential seeming to be somewhat less than
0-2 volt for water, zinc sulphate, and dilute sulphuric acid.                             This dif
ference    of potential added to the electromotive force of contact of zinc
and copper        ought to be equal to the electromotive                     force of a simple

    The changes which occur in the electromotive force of a cell are
difficult to explain.       They may be due to impurities in the metals, to
air condensed at metallic surfaces, to air and other gases dissolved in
the liquid, &c.       They seem to be quite arbitrary, and they are often
very considerable.         The authors have begun an investigation regard
ing   the causes  of   these  peculiar effects.               ¦»
    The discrepancies observable in the following comparisons may also
be due to the smallness of the electromotive forces of contact which
were measured separately, but they are in some part due to the unex
plained changes which occur in the electromotive force of a cell. Let
C, Z, and L represent the copper, zinc, and liquid respectively of a
simple cell ; let Li and La be the liquid in contact with the copper,
and the liquid in contact with the zinc of a Daniell's cell             ;  let CL   be
the electromotive       force of contact of C and     L, and let CL    be identical
with — LC.       Taking the five cells of Table XI, and assuming that              the
electromotive force of a contact of two substances as it exists in a               cell
is equal to its electromotive force when measured in our apparatus,                 we
get the following results : —

     In every case the sum of the separate contact electromotive forces
 is so nearly equal to the observed maximum electromotive force of the

 cell, that we have good reason for believing that the electromotive
 force of contact of any two substances is constant whatever other sub
 stances may be in the circuit.      At the same time it becomes evident
 that there cannot be a very great difference of potential between a
 metallic or liqnid surface and the air in contact with it.
    That the electromotive forces of a zinc sulphate cell and of a water
 cell are so nearly equal seems to be rather accidental.       Zinc sulphate
 is positive to zinc and is less positive to copper, its contact electro
 motive forces having to be subtracted from one another; whereas
 water is not so positive to zinc but is negative to copper, the contact
 electromotive forces being therefore added together.
    In any complete conducting circuit (receiving no energy from with
 out) composed of the substances A, B,. . . . N, the total electromotive
 force is equal to AB + BC + . . . . -f-NA. Now when no changes are
 occurring in the circnit such as will produce a supply of energy, we
 know from the law of conservation of energy that this total electro
 motive force is nothing. In a compound metallic circuit, which is
everywhere of the same temperature, this condition is satisfied.          But
 it is not satisfied if the temperature varies in the circuit, and we find
 then that the total electromotive force AB + BC + . . . . NA is no longer
 nothing, its amount depending on the nature of the metals and on the
 distribution of temperature.      Again, we find that even when all parts
 of the circuit are at the same temperature, and one or more of the
 substances are liquid or solid electrolytic conductors, the sum of the
 electromotive force of contact is not nothing, its amount depending
 altogether on the nature of the supply of energy which exists in the
 circnit, and therefore on the chemical natures of the electrolytes and
 of the metals in contact with the electrolytes.         In fact, the electro
motive force of     a voltaic arrangement depends on the chemical natures
of the metals and of the electrolytes.

    "When    any two pure insulated     substances  A   and  B are placed in
contact with one another, the electromotive force of contact AB charges
them to a certain difference of potentials which is numerically equal
to AB,     and these charges of electricity represent a certain amount of
energy of which the equivalent is a definite amount of chemical action.
If   the substances are pure there is no other electromotive force that
can disturb this establishment        of charge.    It is probable that the
chemical action which might occur          at the surface of contact is very

 little diminished by this charging, and we have no right to say that
 the total amount of possible chemical action at the contact of two
 metallic surfaces is simply equivalent to the energy of the charges.
  When A and B are solid their rigidity limits the possible amount of
 chemical action ; but even when they are both metals if one is a liquid
 the total amount may be very considerable.            With metals there is a
 limit produced by the want of mobility of the alloy, and when the
 liquid is not metallic there is a limit produced by the compound being
 insoluble, and so preventing free contact.            After the charges are
established the electromotive force of contact is exactly balanced, and
there is no further action of any kind.         If, however, A or B be a non
conductor, this establishment of charge may take a considerable time.
In any case there can only be an exceedingly small amount of chemical
action between any two pure substances, as for example, pure zinc and
pure sulphuric acid.
    If A, B, and C be any three substances insulated from other bodies,
A and C being each in contact with B, but not in contact with each
other, the electromotive      forces of contact  AB   and BC charge the  three
bodies in such a way that the difference of potentials between       A  and B
is equal and opposite to      AB,  and the difference of potentials  between
B and C is equal and opposite toBC. The energy required to prodnce
this charging of the bodies is due to chemical action at the places of
contact.     After the three bodies are      so charged there cannot be any
further chemical      action,   and the total amount of possible chemical
action    at these places of contact is very little diminished by the
charging.
    Prima facie we cannot compare the present difference of potentials
between A and C with the electromotive force of contact that would
exist between A and C were they brought together.
    The establishment of the above differences of potential takes a shorter
or longer time, as the bodies are more or less conducting.
    If now we imagine A and C to be brought into contact, as we do
not know the value of       AC, we cannot predict the amount of distur
bance produced in the charges of A, B, and C ; but we may assume
that some disturbance is produced, that is, a current of electricity flows
in the circuit.    We can also say that after the possible chemical energy
at the various    junctions is exhausted, as well as the potential energy
equivalent to bringing A and C in contact, then, if the temperature of
the circuit is everywhere the same, there can be no further current,
since there is no further supply of energy.
    It is known that in a compound solid metallic circuit, which is every
where at the same temperature, there is no continuous chemical action
at the junctions, and consequently by the law of conservation               of
energy there cannot be a continuous current. Hence it has been usual

  to assume that    if A, B, C of our   second example are metals, solid or
  liquid, the difference  of potentials  between A and C jnst before being
  brought into contact is equal to    CA.     Now in the  case of one of the
  metals,   B, being a liquid, we have by the experiment described further
  on shown this assumption to be untrue ; and we believe that even when
  the three metals are all solid, if one or more of them were rather non
  conducting, and if the surfaces of contact were large, there would be
 obtained a result similar to that which we have obtained with solid
 electrolytes of high resistance.       In the case of three ordinary solid
 metals of high conductivity, the experiment would be very difficult, if
 not impossible, to perform owing to the previous exhaustion of the
 possible chemical action through want of perfect insulation of A and
 C from all substances other than B before being themselves put in
 contact.     The experiments now about to be described, as well as those
 given in our last paper, lead us to the conclusion that in all cases when
 A and C are brought into contact there will be a disturbance, in some
 cases, no doubt, only momentary, in the previous charges of A, B,
 and C.
                            A Metallic Voltaic Cell.
    It may be known that when rods of zinc and copper are placed in
mercury and connected with an electrometer no charge is observed.
If known, this may have been regarded as a crucial test of the truth
of the common        theory of compound metallic circuits. Whether the
zinc and copper are in contact outside the mercury or not, the amalga
mation of the zinc appears to proceed at the same rate.             Now, it
seemed to us that in this case the impurities and great conductivity of
the    zinc   with the great liquidity     of  the  amalgam, and the close
 proximity of foreign particles to pure metal, caused the amalgamation
to be produced by local action alone, so that the supply of availabl
chemical energy for the production of a current from the zinc to
copper was exceedingly small ; and we have no doubt that at low enough
temperatures, when the amalgam loses its liquidity, such an arrange
ment becomes a simple voltaic cell.         It was necessary for us to uso
instead of zinc a metal of which the amalgam is nearly solid at
ordinary temperatures.         On enquiry we found that magnesium was
such a metal, and on the first trial we obtained a result corroborative
of the above theory.
    Strips of platinum and magnesium, metallically attached to the
electrodes of the electrometer, were dipped into mercury which was,
perhaps, slightly impure from the presence of other metals, but which
had previously been washed with distilled water, and then well dried.
There was a sudden large deflection, the amount of which fluctuated
very much afterwards, but which was always considerable and on the
same side of the zero.         On successive reversals of the electrometer
                                                                  Q2

key the deflections to      right and left of zero were found to     be nearly
eqaal to one another.       In a  short time there seemed to be an increased
steadiness in the amount of deflection.           When the platinum and mag
nesium were short-circuited for some minutes, the deflection had
decidedly increased in amount on renewed insulation, and this oc
curred after every short-circuiting.          To determine the electromotive
force of   the  arrangement, strips    of   platinum and magnesium, scraped
very clean, were dipped into pure mercury which had previously been
 washed with distilled water, and well dried.          The maximum electro
 motive force obtained was 1*56 volts, that is about one and a half
times the electromotive force of a Daniell's cell, the platinum corres
ponding with the copper plate in the Daniell's cell. It may be possible
by mechanical or other means, or by using another metal than mag
nesium, to give constancy to this arrangement ; and as its internal
resistance is extremely small the cell may be of great practical use for
the production of powerful currents.           It may be remarked that as an
amalgam may       be  easily separated    into  its components by distillation,
such a cell by suitable arrangements can be kept in action for an
indefinite time.
    We have examined a circuit composed of the metals platinum, tin,
and lead, and the coil of a pralvanometer. On raising the temperature of
the tin gradually we fonnd that there was a current, and that it grad ually
increased.     Rapid changes in the current were observable at the melt
ing point of the tin, and there seemed to be a small electromotive force
independent of thermo-electric effects. When the platinum and lead
strips were connected with the electrometer, the deflections were found
to be too small for decided conclusions to be drawn.         We shall proceed,
 when time allows us,     with  the investigation of metallic voltaic cells.

    To measure the electromotive force of the voltaic cell formed by
 plates of zinc and copper separated by paraffin wax and other elec
 trolytes of great resistance, and to determine the change of conduc

  being cut from the same piece of metal ; C is bent upwards and passes
  through an orifice in the bath.     The wire from 1) to the insulated
  electrode of the electrometer    is protected    by a wide tube of metal    ;
 this tube, the outside of the electrometer, and the uninsulated electrode
 being connected with B. A double door (not shown in the figure) gives
access to the inside of the bath. HGH is a wooden support which may
be withdrawn from the bath.        E and F are thermometers of which the
 bulbs are near the surface of the paraffin.      The difficulty of determin
ing exactly    the  temperature  of  the  paraffin wax arose from its non-
condactivity ; and the use of a third thermometer, passing through a
tubulure horizontally underneath B, was found to add nothing to the
accuracy    of the temperature readings.
    To obtain continuous time readings of the electrometer, we let the
image of the cross fibres of our lamp slit formed by the mirror fall on
a horizontal wooden roller covered with paper.          This roller was 100
centims. long, and 13 centims. in diameter.         A clock causes the roller
to make a revolution in two minutes.        We are able suddenly to change
the rate of this roller to one revolution in 7'2 minutes, and we can
also slightly vary the rate by altering the length of the pendulum.
The image of the cross fibres is easily followed in its motion on the
paper by a pencil.     When the paper is cut off at any place parallel to
the roller-axis it exhibits the time observations in a compact form well
 adapted for calculation. The clock being stopped and a scale attached

 to the roller, readings may be made in the ordinary way. Such a roller
 and clock costs very little, and form a valuable addition to every re
 flecting galvanometer or electrometer.
                                    Paraffin Wax.
     The plate A being zinc and connected with the insulated electro
meter-electrode, and the paraffin being solid between the two plates,
 we first short-circuited the arrangement to get zero, then insulated and
allowed the electromotive         force of the paraffin cell to charge plate A,
and the electrometer quadrants in connexion with it.
    A detailed account of our experiments               on conductivity is given
further on. It       is snfficent here to state that at low temperatures the
conductivity of paraffin wax is exceedingly small, the conductivity in
creases to the melting point, the increase being extremely rapid during
melting, and there seems to be a regular increase during the melted
state.     Hence in the experiments with the zinc plate at low tempera
tures, the resistance is so great that although there is a slight charging
of the quadrants due to electromotive force, this is somewhat disguised
by defects of the electrometer.          In fact, at low temperatures, it is im
possible to measure the electromotive force of this simple cell, although
the existence of an electromotive force is quite evident, but when the
conductivity becomes sufficiently great, and this occurs long before
there is any appearance of melting on the upper surface of the paraffin,
the charge reaches a maximum with sufficient rapidity for its accurate
measurement.         At a few degrees above the melting point the maxi
mum charge established itself at once, and however often the plates
were short-circuited for the purpose of taking the zero, the maximum
charge was found to be approximately the same, and to correspond
with an electromotive force of 0'73 volt when least, and 0'75 volt
when greatest : it was also not much affected by change of tempera
ture.     To make these measurements we used as a standard a Latimer
Clark's constant cell.*
    When the plates are charged to their maximum difference of poten
tials there is electric equilibrium, and no further current tends to pass
through the arrangement, the electromotive force being balanced.                  If
then E0 represents this maximum charge, and if Ei is the charge at a
time (<i), and E2 the charge at the time             then —

¦this   conductivity    with the conductivity for that temperature which
we    have otherwise     determined, but we infer from the curve that the
above formula gives a result twice or three times as great as the true
conductivity: this, however, might have been expected from our
knowledge of the phenomena of absorption in dielectrics.
    Sir W. Thomson, in the " Proceedings of the Royal Society " for June
10th, 1875, describes an experiment in which plates of zinc and copper,
in contact with the two sides of a plate of glass, form a voltaic cell.
 When the glass was sufficiently heated to become conducting there
was evident charging of the plates* In the glass cell the maximum
charge became less and less after every short-circuiting, whereas in the
paraffin cell the maximum charge is constant.               In the one case all the
elements of the circuit were solid, the glass being very far indeed from
its liquefying point, so that the amount of possible chemical action at
the junctions was small, and after every successive short-circuiting,
there was a less and less supply until the arrangement was approach
ing a state which had hitherto been supposed to be peculiar to a com
pound metallic circuit ; whereas our paraffin possessed mobility, and
the amount of possible chemical action at the surfaces of contact was
practically infinite in comparison with the currents charging the
plates.
    It is stated above that when any two pure substances otherwise
insulated are brought into contact with one another, the amount of
chemical action must be practically nil, but, as perfectly pure sub
stances do not exist, when two bodies are brought into contact small
complete circuits are formed by three or more different substances, and
currents are produced until the possible chemical actions at the surfaces
of contact are exhausted. Now if one or more of these substances
in such elementary circuits are non-conductors, this exhaustion can
only proceed very slowly, and if the substances at the surfaces of
contact have immobility, the total amount of possible chemical action
will be necessarily small. Hence we see that the amount of chemical
action between bodies depends upon their conductivity and mobility,
as well as on the electromotive forces of contact, and as the chemical
action equivalent to the energy of small charges of electricity is quite
incapable of being detected by the ordinary methods of chemical ana
lysis, and as the charges are easily measurable with an electrometer, we
have, if our theory be correct, in electrical measurement a method of
chemical analysis which is infinitely more sensitive than any purely
chemical method. Thus it is evident that in our paraffin cell there is
 chemical action, but our colleague, Dr. Divers, has found no traces of
 zinc in English paraffin oil which came out to Japan in galvanized
 iron cases, nor in paraffin oil heated to a temperature of 60° C, in a

zinc vessel for many hours.      In fact in chemical analysis, something
which is equivalent to current is measured by a method very much less
sensitive than   if the measurement were made by the best galvanometer,
whereas a current which is not observable with the best galvanometer
may be measured accurately with the electrometer.
   It is plain that if we assume an electromotive force of contact be
tween any two substances, there must be possible chemical action
between these two substances, and this chemical action can of course
only exist at the places of contact.     It may proceed slowly through
want of conductivity, and the amount possible in any given case may
be very small because of want of mobility of either of the substances
in contact, or of want of mobility of the compound formed by the
action.    Thus it is well known that the electromotive force of contact
of glass and other substances is often very considerable, and that the
chemical action between glass and most other substances is very small.
This is due to want of conductivity of the glass, but when glass
becomes heated, its conductivity much increases, and it then becomes
capable of acting chemically on many substances.            When in the
melted state it is acted on chemically by the majority of substances.
It is possible that this great increase of chemical activity accompany
ing a rise of temperature is much more due to increased conductivity
than to change of electromotive force of contact.       Lead glass which
insulates   so  badly, is comparatively    easily acted on by chemicals.
 Chemical   action is always slow unless the substances are conductors,
and we find that nearly all the substances which chemists find it un
necessary to dissolve before applying re-agents are conductors. In
 some cases previous solution may be also required for the mere pur
 pose of producing mobility at the surfaces of contact.        To expedite
 chemical action, solutions are stirred together ; this increases the area
 of contact and diminishes resistance as well as rapidly bringing into
 contact fresh portions previously unacted on.
    The alkaline earths in the solid state are very bad conductors, but
 when melted they are comparatively good conductors, and there is no
 doubt that we have here an explanation of the fact that the bottoms
 come out of platinum crucibles containing melted alkaline earths.
 We might expect that in those      cases  in which melted metals have a
 considerable electromotive force of contact, they would combine to
 form alloys with great rapidity, on account of their great conductivity
 and sufficient mobility to continue chemical combination.       The great
 conductivity of mercury, and its mobility and the mobility of the
 compounds which it forms with other metals, enables it to enter
 rapidly into combination with those metals with which it has a great
 electromotive force of contact.    And it is probable that the electro
 motive force of contact of mercury with iron or with steel is exceed
 ingly small, or that the amalgam is a solid except at very high tern

peratures.     Cold glass is acted on by hydrofluoric acid, and this is
possible  on  account of the great electromotive force and on account of
the silicon tetrafluoride formed by the combination being volatile,
and,   therefore,  possessing great mobility.     Hitherto chemists have
only employed the two ideas of chemical affinity and the amount of
chemical action, but we have shown that these ideas are simplified
when regarded as electromotive        force of contact and currents of
electricity. To connect the two ideas we have a third, viz., resistance,
and the electrical law of Ohm becomes the chemical law — the quantity
of chemical action in unit time equals the sum of a great number of
terms, each of which is an electromotive force divided by a resistance.
                               Outta-Percha.
    The metallic plates of the last experiment were carefully cleaned,
and the paraffin wax replaced by a sheet of gutta-percha, previously
scraped, washed with soap and water, ordinary water, alcohol, sodium
carbonate, and hot distilled water, and thoroughly dried.        The upper
plate A was of clean zinc as before. Our experiments on the con
ductivity of gutta-percha, described further on, show that it increases
with the temperature, not only at the low temperature at which it has
hitherto been examined, but also after it has become plastic at higher
temperatures.
    At the lowest temperature at which we examined the arrangement
there was a decided charging of the plates, but it was so slow that we
must regard the measurement of the minimum electromotive force
0'23 volt as being too small, for a careful examination of the defects
of the electrometer showed that under these circumstances the
measurement might be too small.         At higher temperatures the maxi
mum charge was established with much greater rapidity.
    On each day, some time after the commencement of the experiment
for that day, the electromotive force having remained constant for
Borne time suddenly increased, and then remained nearly constant at
its higher value. This seemed at first to be due to the plates having
been short-circuited for intervals of four minutes or more, but we
afterwards found that it occurred when the plates were only short-
circuited for a few seconds to get to zero. Also, it did not seem to
occur at a particular temperature ; on one occasion the sudden rise
happened at about 35° C, and on another at about 72° C. On the
first of these days the mean low electromotive force was 0"584 volt,
and the mean high 0'763 volt, the very lowest and very highest being
0 64 and 0'86 volt.        On the second day the mean low was 0-534<
volt and the mean high 0*773 volt, the lowest and highest being
 0'529 and 0-789 volt. We are sure, when these measurements were
 made, that the conductivity of the gutta-percha was sufficiently great
 to eliminate any effects due to the minute defects of the electrometer.

   As in the case of paraffin, the conductivity calculated from the
time readings, whilst the zinc and copper plates were establishing
their charge, is greater than the conductivity measured independently
by two copper plates charged with a battery for about five minutes
and then kept insulated.
                                 Ebonite.
   Between the zinc and copper plates was placed an ebonite sheet,
having an average thickness of 0'35 millim. It was chemically clean,
and there was no surface conduction at even low temperatures.           We
found, as in the previous cases, that there was evidence of an electro
motive force, but the charging proceeded very slowly until about
36° C, when the conductivity had greatly increased.         During thirty-
five minutes the temperature steadily increased to 74°     C,  and as there
was no indication of a maximum charge, we let it increase without
short-circuiting during this thirty-five minutes, at the end of which
time the deflection indicated an electromotive force of 3 volts.      After
short-circuiting the charge again     established  itself, but  it did   not
increase as rapidly as it had done at first at the lower temperature,
although from our independent experiments we know that the con
ductivity is greater at higher temperatures.       Precautions have been
taken to avoid any sliding of the ebonite plates during the experi-
m?nts ; for certain preliminary observations showed that such sliding
would produce charges of electricity which would mask mere voltaic
results.    From the mathematical expressions for conductivity and
from our experimental determinations of the conductivity at any given
temperature, we endeavoured, by calculation, to discover whether the
first set of time readings indicated an approach to a maximum, but we
obtained inconsistent results ; the maximum electromotive force thus
calculated varying from 3 to 12 volts.         After the experiments the
zinc plate was found to be only slightly dulled in its polish and not
coloured, neither did the copper plate appear much changed in appear
ance, but a lead weight which had been laid on the zinc to keep it in
close contact with the ebonite was found to be quite red.
   It is evident, therefore, that this arrangement had nothing in
common with an ordinary simple cell, the great charging of the plates
being due to a decomposition of the ebonite by heat.
                              India-Bubber.
   In November, 1875, we endeavoured to find the electromotive         force
of a simple cell formed by placing a sheet of india-rubber containing
sulphur between zinc and copper plates, and we then obtained results
analogous to those which have just been described for ebonite. During
the present investigation, we expected to obtain the same results, since
we used the piece of india-rubber which had previously been

1878.]                Contact    Theory    of Voltaic Action.                 229
employed.       Contrary to our expectations, however, there appeared to
be no further decomposition of the india-rubber by heat, and results
analogous to those previously obtained with the paraffin wax were met
with.     Probably, therefore, all the sulphur that could easily be
liberated had been expelled by the previous heating.            At about 90° C,
the conductivity was sufficient to enable us to measure, with some
accuracy, the electromotive force, which we found to be 0"168 volt ;
but somewhat as in the case of the gutta-percha, between 90° and
 100° C, the electromotive           force increased to 0 356 volt.          This
increase did not appear to be as sudden as in the case of gutta-percha,
but, as before, the electromotive force was fairly constant on each side
of this place of changing.
                                     Shell-Lac.
    An extremely thin sheet of shell-lac was placed between plates of
zinc and copper, as in the preceding experiments.               At low tempera
tures there was evidently an electromotive force, which, at 28° C, we
were able to measure, as the conductivity was sufficiently great.
From this temperature upwards there was practically no change. In
fact, the electromotive     force was constant     and equal to 1-12 volts.    At
temperatures      higher than 65° C,          the arrangement established      its
charge    after  short-circuiting   with    the  rapidity  of an  ordinary liquid
 voltaic cell.
                      "Resistances  of  the above Electrolytes.
    It has been usual for telegraph engineers         to measure the resistance
 of gutta-percha, india-rubber, &c, after a current has been passing
 through the material for one or for not more than three minutes.
 Now, although this may be a very valuable test of a telegraph cable,
 since the amount of apparent loss, through want of insulation during
 the first small period of charge, is one of the elements affecting the
 received current, still since this loss is due to two causes, soaking in
 and true conductivity, and since the former is at first so very great
 compared with the latter, the real resistance can only be ascertained
 after the current has been on for a length of time. The practical
 time of charging necessary to enable the current to be a true measure
 of the conductivity seems to be less at higher temperatures, and in our
 experiments we have endeavoured to approximate to the elimination of
 soaking in.
                                   Paraffin-Wax.
    In November, 1875, we made a great number of time observations
 of the difference of potentials of two copper plates immersed in paraffin-
 wax, and kept asunder by three small pieces of glass, 0'191 centim.
 thick, the upper plate having been originally charged to a certain
 potential, and the lower plate kept in connexion with the earth. We

230               Profs. W. E. Ayrton and John Perry.                [Mar.  21,
found that the conductivity increased with temperature, the increase
being very rapid near the melting point, at which place, as we nsed no
auxiliary condenser, the rate of loss of charge was very high. To
measure the conductivity of melted paraffin, we employed a very
delicate reflecting astatic galvanometer        of 20,000 ohms resistance ;
one Daniell's cell, through a resistance of 120 megohms, gave a deflec
tion of 131"3 divisions on an ordinary scale, at about a metre distance.
The current from a battery having a measured electromotive force
47 times that of our standard Daniell passed through the paraffin
and the galvanometer.      Full precautions were taken to avoid all leak
age except through the paraffin, the deflection of the galvanometer
needle due to instrumental leakage alone being quite imperceptible.
The thermometers did not indicate truly the temperature of the
paraffin, being too high when the apparatus was heating, and too low
when it was cooling ; but as the cooling was very slow, the results
which are given in following table obtained during cooling, and which,
when plotted, give the curve       JK    (fig. 1, p. 231), may be regarded
as being fairly correct, for the observations seem to be all very con
sistent with one another.

    We were unable to obtain galvanometer        and electrometer    tests at
 tbe same temperature, since the galvanometer did not give deflections
 at low temperatures ; and as we had not at this time designed the time
 roller described above, and as no auxiliary condenser was used with
 the electrometer, the loss of charge was too rapid at high temperatures
 to make accurate time observations.
    The oil-bath used in November, being small and otherwise incon
 venient, we proceeded in May of this year with the investigation,
using the apparatus described above. At low temperatures time ob
 servations  of loss of charge were taken on a fixed scale. Near the
melting point time observations were taken on the roller in motion,
and at higher temperatures, one terminal of an auxiliary condenser of
one-third microfarad capacity and excellent insulation was attached
to the plate A, the other terminal of the condenser being connected
with B. Four Daniell's cells were used to charge A.
    At 2(T'9 C, the temperature of the room, A experienced no loss of
charge in ten minutes whether or not the condenser was attached.
   A number of preliminary experiments showed as before that there
was a great increase of conductivity at melting. For instance, on
May 15th, when the temperature was rising, the paraffin appeared to
be solid at 46° C, and it appeared to be liquid at 52° C, and between
these two temperatures we obtained the following results, t being
measured in minutes always.

   These results     cannot  be   compared directly with those previously
obtained with the galvanometer, because in the former case the paraffin
was cooling     from   a high temperature, 90° C, whereas in this case
the temperature was only raised to 51°, and it is well known that
when paraffin is cooled from a high temperature, it will remain liquid

 heated from a low temperature.
    Curve AB, May 16th, gives the relative conductivities when the
 paraffin was rising from 54° C. to 56° C. At 54° the paraffin seemed to
 be solid, and it did not appear to be melted at its upper surface, even
 for some time afterwards, when the thermometers indicated 60° C. But
 at 56° C. it was covered with white eruptions.          With the condenser,
 May 16th, we obtained the following tests. As we did not employ the
 roller the conductivities deduced from detached readings are often in
 consistent, and yet each of these conductivities was deduced from a
 number of observations, in some cases from twenty. This shows the
 difficulty of making eye observations, for when using the time roller
and tracing on it -with a pencil the path of the image of the cross
fibres, no such inconsistences were met with.

    These results may be compared with the galvanometer results,
because in both cases the temperature was cooling from a point much
above melting. Considering the great difficulty of measuring the
temperature, the agreement of these results with the galvanometer
results may be regarded as very satisfactory.

Therefore     the ratio     of the relative conductivities measured without

inductive capacity of paraffin does not change much with temperature,

neglected, we can calculate the specific resistance in megohms of a
cubic centimetre of paraffin wax from our time readings by the

                                   Ebonite.
   In determining the conductivity of ebonite, we at first        proceeded
dsscribed above, using a pair of copper plates ; but we found that the
charge instead of decreasing through conductivity increased apparently
indefinitely. On replacing the copper plates by sheets of platinum we
obtained consistent results, but this may have been due to the sulphur
that could easily    be liberated by heat having been driven out in the
previous    heating.     QR is the curve connecting the conductivity,           or

   the resistance of the ebonite being very great, and the loss, therefore,
   very  slow  even   at high temperatures, and as the specific inductive
   capacity of ebonite is unknown, we were compelled to make experi
   ments to determine      the electric capacity of our arrangement.       This
   was very difficult on account of the small area, 45'6 square centims., of
  the ebonite in contact with the platinum.        The result, therefore, which
  we obtained, and from which we deduced the specific inductive capa
  city of ebonite to be 1"7, must only be accepted as very rough, and
  merely of use in giving us approximate           values of the resistance at
  various temperatures.       The number 1*7 seems too small for a compo
  sition of india-rubber and sulphur. Consequently, all our calculated
  valnes of x may be too large, and ought to be reduced in the ratio
 of 17 to the frue specific inductive capacity of ebonite.

          Itwell known that india-rubber has a greater specific resistance
               is
    and a less specific inductive capacity than gutta-percha. Now                                                  i
    popular explanation of this might be given as follows — Imagine                            :                   i
    portion of the india-rubber in an india-rubber condenser replaced                                             by
                                                                                                                   a
    metallic or other conducting substance either in a single piece or toe                                   in
    form of grains scattered throughout the mass of the dielectric, then
    the resistance of the condenser will be diminished while its capacity
    will be increased. As more and more metal           introduced into tie    is
    dielectric the capacity will become greater and greater, so that   las,                                  at
    if all the india-rubber be replaced by metal, we ought to consider sncl.
    a condenser as having an extremely great capacity, although on accom'
    of the conduction     it     would         be impossible               to experimentally measure
    the charge.    If the above consideration,                          which of course really apphes
    to a dielectric of heterogeneous constitution, be also applicable                                               to
    different homogeneous dielectrics, then we might expect to find that
    for all dielectrics      the specific inductive capacity diminishes                                      as the
    specific resistance       increases. Now the experiments we have       lately
    been engaged on concerning        specific resistances enable us to pwrt
    that in the case of several well-known dielectrics this    really so, as will     is
    be seen from the following table    —           :

     It will be observed    tbat the conventional specific inductive capacity
  of shcll-lac does not follow onr law that small specific inductive capacity
  accompanies high specific resistance.          We are inclined, however, to
  think that the real capacity may be far greater than this conventional
  one, since M. Boltzmann proved in 1874 that the trne specific induc
  tive capacities of sulphur and resin were respectively twice and one
  and a half times as great as the capacities for these substances given
  in books.    Up to the present time we have not ourselves had an
  opportunity of finding the true specific inductive capacity of shell-lac.
     In the preceding table the resistance of ebonite is given in accord
 ance with the rule stated in gur last paper, that is, the resistance given
  in that paper has been reduced in the ratio of 1*7 to 3'15. The specific
 inductive capacity of Hooper's india-rubber is usually given as 3'1 ;
 nsing, however, the numbers given on page 67, Clark and Sabine
 Electrical Tables for the capacities of a sheet of air, and of the india-
 rubber one square foot in area, and -j-oVtf hich in thickness, we find the
 ratio to be 3"3.
     Following out the relationship shown in the above table, we may
 consider a highly conducting metal as a dielectric of extremely great
 specific inductive capacity, just as air, which has an extremely great
 resistance, is a dielectric having (as far as experiment has yet shown)
 the least specific inductive capacity.        But as the resistance of the air
although very great      is  not  infinite, so it is reasonable to conceive the
existence of a space more highly insulating than when filled with air,
 and at the same time having a less specific inductive capacity.
     When we examine the phenomena of induction in this way we might
expect to find a simple relation between the values of specific resist
ance and specific inductive capacity, but further consideration shows
that the received notions of both these qualities of dielectrics are so
badly defined that the first step is to establish clearness in our concep
tions before endeavouring         to determine in what exact way specific
inductive capacity is a function of specific resistance.
    As regards the capacity of an air condenser there cannot be much
 vagueness, for there is neither perceptible absorption nor true conduc
tion, although further on we shall give our reasons for believing there
is some absorption.        But in all cases in which the dielectric is not
a gas there are absorption and conduction phenomena of a complicated
kind, and experiment hitherto has not accurately defined what is meant
by capacity in such cases.
    We are now carrying on a series of observations on induction phe
nomena in flint glass jars and other condensers with dielectrics having
a greater and less specific conductivity than glass.          It is an investiga
tion which progresses very slowly, as some of the single experiments
last nearly a month.          Certain curves obtained for time risings and
fallings of potential in condensers bore striking resemblances to             the

   1878.]               On the  Wscosity of Dielectrics.                241
  curve expressing the time increase of strain in a substance subjected
  to a constant stress, and careful examination shows that all our results
  up to the present time bear so close an analogy with the stress and
   strain phenomena in viscous substances, that we feel that this analogy
  means a physical connexion.      We therefore propose, even before the
  completion of the experiments, to show in the present paper the bear
  ing of this analogy; since not only does it constitute an extension of
  Faraday's stress theory of induction, but, in addition, it forms a veri
  fication of the extension of our knowledge regarding stress and strain
  phenomena, as afforded by our recent experiments on the viscosity of
  substances. Besides this, the theory that we are about to sketch roughly,
  and which we hope to establish in all its details by experiment, is
  valuable in furnishing an easily conceived image of the internal action
  taking place in a dielectric.
      A complete series of experiments will soon be ready for publication,
  showing that almost every body which can be examined exhibits a
  time increase of strain under a constant stress. Thus, when a small
 couple, much less than that which is required to produce any perma
 nent set, is applied to twist a prism, there is a rapid production of
 torsion due to a property of the material measured usually by a
 number called the modulus of rigidity; the rapidity depending mainly
 on the mass which has to be moved, and also depending on the viscous
 yielding (or on something which is related to the viscous yielding) of
 the material.    If we could eliminate the effect of inertia, then not an
 instantaneous but a very rapid production of torsion would be ob
 served, the production of strain along the prism not being instan
 taneous even at the beginning, but proceeding with a velocity com
 parable with the velocity of electric induction. After a very short
 interval the torsion no longer increases rapidly, and only its amount
 (D) at the end of the interval is what has usually been taken into con
sideration by physicists and engineers.      But it should be known that
it is only after a long time that the production of strain ceases, and
the additional torsion (<Z) in glass and steel fibres after some hours or
days in some of our experiments became equal to (£D) . If when the
production of strain appears to have ceased the twisting couple be
suddenly removed, then there is a rapid but not instantaneous reduc
tion of strain (D), and an additional reduction (d) effected after a con
siderable time.
     Thus for all strained substances that we have experimented on, the
equilibriated state is one in which there is a free strain or a strain that
is almost instantly removable, and there is also an absorbed strain
which is only slowly produced, and which is only slowly removable.
     Exactly in the same way, when a condenser is charged by a battery
of electromotive force (V), the charge at first increases rapidly, due to
u property of the condenser called its capacity (S) ; this rapidity

242                Profe. W.   E. Ayrton and John Perry.            [Mar.   21,
depends on the supply of electricity by the battery, and on a less or
greater resistance to rapid motion offered by tbe viscosity (or on some
thing related to tbe viscosity) of tbe dielectric.
   If we could eliminate the effect of slow supply by the battery (and
this is always eliminated in the charging of glass condensers by voltaic
cells) we should still have not an instantaneous but a very rapid
charging of the condenser ; the rate of this charging does not at pre
sent appear to be experimentally         measurable, but ballistic galva
nometers    measure   the time  integral  of the current. We know from
the shape of the curve which 6hows the increase of charge with time,
and from the improbability of any want of continuity, that the rise of
charge is not really instantaneous.       After a very short interval when
the  rate of increase  of charge   is incomparably   smaller than the mean
rate during the interval, the total amount of charge (SV) is what has
usually been taken into account by physicists. But this charge does,
however, increase sometimes for many days to a maximum {(S+*)V},
and in certain experiments with a flint glass condenser («) at the end
of about ten days was equal to (|S).  If, when the charge seems to
increase no longer (we must not confound with increase of charge the
small flow into the condenser which continues even after a long time,
and which measures true conductivity) we connect the coatings of the
condenser, there is a rapid but not instantaneous loss of charge (SV),
and a further loss (*V) only occurring after a long period.    Thus for
our condenser (exactly as for the strained viscous prism) the equili-
briated state for any given difference of potentials is one in which
there is a free charge, that        is,
                                    a charge almost instantly removable,
and an absorbed charge, that          is,
                                      a charge only slowly produced and
slowly removable.       It has usually been considered that this absorbed
charge      quite
            is      distinct  from conduction, but we know that when
strain  is being produced in a viscous substance, and all substances
seem to be viscous, some of the energy          converted into heat, there
                                                      is
fore  if,as we consider, absorption      theisproduction of strain,    must
                                                                      it
be accompanied by the generation of heat, and the conversion                  of
electric energy into heat      is most suitably termed conduction.      We
cannot, therefore, have absorption without conduction, and further,
we consider all true conduction as an absorption in which the whole
quantity of electricity   is  converted into heat, or into some form          of
energy  not  electrical.   Again, when strain              is
                                                   produced by mechanical
stress, we know that the more rapid          the production of strain the
                                                 is
greater will be the amount of heat produced by internal friction.
Reasoning by analogy, therefore, we may conclude that as the rate             of
production of electric strain grows less and less as the interval elaps
ing since charging increases, therefore the rate of conversion of electric
energy into heat, that is, conduction, also grows less and less, and,
therefore,   it  correct to say that the resistance of

                                            is

possibly," because we have reasons for thinking our ideas of stress and
strain will not only throw light on the questions of absorption pre
viously referred to, but will in addition suggest an explanation of the
hitherto apparent inconsistency between the laws for change of re
sistance by heat in conductors and in insulators.           If that be so, then
we think   it may  be  possible  that  we   shall find  out  that Ohm's law    is
always but an approximation,          and that this approximation       is   the
nearer and nearer the truth the less the resistance of the conductor,

Royal   Society,"  October   5th,   1870.)
   True conduction       isfound to be extremely small after some weeks
for the flint glass in Sir W. Thomson's electrometers, care being taken
that the charge in the jar     isleft quite undisturbed by induction, from
electrified moving neighbouring bodies for example, whereas there             is
much loss of charge due to conductivity as well as that due to absorp
tion in the first few days after charging.        Thus two electrometer jars
in  our possession when left untouched for some weeks were found,             if
the first measurement were made not much less than one week after
charging, to retain nearly the whole of their charge, the electrometers
being in constant use, but the replenisher not touched during the
entire time, to avoid alteration of internal distribution.           Now when
the conductivity of glass     ismeasured in any ordinary way a few hours
after charging,     it seems to be very great even when we are able to
eliminate true absorption, which      is all recoverable as electric energy.
Inattention to these considerations, we think, led some of the students
of Sir W. Thomson to infer that the true conductivity of flint glass
was incomparably greater than       it really is.
    In fact, we believe that np to the present time no experiments have
 ever been made which determine the amount of the true conductivity
 of flint glass, that is, the conductivity         along time after charging.
 Since very hot solid glass    is like pitch, a " truly viscous fluid," that   is

244                   On the Viscosity  of Dielectrics.            [Mar.  21,
goes on continually yielding under the action of a constant stress,         we
must assume, since we cannot imagine a breach of continuity in             the
phenomenon,     that glass even when cold is also a   " truly viscous fluid,''
although the gain of strain per day may be almost infinitely small
after the first few days. Similarly, as the true conductivity is very
considerable in hot glass, we may conclude that there does exist true
conductivity in cold glass, although the amount will probably be so
small as to make its separation from surface conduction or other
extraneous loss extremely difficult.
   Prom the curves we have obtained of the charging of condensers,
and assuming that there is no discontinuity, we must assume that even
the first charging is itself a very rapid absorption, and since there is
viscosity, even the very first charging must be accompanied with a
generation of heat, that is, true conduction.       Also since it is known
that gases, like all other substances, are to a certain extent viscous, we
cannot believe that air and other gaseous condensers show absolutely
no absorptive phenomena, in fact, sufficiently accurate experiments
have not yet been made on the subject.
    W e conclude, therefore, that the less the specific resistance of a sub
stance the greater is its molecular plasticity, aud the more plastic the
substance is the greater will be the first charge ; therefore from the
stress and strain analogy it follows that the less the specific resistance
of a substance the greater will generally be the specific inductive
capacity, the result obtained experimentally at the commencement of
this paper   : according to what law, however, the one increases as the
other diminishes,    we are not at present in a position to state.
    From all that precedes it follows that when the potential of a body
surrounded by a dielectric is altered by induction, a portion of the
electric energy is converted into heat, the amount being greater as the
dielectric is more viscous.     Consequently a charged body A, perfectly
surrounded by a dielectric, may be discharged without contact with
any conductor, by alternately bringing near and withdrawing a distant
conductor B ; for the capacity of the arrangement is alternately getting
greater and less, therefore the potentials must be alternately growing
less and greater, and since all alteration of potential is accompanied
by an alteration of strain in the viscous substance composing the
 dielectric, the potential energy of the system must be gradually con-
 verted into heat, whereas from the almost infinite resistance of the
 dielectric, if the bodies were motionless, this result could never haTe
 been attained.     Consequently since the particles of any body are in
 rapid motion, they must all tend to acquire the same potential, even if
 we imagine them separated by a dielectric of very great resistance,
 provided the relative motions are motions of translation. But if the
 movements are motions of rotation only, then this equalization of
 potential will only take place after a very great time, if it takes place

much better than glass, &c.

       F.R.S., Professor of Natural Philosophy in the Royal Insti
       tution. Received March 14, 1878.
   Our most intense coast-lights, including the six-wick lamp, the
"VVigham gas-light, and the electric light, being intended to aid the
 mariner in heavy weather, may be regarded, in a certain sense, as
fog-signals. But fog, when thick, is intractable to light; the sun
 cannot penetrate    it,
                       much less any terrestrial source of illumination.
Hence the necessity of employing sound-signals in dense fogs. Bells,
gongs, horns, guns, and syrens have been used for this purpose     ;  but
it is mainly,  if  not wholly, explosive signals that    I  have now to
submit to the notice of the Society.         During  the long, laborious,
and,
   I    venture to think, memorable series of observations conducted
under the auspices of the Elder Brethren of the Trinity House at the
South Foreland in 1872 and 1873,         was proved that
                                        it               a  short 5^-inch
howitzer, firing 3  lbs. of powder, yielded a louder report than a long
18-pounder firing the same charge.         Here was a hint to be acted
on by the Elder Brethren.     The effectiveness of the sound depended
on the shape of the gun, and as    it  could not be assumed that in the
howitzer we had hit accidentally upon the best possible shape, arrange
ments were made with the War Office for the construction of a gun
specially calculated to produce the loudest sound attainable from the
combustion of lbs. of powder.
                3                  To prevent the unnecessary landward
waste of the sound, the gun was furnished with a parabolic muzzle,
intended to project the sound over the sea, where   it was most needed.
The construction of this gun was based on a searching series of ex
periments executed at Woolwich with small models, provided with
muzzles of various kinds. The gun was constructed on the principle
of the revolver, its various chambers being loaded and brought in
rapid succession into the firing position.   The performance of the gun
proved the correctness of the principles on which its construction was
based.
  It had   been a widely spread opinion among artillerists, that a bronze
gun emits a specially loud report. I doubted from the outset whether
this would help us, and in a letter dated 22nd April, 1874, ventured
to express myself thus — " The report of a gun, as affecting an observer
                           :
close at hand, ismade up of two factors — the sound due to the shock
of the air by the violently expanding gas, and the sound derived from
the vibrations of the gun, which, to some extent, rings like a bell.
This latter,I  apprehend, will disappear at considerable distances."

" that the sonorous qualities of bronze are
                                                        greatly superior to those of
cast-iron at short distances, but that the advantage lies with the baser
metal at long ranges."*
   Coincident with these early trials of guns at Woolwich gun-
cotton was thought of as a probably effective sound-producer.
Theoretic considerations caused me to fix my attention persistently
on this substance ; for the remarkable experiments                     of Mr. Abel,
whereby its rapidity of combustion and violently explosive energy are
demonstrated,      seemed to single it out as a substance eminently cal
culated to fulfil the conditions necessary to the production of an intense
wave of sound.         What those conditions are we shall now more                   par-
ticularly inquire, calling to our aid a brief but very remarkable paper,
published by Professor Stokes in the
                                                   " Philosophical Magazine " for
1868.
    The explosive force of gunpowder is known to depend on the sudden
conversion of a solid body into an intensely heated gas.                      The work
which the artillerist requires the expanding gas to perform is the
displacement of the projectile. Such, however, is not the work that
we want our gunpowder to perform. We wish it to transmute its
energy not into the mere mechanical translation of the shot, but into
vibratory motion.       We want pulses to be formed which shall propagate
themselves to vast distances through the atmosphere, and this requires
a certain choice and management of the explosive material.
    A sound pulse consists essentially of two parts — a condensation
and a rarefaction.        Now air is a very mobile fluid, and if the shock
imparted to it lack due promptness, the pulse is not produced. Con
sider the case of a common clock pendulum, which oscillates to and
fro, and which therefore might be expected to generate corresponding
pulses in the air.       When, for example, the bob moves to the right,
the air to the right of it might be supposed to be condensed, while
a partial vacuum might be supposed to follow the bob.                      As a matter
of fact, we have nothing of this kind. The air particles in front of
the bob retreat so rapidly, and those behind it close so rapidly in, that
no sound-pulse is formed.             A tuning-fork which executes 256 com
plete   vibrations   in a second,    if struck gently on a pad and held in free
air, emits a scarcely audible note. It behaves to some extent like the
pendulum bob. This feebleness is due to the prompt
                                                                       " reciprocating
       "
flow      of the air between the incipient condensations and rarefactions,
whereby the formation of sound-pulses is forestalled.                     Stokes, how
ever, has taught us that this flow may be intercepted by placing the
    * General Campbell   assigns a true cause for this difference. The ring of the bronR
 gun represents so much energy withdrawn from the explosive force of the gun
 powder. Further experiments would, however, be needed to place the superiority
 of the cast-iron gun at a distance beyond question.

An immediate       augmentation   of   the sound   of the fork is the con
sequence.
   The more rapid the shock imparted to the air, the greater is the
fractional part of the energy of the shock converted into -wave motion.
And     as different kinds of gunpowder vary considerably in their
rapidity of combustion, it may be expected that they will also vary as
producers of sound.       This theoretic inferenoe is completely verified
by experiment.      In a series of preliminary trials conducted at Wool
wich on the 4th of June, 1875, the sound-producing powers of four
different kinds of powder were determined.           In the order of size of
grain they   bear  the  names   respectively of  Fine-grain (F.G.), Large-
grain (L.G.), Rifle Large-grain (R.L.G.), and Pebble-powder (P.).
The charge in each case amounted to 4£ lbs. ; four 24-pound howitzers
being employed to fire the respective charges. There were eleven
observers, all of whom, without a single dissentient, pronounced the
sound of the fine-grain powder loudest of all. In the opinion of seven
of the eleven the large-grain powder came next; seven also of the
eleven placed the rifle large-grain third on the list ; while they were
again unanimous in pronouncing the pebble-powder the worst sound-
 producer. These differences are entirely due to differences in the
rapidity of combustion.       All who have witnessed the performance of
 the 80-ton gun at Woolwich must have been surprised at the mild
 ness of its thunder.     To avoid the strain resulting from quick com
 bustion, the powder employed is composed of lumps far larger than
 those of the pebble-powder above referred to. In the long tube of the
 gun these lumps of solid matter gradnally resolve themselves into gas,
 which on issuing from the muzzle imparts a kind of push to the air,
 instead of the sharp shock necessary to form the condensation of an
 intensely sonorous wave.
     These are some of the physical reasons why gun-cotton might bo
 regarded as a promising fog-signal. Firing it as we have been taught
 to do by Mr. Abel, its explosion is more rapid than that of gunpowder.
 In its case the air particles, alert as they are, will not, it might be
 presumed, be able to slip from places of condensation to places of rare
  faction with a rapidity sufficient to forestall the formation of the wave.
  On a priori grounds then, we are entitled to infer the effectiveness of
  gun-cotton, while in a great number of comparative experiments,
  stretching from 1874 to the present time, this inference has been veri
  fied in the most conclusive manner.
      As regards explosive material, and zealous and accomplished

most cases have incurred the labour of reducing and reporting on
the observations.      Guns of various forms and sizes have been invoked
for gunpowder, while gun-cotton has been fired in free air, and in the
foci of parabolic reflectors.
    On the 22nd of February, 1875, a number of small guns, cast
specially for the purpose — some with plain, some with conical, and
some with parabolic muzzles, firing 4 oz. of fine-grain powder, were
pitted against 4 oz. of gun-cotton, detonated both in the open and in
the focus of a parabolic reflector.*        The sound produced by the gun-
cotton, reinforced by the reflector, was unanimously pronounced
loudest of all.    With equal unanimity, the gun-cotton detonated in
free air was placed second in intensity.             Though the same charge
was used throughout, the guns differed notably among themselves,
but none of them came up to the gnn-cotton, either with or without
the reflector.   A second series, observed from a different distance on
the same day, confirmed to the letter the foregoing result.
   As a practical point, however, the comparative cost of gun cotton
and gunpowder has to be taken into account, though considerations
of cost ought not to be stretched too far in cases involving the
safety of human life.          In the earlier experiments, where quantities
of equal price were pitted against each other, the results were
somewhat fluctuating.         Indeed, the perfect manipulation of the gun-
cotton required some preliminary discipline — promptness, certainty,
and effectiveness of firing, augmenting as experience increased.
As lib. of gun-cotton costs as much as 3 lbs. of gunpowder, these
quantities were compared together on the 22nd of February.                    The
guns employed to discharge the gunpowder were a 12-lb. brass
howitzer, a 24-lb. cast-iron howitzer, and the long 18-pounder used
at the South Foreland.            The result recorded is, that the 24-lb.
howitzer, firing 3 lbs. of gunpowder, had a slight advantage over 1 lb.
of gun-cotton detonated in the open ; while the 12-lb. howitzer and
the 18-pounder were both beaten by the gun-cotton.                On the 2nd of
May, on the other hand, the gun-cotton is reported as having been
beaten by all the guns.
   Meanwhile, the parabolic muzzle-gun, expressly intended for fog-
signalling, was pushed rapidly forward, and on the 22nd and 23rd of
March, 1876, its power was tested at Shoeburyness.              Pitted against it
were a 16-pounder,      a 5^-inch howitzer, 1£ lb. of gun-cotton detonated
in the focus of a reflector, and 1£ lb. of gun-cotton detonated in free air.
On this occasion, nineteen different series of experiments were made,
when the new experimental gun, firing a 3-lb. charge, demonstrated
its superiority over all guns previously employed to fire the same
charge.    .As regards the comparative merits of the gun-cotton fired in
   * For charges of this weight the reflector is of moderate size, and may be em
ployed without fear of fracture.

the open, and the gunpowder fired from the new gnn, the mean values
of their sounds were found to be the same. Fired in the focus of the
reflector, the gun-cotton clearly dominated             over all the other sound-
producers.*
    The whole of the observations here referred to were embraced by
an angle of about 70°, of which 50° lay on the one side and 20° on the
other side of the line of fire. The shots were heard by eleven observers
                   " Galatea," which took up positions
on board the                                                  varying from 2 miles
to 13\ miles from the firing-point.            In all these observations, the rein
forcing action of the reflector, and of the parabolic muzzle of the gun,
came into play.         But the reinforcement of the sound in one direction
implies    its withdrawal     from some other direction, and accordingly it was
found that at a distance of             miles from the firing-point, and on a line
including nearly       an  angle   of  90°   with the line of fire, the gun-cotton
in the open beat the new gun ; while behind the station, at distances
 of 8| miles and 13£ miles respectively, the gun-cotton in the open
beat both the gun and the gun-cotton in the reflector.                 This result is
 rendered more important by the fact that the sound reached the
 Mucking Light, a distance of 13£ miles, against a light wind which
 was blowing at the time.
    Most, if not all, of our ordinary sound-producers send forth waves
 which are not of uniform intensity throughout. A trumpet is loudest
 in the direction of its axis. The same is true of a gun. A bell, with
 its mouth pointed upwards or downwards, sends forth waves far
 denser in the horizontal plane passing through the bell than at an
 angular distance of 90° from that plane.                 The oldest bellhangers
 must have been aware of the fact that the sides of the bell, and not
 its mouth, emitted the strongest sound, their practice being deter
 mined by this knowledge.             Our slabs of gun-cotton also emit waves
 of different densities in different parts. It has occurred in the experi
 ments at Shoeburyness that when the broad side of a slab was turned
 towards the suspending wire of a second slab six feet distant, the wire
 was cut by the explosion, while when the edge of the slab was turned
 to the wire this never occurred.            To the circumstance that the broad
 sides of the slabs faced       the  sea  is probably to be ascribed the remark
 able fact observed on the 23rd March, that in two directions, not far
 removed from the line of fire, the gun-cotton detonated in the open
 had a slight advantage over the new gun.
     Theoretic considerations rendered it probable that the shape and
 size of the exploding mass would affect the constitution of the wave
 of sound.       I did not think large rectangular slabs the most favourable
 shape, and accordingly proposed cutting a large slab into fragments
  of different sizes, and pitting them against each other. The differences
    • In  this case the reflector was fractured by the explosion, but it did good service
 after fracture.

 between the sounds were by no means so great as the differences in
 the quantities of explosive material might lead one to expect. The
 mean values of eighteen series of observations made on board the
  "Galatea," at distances varying from             If  mile to 4'8 miles,    were    as
 follows : —

    These charges were cut from a slab of dry gun-cotton about               If   inch
 thick : they were squares and rectangles of the following dimensions :
 —4 oz., 2 inches by 2 inches ; 6 oz., 2 inches by 3 inches ; 9 oz.,
 3 inches by 3 inches     ;  12 oz., 2 inches by 6 inches.
    The numbers under the respective weights express the recorded
 value of the sounds.        They must be simply taken as a ready means of
 expressing   the   approximate       relative intensity of the sounds as esti
 mated by the ear. When we find a 9-oz. charge marked 4, and a
 12-oz. charge marked 4-03, the two sounds may be regarded as prac
 tically equal in intensity, an addition of 30 per cent, in the larger
 charges producing no sensible difference in the sound.                   Were the
 sounds estimated by some physical means, instead of by the ear, the
 values of the sounds would not, in my opinion, show a greater
 advance with the increase of material than that indicated by the fore
 going numbers.        Subsequent experiments rendered still more certain
 the effectiveness, as well as the economy, of small charges of gun-
 cotton.
    It is an obvious corollary from the foregoing experiments that on
our " nesses
                " and
                         promontories, where the land is clasped on both
sides for a considerable         distance    by the   sea — where,   therefore,    the
sound has to propagate         itself rearward    as  well as forward —the    use of
the parabolic    gun, or of the parabolic reflector might be a disadvan
tage rather than an advantage.               Here gun-cotton, exploded in the
open, forms a most appropriate source of sound.                    This remark is
especially applicable     to  such lightships as are intended to spread the
Bound all round them as from central foci. As a signal in rock light
houses, where neither syren, steam-whistle, nor gun could be mounted,
and as a handy fleet-signal, dispensing with the lumber of special
signal-guns, the gun-cotton will prove invaluable. But in most of
these cases we have the drawback that local damage may be done by
the explosion.      The lantern of the rock-lighthouse might suffer from
concussion    near at hand, and though mechanical arrangements might
be  devised,  both   in the case of the lighthouse and of the ship's deck,
to place the firing-point of the gun-cotton at a safe distance, no such
arrangement could compete, as regards simplicity and effectiveness,
with the expedient of a gun-cotton rocket.                Had such a means of
signalling existed at the Bishop's Rock Lighthouse the ill-fated Schiller
might have been warned of her approach to danger ten, or it may be

   twenty, miles before she reached the rock which wrecked her.           Had
   the fleet possessed such a signal, instead of the ubiquitous but in
   effectual whistle, the
                              " Iron Duke " and "               "

      It was the necessity of providing a suitable signal for rock light
   houses, and of clearing obstacles which cast an acoustic shadow, that
   suggested the idea of the gun-cotton rocket to Sir Richard Collinson,
   Deputy Master of the Trinity House. That idea was to place a disk or
   short cylinder of the gun-cotton, in the head of a rocket, the ascensional
  force of which should be employed to carry the disk to an elevation of
   1,000 feet or thereabouts, where by the ignition of a fuse associated
  with a detonator, the gun-cotton should be fired, sending its sound in
  all directions vertically and obliquely down upon earth and sea. The
  first attempt to realize this idea was made on the 18th of July, 1876,
  at the fire-work manufactory of the Messrs. Brock, at Nunhead.
   Eight rockets were then fired, four being charged with 5 oz. and four
  with 7^ oz. of gun-cotton.          They ascended to a great height, and
  exploded   with   a very  loud  report in the air. On the 27th of July, the
  rockets were tried at Shoeburyness, the most noteworthy result on
  this occasion being the hearing of the rockets at the Mouse Lighthouse,
 8^ miles E. by S., and at the Chapman Lighthouse, 8£ miles W. by
  N. ; that is to say, at opposite sides of the firing-point. It is worthy
  of remark that, in the case of the Chapman Lighthouse, land and trees
  intervened between the firing-point and the place of observation.
  " This," as General Younghusband justly remarked at the time, "may
 prove to be a valuable consideration if it should be found necessary to
  place a signal station in a position whence the sea could not be freely
 observed."       Indeed, the clearing of such obstacles was one of the
 ¦objects which the inventor of the rocket had in view.
      On the 13th of December, 1876, and again on the 8th of March,
 1877, comparative experiments on firing at high and low elevations
 were executed. The gun-cotton near the ground consisted of -£-lb.
 disks snspended from a horizontal iron bar about              feet above the
 ground.      The   rockets  carried the  same quantity of gun-cotton in their
 heads, and the height to which they attained, as determined by a
 theodolite, was from 800 to 900 feet.
     The latter day was cold, with occasional squalls of snow and hail, the
direction of the sound being at right angles to that of the wind. Five
series of observations were made on board the " Vestal," at distances
varying from 3 to 6 miles. The mean value of the explosions in the
-air exceeded that of the explosions near the ground by a small but
.sensible quantity. At Windmill Hill, Gravesend, however, which was
nearly to leeward, and 5£ miles from the firing-point, in nineteen cases
out of twenty-four the disk fired near the ground was loudest ; while
in the remaining five the rocket had the advantage. Towards the

close of the day the atmosphere became very serene. A few distant
cumuli sailed near the horizon, but the zeniih and a vast angular
space all round it were absolutely free from cloud.      From the deck of
the
      " Galatea " a rocket was discharged, which reached      a great eleva
tion, and exploded with a loud report.         Following this solid nucleus
of sound was a continuous train of echoes, which retreated to a con
tinually greater distance, dying gradually off into silence after seven
seconds' duration. These echoes were of the same character as those
so frequently noticed at the South Foreland in 1872-73, and called by
me    " aerial echoes."
    On the 23rd of March the experiments were resumed, the most
noteworthy results of that day's observations being that the sounds
were heard at Tillingham, 10 miles to the N.E. ; at West Mersea, lof
miles to the N.E. by E. ; at Brightlingsea, 17-£ miles to the N.E. ; and
at Clacton Wash, 20| miles to the N.E. by £ E. The wind was blow
ing at the time from the S.E.       Some of these sounds were produced
by rockets, some by a 24-lb. howitzer, and some by an 8-inch Maroon.
    In December, 1876, Mr. Gardiner, the managing director of the
Cotton-powder Company, had proposed a trial of this material against
the gun-cotton.       The density of the cotton he urged was only T03.
while that of the powder was 1*70. A greater quantity of explosive
material being thus compressed into the same volume, Mr. Gardiner
thought that a greater sonorous effect must be produced by the
powder.      At the instance of Mr. Mackie, who had been in communica
tion previously with the Deputy Master of the Trinity House anil
myself, a Committee of the Elder Brethren visited the cotton-powder
manufactory, on the banks of the Swale, near Faversham, on the 16th
of June, 1877. The weights of cotton-powder employed were 2 oz..
8 oz., 1 lb., and 2 lbs., in the form of rockets and of signals fired a few
feet above the ground.        The experiments throughout were arranged
and conducted by Mr. Mackie.           Our desire on this occasion was to
get as near to        windward   as  possible, but the Swale and other
obstacles limited our distance to 1| mile.      We stood here E.S.E. from
the firing-point while the wind blew fresh from the N.E.
    The cotton-powder yielded a very effective report.        The rockets in
 general  had  a  slight advantage  over  the  same  quantities of material
 fired near the ground.       The loudness of the sound was by no means
 proportional to the quantity of the material exploded, 8 oz. yielding
 very nearly as loud a report as 1 lb.     The " aerial echoes," which in
 variably followed the explosion of the rockets, were loud and long-
 continued, shading off, as in all previous cases, by imperceptible grada
 tions into silence.
     On the 17th of October, 1877, another series of experiments with
 howitzers and rockets was carried out at Shoeburyness.          The charge
 of the howitzer was 3 lbs. of L.G. powder.            The charges of the

1878.]          Prof. Tyndall.        Experiments on Fog-Signals.                  253
rockets were 12 oz., 8 oz., 4 oz., and 2 oz., of gun-cotton respectively.
The gun and the four rockets constituted a series, and eight series were
fired during the afternoon of the 1 7th. The observations were made
from the " Vestal and the " Galatea," positions being assumed which
                         "
permitted the sound to reach the observers with the wind, against the
wind, and across the wind. The distance of the " Galatea " varied from
3 to 7 miles, that of the "Vestal," which was more restricted in her
movements, being 2 to 3 miles.             Briefly summed up, the result is that
the howitzer, firing a 3-lb. charge, which it will be remembered was
onr best gun at the South Foreland, was beaten by the 12-oz. rocket,
by the 8-oz. rocket, and by the 4-oz. rocket. The 2-oz. rocket alone
fell behind the howitzer.
     It  is worth while recording the distances to which some                   of the
sounds were heard on the day now referred to : —

     The day was cloudy, with occasional showers of drizzling rain ; the
wind about N.W. by N. all day ; at times squally, rising to a force of
 6 and 7 and sometimes dropping to a force of 2 or 3. The station at
 Leigh excepted, all these places were to leeward of Shoeburyness.                   At
four other stations to leeward, varying in distance from 15| to 24|
 miles, nothing was heard, while at eleven stations to windward, vary,
 ing from 8 to 26 miles, the sounds were also inaudible. It was found,
 indeed, that the sounds proceeding against the wind did not penetrate
 much beyond 3 miles.
      On the following day, viz., the 18th October, we proceeded to Dunge-
 ness with the view of making a series of strict comparative experi
 ments with gun-cotton and cotton-powder.                  Rockets containing 8 oz.,
  4 oz., and 2 oz. of gun-cotton had been prepared at the Royal Arsenal ;
  while others, containing a similar quantity of cotton-powder, had been
 snpplied by the Cotton-powder Company at Faversham.                       With these
  were compared         the   ordinary 18-pounder gun,         which   happened to be
  mounted at Dungeness, firing the nsual charge of 3 lbs. of powder.
      From these experiments it appeared that the gun-cotton and cotton-
  powder were practically equal as producers of sound.
      The effectiveness of small charges was also illustrated in a very
 striking manner, only a single nnit separating the numerical value of
 the 8-oz. rocket from that of the 2-oz. rocket. The former was re
  corded as 6-9 and the latter as 5'9, the valne of the 4-oz. charge being
  intermediate between them.           These results were recorded by a number
                                                                             s 2

  of very practised observers on board the " Galatea." They were com
  pletely borne ont by the observations of the Coastgnard, who marked
  the value of the 8-oz. rocket 6'1, and that of the 2-oz. rocket 5-2.
  The 18-ponnder gun fell far behind all the rockets, a result pro
  bably to be in part ascribed to the imperfection of the powder.
  The performance of the syren was, on the whole, less satisfactory
  than that of the rockets.           The instrument was worked, not by steam of
  70 lbs. pressure, as at the South Foreland, but by compressed air,
 beginning with 40 lbs. and ending with 30 lbs. pressure. The trumpet
 was pointed to windward, and in the axis of the instrument the sound
 was about as effective as that of the 8-oz. rocket.                   But in a direction
 at right angles to the axis, and still more in the rear of this direction,
 the syren fell very sensibly behind even the 2-oz. rocket.
     These are the principal comparative trials made between the gun-
 cotton rocket and other fog-signals ; but they are not the only ones.
 On the 2nd of August, 1877, for example, experiments were made at
 Lundy Island with the following results.                 At 2 miles distant from the
 firing point,     with  land  intervening,    the  18-pounder, firing a 3-lb. charge,
 was quite unheard.           Both the 4-oz. rocket and the 8-oz. rocket, how
ever,   reached      an elevation    which commanded the acoustic shadow, and
yielded loud reports.           When both were in view, the rockets were still
superior     to   the  gun.   On   the 6th of August, at St. Ann's, the 4-oz. and
8-oz. rockets proved superior to the syren.                  On the Shambles Light-
vessel,   when      a pressure   of 13  lbs.  was  employed to sound the syren, the
rockets proved greatly superior to that instrument.                    Proceeding along
the sea margin at Flamboro' Head, Mr. Edwards states that at a dis
tance of 1^ mile, with the 18-pounder gun hidden behind the cliffs, its
report was quite unheard, while the 4-oz. rocket, rising to an eleva
tion which brought it clearly into view, yielded a powerful sound in
the face of an opposing wind.
    On the evening of February 9th, 1877, a remarkable series of
experiments         was made by Mr. Prentice, at Stowmarket, with the
gun-cotton rocket.           From the report with which he has kindly fur

    In the great majority of these cases, the direction of the sound

indeed, the two directions were at right angles to each other.                      It is
needless to dwell for a moment on the advantage of a signal command
 ing ranges such as these.
    The explosion of substances in the air, after having been carried to
a considerable elevation by rockets, is a familiar performance.                       In
 1873 the Board of Trade actually proposed a light- and- sound
rocket as a signal of distress, which proposal was subsequently
realised, but in a form too elaborate and expensive for practical use.
The idea of the gun-cotton rocket with a view to signalling in fogs is,
 I believe, wholly due to the Deputy Master of the Trinity House.
Thanks to the skilful aid given by the authorities of Woolwich, by
Mr. Prentice, and Mr. Brock, that idea is now an accomplished fact ;
a signal of great power, handiness, and economy, being thus placed at
the service of our mariners.         Not only may the rocket be applied in
association with lighthouses         and   lightships, but in the Navy also it
may be turned to important account. Soon after the loss of the
"Vanguard"        I ventured    to urge upon an eminent naval officer the
desirability of having an organised code of fog-signals for the fleet.
He shook his head doubtingly, and referred to the difficulty of finding
room for signal-guns. The gun-cotton rocket completely surmounts
this difficulty. It is manipulated with ease and rapidity, while its
discharges may      be so grouped       and combined         as to give a most       im
portant    extension    to the voice of the admiral            in command.         It  is
needless to add that at any point upon our coasts, or upon any other
coast, where its establishment might be desirable, a fog-signal station
might    be extemporised    without difficulty.
    I have  referred moro than once to the train of echoes which accom
panied the explosion of gun-cotton in free air, speaking of them as
similar in all respects to those which were described for the first time
 in my Report on fog-signals, addressed to the Corporation of Trinity

256         Prof. Tyndall.          Experiments      on  Fog-Signals.        [Mar. 21.
House in 1874.*         To these echoes I attached a fundamental signifi
cance. There was no visible reflecting surface from which they could
come. On some days, with hardly a cloud in the air, and hardly a
ripple on the sea, they reached us with magical intensity.                 They came
directly  from   the  body   of   the air in  front of    the  great trumpet which
produced them.         The trumpet-blasts were five seconds in duration,
but long before the blast had ceased the echoes struck in, adding their
strength to the primitive note of the trumpet. After the blast had
ended the echoes continued, retreating further and further from the
point of observation, and finally dying away at great distances.                   The
echoes   were  perfectly continuous as long as          the  sea was   clear  of ships,
" tapering " by imperceptible gradations into absolute silence. But
when a ship happened to throw itself athwart the course of the sound,
the echo from the broadside of the vessel was returned as a shock
which rudely interrupted the continuity of the dying atmospheric
music.
    These echoes have been ascribed to reflection from the crests of the
sea- waves.   But this hypothesis is negatived by the fact that the echoes
 were produced in great intensity and duration when no waves existed
— when the sea, in fact, was of glassy smoothness. It has been also
shown that the direction of the echoes depended not on that of waves,
 real or assumed, but on the direction of the axis of the trumpet.
 Causing that axis to traverse an arc of 210°, and the trumpet to sound
 at various points of the arc, the echoes were always, at all events in
 calm weather, returned         from that portion of the atmosphere towards
 which the trumpet was directed.             They could not, ander the circum
 stances, como from the glassy sea ; while both their variation of
 direction, and their perfectly continuous fall into silence, are irrecon-
 cileable with the notion that they came from fixed objects on the land.
 They came from that portion of the atmosphere into which the trumpet
 poured its maximum sound, and fell in intensity as the direct sound
 penetrated to greater atmospheric distances.
     The day on which our latest observations were made was particu
 larly fine. Before reaching Dungeness, the smoothness of the sea
 and the serenity of the air caused me to test the echoing power of the
 atmosphere.      A single ship lay about half a mile distant between us
 and   the land.      The result of the proposed experiment was clearly
 foreseen.    It was this. The rocket being sent up, it exploded at a
 great height ; the echoes retreated in their usual fashion, becoming
 less and less intense as the distance of the surfaces of reflection from
 the observers increased.           About five seconds after the explosion, a
 single loud shock was sent back to us from the side of the vessel
 lying between us and the land. Obliterated for a moment by this

more intense echo, the aerial reverberation continued its retreat, dying
away into silence in two or three seconds afterwards.
    Ihave referred to the firing of an 8-oz. rocket from the deck of
the " Galatea," on the 8th cf March, 1877, stating the duration of its
echoes to be seven seconds. Mr. Prentice, who was present at the
time, assured me that, in his experiments with rockets, similar echoes
had been frequently heard of more than twice this duration. The
ranges of his sounds alone would render this result in the highesi
degree probable.
    To attempt to interpret an experiment     which I have not had au
opportunity of repeating, is an operation of some risk ; and it is not
                                              I
without a consciousness of this that refer here to a result considered
adverse to the notion of aerial echoes.   When the trumpet of a syren
is pointed towards the zenith, it is alleged that when the syren is
sounded no echo is returned.     Now the reflecting surfaces which give
rise to these echoes are for the most part due to differences of tempera
ture between sea and air. If, through any cause, the air above be
chilled, we have descending streams — if the air below be warmed, we
have ascending streams as the initial cause of atmospheric flocculence.
A sound proceeding vertically does not cross the streams, nor impinge
upon the reflecting surfaces, as does a sound proceeding horizontally
across them. Aerial echoes, therefore, will not accompany the vertical
sound as they accompany the horizontal one. The experiment, as
 I interpret it,   not opposed to the theory of aerial echoes which
                   is                                                     I
have ventured to enunciate.     But, as have indicated, not only to see,
                                              I
but to vary such an experiment,      a necessary prelude to grasping its
                                         is
full significance.
  In a paper published     in the " Philosophical Transactions " for 1876,
Professor Osborne Reynolds refers to these echoes in the following
terms " Without attempting to explain the reverberations and echoes
        :
which have been observed, will merely call attention to the fact that
                                I
in no case have    I  heard any attending the reports of the rockets,*
although they    seem  to have been invariable with the guns and pistols.
These facts suggest that the echoes are in some way connected with
the direction given to the sound.         They are caused by the voice,
trumpets, and the syren, all of which give direction to the sound but ;
I  am not aware that they have ever been observed in the case of a
sound which has no direction of greatest intensity."
    The reference to the voice and other references cause me to think
that, in speaking of echoes, Professor Osborne Reynolds and myself
are dealing with different phenomena.       Be that as      may, the fore
                                                                 it

    There is not a feature connected with the aerial echoes which
cannot be brought out by experiments in the laboratory.                    I have
recently   made   the  following experiment:         —  A   rectangle, 22   inches
by 12, is crossed by 23 brass tubes, each having a slit along it
from which gas can issue. In this way, 23 low, flat flames are ob
tained.    A sounding reed, fixed in a short tube, is placed at one end
of the rectangle, and a sensitive flame at some distance beyond the
other end. When the reed sounds, the flame in front of it is violently
agitated, and roars boisterously.      Turning on the gas, and lighting it
as it issues from the slits, the air above the flames becomes so hetero
geneous that the sensitive flame is instantly stilled by the aerial re
flection, rising from a height of 6 inches to a height of 18 inches.
Here we have the acoustic opacity of the air in front of the South
Foreland strikingly imitated. Turning off the gas, and removing the
sensitive flame to some distance behind the reed, it burns there tran
quilly, though the reed may be sounding.              Again lighting the gas as
it issues from the brass tubes, the sound reflected from the hetero
geneous air throws the sensitive flame into violent agitation.           Here we
have imitated the aerial echoes heard when standing behind the syren-
trumpets at the South Foreland. The experiment is extremely simple,
and in the highest degree impressive.

    Referring to the paper which I communicated to the Royal Society
 last session*, I  have to add, that after passing water continuously for
  Bix weeks through one of the vessels there described, filled with spongy

  iron, and on the bottom    of which meat had been placed, the latter was
 still in a perfectly fresh and hard condition.
     This result encouraged me to try in a similar way the action of
 spongy iron upon hay infusion. The hay, steeped in water, was heated
 for two days to about 35° C. The infusion then showed, under the
 microscope, an abundance of organic life.       I  could not obviously test
 the   action of  spongy  iron upon  this infusion, in the manner described
 in my last paper, namely, by passing it continuously for weeks
through a vessel containing spongy iron and meat.           However, I be
lieve the result will be considered equally conclusive as to the absence
of any putrefactive agents in hay infusion after filtration through spongy
iron, should the meat remain fresh on being immersed in the filtered
liquid for several weeks.
     The following arrangement was adopted : —
    A large vessel was filled with the ordinary filtering materials em
ployed in spongy iron filters, namely, commencing at the bottom, with
gravel, sand, pyrolusite, and spongy iron.         The three first materials
were introduced to prevent the filtered solution containing any iron.
The vessel was provided with a neck at the bottom, and a volume of
the hay infusion, equal to the bulk of spongy iron in the filter, was
passed through it every 45 minutes.
                                   I
    Into the neck of the vessel fixed some tin tubing by means of an
india-rubber stopper.        The tubing was connected with six tins, or
cylindrical vessels of tin-plate, holding about 500 cub. centims. each.
After placing a piece of fresh meat in each tin, a lid was soldered on
air-tight.    The tubing was so arranged, that the inlet tube passed to
the   bottom,  of each tin, an exit tube carrying the water off from the
top.    By first pressing the tubing together, and then cutting it, all the
tins could be readily separated without exposure to air. Each tin was
provided on the top with a short piece of tubing, to serve later on for
the escape    of steam.
     In order to wash the apparatus     and materials, I passed, in the first
instance, water of the New River Company continuously through them
for 24 hours. The tins and contents were then immersed for two hours
in boiling water to destroy any putrefactive germs adhering to the
meat. After closing the tubing, which served during boiling for the
escape of steam, the tins were cooled, and then the filtration of New
River water continued for two more hours,
      The last two tins, which, it will be understood, contained filtered
water and meat, were now detached, and into one of them I passed
 100 cub. centims. of filtered air, after connecting under alcohol with a
glass tube, G feet long, containing compressed cotton wool, through
 which the air was forced.      These two tins were kept for comparison
with those in which the meat was to remain in contact with filtered
hay infusion.       The infusion was passed for six hours through the

260      On Putrescent Organic Matter in Potable Water.           [Mar. 28,
apparatus, including the remaining four tins. These being then also
detached, 100 cub. centims. each of filtered air were passed as before
into two of the tins.
    On opening the tins, which contained filtered water, the one with,
the other without filtered air, the meat was, after four to five weeks'
standing, found to be quite fresh.         Nevertheless, when, after some
time, a drop adhering to the meat was examined under the microscope,
moving organisms were detected.
    The tins which contained meat and the filtered hay infusion gave
similar results.   One pair of the tins, the one with, the other without
filtered air, was opened after nine weeks, and the other after nine
months' standing.      In  both cases the meat remained fresh.
    The hay infusion after filtration had a peculiar smell, reminding me
of some kinds, of cheese. This obviously imparted to the meat a similar
smell, which, however, was quite distinct from that of putrid meat.
After the samples of meat had been standing for 24 hours, the smell
decreased considerably, and the following day it was hardly perceptible.
Between the third and sixth day the several samples exhibited gra
dually the characteristic smell of putrid meat ; those samples which
did not contain filtered air resisting putrescence, apparently, longer
than the others.      The filtered hay infusion, which had not been in
 contact with meat, had, after several months' standing still, the same
peculiar smell.
    The conclusions which I drew in my last paper as to the antiseptic
properties of spongy iron upon putrefactive agents in ordinary water
apply therefore equally to hay infusion. However, those samples to
which filtered air had been supplied, prove more conclusively than my
experiments last year that the bacteria, or their germs, are not revived
when supplied with oxygen after the filtration.         This, in my opinion,
is a result of some importance,      as it  demonstrates that, by filtration
through spongy iron, putrefaction of organic matter is not only sus
pended for a time, but that it ceases entirely until reinstated by some
putrefactive agent foreign to the water.
    Since communicating my last paper,         I  have also continued the
inquiry, how the peculiar action of spongy iron upon organic matter
is to be explained.     If a rod be inserted into a body of spongy iron,
 which has been in contact with water for some time, gas bubbles are
seen to escape.     This gas is sometimes explosive, sometimes not. I
collected a quantity of the gas from two different filters, one of which
 had been in constant operation with ordinary water for ten months. It
 was free from any carbonic anhydride, but contained carbon and hydro
gen. The hydrogen obviously results from the decomposition of water by
spongy iron. The carbon might be due to the decomposition of car
 bonaceous organic matter, or it might be produced similarly to the
 carbo-hydrogen obtained, when dissolving ordinary iron by an acid.

  1878.]           Mr. B. T. Lowne on Eyes of Insects.                     261
  To decide   which of these explanations is correct, a vessel was filled
  with spongy   iron and distilled water, the air being expelled from the
  former as far as practicable.    After three months' standing,    I analyzed
 the gas,  collected as before by inserting a rod into the spongy iron.       I
 found that it neither contained hydrogen nor carbon, therefore most
 probably consisted    only of atmospheric nitrogen. This appears to in
 dicate that the carbon, which was obtained in the previous experiment,
 is actually the result of the decomposition of organic matter.
    The connexion between disease and impure water, more especially if
it be contaminated by putrescent organic matter, has been strongly
urged by various authorities, such as Drs. Buchanan, Frankland,
 Sanderson,     Simon, Tyndall, and others.             This has led me to
attach such importance to the demonstration            that "living ferments"
are absent from polluted water after filtration through spongy iron.
Analytical figures, in their turn, have proved that even Thames water
can by filtration through this material be made, chemically speaking,
purer than some of the best deep well waters.                As the latter are
mostly more or less supplied by polluted surface water, which is
purified by filtration in passing downwards,           there is no reason why
they should be preferred to artificially filtered water, provided the
physiological character of both proves to be alike. This inquiry is at
the present moment being officially instituted in several countries.
Trustworthy evidence in the form of actual experience may thus ere
long be expected to settle the final question, whether and how far the
artificial purification of impure water by spongy iron can be considered
a safeguard against the propagation        of disease.

    The simple     eyes of insects have been so accurately described by
previous observers,     that little need be said on their structure.    I  have
described    the simple eye of Eristalis, chiefly for comparison with the
 compound      and aggregate eyes.       The close relation of the recipient
 rods to the     inner surface of the cornea in this insect is most note
 worthy, since, combined with the great convexity of the cornea and
 the highly refractive nature of the rods themselves, this renders the
 formation of an optical picture impossible.        These facts with the small

number of recipient rods shew that it is most probable that the func
tion of the ocelli is rather the perception of the intensity and the
direction of light than of the actual disposition and colours of sur
rounding objects.
   The compound eyes of insects are of two kinds ; an intermediate
condition between the simple and compound eye, closely resembling the
aggregate eyes of other anthropods, which        I
                                              have at present only found
in the Nematocerous Diptera, and in the bees, wasps, and ants, the
only examples of the Hymenoptera in which I have examined the eyes ;
and the true compound eye, found in the majority of insects.
  I strongly suspect that further observations will show that the aggre
gate form of eye is also characteristic of the Hemiptera and of a large
number of the Coleoptera ;       I
                                hold this view, from a casual observa
tion of the eyes of several species of Hemiptera, as well as from the
imperfect description of the eyes of these insects in Dr. Grenacher's
recent paper.
  I  have examined     and described the eyes of Tipula, Formica, and
Vespa, which are examples of very highly modified aggregate eyes. In
these insects each facet of tho cornea has sixteen recipient rod cells
behind it. In Tipula these are so deeply pigmented, that in the adult
insect it is impossible to get a transparent section ; although      have   I
adopted the method described by Dr. Schaefer in the preparation of
fine sections of the mammalian ovum,* of imbedding the specimen in
cacao butter, and have cut sections of certainly not more than y<> o ou of
an inch in thickness.    These have been examined with a sixteenth
immersion of Nachet's.
   The nearest approach to these deeply pigmented cells is seen in the
red cones in the eye of the pigeon, described by Max Scbultze,t or
perhaps in the deeply coloured rods of the eel (Kiihne).        J
                                                              But, unlike
the latter, the pigmented parts of the eyes of insects, as far as my
observations go, are unaffected by light, and the same observation has
been made by Kiihne with regard to the colour in the so-called rods in
the eye of the lobster.§
   Behind the corneal facet, and immediately in relation with it, each
rod-cell has a minute highly refractive spherule ; this is of an intense
purple colour in the eye of Vespa and Tipula, but it is colourless in the
eye of Formica rufa. It is exceedingly like the globule found between
the inner and outer segments of the cones in many birds.
   Behind the rod-cells a very remarkable structure is found which has
hitherto escaped detection, except by Dr. Grenacher,|| who describes it
under the name retinula. As this term          is,

structures    in other insects which are perhaps very different, and as it
 tends at least to give an erroneous idea of its nature,    I   have preferred
             f
 to call it the   ocellus.
     The facellus consists of a cylindrical or fusiform bundle of seven or
 more — twelve at least in the ant — fusiform cells, each of which has a
 fine axial thread of highly refractive material.     This thread is prolonged
 from the outer extremity of the facellar cell into the rod-cell layer
 above described.       These threads pass also into the deeper structure
 beneath the facellus, which  I     have named the stemon.
     The stemon is the large rod-like organ which connects the facellus
 with the ganglionic retina.        The stemon of each central facet remains
 distinct through its whole course, but those of the peripheral facets
 unite in bundles of four or more near their inner extremities.              In
 Tipula each stemon, whether simple or compound, divides at its inner
extremity into several irregular fine branches which pass into stellate
highly pigmented cells (ganglion cells?).         The inner processes of these
cells connect them with the round cells         of the ganglionic retina.    In
the ant and in the wasp, the stemonata do not divide at their inner
extremities.                  I
                  In the latter have not been at present successful in
tracing    the   connexion      of the stemon and the nervous structures
beneath ; but, in the former, each stemon is connected with the gang
lionic retina by what appears at first sight to be a thick nerve fibre.
From observations on the eyes of Lepidoptera, where similar thick
nerve fibres exist,  I     conclude that, in both cases, these are compound
fibres consisting of a large number of primitive fibrillee.         The gang
lionic retina in the ant consists exclusively        of small round cells ;    I
have been unable to detect either stellate corpuscles or fusiform cells,
which are so constant in this organ in insects.
    In the third form of eye, the true compound eye, the facets are each
provided with a single complex rod-like structure, which          Ihave called
the rhabdion, in accordance           with the nomenclature proposed by
Dr. Grenadier.
    The nature of this structure is best seen in the eyes of the crepus-
cularian Lepidoptera. In the eyes of the Sphingidae a single rhabdion
rests on a distinct facellus, quite comparable, indeed almost identical,
with that of the semi-compound eye.           The rhabdion is separated from
the corneal facet by a cone, described under the term crystal-cone
(Imjstal-lceffety .   The facelli are continuous with thick nerve fibres,
which are undoubted compound.              These are gathered together into
nerve trunks, the fibres from thirty or forty facelli being united into a
single trunk, which branches at its inner extremity, and is connected
with numerous ganglion cells.
     The cone consists of eight cells — Four are superficial, that     is, they
are in contact with the corneal facet; these remain soft; they have
been spoken of by previous writers as
                                             " Sempers' cells," and have been

204                 Mr. B. T. Lowne on        t/ie   Modifications of   [Mar. 28,
confounded with sub-eorneal nuclei of the eye in the Diptera and some
other insects, but they are, I believe, very different structures, mor
phologically speaking.       The other four form the hard cone, or, as I
shall call    it,
               the scleral cone.   These remain distinct throughout the
life of the insect, as the cone always splits most readily into four equal
segments corresponding to the four primitive cells.
    An examination of the eye in moths has shown that the segments of
the scleral cone are prolonged as threads into the rhabdion. The threads
are apparently viscous immediately after death, as they are liable to
contract and form globular or pear-shaped drops, as the inner segments
of the rods and cones of some vertebrates do, according to the observa
tions of Max Schnltze.*
    The chamber in which the cone lies          usually lined with pigment
                                                     is
cells.   These are very remarkable in structure, reminding me of the
retinal pigment cells of vertebrates they are generally arranged round
                                          ;
the apex of the cone, and give off numerous thread-like processes which
surround the cone.
    Although the compound eye in insects exhibits very considerable
modifications in different families, the researches of Claperedet" show
that these are all developed from a condition closely resembling the
type
   I     have just described.   The primitive zone consists of eight cells          :
 four of which Claperede speaks of as the cells of " Semper," and four
 of which he terms cells of the cone. There          every reason to believe
                                                          is
 that the scleral structures are formed in the interior of the latter,
 which, in moths, become entirely converted into scleral tissue the same;

 I    think there     little doubt, from the observations of Leydig and
                      is
 Dr. Grenacher, that the eyes of most,         not of all, the pentamerous

 Coleoptera retain the primitive structure of the cone throughout life,
 and those of many Crustacea present cones which are either partially
 or entirely converted into scleral tissue.          §
 I    propose to term these two forms of eye, proto- and sclero-conic.
    Starting from the proto-conic eye        There are two extreme forms
                                              :
 of deviation   ;in the one, the cone disappears, and its place      occupied

 by a slightly coagulable fluid. This       the case in the eyes of the hete-
                                              is
 rocerous Diptera.    In these insects four portions of protoplasm remain

Lepidoptera, renders it highly probable that the four bodies are the
nuclei of the primitive cells of the cone, and that the remainder of
these cells undergoes        liquefaction.     The four bodies in question are
elipsoids,    with   their  long    axes  at right   angles to the plane of the
cornea ; they exhibit fine longitudinal striations.             I  have called the
compound       organ   formed   of  these four bodies,  the tetrasome.
      In the other type of eye, the chamber contains a fluid formed by
the liquefaction of a portion of the cells of the primitive cone ; but
a remarkable body is developed in the interior of these cells of a
very complex nature. It consists of a tetrasome, formed of four minute
highly refractive spheres, supported on a tetraphore.           I think it probable
that the tetrasome is formed from the nuclei of the four superficial
cells of the cone, whilst the tetraphore appears to be a highly modified
scleral cone formed in the interior of the deeper cells ; but the whole
question of the development of these parts is very difficult, and requires
further investigation.
    I have used the terms hydroconic and tetraphoric to designate these
two forms of eye.        The first is characteristic of the heterocerous Diptera
and    Libellulidae  ;  the  second occurs in Acridium, and in the diurnal
Lepidoptera, Vanessa, Pieris, Golias, and Goneptrix.
    The rhabdion is either prismatic or cylindrical.            In the eye of the
pupa it is seen to be formed of four cells ; but in the imago these are
so closely united that they can no longer be recognized                 as separate
structures.      It contains axial longitudinal striae, which appear to be
the internal prolongations of the highly refractive cone or tetrasome.
    In the Lepidoptera the rhabdion rests on a facellus, formed of seven
fusiform cells, or, in some cases, of as many cylindrical rods, but in the
Diptera, Dragon flies, and some saltatorial Orthoptera it is in imme
diate relation with the outer stellate ganglion cells of the ganglionic
retina.      In the Diptera the rhabdia of the two peripheral rows of
facets are, however, united into bundles of four or more at their inner
extremities ; at least, this is the case in the Syrphidae ; and these
bundles are surrounded by fusiform pigmented cells in such a manner
that they somewhat resemble a facellus.
    The Diptera have, however, a very remarkable layer in the gang
 lionic retina itself, which apparently represents the facellus in function
 at least  ;  I have   termed   it the facelloid layer.
     The accompanying diagram represents the axial structures connected
 with   a single rod-cell, in the semi-compound eye, and with one segment
 of the cone or tetrasome in the true compound eye.
     The rhabdia in the compound eye are surrounded in most insects by
 a close network of tracheal tubes, but in the Diptera these are replaced
  by sac-like trachea which fill the interspaces between the prismatic
  rhabdia ; this arrangement has been described by Leydig.

                                                      think          I

ceeded in working out the retinal structures of Eristalis and Agrion in
considerable detail. In the other insects in which        I
                                                     have examined the
eye, the knowledge   which   I have   been able to obtain of this portion of
the nervous system, must be considered at present as fragmentary. In
Eristalis there are from without inwards : — 1. A double layer of large
stellate ganglion cells; 2. A layer of small round nucleated cells;
3. The facelloid layer already referred to ; and 4. A layer of stellate
ganglion cells.
   These parts are connected with a deep ganglion, which consists of
several layers of fusiform cells by a decussating optic nerve, the fibres
of which cross each other from above downwards, and from without
inwards.    The deep ganglion is connected by a distinct peduncle with
the supra-cesophageal ganglion.     All the structures of the ganglionic
retina are supported by a  fine  neuroglia, which extends from a thick
outer to a fine inner limiting membrane.
  In Agrion the ganglionic retina differs from that of Eristalis in the
absence of a facelloid layer, which is replaced by a triple layer of
prismatic cells : the investigation of the nerve structures of this
insect is rendered very difficult by the presence of a lai'ge quantity of
dark pigment in the stellate connective cells of the neuroglia.
   In Vanessa the facelloid layer of the retina is also absent, but in its
place there are numerous layers of fusiform cells. In noctuid moths, or
at least in some species, the nervous structures are obscured by the
large quantity of deep black pigment which they contain.        In the
semi-compound, or, as    I
                         have termed      it,
                                           the microrhabdic eye of Tipula,
the nervous retina consists of, (1,)     alayer of stellate ganglion cells        ;
(2,) of several layers of round cells and (3,) of several layers of
                                          ;
fusiform cells. The greatest simplicity exists in the eye of Formica,
in which all the structures of the nervous retina are absent except
numerous layers of small round cells.           have not at present been
                                                I
able to make out any decussation of the nerve fibres connecting the
deeper parts with the ganglionic retina in the insects with microrhabdic
eyes, but the investigation   isvery difficult, owing to the great change
of the plane in which the nerve tracts lie.         do not think, however,
                                                    I
that any decussation exists, or think should have found indications
                               I         I
of it.
   The extent and curvature of the cornea and the size and curvature
of the facets afford the most important indications as to the manner
in which vision is  accomplished.    In the true compound eye, think       I
the structure indicates that J. Miiller's theory of vision        the most
                                                                     is

           ;    is also Dr. Grenacher's   view,  and     it   is

shall now endeavour to show, by the curvature of the cornea and the
size of the corneal facets in different insects, as well as in different
parts of the same eye.

  1878.]        the  Simple and Compound Eyes      of Insects.          267
    The semi-compound eye introduces no new difficulty in this theory,
                  I
 it is probable, think, that more than a single luminous impression is
 received by the elements which are situated behind each facet, and
 that these correspond with portions of the field of vision which are
 remote from each other, the central rod cell of one facet correspond
 ing to one of the peripheral rod cells of some other facet; the
 extreme complexity of the connexions between the cells of the
 ganglionic retina renders this view not improbable.
    In order to determine the effect of the long fine highly refractive
 threads of the eyes of insects upon the light,       I made some experi
 ments on the transmission of light through fine threads of glass.
    I  took a capillary tube of glass -g-J^ of an inch in thickness, about
 ~rho °f an mch in diameter, and an inch in length, placed it upright
 in a small trough of water under the microscope and examined it
 with an inch objective.       I found that no light passed through the
 lumen of the tube, but that the section of the wall of the tube
 appeared brightly illuminated. I next placed a few fine glass threads,
 drawn from a glass rod, in the interior of the tube ; these were as
 nearly as possible the same length as the tube and measured 10100
 of an inch in diameter. The upper end of each of these rods
 appeared as a brightly illuminated disk in the dark field ; when the
 focus of the microscope was altered the disk enlarged, showing that
 the rays left the rod in a divergent direction ; in some cases when the
•ends of the rods lay beyond the focus of the microscope, the disks of
 light exhibited grey rings, the result of interference.
    When the lower ends of these rods were lenticular, or fused into a
 drop, or drawn into a cone, the phenomena were the same, and in all
 cases the action of an oblique pencil, even when the obliquity was
 very slight, was feeble as compared with that of a pencil having the
 direction of the axis of the rod.
    These results are such as would be predicted on the undulatory
 theory ; all the light passing into the rod, except very oblique rays,
 -would be totally reflected, without any change of phase in the un
 dulations, at the surface of the glass, whilst all except the axial rays
 ¦would be very much enfeebled by numerous reflections          and inter
 ference from the different lengths of the paths of the rays.       I think
 threads of a highly refractive character immersed in a medium of a
 less refractive index, when less than -g^Vo of an inch in diameter, would
 destroy the effect of rays of only very small obliquity by interference.
    In order to determine the effect of the pigment,         I covered the
 exterior of some glass rods of             of an inch in diameter with
 black varnish, and I then found it impossible to transmit any rays of
 even the slightest obliquity through half an inch of such a rod.
    From these facts   I  think it may be concluded that it is probable
  that the highly refractive structures may be regarded in the light of

 luminous points, which serve as stimuli in exciting the recipient pro
 toplasm in which their ends are imbedded.
    The focus of the facet when this is lenticular, in all the insects
 which I have examined, is situated considerably deeper than the outer
 end of the rhabdion and below the surface of the rod cells in the
 microrhabdic eye, so that even for objects as close as       of an inch to
 the cornea, we have to deal with convergent rays and not with a focal
 point.   This indicates some mode of nerve stimulation other than the
 union of homocentric pencils, in a point beneath the compound
 cornea in relation with the recipient elements.    Considering the small
size of the parts,  I think it quite possible that we must look to the
 phenomena of interference for the explanation ; at least, they must
 play an important part in the phenomenon.
    Whatever may be the manner in which vision is accomplished, the
 size of the corneal facets and the general curvature of the cornea
renders the theory of J. Muller highly probable. . It is true that
 Claperede has expressed the reverse opinion, but     I shall endeavour to
show that he has done so on insufficient data.      According to his cal
culation, a bee should be unable to distinguish objects of less than
eight inches in diameter at a distance of twenty feet from it.         This
calculation is based on the idea that the acuity of vision in this insect
is the same in all parts of the field of vision, and that the general
surface of the common cornea is approximately a segment of a sphere.
This is not the case, for the angles subtended by the adjacent facets*
in the centre of the cornea, which is considerably flattened, is not
more than half a degree at the most ; so that on J. Muller's theory,
supposing each facet to give rise to only a single luminous impression,
the bee should be able to distinguish objects of about two inches in
diameter at a distance of twenty feet, an acuity of vision quite equal
to account for all the phenomena of vision in bees.
    I  have measured the curvature of the cornea of a number of
insects, with a view to determining the angles made by the lines of
vision drawn from the centre of adjacent facets. This is done in the
following manner : — A magnified image of the cornea is thrown on a
sheet of white paper, by means of a microscope and camera lucida,
and the curve of its profile drawn; in this way I have found the
principal meridians.     These curves approach more or less closely to an
epicycloid.
    It is easy with such curves and the size of the corneal facets to
determine the angles made by adjacent facets.            The angles vary
inversely as the radius of curvature, and, therefore, the acuity of
vision varies directly  as the radius of curvature when the diameter of
the facets remains the same, and inversely as the diameter of the
facets when these vary in size.       In many insects, as Tabanus, the
peripheral facets of the cornea are twice or three times the diameter

     of those in the centre, and the radius of curvature is very short at the
     extreme periphery.
$       In most insects the acuity of vision determined in this manner
     diminishes very rapidly at the periphery of the field.       In the centre
     of the field it enables them to perceive, as distinct, objects which
     subtend one degree.      In 2Eschna grandis the sharpness of vision is
    much greater, as the adjacent facets make an angle of only eight
    minutes   with each other. This is the least angle    I have measured in
    any insect,       I
                 but have no doubt, from the nature of the cnrve forming
    the meridians of the eye in the great dragon flies, that a small part of
   the centre of the field has a much greater acuity of vision than this ;
    in the wasp the angle subtended by the smallest visual perceptions is
   twice as great as in JEschna, ; and in the bee it is half a degree.
       The direction of the visual line, or the line perpendicular to the
   compound cornea in the centre of the field of most acute vision, varies
   in different insects.    In the predaceous kinds it is directed forwards in
   the plane of the body, or forwards and outwards,- making an angle of
   30° between the visual lines of the two eyes.      In the pollen feeders it
  is directed downwards as well as forwards and outwards.
       The size of the corneal facets varies in different insects from
  Tiros t° tto 0I" an 'ncn *n diameter.         Their size, except in a few
  insects,   is dependent    on  the  size of the insect, the largest insects
  having the largest and the smallest the smallest corneal facets.
  Prom this it follows that the vision of large insects is more perfect than
  that of small ones, except where the curvature of the cornea is very
  flat.   This corresponds with the manner in which the insects fly. For
  instance, the small Diptera fly round in small circles, and seldom leave
  the place in which they first attain their adult condition, except when
  borne away by currents of air, whilst the larger species take long
  flights when disturbed or in search of food.            The experiments of
  Muller and others have shown that the direction and length of the
  flight of insects depends largely on the visual powers of the insect.
  The forward flight of Tabanus and of many flies corresponds with the
  direction of their visual line, and the same may be said of the lateral
  movements of the large dragon flies.
       The mimicry of insects, especially that between the Diptera and the
  Hymenoptera is sufficiently close to be a protection or advantage to the
  unarmed insect, and is such that it would render the one indistinguish
 able from the other, or the two insects would be scarcely to be dis
 tinguished under conditions of vision equal to those with which the
 insects appear to be endowed except at very close quarters.
      In the extreme periphery of the cornea the adjacent facets make
 an angle of from 30' in wasps and some other Hymenoptera, to 12°
 in many insects.         In the microrhabdic eye of Tipula the curvature
 of the common cornea approaches the segment of a hemisphere.

     The author suggests that the fact that all his results are much lower
  than those obtained by previous experimenters may perhaps be ex
 plained on a supposition that the specific inductive capacity of dielec

    The introductory chapter of this memoir              consists of a summary of
the observations        of John Hunter, Rudolphi, Breschet, Owen, Huxley,
Rolleston, Ercolani, and Kondratowicz, on the form and structure of
the placenta in the apes. The author then gives a detailed description
of his dissection of the gravid uterus and placenta of a Macacm cijno-
molgus well advanced in pregnancy.                He then enters into a detailed
comparison between the form and structure of the placenta in the ape
and that of the human female, in the course of which he records a
number of original observations on the structure of the human pla
centa.      Attention is more especially drawn to the comparative struc
ture of the decidua vera and serotina ; to the prolongations of the
decidua serotina into the interior of the placenta; to the arrangement,
structure, and mode of origin of the intra-chorionic and sub-chorionic
cells ; to the arrangement           of the arteries and veins of the placenta ;
   •  I cannot Touch    for the exact accuracy of this determination,   as tho method of

   The result of this comparison proves that the Macacus and human
female closely correspond in the form of the uterus, and in the
arrangement of the foetal membranes, and that they both possess a
discoid placenta, which in the Macacm is divided into two lobes, but
is not so divided in the human placenta.            In the arrangement and
relative position of the constituent parts of the placenta they also cor

of some of the structures occur, yet, in the main features of con

resemblance to each other.

          Gore,    LL.D.,  F.R.S. Received March 12, 1878.
                                  (Abstract.)
   In this communication,     the author has described an improved appa
ratus for examining the thermo-electric properties of liquids, by the
nse of which, with the precautions stated, all sources of error in such
experiments    appear to be removed     ; he has also described a number of
experiments   he has made    with  it, and  the results obtained.
   By employing a sufficient nnmber and variety of electrically-con
ducting solutions, of acids, salts, and alkalies, in those experiments, he
has discovered several exceptions to the usual effect he had formerly
obtained, viz., that acid liquids are thermo-electro-positive, and alka
line ones thermo-electro-negative ; and has sketched a diagram repre
senting the thermo-electric behaviour of heated platinum in three of
the exceptional liquids.
   Reasoning upon the satisfactory results obtained, he conclndes : —
1st. That the electric currents are not produced by chemical action ;
2nd. Nor by a temporary disassociation of the constituents of the
liquid ; 3rd. Nor by the action of gases occluded in the metals ;
4th. But that they are produced purely and solely by the heat, and
that heat disappears in producing them ; 5th. That they are immediate
or direct effects of the heat, and that aqueous conducting liquids, there
fore, possess true thermo-electric properties : 6th. That the current is
a result of a difference of thermic action at the surfaces of the two
pieces of metal : 7th. That it is a product of a suitable molecular
structure of the liquid, a change of such structure resulting from
alteration of temperature, and a direct conversion of heat into elec
tricity ; and 8th. That the circumstance which is most influential in

 1878.]                               Presents.                                   273
 enabling heat to produce the currents, and most determines their
 direction and amount, is a suitable molecular structure of the liquid.
    By means of the apparatus and process described, he has discovered
irregular molecular changes in several of the liquids examined ; and as
molecular changes are the bases of various physical and chemical
alterations, he suggests the use of this apparatus and method as a new-
one for discovering anomalous            molecular alterations, and other co
incident physical and chemical ones, in electrically conducting liquids ;
and for detecting differences of electric potential between metals and
liqnids at different temperatures.
    By reasoning upon the different results obtained, he concludes also
as probable, that when a piece of metal is simply immersed in a suit
able liquid, a change of temperature occurs; and this (if correct*) is a
parallel fact to that of the production of electricity by simple con
tact only.       The results also support the contact theory of voltaic
electricity.
   The paper concludes with several suggestions of new lines of re
search suggested by the experiments, one of which is the construction
of a new thermo-electro-motor.

"Researches in Spectrum Analysis in connexion with the
      Spectrum of the Sun." By J. N. Lockyer, F.R.S. Received
      November 17, 1877. Read January 24, 1878*
   In  a map of the Bolar spectrum, containing a greatly increased
number of lines, such as that upon which             I  am now engaged, it is
possible  to seek   under    favourable   conditions   the   coincidence or non-
coincidence   of lines due to elements hitherto undetected in the solar
atmosphere, on account of their existing in quantities insufficient to
give very marked spectral lines.
   A search has accordingly been made, on the principles laid down in
previous communications, for those elements which contain in their
spectra long and well-characterised lines in the photographic region.
   Although the evidence cannot be said to be complete until the whole
spectrum has been examined, it is not too early to addnce the following
evidence as to the existence of several additional metals in the sun's
reversing layer, and the probable existence of others.
    The results obtained up to the present time are shown in the follow
ing tables, premising that in the first paper of this series the metals
considered as being solar as the result of the labours of Kirchhoff,
 Angstrom, and Thalen, together with the considerations there brought
 forward regarding the length of the lines, were as follows : —

                     in connexion with       the  Spectrum     of the   Sun.            283
     It  is important      to bear in mind that the lines recorded in the fore
going tables are          in  most cases the very longest visible in the photo
graphic region of the respective spectra.                     In some cases they are
limited      to  the region    39-40,    which   I  have  more especially studied.       So
that the fact of their being reversed in the solar spectrum must be
considered as the strongest evidence obtainable in favour of the exist
ence in the sun of the metals to which they belong, pending the com
plete investigation of their spectra.
     Where, however, there is only one line, as with Li, Rb, &c, the
 presence of these metals in the sun's reversing layer can, for the
 present, only be said to be probable. Neither must it be forgotten that
 in addition to the long lines which a spectrum may contain in the red,
 yellow, or orange, long lines may exist in the hitherto unexplored
 nitra-violet region, so that the necessity for waiting for further evi
 dence before deciding finally upon the presence or absence of such
 metals in the sun will be rendered obvious.
      It will be thought remarkable that if the long lines of such metals
 as lithium and rubidium are found in the photographic                       region of the
 spectrum, the long lines (Li, W.L. 6705 ; Rb, W.L. 6205 and 6296),
 should have escaped detection.
      To this    it  may be replied that, although these red lines may be appa
  rently the brightest to the eye, it by no means follows they are the
  longest, since they are situated in a part of the spectrum which affects
  the   visual organ more strongly than the photographic region does. It
  is  possible also that the reasoning            I  have lately used in a paper com
  municated        to the Society on the spectrum            of calcium may      be applied
  in these cases.
       Since a sensitized       film is affected by some rays more strongly than
  by others, in determining the lengths of lines from a photograph, it is
   not fair to compare together portions of the spectrum separated by
   too great an interval.
       Furthermore the fact of these red lines having been overlooked in
   the solar spectrum is not conclusive proof of their absence, inasmuch
   as this portion of the spectrum is both brighter and less refrangible,
   and a greater degree of dispersion would be necessary when prisms are
   employed to render visible faint dark lines which are easily detected in
   the photographic region.*             I hope to be able to make special search for
    these lines on some future occasion.
       For metals having long lines in the green a special search was
    made.       The long thallium line (W.L. 5349) was photographed, but
    no distinct evidence of a corresponding solar line was obtained.
        Two long silver lines were found also, about W.L. 4018 and 4212,
       *  It is
     c          significant that there is a dark line near the position of the Li line both in
     Angstrom and Kirchhoff's      maps not assigned to any metal.

but these lines, which are reversod, are of such great width that    it is
at present impossible to say whether they are coincident with lines in
the solar spectrum.

       by Dr. Michael Foster, F.R.S., Prelector of Physiology in
      Trinity College, Cambridge. Received March 14, 1878.
                                (Abstract.)
    The paper contains an account of some points in the development
of the Cymothoa cestroides and C. parallela of Milne-Edwards.
    The work was mainly carried on in the Zoological Station at Naples,
and the author takes this opportunity of returning his best thanks to
 Dr. Dohrn and Dr. Eisig for the kind way in which they forwarded
 his researches.
    The eggs were prepared in the way described by Bobretzky in his
 paper on the development of Oniscus murariiis ("Zeit. fiirWiss. Zool."
 Bd. xxiv), namely, by heating them in water, and then hardening
 them, first in bichromate of potash, and then in alcohol, beginning with
 70 cent, and gradually increasing the strength to absolute.     The sec
 tions were stained with Kleinenberg's hematoxylin and mounted in
 Canada balsam.
    The eggs when first laid are surrounded by a single membrane.
    The earliest stages of segmentation were not observed ; the first
 described is that in which a circular patch of cells has appeared at
 one pole of the egg. The cells are of considerable size and contain
 very large granular nuclei ; in the centre of the patch they are poly
 gonal, and more than one layer deep, but at the edges they are flat
 tened and form a single layer.
    The blastoderm gradually spreads over the yolk, the cells on the

dorsal surface being  very thin and difficult to recognise, while on the
opposite side they form a thickened patch (the future ventral wall of
the embryo), which elongates, and soon shows traces of segmentation.
   The procephalic lobes appear first, the other segments are formed in
order from before backwards.
   A second membrane is now formed round the egg.
   The epiblast of the procephalic lobes soon becomes thickened, to form
the cerebral ganglion.     At the most anterior end there is a separate
mass on each side, but in front of the mouth the thickening is con
tinuous right across ; it extends backwards, along the median line, to
form the ventral nerve-cords and ganglia.
   The mouth and, rather later, the anus appear as involutions of the
epiblast.
   Beneath the epiblast a second layer of scattered cells appears.
   The limbs arise as hollow protuberances of the epiblast, filled with
cells from the lower layer.
     On the    dorsal   surface   a peculiar      organ,   homologous       with the
"                         " of the Amphipods, is                         At   a later
  micropyle     apparatus                        developed.
stage it is situated in the first thoracic segment.          It   disappears before
the adult form is reached.
     Just behind the month involution a solid mass of cells appears,
from which the liver will be developed.
  The nervous system, which at first consisted of a continuous mass of
epiblast cells, becomes differentiated into a cellular and a fibrous por
tion.   The external layer of cells or epidermis is separated from     and    it,
it   becomes segmented   so as to form   chain   of separate  ganglia.
    The epiblast covering the head         is a
                                           thickened at a certain point on
each side, and from these thickenings the eyes are developed.
    The solid masses of cells representing the liver become converted
into three cascal tubes, on each side of the body, opening to the yolk,
and quite distinct from both the fore and hind guts.
    The heart appears above the hind gut in the abdomen.
    The hind gut grows forwards very rapidly, and comes nearly into
contact with the fore gut.     The liver caeca increase in size and become
filled with oil-drops derived from the yolk.
    It  is now possible to demonstrate, by dissection, that the yolk                is
surrounded by an exceedingly thin membrane, continuous with the
walls of the liver cseca, and opening into the point of junction of the
fore and hind guts.     This membrane appears to contain nuclei.
    As development proceeds the yolk gradually disappears, and tht
 membrane surrounding        disappears also.

II.   " On the Determination of the Constants of the Cup Anemo

       the Rev. T. R. Robinson, D.D., F.R.S., &c. Received March
       14, 1878.
                                     (Abstract.)
     In his description of     the
                                 cup anemometer (Transactions Royal
Irish Academy, Vol.    XXII),  Dr. Robinson inferred from experiments
on a very limited scale with Robins' whirling machine, that the
ultimate ratio of the wind's velocity to that of the centre of the cups
=3. Some recent experiments by M. Dohrandt show that this number
is too great ; but as some of the details appeared objectionable, and as
they did not include all the necessary data for determining the con
stants, the author was desirous of repeating them.     He was enabled to
do this by a liberal grant from the Royal Society, and the results are
given in this paper.
   After describing the apparatus and the locality in which it was esta
blished, he proceeds to explain the conditions of an anemometer's action.
 Considering only two opposite cnps, and supposing them in motion,
the pressure on the concave surface is as that surface and the square of
the resultant of the wind's velocity V and v, that of the anemometer,
 and as a, the pressure of an unit V on the cup normal to the arm.
   This is opposed, 1. By the pressure of a similar resultant on the
 convex surfaces, and a, another coefficient, also normal to the arm, but
 qnite different from a ; 2. By various resistances depending on      and     ti*
                                                                              ;
3.   By the friction of the machine estimated at the centres of the
cups.
  a and a are functions of     V,      the angle which the wind makes

     Unfortunately,            much difficulty in obtaining some of these
                              there   is
values.       We cannot produce wind of known velocity, and must substi
tute for     itthe translation of the anemometer through the air with a
known speed.*
   The most convenient mode of doing this which occurred to him was
the attaching the anemometer to a whirling machine.         In this case,
however, the rotation of the apparatus causes aD air- vortex, whose
motion must be subtracted from that of tho arm to give what                                               is
assumed as the effective V. The means by which this vortex current
was measured are described; they show that             exceedingly irre    it    is
gular, and that             it   is
                      accompanied by      radial current astill more dis-
orderly. We get with sufficient accuracy, but

Of this there are four kinds acting in these experiments.     1. That due
to the weight of the moving parts of the anemometer          That caused              ;   2.
by the action of    brake, intended to diminish
                             a                       in respect of V        v                        ;     3.
That produced by the lateral pressure of its axle on its supports, pro
duced by the wind, &c.      and, 4. That due to the centrifugal force
                                      ;
arising from the circular track of the anemometer's centre, which in
the actual arrangement     pressed the axle outwards.     The modes of
measuring these are described but this part of the work proved far
                                                 ;
from satisfactory. The ground where the apparatus was established
was affected by tremors from the action of machinery, which made
all these frictions variable and as he had the use of
                                           ;                    for a very                     it

taught by experience.
   The constant o was determined by connecting strong clock-spring           a
with an arm of the anemometer and that of the whirling machine.
When the whirl was rotated the anemometer tended the spring till its
elastic force equalled the air's pressure on the cups. Then a brake-
friction was applied mnch beyond the power of the spring, which
kept the anemometer in its place V was determined, and the tension

   Five instruments were used. No. I, cups 9 inches, arms 24, like the
Kew ones ; No. II, cups 4 inches, arms 24 ; No. Ill, cups 9 inches, arms
12 ; No. IV, cups 4 inches, arms 12 ; No. V, cups semi-cylinders, 9 inches

to be variable in each, ranging from 21-58 to 2"32.       It increases
with F and decreases as «; increases in such a manner as shows that it
will remain finite even when v is quasi-infinite.

least so, those of most the latter, indeed, rambled so much that no
                      7       ;
reliance  could be placed on them.        The matter was not mended by
combining the entire.      Thinking this discordancy might arise from
equ. (I) containing     term £v, he tried this, but with a result so mach
                          a
worse that such a term,         exist, can have no sensible influence. The
                               if  it
results for the other  instruments    were similar. In fact, the method of
minimum squares applies very imperfectly to a case like this, where
the coefficients of the unknown quantities and the absolute terms are
themselves affected with errors.      Besides this, in the final equations of
this process the coefficients of and    7    are so much less than those of
                                                 ft
a that they, especially 7, must be less accurately determined.      It is also
to be noted that these constants may be changed within certain limits,
and still satisfy the equations approximately.
   It was, however, suggested to him by Professor Stokes that, as
equ. (II) has only two variables,          and        could be plotted on a
                                            rj

the five instruments are given, and show distinctly both the general
agreement of (I) with the observations and the cause of the dis
cordances.
   Though in all the dots are much scattered, yet through    large por     a
tion of each the general direction   a right line with (in some cases)
                                            is
a barely perceptible downward curvature.
   Since the curvature   nearly as
                              is    this last must be very small, and
                                            7
assuming     it=0, the equation         aV— 2fiVv— F—0 will            be       sufficiently
accurate.    Towards the vertex of the curves (where                   v   is   small) the

dots are so straggling that nothing can be made of them. In No. II, and
still more in No. IV, they show that the frictions were considerably
astray.    Guided by these indications, and assuming for a nine-tenths
of his measures of that constant, he deduced for Nos. and      I       III values
of /3 and 7 so nearly equal as to make it probable that their means
would satisfy both. This would give «=1-1282; ass + t/=z=l-340.
The positive root of      (I) gives  Y=v   {

    Computing V from this, we find AV=obs. — calc., of which tables
are given for the live anemometers.          As might be expected from the
plottings, they are not very close, but show no systematic deviation
from the law denoted by (I). So it may be assumed exact for all
practical purposes through a range of V from 5 to 42 miles, and of F
from 113 to 3277 grains. For No.          Ill the probable error= +0 45. In
both the errors are less on the hypothesis 7=0. In No.            II these mean
constants fail, but others deduced for it represent the series, though
not so well as in the preceding; here also 7=0 is not inferior.                In
No. IV the frictions seem to have been deranged so much that the entire
series cannot be well represented by any constants.              Circumstances
detailed in the paper account for this. No. V, cylinder cups, is the
best of all. If, as seems probable, x and z are the same for all hemi
spherical anemometers, the difference between their indications will
depend    solely on  -F , and using the values      given above, the limiting
                      a
value of m=2-286, instead of 3.           Though if these experiments were
repeated   with Dr. Robinson's      present experience, and in an undisturbed
locality, better results might be obtained, yet the errors of the vortex
current would still cause uncertainty ; and he intends to try another
plan.
    The anemometer No. I, with its apparatus duly altered, is now
erected on the roof of the dwelling-house 22 feet from the Kew one
also there, to which it is exactly similar. Denoting the latter as S (the
standard one), the other, B, is to be loaded with a brake friction, which
 will make its v less than that of S ; when this has gone on long enough
 to ensure that an equal amount of wind has passed each instrument, a
larger brake friction is applied to E. We shall thus have three equa
tions (1), but four unknown quantities, a, x, V, y.              a, however, is
certainly known nearly by the measures already made. F also can
now be measured with far greater precision.                The chief difficulty
to be feared is the unsteadiness of the wind during each experi
 ment ; but as the time of each revolution of the two anemometers is
 recorded on the chronograph, it will be possible to eliminate this ele
 ment of doubt by selecting those times which have a given ratio.

III.   " On the Action of Ozone on Nuclei."            By Charles Tom-
             linson, F.R.S. Received March            14, 1878.
  After the reading of my paper on the 21st ultimo, Professor Stokes
was so good as to suggest that some of my experiments should be re
peated with ozone, prepared by the action of a coil, instead of that of
phosphorus.
  Professor Guthrie was so kind as to furnish me with a couple of
bottles of ozone, prepared by sending oxygen slowly through Wills's
generator in connexion with an induction coil.
  The ozone was used soon after it was prepared, and in the following
manner       :   —
    Oil of cajuput was distilled, and the fresh distillate was found to be
inactive on a supersaturated         solution of sodic sulphate (3 to 1),
although it was repeatedly shaken up with the solution.            The newly-
distilled oil was poured into one of the bottles of ozone, and shaken up
with   it,and then left for about fifteen minutes.       It was dropped into
nine flasks of the solution just named, and was active in all.         In some
of the flasks the solution became solid as soon as the ozonised oil
reached the surface     ; in others, immediately on shaking the flask, or
after a short interval of repose while, in a third set, after adding the
                                   ;
oil, the axis of the flask being brought into a nearly horizontal position,
the flask was made to revolve slowly, when the solution solidified
against the side, so as to form kind of lining to it.
                                  a
    On the 12th March the wind was N.E., and the ozone in the air was
very active on test paper. A paraffin oil of high boiling point was
distilled, and specimens of the fresh distillate were powerfully active
on a solution of sodic sulphate    (2  to 1).   A similar oil distilled during
a S. or W. wind, as noticed in a former note, was inactive.
    To a  solution of sodic sulphate    (3to 1), containing oil of cajuput in
an inactive condition, a solution of hydric peroxide was added, but           it
had no effect in rendering the oil active.           The flask was shaken
every day during a week, and the only effect was to liberate bubbles of
gas.    On adding to this flask a drop or two of the ozonised oil, the
solution immediately became solid.
    (23rd March.)      The inactive distillates of cajuput and paraffin oils,
shaken up several times during about half-au-hour with pure oxygen
gas, became active.      Test papers, suspended in the bottles, showed the
presence of ozone.      Washed castor oil, similarly treated, remained in
active   ; but shaken up with ozone, and left in contact with      it for some
hours, became active.
I    repeated the experiment, described in a former note, on the ac
tivity of charcoal, on which Pellogio founds his theory of absorption.
Pieces       of box-wood, buried in sand, were heated in   a   crucible during

J 878.]     Capt. Abney on the Acceleration of Oxidation,           fyc. 291
some hours.      When cold, and just taken out of the sand, they were
found to be inactive (except that they liberated a portion of the modi
fied salt after the manner of the inactive essential oils) ; but by
exposure to the outer air (wind N.E.) they became active in about ten
minutes. Cocoa-nut shell charcoal requires a longer exposure to become
active.
    Hence the activity of charcoal does not depend on absorption, but
on the condition of the air contained within its pores.

       frangible End of the Spectrum." By Captain Abney, R.E.,
       F.R.S. Received March 16, 1878.
                                 Preliminary Note.
    In a paper contributed      to the Philosophical Magazine in January last,
 I expressed an opinion that Chastaing's idea regarding an acceleration
 of oxidation being caused by red light might prove true in regard to the
 oxidation of the photographic image, and elsewhere* that Becqnerel's
 coloured spectra and Draper's reversed spectra might be explained on
 the same principles.       Owing to want of time until this last week,      I
 have been unable to investigate the matter, but can now affirm that
 such is the case as regards oxidation of the photographic image.
    Silver bromide, free from contamination, emulsified in collodion,
 which had been previously carefully purified, was spread on a plate,

292     Capt. Abney on the Acceleration      of Oxidation, §c.   [Apr. 11,
and exposed to diffused light.     It was then submitted to the action of
the solar spectrum, while immersed in a solution of potassium perman
ganate, or hydroxyl.      When the strength of the permanganate, or
hydroxyl, was correct a reversed image of the least refrangible end of
the spectrum was obtained, an increase in oxidation taking place when
the red rays acted, the reversal taking place somewhere near D, extend
ing into the ultra-red.
    The accelerating effect of the red rays is most marked when the
solution of permanganate or hydroxyl is weak ; but there is a limit to
the dilution, caused by the fact that silver bromide is sensitive as far
as the line a, and there must be sufficient strength to oxidise the
invisible image as it is formed, besides gradually destroying the effect
of the preliminary exposure.      With silver iodide this is not the case,
the reversed action is much more readily obtained.         The strength of
hydroxyl    solution I employed I cannot state.     That of  permanganate
was as follows : —
    1  grain of potassium permanganate was dissolved in 200 oz. of
water.
   When the dilution was doubled the reducing action of the red rays on
the bromide film was greater than its power of oxidation. A collimator
18 inches long, a prism of 2-inch side, a slit    inch wide, and a camera
with lens of 2-feet focus, were employed for throwing the spectrum on
the plate. The exposure was five minutes, sunlight feeble ; preliminary
exposure four seconds in the diffused light of my laboratory. A speci
men accompanies this paper.        Some interesting experiments      in an
atmosphere free from oxygen are being undertaken.
                (Addendum.)       Received April    5, 1878.
    Since making my communication, which was received by the Royal
Society on the 16th March last, I have employed films which were sen
sitive to the reducing action of the red rays to a wave-length of about
10,000 tenth-metres, and by modifying the strength of the oxidizing
solution, the acceleration of oxidation by the red rays and ultra-red
rays has been more strongly confirmed.       The oxidation on all the films
is effected by potassium bichromate, nitric acid, and ozone, in addition
to the agents   I have already given.
    Had not the sensitive film employed been capable of being reduced
by the action of the red rays and ultra-red rays, the proof of the
acceleration of oxidation by the same rays might perhaps         have beeu
open to dispute.

 II. " Summary of an Experimental Inquiry into the Function of
       Respiration at Various Altitudes."         By William Marcet,
       M.D., F.R.S.      Received March 19, 1878.
    These experiments were mainly undertaken with the view of in
 quiring into the state of the respiration of tourists at various altitudes,
and under the different circumstances     met with on Alpine excursions.
 I was engaged with the present     work  in  the last three summers ; the
stations selected being :  —
    1. A village named Yvoire near the Lake of Geneva, altitude 1,230
feet.
   2.  The Hospice of the Great St. Bernard, 8,115 feet.
   3. The Riffel Hotel, Zermatt, 8,428 feet.
   4. The St. Theodule Hut, 10,899 feet.
   5. The summit of the Breithorn, 13,685 feet.
   An interesting paper on the physiological influence of the fall of
atmospheric pressure by A. Mermod appeared in
                                                        " The Bulletin de la
Societe Vaudoise des Sciences Naturelles
                                             " for September, 1877. After
making a series of observations on the pulse, rate of breathing and
temperature of the body at several, though but moderate altitudes, he
selects Strasburg, 124 metres, and a place called Ste. Croix, 1,100
metres,  for his experiments on respiration.     He made 35 experiments
at  Strasburg, and 32 at Ste. Croix, the temperature of the air being
much the same at both places while occupied with the inquiry.             He
states, in conclusion, that the absolute and relative quantity of carbonic
acid exhaled     from the lungs increases by a change of residence to
higher altitudes, while the rate of respiration (frequence respiraioire)
remains always the same, and there is a diminution in the weight of
the air breathed.
   My results are similar to those obtained by Mr. Mermod, the only
point on which we may differ referring to the rate of breathing.         My
case, however, is slightly different from that of the former experi
mentalist ; he resided two or three months at his stations, while, with
the exception of Yvoire, where      I spend two or three months every
summer,     I merely  remained at mine long enough to make my experi
ments.       I ascended the Breithorn    with my instruments on three
different occasions ; the second time my stay on the summit lasted five
hours fifty-one minutes, and the third time also between five and six
hours.    I  was engaged with the experiments at the St. Theodule Pass
 during   eight   days in succession in 1875, and returned there last
Rummer for three days to complete the inquiry, one of those days
 being taken up with the ascent of the Breithorn with my instruments.
 The inquiry was carried on for three days at the St. Bernard, and for
 the same length of time at the Riffel.

   My experiments amount to one hundred and eleven in number, they
relate to the quantity of carbonic acid expired, the volume of the air
exhaled, and the number of expirations observed within a given time.
   With respect to the estimation            of carbonic acid, the principle of
Pettenkofer's method       was adopted     ;  but the mode of applying it was
somewhat altered in order to suit my requirements.                    The air to be
analysed being      first expired    into a  bag    made   of strong    india-rubber
material, was afterwards drawn into a long glass tube of a known
capacity.     The tubes used in these experiments held about one and a
half litre. The tube, fastened upright to a tripod and closed with
india-rubber stoppers, was first filled with a nearly saturated solution of
salt water ;* the bag being then connected with the tube through the
stopper at the upper end, the salt water was let out at the lower part,
thus aspiring the air from the bag into the tube.              The capacity of the
tube being known, it became filled with a measured bulk of air to be
analysed.     The air in the bag had been allowed to cool till its tem
perature   had  become the same as that of the salt water in the tube, so
that the temperature of the air in the tube and in the bag was alike.
A small pear-shaped vulcanised india-rubber bag, of a capacity of about
100 cub. centims. and emptied of its air, was now substituted for the
large india-rubber bag, and a pipette holding 100 cub. centims. of the
normal solution of barium, and which had been run through the upper
india-rubber stopper, was now opened by turning a stopcock.                       The
fluid then fell into the tube, the air thereby displaced being collected
in the small india-rubber bag which acted as a diverticulum. A stop
cock in the tube connected with this diverticulum being next closed,
the large analysis-tube or cylinder was removed from the tripod and its
contents driven from one end to the other repeatedly in order to
effect the combination of the carbonic acid ; the tube was then returned
to the tripod, and the air in the diverticulum forced into it by
pressure with the fingers, when the stopcock was again closed to be
followed by fresh agitation. The milky fluid was now drawn into a
small bottle holding about 100 cub. centims., which was well corked,
and the solution was subsequently analysed with one of oxalic acid
of known strength.         With but few exceptions the clear fluid was
drawn out of the bottle for analysis with a pipette, as I was led, in the
course of this inquiry, to object to filtration.         The above description is
necessarily much condensed and shortened, but the drawing which
accompanies the present summary will explain at one glance the form
of apparatus 1 employed.
   The air was breathed into the bag through a well-fitting ori-nazal
mask from which two tubes projected, each tube being supplied with
a valve carefully made by Mr. Coxeter, of Grafton Street. The valves

however, in the course of the inquiry, that distilled water could safely be used.

were so constructed as to let in the external air for the inspiration, and
transmit the inspired air to the bag.
    There was much more difficulty than             I  had anticipated in determin
ing  the capacity      of the    bags  used  for  collecting the air expired.       This
was done by filling the bag with a bellows under a certain pressure,
and then measuring the bulk of air by means of a water aspirator, the
amount of water necessary for aspiring out the whole of the air being
carefully measured ; the capacity of each bag was thus ascertained a
number of times, the probable approximate error being finally esti
mated at half a litre.           Two of the bags mostly used in last summer's
experiments had been found to contain 39"3 litres of air each under a
pressure of one inch of water, another held 46'5 litres of air under
1*5 inch of water.           Other bags about the same size were employed,
and one still larger was used on a few occasions.               •
    The use of india-rubber bags, although made of strong material,
appeared to me at first open to a great objection from the known
diffusibility of carbonic acid through caoutchouc, as shown by Thomas
Graham ;* but in the course of the present inquiry                 I   satisfied myself
that no appreciable loss, at all events, no loss serious enough to impair
my results, occurred through the bag in the course of an hour, and as
much as three-quarters of an hour seldom elapsed between the filling
of the bag and the introduction of the air into the analysis-tube.
The experiments were made either sitting, or walking on level ground,
or walking up hill ; most of them were made sitting.                        They were
always conducted in the open air, and no smoking was allowed near
the spot while the bag was being filled.                  The posture selected was
assumed     a few moments             before the experiment was commenced,
so as to    bring      the    body   under    the proper physiological condition.
 The experiments          in the sitting posture were conducted in the
following way      : —  I  first placed the empty bag in a woollen jacket to
preserve the temperature of the air expired and allow of its being
taken, then the bag was connected through a neck and india-rubber
tube with a water gauge fastened to a post, and a thermometer was
 slipped into the bag through another neck.                  An assistant, and my
 guide while in the mountains acted as such in a most commendable
 and intelligent way, stood ready by me with a stop-watch registering
 the minutes and seconds, and at a preconcerted signal set the watch
 in motion.f At the same time              I began expiring into the bag, holding
 the mask to the face with my hand.               When the bag was full, and the
 water in the gauge up to a certain mark, the timepiece was stopped.
 Thus, the time to expire a certain volume of air was determined.                   The
 temperature    of   the  air   inside   the bag  was  then read  off,  and   the jacket
 removed from the bag, the latter being next agitated in the air or

sprinkled over with water or snow till the air it contained had fallen,
to that of the salt water in the analysis-tube.    An assistant holding
up the bag I connected it with the tube, into which the air was drawn
by letting out the water from the tube into a bottle.
   When the experiments were made walking the jacket was usually
dispensed with ; no account was taken of the carbonic acid in the
atmosphere, as I invariably experimented in the open air with the view
of obtaining results to be considered comparatively with each other.
It is true that M. Truchot * has shown that the proportion of carbonic
acid in the atmosphere diminishes as the altitude increases ; the
difference, however, with respect to the volume of air breathed is so
small as to introduce no substantial error in my inquiry. The tern-
perature of the air in the bag immediately after it had been filled, and
having its jacket on, was higher than that same air when submitted
to analysis.   When the difference amounted to more than one or two
degrees  Fahrenheit,  which was nearly always the case, a correction was
introduced into the calculation.

   The influence of food in increasing the amount of carbonic acid
expired is well known. This is clearly shown on the present occasion

the mean altitude of which was 10,292 feet, the maximum carbonic
acid expired is during the first hour after a meal, and the minimum
from four to six hours after eating.         There is a slight rise during the
fourth hour after a meal, by 4 mgms. only, probably due to a cause
independent of food.
   At  the low station, 1,230 feet, above the sea, the maximum carbonic
acid is expired the second hour after a meal. There is a slight rise also
by 4 mgms. between the fourth and sixth hour after a meal, probably
owing likewise to some cause independent of food.
    The whole of my experiments are not included in the means of this
table, as many of them bore no record of the time they were made at,
with reference to the last meal taken.            I must also add, that the tem
perature was only noted occasionally during the day while the experi
ments were being made, and not at each experiment, as there was
frequently no marked change of temperature between one experiment
and another.
    I only wish to draw general conclusions from this table, which cer
tainly shows that the ingestion of food increases temporarily the
amount of carbonic acid expired, a fact which has been fully proved by
the experiments of Edward Smith ;•            I  find that the greatest quantity
of carbonic acid is expired during the first or second hour after a meal,
according to E. Smith this occurs in from one and a-half to two and
a-half hours after a meal.
    In order to neutralize the influence of food, my experiments were
made at all times of the day between breakfast and a late dinner, with
 but two exceptions which only reduce the means by 2 mgms. for the
 carbonic acid expired at one station, and 4 mgms. at the other. Hence
 it cannot be considered, in my estimation of the influence of altitude
 on respiration, that the food taken exerted any marked influence.              I
 must add, however, that      I  took, on the whole, less food at the two
 highest   stations — the St.   Theodule    Pass and Breithorn — than at the
 other places.

    The stations at which a sufficient number of experiments were made
to allow of an approximate estimation of the influence of the tempera
ture of the air on the amount of carbonic acid expired, were Tyoire,
the Riffel, and St. Theodule.                 I  have grouped the temperatures and
amounts of carbonic acid expired, as will be seen in the following
table ; the experiments they refer to are quite irrespective of the time
at which they have been made after a meal.

    In this   table, it will be observed that at every altitude there is an
increase     of carbonic acid expired as the temperature falls, which
 is especially great at the Riffel.                This circumstance observed at the
 Riffel may be clearly traced to the weather, which was bad during one
of the days       I  was engaged with my experiments there last summer.
 While sitting out of doors breathing quietly into my bag the rain was
 falling heavily, accompanied by a cold, piercing wind.
 United    influence     of Temperature and Altitude                  on    the     Carbonic   Acid
                                               expired.
    If we now turn our attention to the united influence of temperature
and altitude on the amount of carbonic acid expired, the following table
 will throw some light on the subject by showing the difference of mean
temperature,       carbonic acid expired, and altitude, between Yvoire and
the four other stations             : —

   The sign — before the figures, showing differences of temperature,
means that those temperatures are by so much lower than the mean
temperature at Tvoire ; while the sign + in the next column means
that the corresponding figures are by so much in excess of those show
ing the amount of carbonic acid expired at Yvoire. An inspection of
this table shows that there is a marked excess of carbonic acid expired
at every one of the high stations over the amount expired at Yvoire ;
and, moreover, that this excess for the summit of the Breithorn is more
than twice that registered for the St. Theodule, just double that for
the Riffel, and not quite twice that for the St. Bernard.
   It is difficult to conclude that this very great proportional excess
of carbonic acid exhaled at the Breithorn is due entirely to the cold air
met with at that station ; and there        is,
                                          to say the least,     strong pre
                                                                     a
sumption of    the existence  of another cause to account   for  the forma
tion of more carbonic acid in the body at increasing altitudes.                     A
further consideration of this point will lead to the conclusion that the
evaporation from the skin and lungs increasing as the atmospheric
pressure falls on rising above the Bea, a certain degree of cold                    is
thereby produced.      Its effect becomes added to the influence of the
fall of atmospheric temperature met with as      rule during the progress
                                                    a
of mountain ascents to be only resisted by the body by additional
                            ;
combustion, attended with an increased production of carbonic acid.
In Mr. Mermod's experiments, the temperature of the air was the
tame at his two stations, and the cold from increased evaporation
„ccounts apparently for the excess of carbonic acid expired at bis
highest station.
I      have therefore come to the conclusion that there         is   an increase of
carbonic acid expired as a person rises above the sea on     mountain    a
excursion, and that this phenomenon                     —
                                       due to two causes first, the fall
of the atmospheric temperature (this        is is
                                       shown as a fact), and secondly,
the cold produced by increased evaporation from the body, due to the
diminished pressure of the atmosphere, this last conclusion being drawn
sis   an inference.    In                     formed in the body to
                            short, more carbonic acid   is
counterbalance              of cold from the two circumstances just
                      the influence
stated. If on ascending to higher level we should find the same
                                      a
atmospheric temperature as we left at the lower station, still an in
creased amount of carbonic acid will be expected on account of the
cold due to the greater cutaneous and pulmonary evaporation.
   As to the volume of air breathed at different altitudes,  remark   it     is
able that, although under barometric pressures very different from
each other, and consequently with ever-changing bulks of air actually
inhaled, still when these volumes of air are rednced to that they
would occupy at the sea-side and at the freezing temperature, we find
over,  took less food there than si the lower stations.
       T                                                   These circumstances pro
bably account for the unexpectedly low excess of carbonic acid exhaled at that place.

  1878.]      the Function  of Respiration at Various Altitudes.         301
 them nearly but not quite the same.        An increase in the amount of
 carbonic acid evolved at places increasing in altitude was attended
 with an actual decrease of the volume of air expired also reduced.
 This result again agrees with that obtained by Mr. Mermod. It applies
 in my case to greater altitudes, attended with differences of tempera
 tures at the various stations ; while, as already stated, the temperature
 of the air was the same at Mr. Mermod's two stations.       As the amount
 of carbonic acid expired is more at the higher stations than at the
 lowest, and the volume of air breathed (reduced) less at the higher
 stations, it must follow that the proportion of carbonic acid expired
 will be greater at the higher than at the lowest station ; we find
 accordingly that the mean for the high stations yields 4-9 per cent, of
 carbonic acid in the air expired, while the experiments at the lowest
 station give 4-l per cent.
     From observations made with and without the face-piece, it follows
 that    I breathed into the open air slower, and apparently deeper,
 through the mask than without it. This accounts for the small number
 of expirations I noted per minute in all my experiments.        Relatively,
 however, the results obtained on this point may be accepted, as the
 breathing was carried on always in the same way while sitting and
 walking respectively.     "We find an increase in the frequency of respira
 tion from an altitude of 8,115 feet to that of 13,685 feet, but hardly
 any suctt increase between the altitudes of 1,230 feet and 8,115 feet.
 This greater number of respirations per minute between the St. Bernard
 and Breithorn was not observed to progress proportionally with rising
 altitudes from 8,115 feet, as will be seen in the table, and there must
 have been some other cause besides increased elevation to account for
it. Mr. Mermod found no difference in the frequency of respiration
 between 466 feet and 3,609 feet ; and here, again, for low stations       I
agree with him ; but I cannot follow him in concluding that, therefore,
the phenomenon is not altered at greater altitudes.
     The volume of air reduced, exhaled per respiration, varied at the
several stations, but followed no regular change relatively to altitude ;
it ranged from 510 cub. centims. at St. Theodule, to 760 cub. centims.
at the St. Bernard.
       Experiments  made while walking on Level Ground, or ascending.
    In every one of these experiments      I walked for a short time, say
two or three minutes, or longer, before commencing to collect the air
expired. They are fewer in number than those made sitting, and less
satisfactory, as it is impossible to depend upon the degree of muscular
exertion being the same in comparative experiments while in the act of
walking or climbing.

     The results have been disposed in a tabular form, and appear to
 show that while walking on level ground, when a certain altitude is
 reached, there is a decided fall in the amount of both the carbonic acid
 and air expired.            Yvoire and the St. Bernard gave nearly the same
 results ; but when the height of the St. Theodule Pass was attained
  (10,899 feet), there was a reduction in the expiration of carbonic acid
 while walking on level ground from 2 249 grms. at Yvoire, and 2 467
 at the St. Bernard, to T919 grms. ; on the summit of the Breithorn
 there was a further          fall of carbonic acid expired to 1'886 grms., while
 the volume          of air expired per minute was reduced from 24- 7 7 litres
 to 19-3 litres ; but the experiments are not numerous enough to allow
 of any but very general results.                  The same remark applies to the
 experiments made walking up hill.                    They certainly show, however,
 that walking up rapidly over rocks and grass patches at or below the
 elevation of the St. Bernard, yield most carbonic acid, the amount
 being as much as 3-156 grms. per minute at the St. Bernard, which
 was attended with the inhalation of the largest volume of air breathed.
 Ascending quickly at the height of St. Theodule caused a considerable
 elimination of carbonic acid through the lungs, amounting to 2 "972
 grms. On the other hand, walking leisurely up hill at the St. Bernard
 gave rise to the production of no more carbonic acid than quick walk
ing on the level ground at that same station ; indeed, the amount was
a trifle less.
    These experiments, therefore, give an idea of the extreme quantities
of carbonic acid expired at various altitudes under moderate and great
muscular exertion, and appear to show that at great elevations, such
as that of the summit of the Breithorn, and perhaps lower, the body is
less able to take in a sufficient amount of air for the supply of carbonic

        Temperature." By J. Clerk Maxwell, F.R.S., Professor
        of Experimental Physics in the University of Cambridge.
        Received March 19, 1878.
                                     (Abstract.)
    1.   In this paper I have followed the method given in my paper " On
the Dynamical Theory of Gases " (Phil. Trans., 1867, p. 49).                I have
shown that when inequalities of temperature exist in a gas, the pres
sure at a given point is not the same in all directions, and that the
difference between the maximum and the minimum pressure at a poiut
may be of considerable magnitude when the density of the gas is small
enough, and when the inequalities of temperature are produced by
small solid bodies at a higher or lower temperature than the vessel
containing the gas.
    2. The nature of this stress may be thus defined : let the distance
from the given point, measured in a given direction, be denoted by
 h, and the absolnte temperature by 0 ; then the space- variation of the
 temperature for a point moving along this line will be denoted by
 dO
 — , and the space- variation of this quantity along the same line by
 d*9
  —.      There is in general a particular direction of the line      h, for which
 ah
  (P9
  ——   is a maximum,     another for which      it is a minimum, and a third for
  aA
 which it is a maximum-minimum.              These three directions are at right
 angles    to each  other, and   are  the  axes   of principal stress at the given
 point ; and the part of the stress arising from inequalities of tempera
 ture is in each of these principal axes a pressure equal to —

     If   a sphere    of one centimetre in diameter is T degrees centigrade
hotter than the air at a distance from               it,   then, when the flow of heat
has become steady, the temperature at            a   distance of    r     centimetres    will   be
Hence, at distance of one centimetre from the centre of the sphere,

  4. In Mr. Crookes' experiments the                  pressure, p, was often so small
that this stress would be capable,               if  it  existed alone, of producing
rapid motion in small masses.
   Indeed,     we were to consider only the normal part of the stress
              if
exerted on solid bodies immersed in the gas, most of the phenomena
observed by Mr. Crookes could be readily explained.
   5. Let us take the case of two small bodies symmetrical with respect
to the axis joining their centres of figure. If both bodies are warmer
than the air at a distance from them, then in any section perpendicular
to the axis joining their centres, the point where        cuts this line will
                                                                    it
have the highest temperature,   and  there  will be a flow of heat outwards
from this axis in all directions.
     Hence    — will       be positive for the axis, and      it   will   be a   line of maxi-
              dhr
 mum pressure,   so that the bodies will repel each other.
     Ifboth bodies are colder than the air at a distance, everything will
 be reversed the axis will be a line of minimum pressure, and the bodies
                 ;
 will attract each other.
     If
      one body     hotter, and the other colder, than the air at a distance,
                     is
 the effect will be smaller and     will depend on the relative sizes of the
                                    ;       it
 bodies, and on their exact temperatures, whether the action         attrac         is
 tive or repulsive.
      If the bodies are two parallel disks, very near to each other, the
     6.
 central parts will produce very little effect, because between the disks
                                                  <P0
 the temperature varies uniformly and             7=^=0-       Only near the edges will
                                                  ah
 there be any stress arising from inequality of temperature in the gas.
     7.If the bodies are encircled by a ring having its axis in the line
 joining the bodies, then the repulsion between the two bodies, when

306      Prof.  J. C.  Maxwell on Stresses in Rarefied Gases               [Apr.  11,
they are warmer than the air in general, may be converted into attrac
tion by heating the ring, so as to produce a flow of heat inwards
towards the axis.
   8.   If a body  in the form of    a cnp or bowl is warmer than the air, the
distribution of temperature         in  the surrounding gas is similar to the
distribution of electric potential near a body of the same form, which has
been investigated      by Sir W. Thomson.* Near the convex surface the
value of — - is nearly the same as            if  the body had been a complete
             dh
sphere, namely       2T -,  where    T is the    excess   of temperature,    and a is
                        a
the radius of the sphere.          Near the concave surface the variation of
temperature is exceedingly small.            Hence the normal pressure on the
convex surface will be greater than on the concave surface, as Mr.
Crookes has shown by the motion of his radiometers.
    Since the expressions       for the stress are linear       as regards  the tem
perature, everything       will  be reversed when the cup is colder than the
surrounding air.
   9. In a spherical      vessel, if the two polar regions are made hotter
than the equatorial       zone, the pressure in the direction of the axis will
be greater than that parallel to the equatorial plane, and the reverse
will be the case if the polar regions are made colder than the equa
torial zone.
    10.  All  such explanations     of the observed phenomena must be sub
jected to careful criticism.         They have been obtained by considering
the normal stresses alone, to the exclusion of the tangential stresses;
and it is much easier to give an elementary exposition of the former
than of the latter.
    If, however, we go on to calculate the forces acting on any portion
 of the gas in virtue of the stresses on its surface, we find that when the
 How of heat is steady, these forces arc in equilibrium.                Mr. Crookes
tells us that there is no molar current, or wind, in his radiometer
 vessels. It may not bo easy to prove this by experiment, but it is satis
 factory to find that the system of stresses here described as arising from
 inequalities of temperature will not, when the flow of heat is steady,
generate currents.
    11. Consider, then, the case in which there are no currents of gas,
 but a steady flow of heat, the condition of which is
                           32    dtf   dr*
 (Tn the absence of external forces, such as gravity, and if the gas in
contact with sobd bodies does not slide over them, this is always a
 solution of the equations, and it is the only permanent              solution.)  In

 this case the equations of motion show that every particle of the gas
 is in equilibrium under the stresses acting on it.
    Hence any finite portion of the gas is also in equilibrium ; also, since
 the stresses are linear functions of the temperature, if we superpose
one system of temperatures on another, we also superpose the corre
 sponding systems of forces. Now the system of temperatures due to
 a solid sphere of uniform temperature, immersed in the gas, cannot of
 itself give rise to any force tending to move the sphere in one direc
tion rather than in another. Let the sphere be placed within the finite
 portion of gas which, as we have said, is already in equilibrium. The
 equilibrium will not be disturbed.          We may introduce any number of
spheres at different temperatures into the portion of gas, and when
the flow of heat has become steady the whole system will be in
equilibrium.
    12. How, then, are we to account for the observed fact that forces
act between solid bodies immersed in rarefied gases, and this, appa
rently, as long as inequalities of temperature are maintained ?
    I  think we must look for an explanation in the fact discovered
 in the case of liquids by Helmholtz and Piotrowski,* and for gases
 by Kundt and Warburg, f that the fluid in contact with the surface
 of a solid must slide over it with a finite velocity in order to produce
 a finite tangential stress.
    The theoretical treatment of the boundary conditions between a gas
 and a solid is difficult, and it becomes more difficult if we consider that
the gas close to the surface is probably in an unknown state of con
densation. We shall, therefore, accept the results obtained by Kundt
aud Warburg on their experimental evidence.
    They have found that the velocity of sliding of the gas over the
surface due to a given tangential stress varies inversely as the pressure
    The coefficient of sliding for air on glass was found to              be  \=—
                                                                                  P
centimetres, where p is the pressure in millionths of an atmosphere.
Mence at ordinary pressures X is insensible, but in the vessels exhausted
by Mr.     Crookes  it may   be considerable.
    Hence if close to the surface of a solid there is a tangential stress, S,
acting on a surface parallel to that of the body, in a direction, h, parallel
to that    surface, there   will also be a    sliding of the gas in contact with
the solid over its surface in the direction          h, with a finite velocity =S-
    13.  I  have not attempted to enter on the calculation of the effect of
this sliding motion, but it is easy to see that if we begin with the case
in which there is no sliding, the effect of permission being given to
the gas to slide must be in the first place to diminish the action of

all tangential stresses on the surface without affecting the normal
stresses   ; and, in the second place to set up currents sweeping over the
surfaces of solid bodies, thus completely .destroying the simplicity of
our first solution of the problem.
    14. When external forces, such as gravity, act on the gas, and when
the thermal phenomena produce differences of density in different
parts of the vessel, then the well-known convection currents are set
up. These also interfere with the simplicity of the problem and intro
duce very complicated effects.       All that we know is that the rarer the
gas and the smaller the vessel, the less is the velocity of the convection
currents ; so that in Mr. Crookes' experiments they play a very small
part.
IV. " Note        on the Existence      of Carbon in the Coronal Atmo
        sphere of the Sun." By        J. N. LoCKYER, F.R.S. Received
        March 20, 1878.
    It is  now four years since  I obtained evidence, which seemed to nic
conclusive, as to the existence of carbon in the sun's atmosphere.
There were two points, however, which remained to be settled before
the matter could be considered to be placed beyond all doubt.
    The first was to establish that the fluted bands generally present in
the spectrum of the arc, as photographed, which bands vary very con
siderably in strength according to the volatility of the metal under
experiment, were really bands of carbon       — a point denied by Angstrom
and Thalen.
    This point is settled by the photographs submitted to the Society with
this communication.         In these the carbon bands remain the same,
though one spectrum is that of carbon in air, the other of carbon in
chlorine dried with great care, and the proof that it cannot be the
spectrum of a combination of carbon with oxygen lies in the fact that
in the chlorine it is more brilliant than in the oxygen.        Now, assum
ing the chlorine to have been but imperfectly dried, this would not
have happened if a compound of oxygen had been in question.
    The next point was to obtain evidence that there was absolutely no
shift in the carbon bands, which sometimes happens when the part of
the arc photographed is not perfectly in the prolongation of the axis of
the collimator.
    A photograph has been obtained which supplies such evidence.
There are metallic lines close to the carbon bands, which are pro
                                                              I
longations of Frannhofer lines, while the lines which have already
 mapped at W. L., 39-27 and 39'295, in the spectrum of iron, are also
 absolute prolongations.       Therefore   there is no shift in the carbon
 flu tings. Now the individual lines in the brightest portion of the

1878.]        On the Poisonous   Principle of Urechites Suberecta.       309
fluting in the nltra-violet are absolute prolongations of    a fine series of
Frannhofer lines in which the wonderful rhythm of the elements of
the flatings is fully retained.
    Angstrom has already shown that the true carbon lines which we get
¦when a coil and jar are employed are not reversed in the spectrum of
the sun.      I  have already shown that the calcium spectrum in the sun
is the spectrum of the spark, and not of the arc.
    The carbon vapour then exists not only in a more complicated mole
cular condition (as is evinced by the flutings) than the metallic
vapours in the sun's atmosphere, but at a lower temperature.
    It must, therefore, exist above the chromosphere, that is, in a region of
lower temperature.         Lower pressure is also indicated by the feeble
reversal.
                I
    The idea put forward some time ago that the outer atmosphere of
the sun (and possibly the composition of the outer planets) is more
metalloidal than metallic is strengthened by this observation.
V. " On the Physiological Action of the Poisonous Principle of
        Urechites Suberecta."       By JAMES John BOWREY, F.C.S.,
       M.I.C., Analytical Chemist to the Government of Jamaica.
       Communicated by Professor A. W. WILLIAMSON, Foreign
       Secretary of the Royal Society. Received March 22, 1878.
    Several species of Echites are common in Jamaica, and certain of
them, known as "nightshades," or " Savana flowers," are reputed to
be very poisonous.        In this paper  I shall confine myself to a species
distinguished as the yellow flowered nightshade, and which Professor
Daniel Oliver has identified as Urechites suberecta, Muell. Arg. {Echites
Neriandra, Griseb.).        This plant is well known to be exceedingly
poisonons ; frequently when I have been examining a sprig plucked at
the road side a passing negro has warned me to be careful as it was
very dangerous.
    My attention was specially directed to it by the fact that it is sup
posed to have been the chief poison nsed by Obeah men in the time of
 slavery. The most wonderful tales are current of the power of these
 men, and it is even stated that they could so administer their poisons
 as to kill immediately or after the lapse of days or weeks.
    Sloane states,
                      " No animal will meddle with this herb, and . . .
 two drams of the expressed juice killed a dog in eight minutes, but it
 may be so ordered as to kill a person in many days, months, or years."
 This statement       I certainly think exaggerated, but my experiments
 show    that  it has some considerable foundation in fact. Sloane further
 states,   " Two or three spoonfuls of the juice purge young persons
 upwards and downwards, bringing away worms. The milk, outwardly

310        Mr. J. J. Bowrey on      the Physiological Action  of  [Apr.  11,
applied, takes away warts, and cares ringworms and freckles."            He
also gives the following as the symptoms occurring in the case of a
medical man to whom a negress was believed to have given portions
of this plant, violent griping, inclination to vomit, loss of appetite,
small convulsions     in various parts of the body, hectic fever, and con
tinued wasting of flesh. Under treatment a fatal result was pre
vented, but some considerable time passed before the convulsive
symptoms left the patient.
   The flowers, and all the green parts of the plant, are very bitter and
acrid, so strong and disagreeable is the taste that 1 think it almost
impossible that an adult could ignorantly take a fatal dose of the fresh
plant; both Sloane and Gosse, however, give instances in which there
was good reason to think death was caused by rum impregnated with
the poisonous     principle, a plug of the leaves having been used as a
stopper.     The  dry leaves may be chewed for some little time before
their bitterness is observed.       Cattle are sometimes poisoned by eating
the dry leaves when grazing, the plant having been cut down and
carelessly left in the pasture when it was cleaned.          The symptoms
described to me as occurring in cattle poisoned by Urechiles subereda
agree with those I have observed in animals to which the poisonous
principles have been given in the laboratory.
   Four substances having toxic properties have been obtained, viz. : —
   Crude principle, a resinous body extracted from the leaves by Stas's
process, under the supposition that they contained an alkaloid.         This
substance may be considered to be a mixture of all the active prin
ciples of the plant with a small proportion of inactive matter.
   Urechitoxin, a crystallizable body of definite composition.
   Amorphous urechitoxin, an uncrystallizable form of urechitoxin,
which has not been obtained perfectly pure, bat which resembles the
crystallizable substance in many respects.
   Urechitin, a crystallizable substance of definite composition, which
constitutes the great proportion of the poison present in unchanged
 Urechites suberecta   leaves.
   The substances enumerated above are glucosides ; for further infor
mation respecting their preparation and chemical properties the reader
is referred to a paper read before the Chemical Society (Journ. Chem.
Soc, xxxiii, p, 252).
   The effect of the crude principle was tried on mice and cats with
the results now to be detailed.
                         Effect on Mice, given by Mouth.
                                  Experiment I.
   A  little of the emulsion of the crude poison was given to a mouse       ;
immediately on swallowing it the animal lost all power of locomotion,
and convulsive movements of the muscles came on, the whole hind

quarters moving together.         This was over in about a minute, but was
succeeded by twitching of the limbs, continuing for about two minutes,
after which all motion ceased, and the mouse was dead three minutes
after the poison was placed in its throat.
                                 Experiment   II.
    Gave a smaller dose of the emulsion than that employed in Experi
         I
ment to two mice ; for some time no effect was visible.             In from
fifteen to thirty minutes there appeared convulsive movements of the
abdomen, as if the animal would vomit ; it then jumped about for a
few seconds, fell over on its side deprived of all power of locomotion,
its muscles twitched for a minute or two, and death followed.
                                Experiment    III.
    A  little of the crude poison, in a form like very thick treacle, was
put in the mouth of a mouse ; from its treacly condition the poison
could not be spat out by the animal.        For half an hour no effect was
noticed ; then there appeared to be disinclination to move, which in
creased until motion was plainly impossible, the mouse falling over on
its side and dying ninety minutes after the poison was put in its
mouth. The other symptoms noted were apparent attempts to vomit,
seeming difficulty in breathing, and shortly before death convulsive
gaspings for air.
                                Experiment    IV.
    A dose of the poison in the same state as that used in Experi
ment III, but in quantity much less, was given to a mouse ; for an
hour or two the animal appeared to be unaffected ; it then became less
active. Next day it would hardly move even when touched, but it ate
well. It was not seen on the third and fourth days, but was well pro
vided with food and water. On the morning of the fifth day it seemed
better than on the evening of the second day, but as the day passed
on it got worse, being very indisposed            to move, and when it did
clinging to the ground as if afraid of falling over. When first seen
on the morning of the sixth day it could hardly move, and as the
morning passed on it completely lost all power of locomotion, and died
quietly just five full days after it had received the poison.         Imme
diately before death the penis became erected, and semen was emitted.
    The most marked symptom in these four experiments was loss of
power of locomotion, the paralysis coming on very gradually when the
dose was smallest ; when the poison quickly proved fatal, convulsions
preceded death.

  312       Mr.   J. J. Bowrey on     the  Physiological Action     of  [Apr. 11,
  of an emulsion to a fine healthy kitten weighing about 2 lbs. The
  effect on the mouth and fauces was so immediate that but a small
  fraction of the dose was swallowed, the instantaneous choking causing
  the discharge of most of the emulsion, while the large quantity of
  frothy salira which directly began to flow must have washed the
  mouth out completely.
     In two or three minutes the animal appeared to be trying to vomit,
 but possibly it was merely choking up the thick saliva.
     9.26 a.m. Passed ordinary feces.
     9.28 a.m. Vomited violently ; this repeated at 9.37 and 9.43.            Up
 to this time it kept on its legs, now and then moving about slowly ; it
 appeared very disinclined to move, yet impelled to do so.
     9.45 a.m. Lay down and, except when vomiting or roused, remained
 lying down as if sleeping till three o'clock. During the latter part of
 the time, when disturbed, it would walk a few steps, but was in great
 danger of falling over on its side.
     10.8 a.m. Convulsive vomiting of a thick greenish-yellow liquid, re
 peated at 10.33 ; 11.5 ; 11.50 a.m., and 12.20, and 1.20 p.m. Each time
 the vomiting occurred after the kitten had been disturbed, or had
 itself moved a few steps ; it screamed during each vomiting, and even
 during an attempt to vomit.
     At 3 o'clock in the afternoon it walked out of the laboratory into
 the office, and there went to sleep until removed to my lodgings ; it
 slept all the evening and night, and was still sleepy next morning.
     All food and drink were refused on the day of administration ; next
 morning it tried to eat a morsel of meat, but did not swallow any of
it ; later in the day it drank some milk ; after this it recovered
rapidly.
      The poison was given on an empty stomach.                 There were alto
gether     ten   actual  or  attempted    vomitings,  nine   of  which occurred
within the first four and a half hours.          Two hours after the adminis
tration it seemed to be in a dying state, after this time it gradually
improved; very likely had it been disturbed when in its weakest con
dition, convulsions would have come on, and death would have been
the result.

walked      as   if drunk.
    1.0   p.m.   Passed urine and fa?ces.        Vomited.      It    was now very rest
less,     screamed continually, and had general                     convulsive tremors.
Wagging     its tail.  Soon it became quiet, and appeared very sleepy,
but in a minute or two convulsions of a violent character came on, the
pupils dilating in the fit, but contracting as it passed off.
   1.15 p.m. A second attack of convulsions came on in which the
animal died. The pupil of each eye was so enlarged that no iris could
be seen, nor was any visible thirty minutes after death.
   Rigor mortis not perceptible till an hour after death ; in two hours
it was marked. The body was opened in the afternoon on which the
animal died ; the only special appearances noted were the very dis
tended state of the stomach, and the tenseness of its walls, the tense
wiry condition of the intestines, which were so contracted that a trans
verse section appeared solid, and the gorged state of the auricles and
right ventricle, the left ventricle being nearly empty.
                                   Effect of Urechitoxin.
    This substance is very bitter and acrid, and produces a singular
sensation on the tongue and lips, as if they were swollen and blis
tered ; no visible change is really produced, but so vivid is the sensa
tion that it is almost impossible to persuade oneself that the tongue is
of its usual size, and the lips unblistered. The tingling lasts for many
hours.    Urechitoxin is powerfully sternutatory, the least particle
introduced into the nostrils causing violent fits of sneezing, accom
panied with a choky sensation at the back of the throat. Experi
ments have been made on mice, cats, and one dog, with this poison,
and as I believe it to be the typical active principle of the plant —                if,
indeed, not the active principle, urechitin being in all probability a
compound containing       — more experiments have been made with
                              it                                                     it

it gave but one or two twitches after being put out of the hand and
was dead.       These mice were opened, their stomachs found empty,
about a quarter drop of liquid squeezed from each and separately tested
gave the urechitoxin colour reaction distinctly.

urechitoxin, dissolved in        cnb. centim. of spirit (30 per cent.), but part
was swallowed, certainly not more than -j^y gr. In two hours the
animal was sluggish, clinging to the ground as if afraid of falling over
on  its side.   In six hours    so paralysed       as to be unable    to govern its
movements, tumbling over if it tried to move from one spot to another,
its limbs trembling much, and its breathing difficult and convulsive.
Next morning, nineteen hours after the poison had been given, the
mouse was found dead and stiff.
   These mice were affected exactly as were those to which the crude
poison was administered.         The effects, however, appeared much more
quickly, no doubt because the nrechitoxin was given                   as a perfect

the kitten's mouth.         Frothy saliva began to flow directly, the dis
charge    continuing for nearly forty minutes.              I think some of the
poison must have been got rid of in the saliva.                   No other effect
followed.     Next day the dose was repeated with the same effect ; after
the flow of saliva had ceased it ate, but about three hours after the
administration of the second dose the animal was seized with strong
convulsions, crying out spasmodically              and gasping for breath.        It
repeatedly passed    nrine,  also a little faeces,   and died  in the  convulsions.

all, seven doses were administered in eight days ; during this time the
kitten was dull, and had but little appetite.           It was found dead within
an hour of the exhibition of       the   last   dose,  and unfortunately was not
seen alive after the poison was given.             The total quantity of poison
given was ^ gr., rather less than 2 mgms.
    On opening the kitten a remarkable absence of fat was observed, the
tissues were pale, the lungs almost colourless, and the tongue very
white. The large arteries were empty, the large veins gorged with

 blood, the left ventricle quite empty, the right ventricle and the
 auricles were very full, in each auricle was a clot, that in the right
 very fibrinous and apparently growing from its walls.         The liver was
 normal, the gall-bladder very full, the bile tinging the surrounding
 tissues.    The stomach distended with gas, otherwise empty, its walls
thick and stiff, the intestines down to the appendix thick and stiff,
indeed     almost wiry, empty, and contracted, so as to have the appear
ance of a solid cylinder more than that of a tube on being cut through
transversely.     This condition was not observable below the appendix,
the lower part of the large intestines contained much faecal matter.
The bladder was empty, the kidneys apparently normal, their external
blood-vessels beautifully injected.     The body was opened three and a
half hours after death.

    In this experiment          gr., i.e., 013 mgm. of pure hydrated
urechitoxin, in one drop of spirit (40 per cent.), was administered to a

dose.     Appetite good.
    February 8th, 10th, 11th. — The administration of each dose was
followed by retching.     Appetite good. Weight now 2 lbs. 8 ozs.
    February 12th and 13th. — No vomiting.

Appetite still fairly good.    Weight from 2 lbs. 7 ozs. to 2 lbs. 9 ozs.
    February 18th and 19th. — Did not vomit nor care to eat. Weight
fell on the 19th to 2 lbs. 6 ozs.
    February 20th. — The last dose given.         No vomiting.       At first
refused to eat, but eight hours after receiving the poison it ate a little.
Weight 2 lbs. 5£ ozs.
    Next morning it was found dead      ;  it had evidently died in convul
sions.
    Its dead •weight was 2 lbs. 4£ ozs. The pupils of the eyes were so
enlarged as to reduce the irises to mere circular lines; this appearance
I have noticed in every cat killed by urechitoxin. The kitten was in
good condition ; on opening it a large quantity of fat was found sur
rounding the internal organs, otherwise the appearances were similar
to those noted in Experiment X.           The weight was taken each day
before food was given to the animal, and the poison was administered
by   allowing the drop of spirit containing it to fall into the throat of
the kitten immediately after it had been weighed.            It was then re
turned to its cage, and food speedily supplied to it.

                               Experiment         XII.
    This was an experiment similar to Experiment XI, excepting that
but one half the quantity of hydrated urechitoxin was given daily,
viz., tbVo BV'i      0'065 mgm.          The kitten weighed 2 lbs. 2 ozs.
    February 3rd. — First dose given, repeated on the 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th,
8th, 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th, without any visible effect.             Weight
varying from 2 lbs. to 2 lbs. 2 ozs. Appetite good.
    February 15th, 17th, 18th, 19th, 20th— The kitten during this time
was dull but still ate fairly.       Its weight declined to 1 lb. 15 ozs., one
morning being      1  lb. 13 ozs.       Though it ate, its appetite was fast
failing.

    February 22nd. Refused food entirely. Weight 1 lb. 13 ozs. Died
in convulsions in the evening ; it had become very thin. It was not
opened.
    Exp. XI. — Each dose          gr. Given 16 in 18 days. Total weight
given yy gr. = 21 mgm.           Death on 18th day. Weight on 1st day

    Exp. XII. — Each    dose  1016()   gr.   Given 18 in 20 days. Total weight
given nearly   T'T gr. =  1"2 mgm.          Death on the 20th day. Weight on
1st day 2 lbs. 2 ozs., on 20th day         1  lb. 13 ozs.
                               Experiment         XIII.
    In this experiment the poison was given in a manner more likely ta
ensure the swallowing of each dose completely, and also at the same
time to prevent its action on the fauces.            A solution of pure hydrated
urechitoxin was prepared containing -j-^ gr. of the poison in each cub.
centim., strong spirit being used as the solvent.              A number of bits of
filtering paper — each about J-inch square — were suspended on pins.
Each of these pieces of paper received                   cub. centim. of the spirit
solution delivered from an accurately graduated pipette ; when the
spirit had completely evaporated, and the squares were dry, they were
placed in a stoppered bottle.         To give the dose, a square of paper was
cut into shreds    and   mixed   with a little butter — the grease appeared
to prevent the cat perceiving the bitter taste of the poison — and placed
in a bit of meat, which was then given to the animal.                  The cat was
liberally fed once every day about 11 a.m., its weight being taken first,
and the poison given immediately before the day's food was put in its
cage.    I  may remark that plenty of exercise was allowed to all the
animals experimented on, the cats having the run of large premises
during the day, their cages being closed at night only.
    Bed cat weighing 5 lbs. 4 ozs.                Received first dose July 3rd.
Repeated on July 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th, during which time
its weight was constant.

   July   12th, 14th, 15th, 16th, during which time its weight fell to
5 lbs.
   For the last few days it was rather dull and inactive, and lost its
appetite.
   At 10 a.m., on     July 17th, there was nothing to attract notice in its
appearance ;      but  at 11 o'clock it was seized with convulsions, passed
faeces involuntarily ; and after the convulsions passed off it lay on its
side breathing heavily from the abdomen till about 1 p.m., when it died
in a second attack of convulsions.
   Its bladder was found distended with urine, the stomach and intes
tines empty and tense, the latter almost wiry.                   Gall-bladder full,
liver very dark and full of blood. All the veins full of dark blood,
which coagulated very quickly.                Lungs pale.       Heart, right side
gorged with dark blood, left side contained a little redder blood, but
not fully aerated. Arteries collapsed, and nearly empty. Pupils dis
tended so as almost to obliterate iris.             Tongue bluish immediately
after death.
                                 Experiment     XIV.
   A white cat, weighing 6 lbs. at the beginning of the experiment,
was treated exactly as the one in Experiment              XIII,  a square of paper
containing            gr. of urechitoxin being given to it every week day
(with   one   exception) for eleven weeks. Its weight gradually increased,
so  that   it weighed 6£ lbs. at the end of that time.              No effect was
apparent up       to the  day   on  which  it  received    the last  dose.   In the
morning it was well and cheerful, at 1           p.m.  it was discovered very ill,
possibly it had been attacked by convulsions.                However, it took the
dose of poison, and ate a little food.            Next day it seemed well, no
poison   was   given   to it.   The   day after  it  died about 10 a.m. ; it was
not seen to die, but it presented the appearances seen in other cats
poisoned with urechitoxin.            There had been a little purging shortly
before death.      .
                                  Experiment    XV.
   A  kitten, weighing       If lbs., was treated in the same manner as the
cats in Experiments       XIII    and XIV, a square of poisoned paper being
given to it every week day for nearly four weeks, a total of 22 doses
being administered.         For the first three weeks no effect was apparent
and its weight increased to 2 lbs. ; during the last week it appeared
dull and did not care for its food, its weight falling to 1^ lbs. There
was nothing calling for special note in its mode of death or in the
appearances subsequently observed.

     Three other cats were experimented on in a similar manner, two of
them receiving about 100 squares each, and the other about 40 np to
 the time when the experiments were discontinued.                Except very
occasional vomiting these cats appeared in perfect health ; none of
them lost weight, while one gained considerably.           Only a portion of
the squares of poisoned paper were taken from the same lot as those
used in Experiments XIII, XIV, and XV, most of them were from a
new batch prepared from a solution which had been kept for a long
time.      I have found that weak solutions are apt in time to lose their
bitterness, indeed, the papers prepared from this old solution had but
a very slight bitter taste ; this test, however, was not applied until the
absence of effect on the cats led me to suspect that something was
wrong.       In all probability, for the greater part of the time, these
three cats were receiving but a fraction of the dose intended.
                Effect of Urechitoxin on a Dog, given by Month.
                                 Experiment    XVI.
     One gr., i.e., 65 mgms. of crystallized hydrated urechitoxin, was put
 on a piece of meat, another piece laid over it and the two bits of meat
lightly tied together with         a piece  of cotton and given to a medium-
sized dog ; no effect followed for      an hour, then the animal vomited four
times in quick succession, the meat containing the urechitoxin was
found in the vomit, the quantity of poison apparently undiminished,
one edge of the layer of poison, however, was free, i.e., uncovered by
meat, and must have been in contact with the juices of the stomach.
The dog was watched for an hour and a-half after the vomiting was
over, during which time it slept naturally, showing no ill effects what
ever.      It was then left for the night, with food and water at its side,
in the fall expectation of finding it quite well in the morning ; how
ever, it was discovered dead and cold, the food and drink untouched.
     The internal organs were found to be congested, all the cavities of
the heart contained much thick black blood, the auricles being gorged.
There were marks of irritation on the inner face of the stomach.
The brain was normal.

            Effect of a large dose on Gats, subcutaneously injected.
                              Experiment    XVII.
   Injected £ gr., i.e., 8"1 mgm. pure hydrated urechitoxin, dissolved
in  | cub. centim. (40 per cent.) spirit, under the skin of neck of
a  strong full grown cat. For ten minutes nothing particular was
noticed,   unless, indeed, the animal was slightly uneasy and indisposed
to move ; at the end of this time it became very nneasy, mewing a good
deal.    When thirteen minutes had elapsed the cat vomited violently
and then passed faeces.       During the next twenty minutes it vomited
very   violently three times and passed faeces and urine involuntarily,
the breathing also became very hurried, more than 100 respirations
per minute.       Very unwilling to move, seemed giddy, tail twitching ;
                                                                            *
two or three times, however, the animal showed unexpected strength,
getting up and walking a few steps.        About thirty-five minutes after
the injection most violent convulsions came on and death took place
thirty-seven minutes after the poison had been injected.           When the
convulsions came on the pupils enlarged so as to reduce the irises to
mere circular lines, this enlargement remained for a considerable time
after death, then the irises began slowly to contract.
   The appearances       noted on opening the animal were the same as
those usually seen in other cats poisoned by urechitoxin. The stomach
contained about a teaspoonful of white frothy liquid and was very
much    distended with gas. The intestines were remarkably tense and
wiry, and showed frequent knots in their course, like the knots of a
bamboo cane but much more exaggerated.
                              Experiment   XVIII.
   Injected ^ gr. pure hydrated urechitoxin, dissolved in spirit, under
skin of neck of a half-grown kitten, immediately afterwards gave it a
mouse   which it caught and ate. In five minutes from time of injec
tion vomiting came on and the mouse was ejected.             The kitten now
very uneasy,      convulsive  twitchings appeared, speedily followed by
strong convulsions, in which it died within eight minutes of the injec
tion.   It was opened directly, the stomach was loaded with food and
the colon with faeces.      The heart, which was very distended, was not
cut into ; it contracted considerably as it cooled.      The other appear
ances were similar to those noted in other experiments.
                             Experiment   XVIIIa.
   In this    case a quantity of urechitoxin was injected sufficient to
prove    fatal very speedily.     Experiments   XVIII   and XVIIIa were
 performed simply in order that some medical friends might see the
 great activity  of the poison, and I mention No. XVIIIa here, for the
 sake  of the following extract from my note book.            " The cat was

effect was to cause the animal to vomit, which, in Experiment XVIII,
was very speedily followed by convulsions and death, but, in Experi

fasces were passed, and there was a marked disinclination to muscular
exertion before the final convulsions came on and life became extinct.

  11.45 a.m. Vomited twice, brought up very little.                        Respirations over
120 per minute and irregular.
     Put a mouse in the cage             ;   the cat noticed        and touched    it,   and when
itfled, started after it, but did not follow      remained looking at, but

did not attempt to catch it. The mouse was removed, when the cat
lay down and remained lying down from 11.50 to 12.15 o'clock.
Respirations varying from 100 to 90 per minute, irregular in both rate
and intensity, but becoming less violent and rapid.
  12.15 p.m. Got up, restless, crying, licking bps till
  12.17 „      Vomited violently     little frothy liquid. Soon lay down

                          if   it
did not attempt to do so. On being put back in the cage          struggled         it
to get out for some ten minutes, then lay down as          asleep, but notif
really so.

but did not do so. Now very sluggish, and remained so, neither
vomiting or passing faeces or urine till 10.30 next morning, when its
respirations were irregular and 45 per minute the heart-beats were   ;
also irregular and over 110 per minute.        It refused to eat, and had
taken nothing, except possibly some water, from the time when the
poison was injected.

       Fourth day. — 7.0 a.m. Vomited twice, bringing up much white frothy
   liquid.      Afterwards tasted some milk — drank no appreciable quantity.
       10.30 A.M. Vomited a quantity of liquid, looking like dilute milk.
       11.30     „    Would have nothing to do with           a mouse.    Lay down
   almost wherever       it was placed, and even if it wanted to reach another
   spot,   it moved but a few steps, trembling and' but half-raised on its
   legs,  in danger of falling over on its side. It would lie down without
   reaching the desired place, never moving two feet at one time.
       Weight 5 lbs. 11 ozs. It gradually got worse, twitching of the ears,
   and indeed whole head, now occurred on its being forced to make the
   slightest movement.         The pupils very contracted, and not sensitive to
   light.     I  think, however, that if the cat's attention could have been
  aroused they would have expanded and proved sensitive.
       2.0 p.m. The cat now unable to keep on its feet ; even when placed
  upon them it sank on to the ground without any attempt to take up a
  restful or easy position. Saliva flowing from its mouth.
      3.0 p.m. to 3.10 P.M. While being moved convulsions,             accompanied
  with cries, came on, followed by vomiting and a second attack of con
  vulsions, in which it died.
      Weight now 5 lbs. 10 ozs. The eyes presented the usual enlarged
  pupils.       The body was immediately opened. Stomach inflated, con
  tained a little yellow mucus.          Intestines contracted. Colon contained
  a little hard fasces.       Bladder contained a few drops of urine.         Liver
  and kidneys appeared normal, the veins of latter beautifully injected.
  Lungs pink with a tinge of yellow, became cream-coloured as they
  cooled.       Heart filled. Pericardium, right ventricle full ; on cutting
  into it some thick dark blood flowed, but a mass of coagulated blood
  remained in it ; left ventricle contained a little red blood, which did
  not coagulate until it was exposed to the air.                External vessels of
  brain congested ; no blood-points were seen in its substance on cutting
  into it. Death took place 77 hours after the first injection and 53
  hours after the second.        The total weight of poison injected was
  gr., i.e., nearly    2 mgms., equivalent to one-and-a-half millionth part of
  the weight of the cat.

  fed 16 hours before the injection.
      10.50 a.m. Poison injected.         After it was liberated the animal lay
  down, and remained so till
      11.25 a.m.     When it began to lick its lips, but the uneasiness passed
  off, and only occasionally      did it give a lick, still lying down.
      11.55 a.m. Got up uneasy, mewing, licking lips.
      12 o'clock. Vomited frothy liquid.

catch a mouse put with it. Next day still better, caught and ate                                     a
mouse. On the tenth day was still stronger, and on the eleventh was
quite recovered.
   The poison injected was not the three-millionth part of the weight
of the cat. No food whatever was taken until the evening of the fifth
day, and as nothing had been taken for sixteen hours before the injec
tion, nothing was eaten for five whole days.

    11.50 a.m. Lay down as if to sleep, but if it did sleep it was not
soundly.        It continued lying down with its eyes closed, but opened
them on being spoken to. No other effect followed, and on the second
and third days it appeared quite well and ate fairly.

 a single step     from the place were it lay unless obliged to do so by force,

two worms.       Drank a very little milk which it had hitherto refused ;
still refused  all solid food. Now very weak. Noticed but did not try
to catch a mouse pat in the cage with it.
   2 p.m. Vomited a little curdled milk.

dition as on the previous day, but noticed a little more when it was
stroked.
   11 a.m. Put the cat in the cage with a mouse ; no attempt was made
to catch      it,
               and soon the cat vomited a quantity of yellow liquid.

its movements.    When put in glass vessel with mice would not notice
them, but jumped out and soon after vomited.      Took no food what
ever.
  Eleventh day. —Weight             3    lbs.   6   ozs.   Plainly much better, noticed
when spoken to, purring,                &c.       Took no food, however,     and would
have nothing to do with mice.

rapidly and completely recovered.
  The injection of the crude principle produced no other effect than
disinclination to activity for a few hours afterwards.
   The injection of the urechitoxin (on the fourth day from that of
the crude poison) was followed in twenty minutes by vomiting.    On the
fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh days, all food   was  refused. On  the
eighth day took      little milk which was speedily ejected by vomiting.

    Injected -j-^ gr. amorphous urechitoxin in cub. centim. of spirit (40
 per cent.) under skin of neck of a full grown cat weighing 4 lbs. 12 ozs.
 The only effect observed was that the animal became dull and sleepy,
 and would eat on the day of injection, or on the two following days,
 thus fasting for three days. It ate a little, very little, on the fourth
 and fifth days, but still remained in the same sleepy state, taking no
 exercise.     After that it rapidly recovered. There was no vomiting.

 parently weak, and did not recover its appetite for full five days after
 the injection of the poison.       There was no vomiting.

                  Effect of Urechitin on Gats, given by Mouth.
                             Experiment    XXVIII.
   A dose of finely powdered urechitin, weighing        -Jg- gr., i.e. 6"5 mgms.,
was given    to a cat on a piece of meat ; the whole was swallowed, and
the animal ate a hearty meal directly afterwards.
   11.20 a.m. Poison administered.
   12.40 p.m. Vomited a little frothy liquid ; during the next hour it
twice vomited food, and once frothy liquid.
   2.15 p.m. Had twice since 1.40 p.m. vomited a little frothy liquid.
Now very indisposed to move, when it did was very sluggish and also
uncertain in its movements.         Before the poison began to act, it had
been a more     than  usually active  cat. Though so unwilling, or perhaps
unable readily, to move, it was too uneasy to remain long in one spot.
Breathing laboured and abdominal.
   3 p.m. Vomited frothy liquid very violently. Very weak.                  After
this time it remained very quiet,          as  if too  weak to move, yet it
appeared decidedly easier.       Next morning it was still very feeble.
   At 10 a.m. it vomited some frothy liquid, in which was a worm. It
had been vomiting during the night.            It refused to eat all day, but
after this time recovered rapidly      and  completely.
   Urechitin is very insoluble in watery liquids ; and as the dose was
given in the solid form, and was immediately followed by a hearty
meal, which was entirely ejected within two and a half hours from the
exhibition of the poison, no doubt but little was absorbed into the
system.
                              Experiment     XXIX.
    To the perfectly recovered       cat used in Experiment         XXVIII,   ad
ministered a similar dose, i.e.,          gr. urechitin; but this time the
poison was dissolved in a few drops of very strong alcohol, and the
solution diluted with weak spirit until the poison began to crystallize
out of the mixed solution, and very fine crystals were then poured into
the throat of the cat, and its mouth held shut until they seemed to be
swallowed.      The bulk of the dose undoubtedly was swallowed, but
little escaping.

 wards convulsions came on, in which it died.
    After 1 o'clock it gradually became weaker, and was very unwilling
 to move. When the effects of the poison were well developed, the skin
 of neck was observed to be of a bright pink colour; the colour was
 easily seen on the neck, as the skin was very thin there ; when the
 poison was given the skin was almost colourless.         The eyes were not
 affected, their pupils remaining sensitive to light; in death, however,
 they enlarged, the irises becoming mere lines.
                              Experiment      XXX.
    A dose of T\f gr. of pure finely powdered urechitin was distributed
 on two small pieces of meat, which were then given to a cat ; one piece
 was swallowed, the other rejected after being chewed (no doubt the
 poison was tasted) ; a considerable proportion of the dose, however,
 must have been swallowed       even from that second piece of meat, for
the poison     lying on its exterior would be swept off in the act of
 chewing.

    Next morning it was found in the Rame state as when left ; there
were no signs of any vomiting.        On being let out of its cage it slowly
walked to a bush, under the shade of which it remained all day. It
refused to eat anything.       In the evening it was left under the bush.

Third morning The cat was found lying in a cool place some 40 feet
from the spot where it was left on the second day. It was very weak,
and had lost the power of locomotion completely, but could move its
limbs languidly. At 10 a.m. it was carried into the laboratory, that it
might be more closely watched.          If undisturbed it lay perfectly still,
asleep.   Liquid ran from its mouth. Pupils sensitive to light, but

  1878.]       the  Poisonous Principle     of Urechites Suberecta.            331
  moved   sluggishly.     Now and then      a slight convulsive movement of the
 body aud limbs was seen.            It  became weaker and weaker,       until the
 breathing was imperceptible,                                      I
                                       and only by touch could be certain it
 was not dead.        Urine ran from it. At a few minutes before 12 o'clock
 it died.    I  did not see it die, but   I  had examined it about ten minutes
 before   I found it dead. There was no rigidity, but the usual enlarge
 ment of the pupil was very marked immediately after death, which
 took place 49 hours after the administration of the poison.
     The bladder was found distended with urine, and the lower bowels
 full of hard faeces. The smaller intestines were empty, but not tense
 or contracted.       The gall bladder distended with bile, and colouring
 the stomach yellow.          The lungs pink. The right side of the heart
 gorged with dark blood, and the veins also ; the left side contained a
 little thin red blood.       The body was opened very shortly after death.
     The experiments        I  have detailed show the four forms of poison
 extracted from Urechites suberecta to be practically identical in their
 physiological action.        In mice they cause muscular paralysis, respira
 tory difficulty, and convulsions ending in death.             In cats, large and
 moderate doses always produced vomiting, which (in the cases where
 very speedily fatal doses were exhibited) was followed by convulsions
and death; but where death was delayed, both faeces and urine were
evacuated,       the vomiting frequently renewed, pulse and respiration
 quickened, notably the former, and muscular paralysis gradually de
veloped, the end being preceded by convulsions. Very small doses pro
 duced on the first day vomiting, defecation and micturition;                  the
vomiting persisting for several days, but the bowels becoming confined
and the secretion of urine apparently lessened.            But perhaps the most
marked symptoms following the exhibition of small doses, was the
refusal of all food for many days, and the great disinclination to
muscular exertion.          Salivation was also sometimes produced by the
injection   of  very  small   quantities of the poison.
    In the four experiments on cats, in which but l6100 gr. of the poison
was administered daily, there was no vomiting, indeed no visible effect
for many days ; then a gradual loss of appetite and general dulness,
succeeded by sudden convulsions, followed in a few hours by death.
In Experiment XIV, however, no symptoms of poisoning appeared for
eleven weeks, and then they preceded death by less than twenty-four
hours.
    The smallest quantity of the pure crystallized poison which proved
fatal to a cat was -j-^ gr., injected subcutaneously in one dose — see
Experiment XX. This was equivalent to one two-and-a-half millionth
of the cat's weight. The next smallest fatal dose is that recorded in
Experiment       XIII,  in which eleven separate doses were administered,
amounting in all to v\ gr., or one three-and-a-quarter           millionth of the
cat's weight.       In other experiments no fatal effect resulted until three

   Nearly four years since, in examining an infusion of animal matter,
which had, unfortunately, been diluted with water, and had vegetable
substances placed in     it,
                          I      observed a minute and intensely active
organism,  which,   on closer  and  more careful examination,   Ifound to
be of a form entirely new to me.      I therefore determined to endeavour
to discover its life-history   ;but the diluted infusion was unsuited to
it,and in the course of five days no living form remained.         During
this time   had been able to determine veiy little that was consecutive,
                 I
but had seen enough to lead me to desire to find        it

not until the latter part of the summer of 1876 that found it again.
It appeared then, in a maceration, in which the body of a vole was
decomposing.         The maceration was only three weeks old, and this
organism had evidently only just arisen ; it increased daily in vigour
and numbers, and in three weeks             I   was sA liberty to study it con
tinuously.
   For this purpose         I employed the " continuous          stage," jointly
devised for preceding researches,* by means of which a drop of the
infusion could be kept under examination, without evaporation, for an
indefinite time, and with the most powerful lenses. f
   My method was to follow out, as far as possible, the morphological
details separately ; and then to steadily follow one form from its
earliest to its most mature condition; thus discovering how the
different states were related, and making out an unbroken life-history.
   Most of the more difficult and delicate work was done with an
entirely new lens, made specially for me by Messrs. Powell and
Lealand ; and which is nominally a -j^th inch lens. It was made spe
cially for this class of investigation, for which it is admirably adapted.
Its " working distance " is sufficient ; its " penetration," for such a
power, is extremely great, its angle being moderate ; and its
                                                                         " defini
tion     is as sharp and clear, when properly used, as that of the finest
^th   or   \th.    I  also had the advantage of the use of the four new
                        " new formula "
lenses made on a                           by the same makers, viz., a £th of
low angle and great penetrating power ; and a Ath, Tjth, and y^th of
high angles.       I  also used the JTth and -j^th lenses.
    One of the difficulties attending the study of this organism was its
extreme rapidity and caprice of movement.                  Its normal form is
depicted at fig. 1, Plate 8.          It is there magnified 3,000 diameters.
Its sarcode is clear, and to all the lenses employed structureless.          It is
usually    found     to  have  minute   vacuoles   scattered through it.      The
form of      the body is distinctive.         Its greater part is a long oval
slightly constricted a little above the middle.          But from the front, or
shorter portion, a kind of neck (a, fig. 1) protrudes, from which pro
ceeds the front flagellum, which is extremely fine, and from one and
a-half times to twice as long as the body.              Below this and at the
sides or
            " shoulders " of the
                                    organism, two other long and fine flagella
arise, proceeding backwards, as seen at b, c, ibid.          In addition to this,
there is always a nucleus-like body slightly to one side of the lower
part of the organism, as seen at d ; and with the higher lenses and
delicate manipulation there was frequently seen, within this, an ex-

  behind and its active anterior one, it is a very remarkable object.
  But the suddenness with which it can arrest its most rapid movement,
  or change it in any direction up, down, or directly reversed, is still
  more remarkable.       In this the flagella at the sides are brought into
 active operation; sometimes both being spread out like long arms ; at
 other times one being stretched out and in vigorous action, while the
 other is closely pressed to the other side, and so forth, giving this
 organism a control over its movements which is of extreme interest.
 Indeed the apparent volitional mastery which this seemingly structure
 less speck exercises over these equally structureless filaments, for the
 determination of its course, cannot be seen and studied without
 wonder.
    But besides this free-swimming movement, it was capable of the
 most vigorous motion in an
                                     " anchored " state. Most of the
                                                                       larger
 septic organisms belong to, or are associated with, certain conditions
 of the decomposing matter ; and disappear before the advent of other
 forms, when that condition is past.        This one was associated with the
 general breaking up of the decomposing animal matter; and the
 movement which        I  am about to describe apparently contributed to
 this.   It  was   a powerful springing motion.         The trailing flagella
 became attached to the floor as at a, b, fig. 2, by what means could
 never be discovered ; but the attachment was very secure and could
 be discontinued    at any moment.       Directly the anchorage is made, the
 two anchored flagella with the utmost rapidity coil in a spiral, as at
 e, fig. 2, bringing the body of the organism nearly to a level with the
 floor.   With equal suddenness it darts up in the line indicated by the
arrow d, and thus having reached the limits of its flagella it moves
down, with equal rapidity, in an arc of a circle of which the flagella
are the radius ; indicated by the arrow e. In this way the whole
body is brought down on the point /. But the matter to be noticed
is, that this is never done except upon a fragment of the decomposing
tissues in the infusion.      And if a small fragment be taken out at any
time and examined, it would soon be encircled by thousands of these
forms incessantly darting up and down upon it in the way described ;
and careful observation showed that they, by this means, rapidly
changed the form and diminished the size of the little particles so
attacked.     No morphological changes are at all apparent in those that

 1878.]         the  IAfe-History of a Minute Septic Organism.                       335
 are   in this condition, but they are continually freeing themselves and
 swimming away and others are constantly coming.
     The changes now to be described will be understood                to be given as
 the   result of long-continued and repeated effort.                  Failure is very
 much more frequent than success in working out the preliminary
 details, but pre-eminently so in steadily following to the end the
 changes undergone by a minute organism.*                  I merely record the final
 results, "which have issued both from the study in detail of phases in
 the life-cycle of the organism, such, for example, as the minutiae of
 the method of fission and fusion — and also from an unbroken ob
 servation of its comparatively short life-cycle, which was three times                     >
 repeated.
     Following then, steadily, a normal form, which has just freed
 itself from the springing condition, as fig. 1, the first real indication
 of change, though by no means the first to be discovered, is a splitting
 of the anterior flagellum, as seen at a and b, fig. 3, and the moving of
 the nucleus to the centre, as seen at c.            With a power of from three
 to four thousand diameters, there may also be seen a delicate line under
 the base of the flagellum,            as shown at d.        In the course of from
 thirty to sixty seconds this has widely opened and the base of the
 flagellum has divided as seen at a, fig. 4, while at the same time
 the nucleus shows an incision in the direction of its length, as seen
 at b in the same figure ; and a similar incision has commenced at the
 ]x>sterior end of the body, as shown at c.                  In a very few seconds
 more, this slight incision (c, fig. 4) is the origin of a wide opening,
 as seen at a, fig. 5, above which it will be seen that the nucleus has
iilmost divided and a pale line runs through the body-substance from
the upper to the lower opening.              The posterior opening widens much
 more rapidly than the anterior one, as fig. 6 shows, depicting a con
dition ensuing in from one minute to four minutes after that shown in
tig. 5.       And at this stage the nucleus has split into two and the
divided parts occupy distinct positions, as shown at a, b.                   The upper
or anterior split now widens as well as the posterior one, as shown in
tig. 7, leaving the two parts merely united by a neck of sarcode.
    • In  fact hundreds are followed which from one or more of many causes do not
complete    the cycle of their lives. It may be arrested — and frequently is — by deatli in
the earlier stages, in the middle, or still worse towards the end.       In the same way
tbere may be failure by the individual form being lost amidst a crowd of others, or by
                                                                             "
slowly working its way to the little ring of liquid at the edge of the cover," and
then going out into it, and so making further study impossible. Or the apparatus
may be at a ciitical moment a source of trouble ; the delicate balance between the
moisture carried over by capillarity, into the chamber containing the fluid with its
organisms, and the evaporation taking place, may by some means, such as a sudden
climge of temperature, be broken, and nullify hours of patient and, but for that,
successful work. In every such case there is but one method open — it is to begin
again de novo upon another form.

 Great vigour of movement now ensues, but of an irregular kind ; and
instead of being forward, is from side to side; when suddenly the
distance between the two parts widens, as in fig. 8, a stretched fibre of
sarcode alone uniting them.       Movement is still apparently concerted,
and is from each other, the fibre of sarcode becoming speedily thinner
until it has stretched to double the length of an ordinary trailing
flagellum ; this is shown in fig. 9 ; and in a few seconds more, by a
vigorous movement of each body in opposite directions, as the arrows
indicate, the fine filament of sarcode snaps in the middle, and two
perfect forms are thus set free by fission.
    The process is carried on with great vigour, and is apparently the
only metamorphosis to which the organism is subject. In nine separate
cases a single form was carefully followed, that is to say, a vigorous
form in each case was watched from its first act of fission ; one part of
the divided organism being constantly followed. The whole process of
division, from its visible beginning to its close, took place in from four
to seven minutes; and was recommenced during the first hour in periods
not exceeding three minutes.         For the next two hours the intervals
would be from seven to ten minutes, and after this the intervals became
indefinite, not being less than twenty nor more than forty minutes.
   Following the first separated segments, as represented by one part of
its divisions, in all its subsequent separations, as begun and carried on
by nine separate organisms in which fission happened for the first time,
the terminus of the process of fission in the last of the segment-forms in
all the cases, was death in six of the nine instances, and entire metamor
phosis in the remaining three. In the cases in which death ensued the
process of fission was continued for seven hours in one case ; six hours
in three cases ; and five-and-a-half hours in the remaining two. In
the cases in which metamorphosis took place, three hours in one case,
and four hours in the remaining two, terminated the period of fission.
There was then inaction in this last segment-form, and the appearance
indeed of the loss of vitality ; but the first indication of a difference be
tween this and the more frequent cases of vital collapse, was the rapid
" clubbing," or gathering into knots of the trailing flagella, followed by
a rapid enlargement of the nucleus, and a glittering, rapidly amoeboid
condition of the entire body. This condition is shown in fig. 10. The
changes are now very rapid : not more than seventy seconds elapse
before the trailing flagella are wholly fused with the body substance,
and while the head-and-neck-like protuberance pointed out in fig. 1,
is preserved, the body, having lost the lateral or trailing flagella,
becomes oval ; with an immensely developed nucleus, as shown in
fig. 11.    It swims now with great ease, but always merely in a
straight line, and always takes a sudden dart backwards before
changing the direction of its motion.        It may swim in this way for
from a quarter to     half  an hour ; but during this time a band of gra

1878.]        the Life-History of a Minute Septic Organism.            337
nulea is formed, at first faintly, and afterwards very distinctly, which
is shown at a, fig. 11. In this condition it swims directly into the
midst of a group of forms in the springing state shown in fig. 2,
and the utmost care is needed to keep it in view ; but as a rule not
many seconds ensue before it has firmly attached itself to one of the
springing forms, which at once unanchors itself, and both together
swim freely and vigorously about, as shown in fig. 12. They now
swim in concert for a very variable period, but generally from thirty-
five to forty-five minutes, when their movements become sluggish ; the
trailing flagella of the lower form become inert and fall upon, and be
come fused with, the mass of sarcode ; meanwhile the bodies have
rapidly been uniting, and the two nuclei become fused together, as
seen in fig. 13, while the anterior flagella become, in their extremely
sluggish movements, at last, entangled with each other, and also melt
together, as shown at 6, and all movement ceases. In the course of ten
minutes, from this condition, all trace of the separate bodies is lost, a
more or less regular oval form is taken, as shown in fig. 14 ; at the
same time a slow amoeboid disturbance of the sarcode is visible, which
 diminishes until perfect fusion results, which occurs in the course of
 twenty minutes, all trace of the nuclei having vanished ; and the oval
 gradually elongates until it roaches the tight, glossy, still condition
 shown in fig. 15.
     This, as previous experience had led me to expect, proved to be a
 cyst charged with spores. On the first occasion,      I  anticipated a long
 continuous watch ; but at the end of three hours there was a sudden
 falling in the middle of the spindle-shaped sac, and a general altera
 tion of form, which led me to earnest effort to discover some discharge.
 And that it was taking place there could be no doubt, for there was a
 rapid diminution in the size of the sac ; and there were apparent frac
 tures in the delicate investing membrane ; but nothing more than
 cloudiness at the ends could then be made out. I was using the -rsth
 new formula lens (dry), and exhausted all expedients, in vain, to make
 out the real cause of the change ; and as it is hopeless to attempt to
 change a lens successfully under such circumstances, there was nothing
 to be done but await another opportunity ; using another lens. This
 ^th had proved of great value throughout in the detection of minute
 structure and change of form ; but the kind of illumination which
 best reveals extremely minute semi-opaque bodies, is the perfect central
 illumination which      I have endeavoured to describe in the "Monthly
  Microscopical   Journal,"   vol. xv, page 165. That is to say, the illu
  mination of the whole field through a circular aperture in the dia
  phragm from the ^V*h to the y^sth of an inch in diameter, through
  the centre of which aperture the optical axis of the sub-stage con
  denser, if continued, would pass. But for this special method the new
  -Jsth is not so efficient in my hands as the -s^th, ^yth, or , jth.

 338                    Rev. W. H. Dallinger on                   [May   2,
    Having, therefore, ultimately secured another    sac, I determined   to
nse the -^yth, as being, as I believed, the most suitable lens for the
pnrpose.    In the still condition of the sac, ample time was given for
the most delicate adjustment of the light and of the lens, and the
watching was begun under the best conditions.
   Not the slightest movement, either within or without, is visible while
the cyst is in this condition ; and the time over which this inactivity
extended was never less than three hours, nor more than five hours, in
the eight separate instances which    I studied.  In the second instance
the length of  time  which  elapsed was four hours.    At the end of that
time, without reason discoverable at the moment, there was as before a
falling in of the centre of the cyst, and an irregularity in its shape,
with a visible and rapid diminution in size. At first nothing but a
cloudiness at the two ends could be discovered ; but, by a little delicate
adjustment of light and lens there became distinctly visible an outflow,
from the two ends and tho middle of the cyst, of the most exquisitely
minute particles which I have ever seen ; and as the quantity flowing
out diminished, their segregation became more complete, and their
clearness and independence more manifest.
   The nature of the "continuous stage" — which keeps the drop of
fluid under examination from evaporating — is such as to compel the
use of the microscope in an upright condition, in order that the stage
of the instrument may be perfectly horizontal. On this account the
          "                "
ordinary camera lucida is of no avail, or only of use by special and
difficult arrangements ; but a beautiful little instrument, made by
M. Nachet, of Paris, specially meets this emergency, and enables us to
make camera lucida drawings with great ease and accuracy.           I had,
therefore, by anticipation, arranged this apparatus : and when the out
flow had continued for about five minutes, made a drawing of the cyst,
of which fig. 16, Plate 9, is an accurate copy.        As, of course, the
minute particles were in rapid movement of outflow, they were put
into the drawing, not with camera lucida, but subsequently ; and they
accurately represent what was seen at the time.        The emission con
tinued for about forty minutes, becoming more and more feeble, until
at last there was no more movement.       At this stage there were many
of these minute particles well segregated round the ends of what re
mained of the cyst ; and then   I was able, not only to make a drawing
of the delicate white film of the cyst, but to indicate by fine dots the
relative appearance of the cyst and the still particles.    This drawing
is reproduced at fig. 17.
   The entire details of the subsequent history of these minute bodies
were of course only made out by several successive and continuous
observations on the emissions of different cysts.      But, in each case,
the lens was fixed upon some of the minute bodies that remained
near the exhausted cyst, and then the observation was unbroken

1878.]        the   Life-History of a Minute Septic Organism,        339
and continuous to the end.         When first seen, these exquisitely
minute specks are strongly opaque ; but as they are attentively
watched with a magnification of 5,000 diameters, they, in the course
of from twenty to forty minutes, become quite clear, and would be
much more difficult to find in this condition than when first poured
out. But, following upon this, there is a distinct elongation, which is
indicated at fig. 18, and this proceeds so that, at the end of an hour
and a half, they were in the shape and relative size shown at fig. 19.
    On the first and second occasion on which the observations were
made, very little was made out, except the succession of the meta
morphoses ; but on subsequent occasions, when a careful scrutiny for
the discovery of delicate changes was made, the clear, sharp, defining
power of the new xfth objective was of great service ; by its means     I
was enabled to discover the first indication of the origin of the anterior
and lateral flagella in the developing germ. At the end of an hour and
a half after emission from the sac, the long oval form which the germ
had taken (indicated at fig. 19) was always associated with a sharpen
ing at one end. This became rapidly sharper and longer, as seen in
fig. 20, at 4 and 6. This always developed into the anterior flagellum.
But at about the same time— generally about two hours after emission
from the cyst — there were pushed out two delicate points of sarcode
laterally, and at right angles to the beak in front; 1, 2, 3, 5, fig. 19,
are copies of camera drawings of this condition in the minute germi
 nating body ; and the extremely delicate lateral points were found by
close watching to develop into the lateral flagella of the perfect form.
 The growth was now much more rapid ; fig. 21 represents the changes
 that had taken place in forty minutes after the condition depicted in
 fig. 20. And now slight movements began in some of the better de
 veloped forms, such as a, fig. 21. They were not changes of place,
 but movements of the lateral and anterior flagella, and occasionally a
 change of the direction in which the bodies lay.        In the course of
 another hour the neck-like protrusion at the base of the anterior
 flagellum generally appeared as shown in a, b, fig. 22, and very soon —
 in every instance less than a quarter of an hour after — short move
 ments of translation begin, which resulted in ten minutes more, in
 graceful swimming. Fig. 23 is a copy of a drawing made of one of
 these forms that had reached the condition the drawing depicts in
a little over four hours from the time of emission from the sac. It was
then the ^      th of an inch in long diameter, just one- half the size of

              0
the adult ;   but   itwas perfect in form, even to the possession of    a
nucleus, and swam with freedom and grace. Its increase of size from
 this time was even more rapid, for in the course of another hour       it
 had passed through the size and condition seen         in fig. 24, to the
 normal parental size depicted in fig. 25. And
                                                 it if,
                                                     afterit  had reached
 this state,  itwere still persistently followed,    might be in ten or

fifteen minutes, but certainly within an hour, the first signs of fission
would show themselves, as indicated in a, b, c, d, fig. 25 ; and from that
time fission, in successively separated individuals, continued in active
progress for hours, as before described.
    Thus the life-cycle was completely made out.
    It may be noticed : —
    1. That the method of fission is both delicate and complex, being
not merely a separation into two parts of a particle of living proto
plasm, but a division of distinct organs, such as nuclens and flagellum.
    2. That the transformation of the individual form, at the terminus
of a series of fissions, into an apparently new organism, prior to genetic
blending (as shown in figs. 10, 11, Plate 8), is remarkable.      And
    3. That the life-cycle of this form is rigid, and marked by no caprice.
It passes  regularly through the same metamorphoses.         If seen in any
given state, it could be positively affirmed through what stages it had
passed, and through what remaining stages it must subsequently pass,
to reach the adult condition.
    It now remained to determine whether the spore, or germinal par
ticles, emitted by the sac, possessed any capacity to resist the action of
heat not possessed by the fully developed form.
    It was first carefully determined, by a method to be presently de
scribed, that the adult organism never survived after exposure for five
minutes to a temperature of 142° F.
    For determining the amount of heat resistance possessed by this
spore, two methods were employed : —
    1. The ordinary three by one inch slips of glass, used for micro
scopical purposes, were cut into three pieces, each of which was thus an
                                                               "
inch square. These could be put into and worked with the continuous
stage." The septic fluid containing the organism was placed upon it, and
covered in the usual way with the thinnest covering glass. It was then
 watched with suitable lenses until, either in that or in some successive
 drop of the fluid, a cyst was seen to pour out its spores, as in fig. 16,
 Plate 9.    It was then at once taken and placed in a small brass
chamber, into the middle of which the bulb of a delicate thermometer
was fixed, the tube fitting air-tight into the cover of the chamber, and
the expansion of the mercury being read off outside.
    The small square of glass containing the fluid and spores was placed,
as it came from the stage of the microscope, in the- middle of the
 chamber.    The chamber was then closed, and heat so applied as to
 slowly raise the temperature of the air within. In half an hour it had
 reached the temperature I desired, which was 210° F.; and the chamber
 was kept accurately at this point for ten minutes.
    The square of glass was then taken out, cooled, and examined, and,
 of course, to the lens presented a dry amorphous aspect.
                                                           "              "
    Previously some of the fine capillary tubes known as vaccine tubes

 1878.]          the   Life-History of a Minute Septic Organism.             341
had been     filled with water, to which a little filtered fowl broth was
added      asnutriment. These tubes were then hermetically sealed, and
heated     up to 310° F. in a digester.     These were kept in absolute
alcohol,   so that the outsides of the tubes might not contract dust, and
so   forth.
     The contents of these tubes were now used to remoisten          the dried
film beneath the cover-glass.            The ends of the tubes were broken   off,
and by capillarity the fluid was drawn beneath the cover, at the edge
of which the now open end of one or more of the tubes was applied.
In this way     plentiful supply of moisture was given.
                  a
    It was now placed again in the " continuous stage " and examined.
 At the end of four to five hours the fluid film looked almost every
 where clear, and as it appeared before heating ; but I was not able by
any method I employed to discover the minnte spores, nor could I find
in this one the earlier stages of development ; but at the end of seven
hoars, while
               " searching " with a low angled
                                                   -rVth inch objective,        I
saw three forms in about the state of development shown in fig. 23,
Plate 9 ; and in the course of another hour a great increase in their
number had taken place, and in three separate instances they were
followed from the time they were first seen into full development and
the commencement of fission.
   When more cysts were found this entire process was again repeated
twice at the same temperature, and at the expiration of ten and eleven
honrs respectively adult forms in full activity were found ; and in the
latter of these two instances        I
                                 discovered the organism when it was in
the still condition of development, represented in figs. 20 and 22,
Plate 9.    It was thus manifest that by this method of heating a tem
perature of 210° F. could be completely resisted.
   Following the above process in every particular,            I
                                                             next, as they
could be found, subjected the spores to 260° F.            I
                                                         did this on three
glass squares (as before) in succession.      But in no one of these did
the organism reappear, although examination was repeatedly and care
fully made for five days.
   It thus appeared that a temperature of 260° F. applied in this way
was fatal to the form, for on taking a needle-point of the septic fluid
containing the organism in abundance, and, touching the edge of the
flnid with      it,
                 found that in the course of four or five hours there were
                 I
hundreds swimming in full vigour, showing that the fluid was capable
of sustaining the organism,        were in a vital condition in the fluid.
                                  if

contents of two separate cysts.    In the one case, after ten hours, there
was a re-appearance of the living organism, but only two or three
adults could be then found and the increase that afterwards ensued
                                 ;
was dependent upon fission, for no small forms could be seen.        In the
other case, there was rather a larger number of adults at the end of

between nine and ten hours, but their number was far fewer than in
those instances where a lower temperature had been employed.
  I followed this with four more experiments, separately and succes
sively made. Two of them were at a temperature of 248°, and two at
252° F. In both of the former, at the end of nine or ten hours, the
complete organism in full vigour could be seen ; and, in one of the cases,
it was discovered in the still condition shown at fig. 20, Plate 9, and
watched until the organisms had attained the condition indicated in
fig. 24, Plate 3.
   But in the two latter instances (heated up to 252°) the living form
did not re-appear during the six days following, although repeatedly
looked for.
  I   concluded, therefore, that the temperature of 250° F. was the
limit of endurance which the spore of this form could bear by this
method of heating.
   Now, it must be noticed that in testing the death-point of the
adult, as I shall presently show, a fluid heat was employed.        But the
spore   can hardly  be said hitherto to have  been heated  in the same con
ditions.    Doubtless, in the heating chamber the higher temperatures
 are endured after evaporation, and consequently the heat is "dry."
 But after years of thought on the matter, no other way has suggested
itself to me as possible, for the attaining of the result, by other means.
 What is required       is,
                        that we should know beforehand, that in the drop
 of fluid exposed to a given heat, the spores of a given organism in a
freshly emitted condition, and, therefore, before development had begun,
 were present.     And, moreover, that     shonld be so placed that after
                                           it
 heating   itshould be in such conditions as would admit of the use of
 the highest power lenses to discover      the spores, known to have been
                                          if
 deposited there, would, after subjection to the thermal conditions
given, develop as they had been demonstrated to do before heating.
   Now, there are two ways of doing this. The one        approximate.
                                                                   is

                         is

                    must be extremely perplexing. The other way

the certainty and the uniformity of results must depend upon the
certainty we possess, as to whether the spores were in the fluid before
heating or not.       And when we remember that the phenomenon of

   My plan was to arrange the form of the vessel in which the fluid was

means of extremely delicate glass blowing.       The apparatus       pre                  is

and this tube terminates      in a delicate closed and flattened cell C. In
a microscopical point of view this cell is the most important part of
the apparatus.     It is a flattened bulb, and its upper and under walls
are films of glass, varying in different pieces of the apparatus from
the ^th to the j-5Tj*h of an inch in thickness ; and the space between
these walls may vary from the -^th. to the ,-gTyth of an inch in depth.
   We thus have a perfect cell, completely closed, the contents of
which can readily be studied with the aid of the most powerfnl lenses.
The walls of the cell are of course not as absolutely even and smooth
as the thin
               "                    "
                 covering glass        usually employed with high power
lenses : but it is in the majority of cases beautifully level and clear,
when the manner of its production is remembered.                Of course I
should never have employed these cells for the purpose of discovering
delicate and unknown details ; but they answer admirably for deter
mining the presence or absence of phenomena, the nature of which is
well known beforehand.
   It i3 manifest then, that if a fluid be put in the bulb and stand at
the level of the dotted line A, that it will fill and be in communication

fluid, inoculating it.    In relation to the particular organism now
being considered, this, however, was not required.
   The first important matter to be taken into account was the death
point of the adult. A piece of apparatus similar to fig. 26 was used.

1878.J          the Life-History of a Minute Septic Organism.          345
When the fluid containing the organism was inserted, a large number
of the      organisms was seen by the lens in the cell C.       The whole
apparatus was now placed in a copper vessel with cold water, the
water just covering the bnlb A, and a thermometer was placed in the
water. A Bunsen's burner was used for heating, which had minute
jets springing from a tube bent in the form of a parallelogram, corre
sponding to the form of the vessel. The heat was now applied, so
that the water rose in temperature with extreme slowness. It was
taken out directly the thermometer read 100° F., and at once examined.
 Several of the organisms were at once visible : but the great majority
 of them were quite still, and the only movement discoverable was a
 more or less languid movement of flagella, the bodies being motion
 less. In seven minutes a form sailed slowly across the field, but          I
 preferred to keep my attention fixed on those which I had seen from
 the first. In the course of three-quarters of an hour the flagella of ten
 forms were all vigorously working, and the bodies began to move, and
 in an hour and a- half from the time of being taken out, the whole field
 was     as active as before heating.
      In  the same manner the fluid was next raised to 130° F. On exami
 nation the immediate effect was more marked, the inaction more com
 plete.      Only one flagellum was seen to move in the whole field. But
  in   the course of half an hour the flagella were gently swaying, and in
  two    hours the same individuals were swimming freely.
      When, however, the fluid was raised to 140° F., the inaction was
  absolute when the cell was first examined, and only one-fourth of the
  individuals in a selected field revived.     These did so in the course of
  three hours, but the remainder did not move to the end of the day,
  and were in the same position and inactive on the morrow ; and it was
  snbsequently shown, by the same means, that a temperature of 142° F.
  was entirely destructive of the vitality of the adult.
      The next step was to ascertain the effect of the boiling point upon
   the spores.
       To be quite sure that spores, in the condition required, were in the
   fluid, a thin circle of glass was cut that would lie upon and take the
                                       "
   place of the ordinary floor of the continuous stage." By this means
   if a deposit of spores were seen to take place, it could be readily re
   moved bodily from the microscope.      On the under surface of this circle
   of glass a few lines with the diamond were made, in convenient places,
   to facilitate its subsequent fracture. On this then, in the stage, pro
   perly covered as usual, the fluid was hunted and watched, and fresh
   drops taken until a cyst was seen, and then watched until it burst.
   The circle of glass on which this happened was now taken carefully
   away from the microscope and broken, so that the pieces containing the
   fluid drop fell into the funnel B, fig. 26. The fluid containing the
   organism in abundance was now poured over these down the tube and

  34G                    Rev. W. H. Dallinger on                   [May 2,
 into the bulb A, carrying with it the fluid on the fragments of glass
 which contained the just emitted spore. Thus it was known that
 spores in the condition required were actually in the apparatus.
     The whole was now placed in a suitable vessel with solid white
 paraffin, which was slowly melted, covering when in a fluid state the
 whole bulb A. The heating of the paraffin was extremely gentle, and
 it was raised as much above the boiling point of water as was con
 sistent with a gentle ebullition of the infusion A. This was continued
 for ten minutes.     The tube  J was then hermetically closed before the
 ebullition had ceased, and was removed from the paraffin and carefully
 wiped while hot.     The piece of platinum H was now shaken sharply
 upon the septum F, and the calcined air contained in E was admitted
 into the bulb A, the platinum remaining on the top of the passage G,
 which was too small to admit of its entrance into A. In this way the
 normal conditions of the infusion were as far as possible restored.
     The cell C was now fixed upon the stage of the microscope, and
 could be carefully examined with the most suitable lenses ; and from
 the fact that the cell was closed,
                                         " immersion " lenses could be em
 ployed, which gave an advantage in working.
    I first employed an immersion ^th. But nothing was at all visible
 but Brownian movement, and during the next seven hours no trace of
 the organism could be found.        The whole was now left for six hours
 more, and then the entire cell was carefully
                                                  " searched " with an im
 mersion Tjth.     At the close of an hour and a half three of the organ
 isms, one in the adult condition, and two in the semi-developed state
 shown in fig. 24, were found swimming freely ; and in the course of
 the next few hours the cell was freely visited by the organism in full
 vigour.
    The length of time that elapsed before the organism appeared in
 the cell,  I presumed to be explicable by the fact, that it took a con
 siderable time for it to arise, in sufficient quantity, in the reservoir A
to render it probable that it would migrate into the cell C ; and this
supposition was sustained by subsequent facts.
    It was clear, then, that 212° F. was a temperature not destructive of
the germ when endured in a fluid condition.
    To reach higher temperatures it was, of course, needful to employ a
digester.     For this purpose tubes alone were employed, which were
terminated in the cell C, fig. 26, but the bulb A and all its appendages
were dispensed with ; the tube D, for example, terminating at one end
in the delicate cell C as before, but at the opposite end in the place
of A was a simple funnel for the delivery of the infusion into D.
When the spore in the required condition had been found and placed
in the funnel as before described, the fluid was inserted as before, and
the tube was then hermetically sealed.
    It was now placed in a small digester, with a register for pressures.

  and heated np to the temperatare of             240° F., 10° F. below the death-
  point    in  the  dry condition.      It was kept at this for five minutes.
     As soon as it coold be conveniently taken from the digester it was
                    " cradle " on the stage of the
  placed in a                                           microscope.    Nothing but
  violent Brownian movement was visible anywhere ; and nothing more
  than this could be seen by the end of twelve hoars, although the search
  was very strict and systematic. For the next twenty-four hours no
  other result ensued, and at the end of six days there was no trace of
  the organism. The question now arose as to whether any incapacity
  to sustain the organism had been superinduced.              For this purpose the
  tube was opened        at its  sealed  end, and a small piece of platinum wire
  which had been immersed in the fluid containing the living organism,
  was dropped into it. It was then sealed again and examined. In
 the course of twenty minutes seven of the introduced organisms were
 seen, and in the next two days they were present in great abundance.
     It  thus became manifest that the previons sterility of the fluid in
 the cell was due to the destruction of the germs, or spores, by the heat
 to which the infusion had been subject.
    Another tube was now taken, and after preparation in all respects
 in the same way, was heated in the digester to 230° F., and kept at
 that for     five minutes.
    The result was precisely the same as in the preceding instance.
 There was no trace of the living organism from the first, on to the
end of a week. But in this case also, inoculation reintroduced it
successfully, and it flourished.
    I now determined         that 220° F. should be tried; and after the tube
and     its   contents   had    been arranged as before, it was heated to that
point, and kept in that condition for five minutes.
    When first examined with a suitable lens, as before, nothing but            the
well-known Brownian movement was visible.                 And this remained true
for the first five hours, although the whole cell was carefully examined
with the new formula .^th and xfth inch objective, and repeatedly
" searched       " with the £th.      But during the sixth hour     I  became con
vinced that the organism in a developing                condition was present ; it
was in a part of the cell immediately under the tube ;            and in the course
of a few minutes I was perfectly satisfied that the               organism   in the
condition represented at fig. 22 was there, but only five could be seen ;
these, however, increased in size as usual, and in the course of forty
minutes three of them began gracefully to move, and following one of
them I saw it attain to the usual adult condition. The next day the
cell had scores of the organisms swimming in it.
    This    experiment was now repeated, every detail of preparation being
as before.        The results were similar ; that is to say, the living organism
reappeared ; but it was not found until the seventh hour, and then it
was freely swimming and in an almost perfect condition.                 But I could

not at this time find more than this one ; but in the course of some
hours several more were present, perhaps as the result of fission.
  From this it appeared plain that the spores had survived a tempera
ture of 220°    F. in a fluid heat          :       of subsequent tests
                                                but by      a series
conducted jn precisely the same way, I found that if 220° F. might
not be considered the limit of temperature which the spore could
survive, at least this organism never showed itself again after heating
the spore to 222° F.
   It thus appears that in this particular organism the dry heat is
considerably less destructive of the vitality of the spores than the
moist heat.   That there         is,
                             indeed,   difference of 28u or 29° F. or,
                                                 a                                ;
speaking broadly, we might say 30° F.
  This is undoubtedly a difference of considerable importance.      But               a
temperature  of 220° F. resisted successfully at all, implies of necessity
actual protection of some kind.         shall not attempt to theorize upon
                                            I
or suggest what that may be but        ;       manifestly not beyond the
                                                  it   is
reach of chemical and physical science to approximate to an explana
tion, whilst biological science furnishes analogy in higher and more
 complex departments of its researches.          One thing             is
                                                                 absolutely
certain;   which is, that the optical condition of the freshly emitted
spore  is  quite distinct from that which          presents in from three-
                                                            it
quarters of an hour to an hour after development has commenced.           It
is  to the comparative opacity of the newly emitted germs that their
visibility at that time     isdue. Hence they are most certainly dis
 covered by means of a shaft of aln ost parallel light the -j-J^ of an
inch in diameter at right angles to the plane on which the spores are
lying, and their imperfect transmission of this reveals them. But in
the course of an hour they become far more transparent than even the
adult form.     This isundoubtedly the result of the vital processes in
volved in germination. The sarcode         in a fluid condition and cannot
                                                  is
resist the heat that surrounds — a constant current of liquid must be
                                       it
passing in and out of the sarcode by imbibition and exosmosis.          The
result must be the circulation through the sarcode of fluid at a tempe
rature destructive of the vital processes. Hence the destruction of
the adult at 142° F., and there can be little doubt but the young
germinating form would be destroyed, for the same reasons, at the
same or — perhaps from the probably greater intensity of the vital
processes — even a lower temperature.        But in the spore, the vital
activities of the developing protoplasm have not commenced               the      ;
sarcode    isin all probability in a fixed state and a protective condi

                                     whose Life-Histories were worked out by
 Dr. Drysdale and myself, as          I  have been enabled to get again during
 the last two years,       I have been able to satisfy myself that 30° F. is by
no means the fixed difference between the power                    of thermal resistance
 possessed    by the spores of these forms when heated in a dry and a
moist condition. There is considerable variety in this matter, and
variety which in all probability, nothing but a perfect acquaintance
with the vicissitudes        through which by adaptation they have survived
in their evolutional history, could explain.
   In conclusion, without entering into details,                    I  may observe that
these forms have, as far as my observations have extended, a far
greater capacity to resist heat than the bacteria ; but their distribution
is far more limited.

      No. II. Received March 26, 1878.
   Since our last communication to the Society we have succeeded in
reversing characteristic lines of the vapours of rubidium and caesium.
Considering the known volatility of these elements, and the small
quantity of their compounds at our disposal, we thought                better to
                                                                           it
try the effects first in glass tubes. For this purpose           piece of corn-
                                                                       a
bastion tubing had one end drawn out and the end turned up sharply,
and sealed off (like an ill-made combustion tube of the usual form) so
as to produce an approximately plane face at the end of the tube a                  ;
small bulb was then blown at about an inch from the end, and the
tube drawn out at about an inch from the bulb on the other side, so as
to form  a long narrower tube. Some dry rubidium or caesium chlo
ride was next introduced into the bulb, and              afragment of fresh cut
sodium, and    the  narrow   part  of  the  tube turned up, so as to allow the
tube and bulb to be seen through in the direction of the axis of the tube.
The open end was then attached to            a  Sprengel pnmp, and the air ex
hausted  ;  the sodium was then melted, and afterwards either dry
hydrogen or dry nitrogen admitted, and the end of the tube sealed off
at nearly the atmospheric pressure.           We found        necessary to have
                                                             it
this pressure    of  gas  inside   the   tube,  otherwise  the metal distilled so
fast on heating       that the ends were speedily obscured by condensed
                        it
drops of  metal.     Through these tubes placed lengthways in front of a
spectroscope, a lime light was viewed.             On warming the bulb of a
tube  in which    rubidium    chloride   had   been sealed up with sodium, the
D lines were of course very soon seen, and very soon there appeared two
dark lines near the extremity of the violet light, which, on measure

 ment, were found to be identical    in position with the well-known violet
 lines of rubidium. Next appeared faintly the channelled spectrum of
 sodium in the green, and then a dark line in the blue, very sharp and
decided, in the place of the more refrangible of the characteristic lines
of   caesium  in the flame spectrum.   As the temperature rose these dark
lines, especially those in the violet, became sensibly broader ; and then
another fine dark line appeared in the blue, in the place of the less refran
gible of the caesium blue lines.      During this time no dark line could
be observed in the red, but as the temperature rose a broad absorption
band appeared in the red, with its centre about midway between B
and C, ill-defined at the edges, and though plainly visible not very dark.
The lines in the violet had now become so broad as to touch each other
and form one dark band.        On cooling, the absorption band in the red
became gradually lighter without becoming defined, and was finally
overpowered by the channelled spectrum of sodium in that region.
The double dark line in the violet became sharply defined again as the
temperature fell. There are two blue lines in the spectrum of rubidium
taken with an induction-coil very near the two blue lines of caesium,
but they are comparatively feeble, and the two dark lines in the blue
which we observed in the places of the characteristic blue lines of
caesium we believe must have been due to a small quantity of caesium
chloride in the sample of rubidium chloride.          These blue lines were
not, however, visible when some of the rubidium chloride was held in
the flame of a Bunsen's burner, nor when a spark was taken from a
solution of the chloride; but the more refrangible of them (Csa) was
visible in the spark of an induction-coil, without a Leyden jar, taken
between beads of the rubidium chloride fused on platinum wires.
    When a tube containing caesium chloride and sodium was observed,
in the same way as the former, the two dark lines in the blue were
seen very soon after the heating began, and the more refrangible of
them broadened out very sensibly as the temperature increased.           The
usual channelled spectrum of sodium was seen in the green, and an
additional channelling appeared in the yellow, which may be due to
ctesium or to the mixture of the two metals.         We have at present no
metallic caesium wherewith to decide this question.      Indeed the caesium
chloride used was not free from rubidium, and the dark lines of
rubidium were distinctly seen in the violet.
    It is remarkable that these absorption lines of caesium coincide
with the blue lines of caBsinm as seen in the flame, not with the green
line which that metal shows when heated in an electric spark of high
density.     It is to be observed, however, that when sparks from an
induction-coil without a jar are taken between beads of caesium chlo
ride, fused on platinum wires, a spectrum similar to the flame spectrum
is seen, and it is only when a Leyden jar is used that the spectrum is
reduced to a green line.         In like manner both the violet lines of

352                     Profs. Liveing and Dewar                            [May 2.
rubidium are reversed in our tubes, and both these violet lines are seen
when the spark of an induction-coil, without jar, is passed between
beads of rubidium chloride fused on platinum wire, though only one of
them appears when a Leyden jar is used.
    We have not repeated these observations          on caesium     and rubidium
in iron tubes, because the light emitted from the hot iron does not
extend so far into the violet as the rubidium lines, and the amount of
caesium at our command at present is very small.
    We have extended our observations on the absorption of magnesium
and of mixtures of magnesium with potassium and sodium, using iron
tubes placed vertically in a small furnace fed with Welsh coal, as
described in our former communication.
    The result of several observations, when commercial magnesium
 (i.e., maernesium with only a small percentage of sodium in it) was
used, is that the absorption produced by magnesium consists of —
     (1.) Two sharp lines in the green, of which one, which is broader
than the other, and appears to broaden as the temperature increases,
coincides in position with the least refrangible of the b group, while
the other is less refrangible, and has a wave length very nearly 5,210.
These lines are the first and the last to be seen and very constant,
and we at first took them for the extreme lines of the b group.*
    (2.)  A dark line in      the blue, always more or less broad, difficult
to measure exactly,       but very near the place of the brightest blue
line of magnesium.         This line was not always visible, indeed rarely
when magnesium alone was placed in the tube.                  It was better seen
when a small quantity of potassium was added.                The measure of the
less refrangible edge of this band then gave a wave length of very
 nearly 4,615. It was also seen when sodium and magnesium were
 used together, but it was more difficult to get a measure of it in this
case, as the sodium obscures the blue part of the spectrum. A measure
 taken when sodium was used gave a wave length 4,580, but this can
 only be regarded as an approximation.
     (3.) A third line or band in the green rather more refrangible
 than the 6 group.          This is best seen when potassium as well as
 magnesium is introduced into the tube, but it may also be seen with
 sodium and magnesium.          The less refrangible edge of this band is
 sharply defined, and has a wave length about 5,140, and it fades away
 towards the blue.
     These absorptions are all seen both when potassium and when sodium
 are used along with magnesium, and may be fairly ascribed to mag
 nesium, or to magnesium together with hydrogen.
     But besides these, other absorptions are seen which appear to be due
 to mixed vapours.
           • On one occasion a dark line corresponding to bi was also seen.

 1878.]     on the  Reversal of the Lines of Metallic    Vapours.       353
    (4.) When sodium and magnesium are used together a dark line,
 with ill-defined edges, is seen in the green, with a wave length about
 5,300.   This is the characteristic absorption of the mixed vapours of
 sodium and magnesium, it is not seen with either vapour separately,
nor is it seen when potassium is used instead of sodium.
    (5.) When potassium and magnesium .are used together, a pair of
 dark lines are seen in the red.    The less refrangible of these sometimes
broadens    into a band with ill-defined edges, and has a mean wave
length   of about  6,580. The other is always a fine sharp line, with a
wave length about 6,475.      These lines are as regularly seen with the
mixture of potassium and magnesium as the above-mentioned line
 (5,300) is seen with the mixture of sodium and magnesium, but are
not seen except with that mixture.
    (6.) On one occasion, with a mixture of potassium and magnesium,
another dark line was seen in the blue, with a wave length nearly
4,820.    This line is very near one of the bright lines, seen when sparks
from an induction-coil, without a Leyden jar, are taken between
electrodes of magnesium, and may very likely be due to magnesium
alone, and not to the mixture of vapours, as we only observed it on
one occasion.
   There is a certain resemblance         between   the  absorptions above
ascribed to magnesium, and the emission           spectrum seen when the
sparks of a small induction-coil, without Leyden jar, are taken be
tween electrodes of magnesium.        This emission spectrum is the same,
with the addition of some blue lines, as that seen when the sparks are
taken from a solution of magnesium chloride, as accurately described
by Lecoq de Boisbaudran {Spectres lumineux, p. 86), and as that seen
in burning magnesium (Dr. W. M. Watts, Phil. Mag., 1875), and
consists, as we have observed, of lines with the following wave
lengths :— 4,481, 4,590 (Thalen 4,586), 4,570 (Thalen 4,565), 4,797,
4,930, 4,945, 4,957,4,969, 4,980, 4,990, 5,000, the well-known 6 group,
and 5,528 (Thalen).
     The pair of lines (1) correspond nearly with the 6 group, but
slightly displaced towards the red ; the shaded band (3) corresponds
less closely to the series of seven lines 5,000 to 4,930, which pro
gressively decrease in brightness towards the blue, and is also a little
less refrangible than that series ; the broad line in the blue (2) cor
responds to the pair of lines 4,570 and 4,590 ; and the remaining line
(6) with the line 4,797, also both displaced a little towards the red.
No absorption corresponding to the extreme lines 4,481 and 5,528 was
observed.     There is plainly no exact reversal except of the line blt and
even in that case it may be an accident if we suppose the two dark
lines (1) to represent the extreme line of the group b. It may be
noted in connexion with this that the absorption lines described by us
in our former communication as seen with sodium and potassium

  than, well-known emission lines of those elements.
      The absorptions produced by the mixtures of vapours plainly offer
  a wide field for further observation. At present we have not succeeded
 in observing those produced by mixtures of vapours other than those
 here recorded ; and it seems needful to use tubes of a less fusible
 material than iron, which, notwithstanding the protection of fire
 clay, very quickly gives way at the temperatures we have used.
     With regard to those above described, we may observe that there
 is in the solar spectrum an absorption line, hitherto unaccounted for,
 closely corresponding to each of them.           Thus, on Angstrom and
 Thalen's map there are dark lines at 6,580 and 6,585, with more or
 less continuous absorption between them, a broad dark line between
 t'!,474 and 6,475, and a dark line at 5,300.    There are also dark lines
 nearly, if not exactly, coincident with the series of seven bright lines
 of magnesium above described, which we have not seen strictly re
 versed.     The coincidences of the series of the solar spectrum hitherto
 observed have, for the most part, been with lines given by dense
 electric sparks ; while it is not improbable that the conditions of tem
 perature, and the admixtures of vapours in the upper part of the solar
 atmosphere, may resemble much more nearly those in our tubes.
     We intend to pursue our observations, using higher temperatures,
if we can obtain tubes which will stand under those circnmstances.

        By Professor James Dewar, F.R.S.. Jacksonian Professor
        University of Cambridge.       Received March 20, 1878.
     Edmond Becquerel, in the year 1839, opened up a new field of
chemical research through the discovery that electric currents may be
developed during the production of chemical inter-actions excited by
solar agency.
     Hunt, in the year    1840, repeated, with many modifications,     Bec-
qnerel's experiments,    and confirmed his results.
     Grove, in 1858, examined the influence of light on the polarized
electrode, and concluded that the effect of light was simply an
augmentation     of the chemical action taking place at the surface of the
electrodes.
    Becquerel, in his well-known work, " La Lumiere," published in
1868, gives details regarding the construction of an electro-chemical
actinometer formed by coating plates of silver with a thin film of the
sub-chloride, and subsequent heating for many hours to a temperature
of 150° C.
    EgerofT,  in 1877,   suggested   the  use of   a double  apparatus   of

  1878.]             Experiments in Electro Photometry.                   355
  Becquerel's form, acting as a differential combination, the plates of
  silver being coated with iodide instead of chloride.
     The modifications of the halogen salts of silver when subjected to
 the action of light have up to the present time been used most success
 fully in the production of electric currents, and although mixtnres of
 photographically sensitive salts have been shown by Smee to produce
 currents of a similar kind, yet no attempt has been made to examine
 the proper form of instrument required for the general investigation
 of the electrical actions induced by light on fluid substances.
     This subject has occupied my attention for some time, and the com
 pleted investigation I hope to present to the Society.         In the mean
 time the following description will give an idea of the method of in
 vestigation.
     A little consideration shows that the amount of current produced by
 a definite intensity and quality of light acting during a short period of
 time on a given sensitive substance in solution, is primarily a function
 of the nature, form, and position of the poles in the cell relatively to
the   direction in which the light enters, and the selective absorption,
concentration, and conductivity of the fluid.
     The diffusive action taking place in such cells complicates the effects
and is especially intricate when insoluble substances are formed.          In
order to simplify the investigation in the first instance, poles that are
not chemically acted upon, and a sensitive          substance yielding only
soluble products on the action of light, were employed.              For this
purpose platinum poles and chlorous acid or peroxde of chlorine were
selected.
    The best form of cell had one of the poles made of fine platinum
wire fixed as closely as possible to the inner surface where the light
enters, the other pole being made of thicker wire placed deeper in the
fluid.
    As the action is confined to a very fine film where the light enters,
the maximum       amount of current is obtained when the composition of
the fluid is modified deep enough to isolate temporarily the front pole
in the modified medium.        Under these conditions the formation of
local   currents is avoided, and the maximum        electromotive   force ob
tained.
    In cells of this construction the amount of current is independent
of the surface of the fluid acted upon by light, so that a mere slit
sufficient to expose the front poles acts as efficiently as a larger surface.
This prevents the unnecessary exhaustion of material and enables the
cell to be made of very     small dimensions.    By means of such an ap
paratus the chemical actions of light and their electrical relations
may be traced in many new directions.
    The amount and direction of the current in the case of chlorous
acid is readily modified by the addition of certain salts and acids, and.

356       Mr. G. M. Whipple on       the Determination   of the    [May 2,
thus electrical variations may be produced, resembling the effects
observed during the action of light on the eye.
   Certain modifications taking place in the chlorous acid by exposure
to light increase its sensibility, and as a general result it is found that
the fluid through these alterations increases in resistance.       We have
thus an anomalous kind of battery where the available electromotive
force increases with the resistance.    The addition of neutral substances
which increase the resistance without producing new decompositions
improves the action of the cell.
   Care has to be taken in these experiments to use the same apparatus
in a series of comparative experiments, as infinitesimal differences in
the contact of the active pole render it difficult to make two instru
ments giving exactly the same results.       Cells have been constructed
with two, three, and four poles, and their individual and combined
action examined.      Quartz surfaces have also been employed instead
of glass, thus enabling the chemical opacity of different substances to
be determined.
   The electrical currents derived through the action of light on definite
salts  are strong in the case of ferro- and ferri-cyanide of potassium,
but remarkably so in the case of nitroprusside of sodium.
   Of organic acids the tartrate of uranium is one of the most active.
A mixture of selenious acid and sulphurous acid in presence of
hydrochloric acid yields strong currents when subjected to light in
the form of cell described.     The list of substances that may be proved
to undergo chemical decomposition by the action of light is very ex
tensive ; full details will be found in the completed paper.
IV. "On     the Determination     of the Scale Value of a Thomson's
      Quadrant    Electrometer    used   for Registering the Variations
      in Atmospheric Electricity at the Kew Observatory."               By
      G. M. Whipple,     B.Sc,   Superintendent of the Kew Observa
      tory.    Communicated by Robert H. Scott, M.A., F.R.S.
      Received April 3, 1878.
   The Meteorological Council, being desirous of discussing the pho
tographic traces produced by their electrograph at the Kew Obser
vatory some time since, requested the Kew Committee to institute a
series of experiments, with the view of determining the scale value of
the instrument, in order to prepare a suitable scale for measuring the
curves.
   The Kew Committee, at their meeting in November, entrusted the
matter to me, and accordingly, having obtained the loan of a battery
of 300 Bunsen cells, some preliminary experiments were made, which

1878.]     Scale Value    of a Thomson's Quadrant Electrometer.        357
showed that the greatest potential which could be obtained with them
was very inadequate for the purpose.
    Having named this fact to Dr. De La Rue, he very generously
placed his large chloride of silver battery at the disposal of the Ob
servatory, and by its means we have been able to test the value of the
deflections   of the instrument at different points of the scale throughout
its entire range.
    Owing to the difficulty of transporting the large battery the experi
ments were all made in Dr. De La Rue's laboratory, Charlotte-street,
Portland-place, London.
    The electrometer (Thomson's Quadrant, No. 19, White, Glasgow,
 maker) was dismounted from its position in the Observatory on the
 3rd December, 1877, careful measurements having first been made of
 the distance of a mark on the instrument from the source of light and
from the point of incidence of the reflected spot of light on the circum
ference of the cylinder of the registering apparatus.
    The acid was then removed from the jar, and the needle fixed for
transit.
     Before moving the instrument the exact position of the quadrants,
 which are kept separated to some distance in ordinary use, was marked
 by lines drawn on the cover, so as to ensure as far as possible that the
 same inductive power should be acting on the needle during the expe
 riments as there had been whilst the electrometer was in daily use at
 the Observatory.
     The time of vibration of the needle was also carefully determined
 and noted, with the view of detecting any change that might occur
 in its sensibility from derangement of its supporting fibres during
 transit.
     The apparatus    was then conveyed to Dr. De La Rue's laboratory,
 and there fitted up on a bed prepared for the purpose, on which the
 distances as mentioned above were marked.
     The jar having been refilled with acid the needle was liberated, and
 its time of vibration being found unaltered, it was charged positively,
 and the instrument left for several days in order that its interior might
  become thoroughly dried.
     In the first experiment readings were taken on a scale divided into
  fortieths of an inch, which was placed in the exact position occupied
  by the front face of the cylinder of the registering apparatus of the
  electrograph.
     The battery terminals were then attached to the electrodes of the
  instrument, and the cells joined up in series as required.      The deflec
  tions produced by the different potentials were read off on the scale
  with the following results, the quadrants      being put to earth at the
  beginning of each experiment      with the view of obtaining a correct
  value of the zero.

 I. " On the Action of Sonorous Vibrations in varying the Force
       of an Electric Current." By Professor D. E. Hughes.
       Communicated by Professor Huxley, Sec. R.S. Received
       May 8, 1878.
    The introduction of the telephone has tended to develop our know
 ledge of acoustics with great rapidity.      It offers to us an instrument
 of great delicacy for further research into the mysteries of acoustic
 phenomena.      It detects the presence of currents of electricity that
 have hitherto only been suspected, and it shows variations in the
 strengths of currents which no other instrument has ever indicated.
    It has led me to investigate the effect of sonorous vibrations upon
 the electrical behaviour of matter.        Willoughby Smith has showr
 that the resistance of selenium is affected by light, and Bernstein has
 led us to believe that many other bodies are similarly affected.          We
 know also that the resistance of all bodies is materially influenced by
 heat.    Sir William Thomson and others have shown that the resist
 ance to the passage of currents offered by wires is affected by their
 being placed under strains, . and, inasmuch as the conveyance of
 sonorous vibrations induces rapid variations in the strains at different
points of a wire,   I believed that the wire would vary in its resistance
when it was used to convey sound.             To investigate this   I  made a
rough-and-ready telephone,       with a small  bar  magnet  four inches  long,
half the coil of an ordinary electro-magnet, and a square piece of
ferro-type iron, three inches square, clamped rigidly in front of one
pole of the magnet between two pieces of board.              When using the
pendulum beats of a small French clock, or the voice, as a source of
sound, I found this arrangement supplied me with an extremely deli
cate phonoscope or sound detector.
    All the experiments detailed in this paper were made with the
simplest possible means, and no apparatus of any kind constructed by
a scientific instrument maker was employed.          The battery was a simple
Daniell's cell, of Minotto's form, made by using three common
tumblers, a spiral piece of copper wire being placed at the bottom of
each glass and covered with sulphate of copper, and the glass being

 1878.]       in varying   the  Force  of an Electric Current.          363
 then filled with well-moistened clay and water.       A piece of zinc as
 the positive element was placed upon the clay.       Insulated wires were
attached to each plate, and three of these cells were joined in series.
All experiments were made on a closed circuit, the telephone being
used as a phonoscope to detect variations in the current and the con-,
sequent reproduction of sound.        The apparatus, or materials experi
mented upon, were used in the same way as the transmitter of the
speaking telephone of Bell. The attached sketch will make this clear.
B is the battery, S the source of sound or material examined, T the
telephone or phonoscope.
   I introduced into the circuit at S a strained    conductor — a stretched
wire — listening attentively with     the telephone to detect any change
that might occur when the wire was spoken to or set into trans
verse vibrations by being plucked aside.          Gradually, till the wire
broke, the strain was varied, but no effect whatever was remarked
except at the moment when the wire broke.             The effect was but
momentary, but invariably at the moment of breaking a peculiar
" rush " or sound was heard.       I then sought to imitate the condition
of the wire at the moment of rupture by replacing the broken ends
and pressing them together with a constant and varying force by the
application of weights.     It was found that if the broken ends rested
upon   one another with  a  slight pressure of not more than one ounce
to the square inch on the joints, sounds were distinctly reproduced
although the effects were very imperfect.
   It was soon found that it was not at all necessary to join two wires
endwise together to reproduce sound, but that any portion of an
electric conductor would do so even when fastened to a board or to a
table, and no matter how complicated the structure upon this board,
or the materials used as a conductor, provided one or more portions
of the electrical conductor were separated and only brought into con
tact by a slight but constant pressure. Thus, if the ends of the wire ter
minate in two common French nails laid side by side, and are separated'

from each other by a slight space, were electrically connected by laying
A similar nail between them, sonnd conld be reproduced.              The effect
was improved by building up         the  nails log-hut  fashion, into  a square
configuration, using ten or twenty nails.            A piece of steel watch
chain acted   well.  Up   to   this  point  the  sound   or grosser vibrations
 were alone produced, the finer inflections were missing, or, in other
 words, the timbre of the voice was wanting, but in the following experi
 ments the timbre became more and more perfect until it reached a
 perfection leaving nothing to be desired.           I  found that a metallic
powder such as the white powder        —  a mixture of zinc and tin —sold in
 commerce as
                " white bronze," and fine metallic filings, introduced at
the points of contact, greatly added to the perfection of the result.
   At this point articulate speech became clearly and distinctly repro
duced, together with its timbre, and I found that all that now
remained was to discover the best material and form to give to this
arrangement its maximum effect.              Although    I  tried all forms of
pressure and modes of contact, a lever, a spring ; pressure in a glass
tube sealed np while under the influence of strain, so as to maintain
the pressure constant, all gave similar and invariable results, but the
results varied with the materials used.         All metals, however, could be
made to produce identical results, provided the division of the metal
was small enough, and that the material used does not oxidize by
contact with the air filtering through the mass. Thus platinum and
mercury are very excellent and unvarying in their results, whilst lead
soon becomes of such high resistance, through oxidation upon the
surface, as to be of little or no use.      A mass of bright round shot is
peculiarly sensitive to sound whilst clean, but as the shot soon become
coated with oxide this sensitiveness ceases.           Carbon again, from its
surface being entirely free from oxidation, is excellent, but the best
results I have been able to obtain at present have been from mercury
in a finely divided state.       I  took a comparatively porous non-con-
ductor, such as the willow charcoal used by artists for sketching,
heating it gradually to a white heat and then suddenly plunging it in
mercury.     The vacua in the pores, caused by the sudden cooling,
become filled with innumerable minute globules of mercury, thus, as
it were, holding the mercury, in a fine state of division.         I  have also
tried carbon treated in a similar manner with and without platinum
deposited upon it from the chloride of platinum.            I have also found
similar effects from  the  willow   charcoal   heated in an iron vessel to a
white heat, and containing a free portion of tin, zinc, or other easily
vaporized metal.     Under such conditions the willow carbon will be
found to be metallized, having the metal distributed throughout its
pores in a fine state of division.      Iron also seems to enter the pores if
heated to a white heat without being chemically combined with the
carbon as in graplxite, and, indeed, some of the best results have been

 obtained   from   -willow   charcoal    containing iron in     a fine state of
 division.
    Pine charcoal treated in this manner (although         a non-conductor    as
 a simple charcoal) has high conductive powers, due to the iron ; and
from the minute division of the iron in the pores, is a most excellent
 material for the purpose.
   Any one of these preparations        confined in a glass tube or a box, and
                                                              "
provided with wires for insertion in a circuit, I call a transmitter."
    Reis, in 1860, showed how, by the movement of a diaphragm, inter
mittent voltaic currents could be transmitted, agreeing in exact number
with the sonorous waves impinging on the diaphragm, and thus repro
ducing music at a distance by causing an electro-magnet to vibrate in
unison with the diaphragm ; and, with an iron diaphragm, Graham
Bell showed how the vibrations of that diaphragm in front of a
polarised electro-magnet could similarly induce magneto- currents, cor
responding in number, amplitude, and form, with the sonorous vibra
tion, and thus reproduce       all the delicacies of the human voice. Edison
and others have produced variations in the strengths of a constant
current by causing the diaphragm to press directly upon some elastic
conductor, such as carbon, spongy platinum, &c, the varying pressure
upon these materials varying the resistance of the circuit, and conse
quently the strength of current flowing.              Graham Bell and others
have produced the same effect, by causing the vibrations of the dia
phragm to vary the electromotive force in the circuit.                It will be
seen, however, that in the experiments made by myself, the diaphragm
has been altogether discarded, resting as it does upon the changes
produced by molecular action, and that the variations in the strengths
of the currents flowing are produced simply and solely by the direct
effect of the sonorous vibrations.
   I have found that any sound, however feeble, produces vibrations
which can be taken up by the matter interposed in the electrical
circuit.    Sounds absolutely inaudible to the human ear affect the re
sistance of the conductors described above. In practice, the effeot is
so sensitive, that a slight touch on the board, by the finger nail, on
which the transmitter is placed, or a mere touch with the soft part of
a feather, would be distinctly heard at the receiving             station.   The
movement of the softest camel hair brush on any part of the board is
distinctly audible.      If held in the hand, several feet from a piano, the
whole chords     — the highest as well as the lowest — can be distinctly
heard at a distance.       If one person sings a song, the distant station,
provided    with  a similar transmitter, can sing and speak at the same
time, and the sounds will be received loud enough for the person sing
ing to follow the second speech or song sent from the distant end.
                              I
   Acting on these facts, have also devised an instrument suitable for
magnifying weak sounds, which I call a microphone. The microphene,
                                                                    2 B 2

366     Prof. Hughes on      the Action of Sonorous     Vibrations   [May    9,
in its present form, consists simply of a lozenge-shaped piece of gas
carbon, one inch long, quarter inch wide at its centre, and one-eighth
of an inch in thickness.       The lower pointed end rests as a pivot npon
a small block of similar carbon ; the npper end, being made round,
plays free in a hole in a small carbon-block, similar to that at the
lower end. The lozenge stands vertically upon its lower support.
The whole of the gas carbon is tempered in mercury, in the way
previously described, though this is not absolutely necessary.             The
form of the lozenge-shaped carbon is not of importance, provided the
weight of this npright contact piece is only just sufficient to make a
feeble contact by its own weight.        Carbon is used in preference to any
other material, as its surface does not oxidise.      A platinum Burface in
a finely-divided state is equal, if not superior, to the mercurised carbon,
but more difficult and costly to construct.         I  have also made very
 sensitive ones entirely of iron.
    The best form and materials for this instrument, however, have not
 yet been fully experimented on. Still, in its present shape, it is
 capable of detecting very faint sounds made in its presence.        If  a pin,
 for instance, be laid upon or taken off a table, a distinct sound is
 emitted, or, if a fly be confined under a table-glass, we can hear the
 fly walking, with a peculiar tramp of its own. The beating of a pulse,
 the tick of a watch, the tramp of a fly, can thus be heard at least
 a hundred     miles distant from the source of sound.         In fact, when
 further developed by study, we may fairly look for it to do for ns,
 with regard to faint sounds, what the microscope does with matter too
 small for human vision.
    It is quite evident that these effects are due to a difference of pres
 sure at the different points of contact, and that they are dependent for
 the perfection of action upon the number of these points of contact.
 Moreover, they are not dependent upon any apparent difference in the
 bodies in contact, but the same body in a state of minute subdivision
 is equally effective.    Electrical resistance is a function of the mass of
 the conductor, but sonorous conduction is a function of the molecules
 of matter. How is it therefore that a sonorous wave can so affect the
 mass of a conductor as to influence its electrical resistance ? If we
 assume a line of molecules, we know that a sonorous wave is accom
 panied by alternate compressions and rarefactions.          If we isolate the
 part under compression from the part under dilatation we vary the
 dimensions of the mass, and we alter its electrical resistance.       In any
 homogeneous conductor of finite dimensions the effect of the one will
 exactly compensate for the effect of the other, and we get no varia
tion of current, but if we break up this homogeneous conductor into a
series of minute subdivisions without actually breaking their electrical
continuity we destroy this neutralizing influence, and we render
evident the effect of 6onorous vibrations in varying the dimensions of

the   mass  of the conductor,    and therefore     in varying its electrical
resistance, for we reduce the length of a portion of the conductor to
a fraction of the length of a sonorous wave. Molecular action alone
explains to me all the effects produced.       Size or shape does not affect
them. A piece of willow charcoal, the size of a pin's head, is quite
sufficient to reproduce articulate speech. I regard the action as
follows : — If we have two separate conductors joined simply by contact
this contact offers a certain resistance. Now we can vary or lessen
the resistance by increasing the pressure, thus bringing more points in
                                          I
contact or closer proximity. Now, as employ a constant pressure on
the contact, which is exactly under the same influence of the vibra
tions as the points of contact, more points or closer proximity can
only be obtained through the molecular swelling or movement of the
contact points.
   If we assume a line of molecules at the point of contact of the
minute masses of conducting matter in their neutral condition to be
arranged thus : —
they will appear thus under compression      : —
and thus under dilatation : —
   In  the former case the electrical resistance would be less, and in the
latter case more than in the normal condition. Hence we should get
variation in their electrical resistance, and thus sonorous waves could
vary the strength of an electric current, and the variations of the
electric current can be made to reproduce sonorous vibrations. These,
however, would only produce the result in a certain line, say horizontal ;
but those perpendicular, while producing the same result, would be a
half vibration behind, and thus if two contacts, the one horizontal and
the other perpendicular, were on the same piece of charcoal and the
conducting line joined to both, we should have interference.             The
contrary takes place as the more contacts we have, and the more
 varied their direction on the same, the louder and purer the sound
becomes.     Hence there is no interference, and consequently the whole
 mass must swell and diminish equally in all directions at the same
instant of time.
    The tube transmitter, which I exhibit this evening, consists of an
 exterior glass tube two inches long and one quarter of an inch in

diameter.     In it are four separate pieces of willow charcoal, each one
quarter of an inch long, and two terminals of the same material. The
terminals are fastened in the tube, and connect exteriorly with the line
and interiorly with the four loose pieces, thus    : —
    Here A is made to press on B, C, D, E, F, and G, nntil the resist
ance offered to the electrical current is about one-third that of the
line upon which it is to be employed. It may be attached to a resonant
board by the ends A or G. If the result was simply due to vibrations,
we should have A and B making greater contact at a different time
from F and G, and consequent interference.              If it was a simple
shaking or moving of B, C, D, E, and F, it could produce no change,
as if B pressed more strongly on C, it would be less on A, and also if
the tube was attached by the centre we should have no effect ; but if
the effect is dne to a swelling or enlargement of B, C, D, E, F, it
 would make no difference where it is attached to the resonant board,
as is actually the case.    Again reduce the pressure of A upon B, Ac.,
 until tbey are not in contact, and no trace of current can be perceived
 by shaking the tube.      The instant the sonorous vibrations pass in the
 tube there is electric contact to a remarkable degree, which eonld only
 have taken place by the molecules enlarging their sphere under the
 influence of the sonorous vibrations.
     It is impossible to say what can be the applications or the effects of
 the discovery which I have had the honour of bringing before the
 Royal Society, for the whole question has been studied with crude
 materials, and scarcely sufficient time has elapsed to enable me to   con
 sider its nltimate uses.     I do not desire to assert that there is  any
 thing in what I have brought forward that is superior to or equal to
 other transmitters used for telephony.         It is as loud and far more
 sensitive than any    I have yet hear,d, and it may be increased by multi
 plication of transmitting contacts in quantity or intensity ; the loud
 ness is at present limited by the capability of the receiver.    The mate
 rials at my disposal, and the arrangement of them, have not yet been
 sufficiently studied.    I  only wished to show that it is possible to
 transmit clear and intelligent articulate speech, and to render audible

    The thymus is composed of lobes, lobules, and follicles.
    Each follicle consists of a cortical and a medullary portion ; the
 medullary parts of two neighbouring follicles are often united ; and
 at one point, therefore, the medullary portion may extend through the
 cortex of the follicle; in some follicles the medullary portion may be
 found in the form of two or more islands situated in the interior of the
 follicle.
    The follicle is composed (a) of a reticulum of nucleated cells, and (b)
 of cells ; the reticulum forms an adventitia to the blood-vessels.
    The cells forming the reticulum in the cortical part of the follicle
 consist of a disk-shaped nucleus, a cell body very little larger than
 the nucleus, and of very long, fine, branching processes.
    The reticulum of the medullary portion is composed of cells with
 coarse, short processes ; the body of the cell is more than twice, or
 even three times, as large as the nucleus, and contains one, or at
 times, two nuclei ; in places, large protoplasmic masses are met with,
 forming part of the reticulum composed of two or three cells united
 together.     There are also found in the medullary portions, in certain
 btates of the thymus, connective tissue trabecules.
     The cells are of four kinds : —
     (I.) Small cells, resembling the lymph cells of a follicle of a
 lymphatic gland.       Staining fluids act differently on these cells in the
 cortical and in the medullary parts of the follicle.
     (2.) Large granular cells of various sizes ; many of them have long
  processes by which, in some cases, they are attached to the trabecular
  and to the blood-vessels : these cells contain one or two nuclei, and
  help to form (partly by a process of vacuolation) the concentric cor
  puscles of the thymus.

      (3.) Giant cells. Multinuclear masses of protoplasm.
      (4.) Concentric corpuscles of various sizes, sometimes attached to
  one another by long processes. The corpuscles are formed of two
  parts — a central portion, which is granular, and is acted on in a
  peculiar manner by staining fluids ; and a peripheral portion formed
  of flattened epitheloid cells continuous with the reticulum.          The
 concentric corpuscles are concerned in the formation of blood-vessels
 and trabecular.
     The granular cells, giant cells, and concentric corpuscles, are almost
 entirely confined to the central portions of the follicles.
     In fresh preparations, colonrless nucleated cells are seen, which
 contain granules and spherules of haemoglobin ; these cells either form
 parts of the concentric corpuscles, or are in close connexion with
 them.
     The blood-vessels of the cortical portions of the follicle are of small
 size ; they run in lines from the periphery of the follicle to the edge of
 the medullnry portion.     The medullary portion of the follicle is sur
rounded by a ring of blood-vessels ; the vessels are larger in the
medullary portion than in the cortical portion of the follicle.

                                 (Abstract.)
    "A curve,"   is to be understood to mean a continuous one-dimen
sional aggregate of any sort of elements, and therefore not merely n
curve in the ordinary geometrical sense, but also a singly infinite
system of curves, surfaces, complexes, Ac, such          that one condition
is sufficient to determine a finite number of them.       The elements may
be regarded as determined by k co-ordinates ; and if these be connected
by A;— 1 equations of any order, the curve is either the aggregate of
common solutions, or, when this breaks up into algebraically distinct
parts, the curve is one of these parts.
    In  the paper, of which this is an abstract, theorems are established
relating to the nature of the space in which such curves can exist, to
the mode of representing them in flat space of lower dimensions, and to
some of their properties.    The following are the leading theorems : —
    I. Every proper curve of the nth order is in a flat space of n dimen
sions or less.
    II. A curve   of order n in flat space of k dimensions (or less) may
be represented,    point for point, on a curve of order n — k + 2 in a
plane.

   III.  A  curve of order n, in flat space of n dimensions (and no less),
is always unicursal.
   From this the author obtains a representation of the points of an
n dimensional space by means of groups of n points on such a nnicnrsal
cnrve,    corresponding    to the methods of Hirst and Darboux for
3-dimensional space.
   When n is even, the system corresponds to that of poles and polars
in regard to a quadric locus upon which the curve lies.
   When n is odd, every point is co-flat (i.e., n + 1 points lie in the
same n — 1 flat), with the n points of the osculant (n — 1) flats which
can be drawn through it.
   IV. Every curve of order n in flat space of n— 1 dimensions is either
nnicnrsal or elliptic.
    V. When the curve is unicursal, and n is odd, the n points of super,
osculation, or points of stationary osculant (n — 2) flats, are on the
same (n — 2) flat.       But when n is even, this will be the case only
nnder a certain condition.
   VI. When the curve is elliptic (or bi-cnrsal) the class of the curve
is n (n — 1), and the number of superosculants n*.
   If we consider a curve of the order n and deficiency p, existing in k
dimensions, a (k — 1) flat cuts such a curve in n points, such that the
sum of each of the^j parameters (Abel's theorem gives p equations be
tween the parameters of n points which lie on a (4 — 1) flat), for these
n points is zero.     And we obtain the theorem
   VII. A curve of order n and deficiency p, not greater than ri, can
at most exist in n — p dimensions.

represented in the annexed woodcuts.
   The five disks are all in one plane, and their centres in one line.
 The axes of the cylinders are all in a line parallel to it. The diameters
 of the five cylinders are all equal, so are those of the globes ; hence
 the centres of the globes are in a line parallel to the line of the
 centres of the disks, and to the line of the axes

    One long wooden rod, properly supported and guided, and worked
by a rack and pinion, carries five forks to move the five globes and a
pointer to trace the curve on the paper cylinder. The shaft of the
 paper cylinder carries at its two ends cranks at right angles to one
 another ; and a toothed wheel which turns a parallel shaft, and a third
 shaft in line with the first, by means of three other toothed wheels. This
 third shaft carries at its two ends two cranks at right angles to one
 another.
    Another toothed wheel on the shaft of the paper drum turns
 another parallel shaft, which, by a slightly oblique toothed wheel
 working on a crown wheel with slightly oblique teeth, turns one of
 the five disks uniformly (supposing to avoid circumlocution the
 paper drum to be turning uniformly).          The cylinder of the integrator,
 of which this one is the disk, gives the continuously growing value of
j'ydx.
    Each of the four cranks gives a simple harmonic angular motion to
 one of the other four disks by means of a slide and crosshead, carrying
 a rack which works a sector attached to the disk. Hence, the cylinders
 moved by the disks, driven by the first mentioned pair of cranks, give

   We cannot flatter ourselves that we have done more during our
three and a half years' work than contribute a few facts towards the
data necessary for the solution of the problem of the cause of stratifi
cation produced by the electric discharge in vacuum tubes. We refrain
for the present from suggesting any hypothesis to account for this
beautiful phenomenon, in the hope of being able to confirm, experi
mentally, certain views which we entertain concerning it. The paper
we have now the honour of laying before the Society consists mainly
of a record of the various appearances presented by the discharge in
residual gases at various pressures and with various currents.
   Throughout our labours we have felt strongly the necessity for
obtaining measurements of the physical conditions (nature and
pressure of the gas, strength of the current, difference of potentials
between the electrodes, size of the tubes, forms of electrodes) which
accompany the various phenomena observed during our experiments.
   In order that others may be in a position to theorize as well as
ourselves, we have given a more detailed account than we otherwise
should have done of the phenomena observed, which, for the same
reason, we have illustrated by copious diagrams and many copies of
photographs.
  For example, in diagram, fig. 43 are shown some of the very great
variety of phases in rarefied hydrogen, observed with tube 129, 32
inches long, 1 '6 inch diameter; the terminals being a straight wire
and a ring about 1 inch in diameter, both aluminium.      We quote a

    The difference of the strata in tubes of different diameter at the
same pressure and with the same current is very clearly brought out in
tube 161, fig. 3, composed of two portions, one being 18 inches long and
1*66 inch internal diameter, the other 17-5 inches long and 0"975 inch
diameter, the ratio of the sectional areas being 2'864 to 1.     The ter
minal in the small tnbe is a point, in the large one a ring. With
4,800 cells, the point (small tube) positive, C. 0"02825 W> there were
produced in the small tnbe 62 disk-shaped strata, and in the large tnbe
twelve cup-shaped strata occupying half of the length of the large tnbe ;
beyond these the discharge was dark.          With the point negative
C. 0'0245l, there were produced in the small tube 54 disks, and in
the large tube thirteen cup-shaped, completely filling it. The number
of strata does not therefore appear to be in the inverse ratio of the
areas. The strata in the small tnbe were blue, but at times, with a
larger current, carmine, as in the capillary part of a spectrum analysis
tube, the strata in the large tube being much fainter and pink.

   We have found it necessary to exhaust the tubes ourselves, in order
 to be certain of the conditions as to pressure and purity of the gas
 (which we examined spectroscopically at various degrees of exhaus

 378                       De La Rue and Muller.                    [May 16,
 tion).     By operating in this way we have been able to reproduce over
 and over again phases which are more or less transient in all tubes ;
 indeed, we encountered great difficulties when we first commenced
 our labours with tubes supplied by various makers, for after a very
 short time they completely and permanently changed so as no longer
 to present the splendid stratifications witnessed on a first trial.
     All the tubes which we exhausted were provided with two glass
 stop-cocks, one of which was        connected with the gas generator, the
 other to the system of pumps.        The rinsing of the apparatus was first
 effected many times with a high pressure water trompe (head of water
 106 feet, producing a vacuum of 12 millims.) ; the tube was then ex
 hausted by a mercurial pump (Alvergniat's make), and finally by the
 Sprengel.     In our later experiments the measurements of low pressures
 were made by means of the M'Leod gauge, which indicated pressures
 down to 0-00005 millim.
    By absorbing carbonic acid with potash, and, more especially, hydro
 gen with spongy palladium, a vacuum was obtained so perfect (pressure
 0 000055 millim., 0"066 MO that the potential of 11,000 was insufficient
to cause a discharge.
    We have adopted several expedients for ascertaining the resistance
of the tubes. In the first instance we placed the tube in one of the
arms of a Wheatstone bridge, but the oscillations of the current were
so great that it was necessary to substitute a vacuum tell-tale tube for
the galvanometer ; this became illuminated whenever the currents in
the two branches were unequal.         In spite of this device it was impos
sible to balance exactly the resistance of a tube by a metallic resist
ance.     It  was found that the resistance      of a vacuum tube varied
greatly as soon as the current passed and usually diminished, but
when once the current was interrupted it was necessary to increase
considerably the balancing resistance in the symmetrical branch of
the Wheatstone bridge, in order to reproduce an illumination.          After
standing at rest for some time the tube took up its original condition.
    In fig. 4 A Z is the battery, the A terminal of which is connected at A',
in the bridge arrangement, with two equal fluid resistance tubes, FR
and FR', of 420,000 ohms, placed in vessels containing ice, to keep
them at a constant temperature ; an adjustable coil resistance is in
serted between B and D ; the tube T T', to be tested, is placed between
D and C, the Z terminal of the battery being connected to D. When
the resistance is greater or less than that of the tube to be tested
there is an illumination in the detector tube between B and C ; but
when a current passes in T T", balanced by a proper adjustment of the
coil resistance, then the glow in the detector ceases.
   Better results were obtained either by reproducing the deflections of
a galvanometer, observed during the course of the experiments, with
metallic resistance substituted for the tube ; or by measuring with an

    We were induced to extend the investigation by means of the elec
trometer, to the determination of the rate of fall of the potential
 throughout the length of a vacuum tube. For this purpose we had
 several   tubes constructed with aluminium rings fixed to platinum
 wires inserted in the glass at nearly equal intervals. It was found
 that the fall of potential for equal spaces had a maximum value is the
 neighbourhood of the negative electrode ; in the neighbourhood of the
 positive, though considerably less than near the negative, it was greater
 than in the middle of the tube, where for equal intervals the fall of
 potential was sensibly constant.
     The most important result of these measurements was the establish
 ment of the constancy of the difference of potential between the elec
 trodes of a given tube and gas, at a given pressure, for all variations
 in the value of the current, even when these were as great as 1 to
 150.    This conclusion was arrived at subsequently to the observation
of the majority of the phenomena recorded in the paper. Accordingly,
 it must be understood that what has been termed " resistance of a
 tube
       " indicates that the difference of potential between its
                                                                 terminals
 was the same as that which would have existed between the ends of a
 metallic wire of the resistance given if substituted for the tube in the
 particular circuit.
    We have, moreover, by experimenting with such tubes as 154 and 155,
 fig. 5, wherein there is a constricture of the same bore, but of different
lengths, established the fact that the constricture greatly increases the.

smallness of the diameter of the constricture than upon its length.

     In   the course         of our experiments we have arrived at the following
facts     :   —
     1. The discharge             in a vacuum
                                 tube does not differ essentially from that
in air and other   gases at ordinary atmospheric pressures ; it cannot be
considered as a current in the ordinary acceptation of the term, but must
be   of       the nature     of a disruptive discharge,                the molecules      of   the gas acting
as carriers of electrification.  The gases in all probability receive two im
pulses in opposite directions, that from the negative being the more con
tinuous of the two.* Metal is frequently carried from the terminals and is
deposited on the inside of the tube, so as to leave a permanent record of the
spaces between the strata.
     2.   As       the exhaustion proceeds      the potential necessary                  to cause   a current
to pass diminishes up to a certain point, whence                                  it again increases, and
tlie strata thicken and              diminish in number, until a point is reached at
which, notwithstanding the high electromotive force available, no discharge
through the residual gas can be detected.
     3.   All
          strata have their origin at the positive pole.    Thus, in a given
tube, with a certain   gas, there  is produced    at a   certain pressure, in
the first instance, only one luminosity which forms on the positive
terminal,            then,   as    the      is gradnally carried further
                                          exhaustion                                                        it-
detaches itself, moving towards the negative, and being followed by
other luminosities, which gradually increase in number up to a certain
point.
   4. With the same potential the phenomena vary irregularly with the
amount       current. Sometimes, as the current
                of                                      increased, the numberis
of strata in certain tubes increases, and as                  diminished theirit    is
number decreases; but with other tubes the number of strata fre
quently increases with         diminution of current.
                                     a
      A change
     5.                current frequently produces an entire change in the
                             of
colour     the strata.
              of          For example, in      hydrogen tube from a cobalt

blue to a  pink. It     also  changes the spectrum of the strata moreover,                     ;
the spectra of the illuminated terminals and the strata differ.

          If                 irregular and the strata indistinct, an alteration
                                   is

  of   the  amount of current makes the strata distinct and steady.          Most fre
  quently    a  point  of steadiness,  sufficient   for photographing,    is produced
  by the careful introduction of external resistance ; subsequently the
  introduction of more resistance produces a new phase of unsteadiness,
  and   still more resistance another phase of steady and distinct stratifi
  cation.
     7.  The greatest heat is in the vicinity of the strata.        This can be best
  observed when the tube contains          either only one stratum, or a small
  number separated by a broad interval. There is reason to believe that
  even in the dark discharge there may be strata ; for we have found a
 development of heat in the middle of a tube, in which there was no
 illumination except on the terminals.
     8.  Even when the strata are       to all appearance perfectly steady, a 'pul
 sation can he detected in the     current; hid it is not proved that the strata
 depend     upon intermittence.
     9. There is no current from a battery through a tube divided by a glass
 division into two chambers, and the tube can only be illuminated by
 alternating     charges.
    10.    In  the same    tube  and with the same gas, a very great variety of
phenomena         can  be  produced by varying the pressure and the current.
 The luminosities and strata,       in their various forms, can    be  reproduced in
 the same tube,     or in others  having similar dimensions.
    11.    At   the same pressure and with        the same   current, the diameter of
 the tube affects    the character and closeness of the stratification.

 Professor Adams has given, by an inductive process, the development
of the product of any two of Legendre's Coefficients in a series of the
 Coefficients; from this is immediately deduced the value of the in
tegral between the limits — 1 and +1 of the product of any three of
the Coefficients.         On the other hand, if we know the value of this
definite integral, we can immediately deduce the development of the
product of any two of the Coefficients.               Thus it may be of interest to
give a brief investigation of the value of the definite integral.                   I

    The many unexplained phenomena attending the passage of elec
tricity through gases will probably for some time to como occupy the
attention of experimental physicists.              It is desirable that the subject
should be approached from as many different sides as possible.                 One
of our most powerfal          instruments    of research is the spectroscope, but
before it can be applied to the study in question we have to settle the
 chemical origin of the different spectra, which we observe in vacuum
 tubes, and to discuss in what way such spectra are liable to change
under different circumstances.           A special investigation has to be made

384          Dr. A. Schuster on    the  Spectra  of Metalloids.   [May 16,
for each gas ; we have to study the effect of various impurities, the
influence of the electrodes, and that of the glass which in the tubes
generally  used is considerably heated up by the spark.       I have chosen
oxygen as a first subject of investigation. Though Pliicker and Wiillncr
have, as far as their experiments went, accurately described the phe
nomena seen in oxygen tubes, the following contains much that is
new, and   will put some  of the older facts on a firmer basis.
   As some of the facts brought to light by the investigation bear
directly on the question of double spectra, our knowledge on that
point must be briefly referred to. We divide all known spectra into
three orders.    Continuous spectra, channelled space spectra, and line
spectra.   With regard to continuous spectra, it is shown that the
older statement which limited them to liquid and solid bodies is no
longer tenable. Most gases give continuous spectra long before they
condense.     Two theories of continuous spectra are noticed.      The one
considers that the vibrations of a molecule always tend to take place
in a fixed period, but that the impacts of other molecules may, when
the pressure is great or in liquid and solid bodies, prevent complete
oscillations taking place, and thus produce a continuous spectrum.
The other theory considers that, when a gas condenses, molecular
combinations take place, which make the molecular structure more
complicated, and may produce channelled space spectra or continuous
spectra.    According to the latter theory such molecular combinations
are possible before the gas condenses, and thus the state of aggrega
tion of the gas only indirectly affects the spectrum. The latter theory
seems to be more consistent with experiment than the former one.
For instance, it is shown that oxygen gives a continuous spectrum at
the lowest temperature at which it is luminous.         If the temperature
be raised, the continuous spectrum is replaced by a line spectrum.
This seems to be inexplicable by theory of molecular impacts.
   With regard to channelled space spectra attention is drawn to a
new kind, which finds a representative in the spectrum of the negative
pole in oxygen.     The ordinary channelled space spectra show bands,
which when seen under small dispersion appear to have a sharp
boundary on one side, and fade gradually away towards the other.
When seen under large dispersion these bands appear to be made up
of a number of lines which get nearer and nearer to each other a.s
they approach the sharp boundary.          The spectrum of the negative
pole in oxygen, when looked at with small powers, seems to be made
up of a number of bands which are uniformly illuminated throughout,
but with high powers each band is found to be made up of a number
of lines at about equal intervals.
   With regard to line spectra it is shown that a body may at a low
temperature show a different set of lines altogether from what it
shows at a high temperature.         It is difficult to decide whether the

 1878.]      Dr. A. Schuster on       the Spectra    of Metalloids.         385
change from one line spectrum to another is due to the same cause as
that of a band spectrum to a line spectrum.
   The chief difficulty in the way of a complete investigation of the
spectrum of oxygen consists in the great disturbing influence of the
presence of even a small quantity of any carbon compound.              Amongst
a great many oxygen tubes which were filled by various makers, I only
found one which showed the spectrum of pure oxygen ; all the others
gave a spectrum of carbonic oxide.          It is therefore necessary in filling
oxygen    tubes,  to avoid  all greased joints and all india-rubber tubings.
I have used a Sprengel air-pump, which communicated with the vacuum
tube by means of a ball and socket joint. The joint was kept air
tight solely by means of strong sulphuric acid. The vacunm tube
was fused directly to the ball of the joint.        To one end of the vacuum
tube a piece of hard glass tubing had been fused. This was filled
with different substances which, on heating, gave off pure oxygen.
The oxygen therefore came only into contact with glass, mercury, and
sulphuric acid, and the metal of the electrode.           By repeatedly filling
and exhausting the tube all extraneous matter, which always is
attached to the inner surface of the glass, could be swept away.            Per
manganate of potash, oxide of mercury, and chlorate             of potash, were
used in turn to prepare the oxygen, but no effect was observed which
could be traced to the substance used. The effect of the electrodes
was eliminated by varying the metals.            Aluminium, platinum, silver,
brass, and iridium were used as electrodes.          Any possible effect of the
glass was eliminated by finally repeating all experiments in a glass
receiver six inches in diameter, so that no part of the spark came
nearer than 2| inches to the glass.        In this way it is believed all pos
sibility of error due to the presence of any possible impurities was
avoided.
   All  measurements      were reduced    to wave-lengths by interpolation.
The lines of iron or any metal whose lines are reversed in the solar
spectrum were taken as reference lines. The wave-length of the re
ference lines    could therefore always be found on Angstrom's solar
map.    As a rule the dispersion was equal to that of four heavy flint-
glass prisms of a refracting angle of 62°, and it is believed that the
accuracy of the measurements equals that of any other spectroscopic
measurements.
   Four different spectra of oxygen must            be  distinguished.   At   the
lowest   temperature     at which    oxygen     becomes luminous     it gives a
continuous spectrum.        As the temperaturo is gradually raised the
continuous spectrum is successively transformed into two distinct line
spectra, which I call respectively the compound line spectrum and the
elementary line spectrum.        It is one of the principal objects of this
paper to show that these two line spectra which have been much
mixed up together have a separate existence.            The generation of one

 38(5        Dr. A. Schuster on the Spectra of Metalloid*.      [May 16,
 always involves the destruction of the other.     The fourth spectrum is
 that which is always seen at the negative pole in vacuum tubes filled
 with oxygon.
    The Continuous Spectrum. — The following facts prove the statement
 that at the lowest temperatnre at which oxygen is luminous it shows a
 continuous   spectrum.
    1. The wide part of a Plucker tube generally shines with a faint
yellow light. When looked at by means of a prism the spectrum is
 perfectly continuous.
   2. If a spark of an ordinary Ruhmkorff coil is taken in oxygen at
atmospheric pressure, one of the line spectra generally appears, but
when the break is put out of adjustment so as to weaken the spark,
the lines disappear and are replaced by a continuous spectrum which
has its maximum of intensity in the greenish-yellow, and gradually
fades away towards both ends of the spectrum.
   3. Becquerel mentions an observation according to which the point
of the oxyhydrogen flame takes a yellow colour when an excess of
oxygen is present.      The description of the somewhat characteristic
colour which Becquerel gives coincides exactly with the colour of the
spark in oxygen, when it shows the continuous spectrum.        According
to Plucker an excess of hydrogen shows the hydrogen lines, and it is
therefore reasonable to suppose that in Becquerel's experiment the
oxygen was sufficiently heated up to become luminous.
   The continuous spectrum must not be confounded with the con
tinuous spectrum which under high pressure forms the background to
the line spectrum.
   The Elementary Line Spectrum. — This is the spectrum which is seen
when a strong spark passes through oxygen at the atmospheric pres
sure.   It can be seen at all pressures when a jar and air break are
introduced into the circuit.       Several measurements exist of these
lines, but only those of Thalen are given in absolute measure. Thalen's
measurements, however, refer to the lines seen wheu a spark passes
through air. Under these circumstances the oxygen lines are weak
compared to the nitrogen lines, and some strong oxygen lines do not
appear at all in Thalen's list.   I have made a careful measurement of
all the lines.   Some of the weaker bands have a different appearance
and suggest, therefore, a doubt whether they are really due to oxygen ;
but they always appear with the same relative intensity, and      I  could
not obtain any evidence which would justify their exclusion from the
list of oxygen lines.
    The Compound Line Spectrum. — Plucker in his first investigation of
oxygen says it consists of four lines, one in the red, two in the
green, and one in the blue.     In his later drawing of the spectrum of
oxygen, he gives a great number of lines of which these four form a
part.   Wullner says that the four lines in question are always the

1878.]       Dr. A. Schuster on      the Spectra  of Metalloids.           387
first to appear in oxygen tubes.         Thalen and Angstrom do not give
these lines ; Huggins does not give them ; Salet does not give them.
Pliicker and Wiillner are the only observers who experimented under
the circumstances      under which the lines appear.         They come out
equally well whatever way the oxygen is prepared, whatever the
nature of the electrode, and     I  have seen them under the large glass
receiver already mentioned.        The following is the appearance of an
oxygen tube as it undergoes gradual exhaustion.
    When the pressure is sufficiently diminished to allow the spark to
pass, it shows a yellow colour and the spectrum is perfectly continuous.
Almost immediately, however, the four lines are seen in the capillary
part of the tube above the continuous spectrum.              The continuous
spectrum in the wide part is then stronger than in the narrow pari.
The four lines seem to have taken away part of the energy of the
continuous spectrum.       As the exhaustion proceeds the spark spreads
out in the wide part, and the continuous            spectrum is therefore di
minished and becomes less intense than in the capillary part ; but it
gradually loses in intensity also in the narrow part, until the four
lines stand out on a perfectly  black backgrounds      If under these circum
stances the jar and air break is inserted in the circuit, everything will
disappear and the elementary line spectrum will come out.             We have
liere as complete a transformation as from the band spectrum of nitrogen
to the Hne spectrum of nitrogen taking place under precisely the same
circumstances ; and it is therefore not unlikely that the two phe
nomena are due to the same cause.           There are two reasons why the
existence    of the compound line spectrum of oxygen as a separate
spectrum may have escaped previous observers.           There is a blue line in
the elementary line spectrum which is nearly coincident with the blue
 line of the compound line spectrnm.            It requires considerable dis
 persion to notice the difference      ; the complete   disappearance of the
 compound line spectrum has therefore escaped notice.                 The two
 green lines and the red line widen easily at higher pressures, and as
 has been remarked by Wiillner, even fuse together to a continuous
 spectrum.     If the experiment is therefore made at a pressure at which
 oxygen has a continuous      background, the disappearance of these lines
 might be taken for their widening and fusing together.                No such
 mistake is possible when the vacuum is good.          I  have not been able
  to determine   with certainty whether the red liDe seen at atmospheric
  pressure is a remnant   of the compound line spectrum, or whether it is
 a line of the elementary line spectrum closely coincident.           I am in
 clined to the former view, although it often seemed as if the line seen
 at atmospheric pressure was less refrangible than the red line of the
 compound line spectrum.          I have drawn attention in a letter to
  "
    Nature" (December 20), to the fact that the compound line spec
  trum of oxygen seems to be reversed in the sun.          T have no further

information to add on that point, and the wave-length of the lines will
 be found in my letter.
    The Spectrum of the Negative Pole. — This spectrum has first been
correctly described by Wiillner.          It consists of five bands, one of
which is too weak to be measured.          The appearance of each band has
already been described (page 384). Careful measurements of the bands
have been taken.       With regard to the explanation of the separate
spectra  found   at the negative pole in nearly all gases, I incline to the
view that they are due to separate molecular compounds which are
formed at the pole.      The following experiments seem to support that
view.    When the pressure is very small the spectrum of the negative
pole   extends   throughout that half of the tube which encloses the
negative pole, and which I shall call the negative half. If the current
be suddenly reversed      the spectrum of the negative pole will still be
seen at first, in that part which was the negative half and now is the
positive half of the tube ; but it will gradually disappear and a perma
nent state will be established, in which the spectrum of the negative
pole is, as before, only seen in the negative half.           That it is the
reversal and not the interruption of the current which produces the
result is easily proved by interrupting the current and at once closing
it again the same way, when no difference will be seen.          If, however,
the current be left interrupted for some time, say one minute, so that
any compounds which may have been formed in the negative half
may diffuse into the other half, and if then the current is closed either
the same or the opposite way, the negative spectrum will be seen at
first throughout the tube, but gradually disappear in the positive
half.
   If the current be rapidly reversed in succession, after a little while,
when the effect of the first reversal has disappeared, the permanent
state will   always   be   established   at once, and the spectrum of the
negative pole will appear only in the negative half.
   If after the last experiment the current be interrupted for some
time and then closed, the spectrum of the negative pole will at first be
seen throughout the tube, and gradually disappear in the positive
half.
   It is not  quite easy to see the explanation of the last two experi
ments.
   The experiments were all made in the Cavendish Laboratory, Cam
bridge, and I am much obliged to Professor Clerk Maxwell, for the
kindness with which he has placed the resources of the Laboratory at
my disposal.

    1. The Prague magnetic observations began in July, 1839, and
have been continued until the present date.           The observation hours,
18h., 22h., 2h., 10h., are common to the whole series, except for the
year 1853, during which observations were made only at the hours
18h., 2h., lOh.      As far, however, as the estimation of the diurnal
range    of  magnetic declination is concerned, these last three hours are
practically as good as the former four, inasmuch as the observations at
22h. are hardly ever made use of in determining the diurnal range.
    In the determinations herein recorded, magnetic disturbances are
included, and the range is a mean monthly one, obtained by comparing
together the mean values of the magnetic declination, corresponding
to the hours 18h., 22h., 2h., 10h., for any given month, and taking
the difference between the highest and the lowest of these values as
representing the mean range for that month.               There is reason to
believe that the ranges thus obtained are not greatly different from
those which would have been obtained from an hourly series of observa
tions.
                  A. Annual Variation of Declination-    Range.
    2. In   order  to obtain   this variation, the mean monthly ranges
obtained, as already described, and extending from the beginning of
1840 to the 'end of 1876, have been made use of.               From these we
obtain the -following table:    —

 declination-range,    I have treated these observations precisely in the
 way in which the Kew declination- ranges were treated (Proc. Roy. Soc,
 March 22, 1877). By this method, proportional values of the declina
 tion-range at Prague have been obtained for the middle points of each
 month for each year, and it is believed that these values are freed
 from any recognised inequality depending either on the month of the

     the way in which the corresponding         numbers were dealt with in the
     case of the Kew and Trevandrum observations, that is to say, a set of
     nine-monthly values of declination-range has been obtained, corres

     are exhibited in the following tables, up to the end of the year 1852,

     5.   The results of Tables III and IV are exhibited in Diagram I
above, in which figs. 1 and 3 represent sun-spot values, and figs. 2 and
4 Prague declination-ranges.                From these figures it will be seen that
a   number of points in the sun-spot curves may be fairly identified as
corresponding to certain points in the declination-range                      curve, but
that the latter invariably lag behind the former in time.                      It ought,
however, to be borne in mind that here the materials for comparison
are not quite of the same order of completeness as in the case of Kew
and Trevandrum.
     The lagging behind may be well seen by comparing together the
epochs of maximum and minimum sun-spot frequency with the corres
ponding epochs of declination maximum and minimum range. We
thus obtain the following result : —

     I   have   thus     examined     the most trustworthy sun-spot values and
 declination-ranges, and it          may,   I  think, be fairly concluded that there
 is an intimate relation between                the two phenomena, but that the
 points of the sun-spot ranges precede those of the declination-ranges
 in respect of time.
          Variations which seem to depend on Planetary Configurations.
      6.  The Prague proportional values herein given cannot be regarded
  as equally good for the purpose of investigating these periods with
  those derived from Kew or Trevandrum. In the Prague series we have
  only one value for each month, whereas in the Kew or Trevandrum
  series we have one value for each week.                  Inasmuch, however, as the
  Prague series is longer than either of the others we may, perhaps,
  regard it as of equal value for the purpose now in hand with the Kew
  series, while the Trevandrum series, on account of its comparatively
   short duration, can hardly be regarded as possessing more than hall
   the weight of either of the others.              If wo treat the Prague observa
   tions in the manner in which the Kew observations were treated (Proc.
   Boy. Soc, March 22nd, 1877), we obtain the following result : —

from the three observatories — Kew, Trevandrum, and Prague — giving
equal value to the results       of Kew and Prague, and half value to those
of  Trevandrum.

  These three planetary periods,    as shown     by the mean magnetic results
of the three Observatories      recorded     in Table IX, are exhibited in
Diagram II, in which fig. 2 denotes the period of Mercury, fig. 4 that
of Mercnry and Jupiter, and fig. 6 that of Mercnry and Venus, while,
as shown by the sun-spot results of Table X, they are exhibited in
figs. 1, 3, and 5, fig. 1 denoting the period of Mercury, fig. 3 that of
Mercury and Jupiter, and fig. 5 that of Mercury and Venus.
   11. If we compare together the three sun-spot periods with the
three magnetic periods, as exhibited in these diagrams, we shall remark
a great similarity between them, while, however, as we might expect,
the declination results lag behind the solar results in point of time.
   12. An inspection of the sun-spot records reveals the fact that at
times of maximum spot frequency, not only are there most spots on
the sun, but that the sun-spot inequalities         or oscillations (however
produced)    are at  such  times  much   more  prominent than during times
of minimum sun-spot frequency.           Now, if it be true that these spot
periods   are due   in a  great  measure,  if not entirely, to planetary con
figurations, we might expect that (possibly from an increase in the
susceptibility of the sun) the planetary periods herein investigated
should at times of maximum sun-spots be found to be greater than
their average value.
   13. I  have endeavoured to test this in the following manner : —
   The two most available periods are that of the orbit of Mercury
round the sun, and that of the synodic revolution of Mercury and
Jupiter.     The average sun-spot inequalities for a single period of
each of these have already been given in Table X. Now, it might be
supposed that we have only for the present purpose to take these
periods and find whether their values, during times of maximum sun-
spots, are greater than their mean values.       It however, curions and
                                                  is,                 a
interesting fact  that  (as  far back as accurate  observations extend) times
of many sun-spots correspond well with times when Jupiter               at the
                                                                             is
perihelion of Mercury.         Now,
                                  it   is  easy to  see that  on this account
alone, and apart from any increased susceptibility of the sun, we should
have sun-spot inequalities greater than the average at the times when
the two planets are in this position with respect to each other.  For
                                                                  2   d

398                     Prof. B. Stewart on               [May  16.
taking the average sun-spot inequality due to the period of Mercury
 (see Table X), we find a spot maximum somewhat before the time
                              Diagram II.
when Mercury comes to its perihelion, and again taking the sun-spot
inequality due to the period of Mercury and Jupiter (see Table X),
we have likewise a maximum somewhat before the time when Mercury

 and  Jupiter come together.        If then Jupiter be at the same ecliptical
 longitude   as that of the perihelion of Mercury, we should expect
 prominent oscillations from the effect of superposition             of the two
 periods alone, apart from any increased susceptibility of the sun.
    14. Suppose we now take a group of fifteen periods, embracing
 nearly four years, around each of the epochs when Jupiter is in this
 position with regard to Mercury.         These epochs will be as follows (as
 far as available sun-spot observations are concerned) : March, 1835,
 January, 184", November, 1858.           Let us make use of these selected
 periods to determine the inequality due to the period of Mercury, and
 also that due to the synodic revolution of Mercury and Jupiter. Even
 if there be no increase on these occasions of the susceptibility of the
sun, we shall have results greater than the mean for each of the in
equalities so determined from the effect of superposition alone.                  In
other words, the apparent Mercury inequality is mixed up with and
exaggerated by the superposition            of the Mercury and Jupiter in
equality,  while  the   apparent   Mercury    and Jupiter inequality is, in its
turn, mixed up with and exaggerated by the Mercury inequality. Now,
on the supposition that the susceptibility of the sun does not alter, we
can calculate from knowing the mean inequalities what these apparent
inequalities ought to be, because we can calculate the effect of mere
superposition of the one upon the other.               These we may call the
calculated inequalities.       Now, if there be an exaltation due, let us
imagine to an increased susceptibility of the sun on these occasions
(which are also those of numerous snn-spots) the observed planetary
inequalities should be greater than the calculated.              It will be seen
from the following table that this is really the case.

   The results of Table      XI  are exhibited in Diagram IT, in which fig. 7
gives the observed        and the calculated sun-spot inequalities for the
period of Mercury, and fig. 9 the same for the period of           Mercury and
Jupiter.
   15.  If we   now turn to declination-ranges we shall find that there
are greater oscillations or sub-periods in the value of these ranges
during times of maximum than during times of minimum sun-spots.
But on the other hand the increased value of such oscillations is by no
means so striking as in the case of sun-spots.          Mr. Broun has already
made the remark that while there is an increase in the whole declina
tion-range during times of maximum sun-spots, yet this increase is
not so marked as in the case of the spots themselves, inasmuch as we
have a considerable declination-range when there are no spots on the
.sun.   From what has now been said it would seem that a similar
remark applies to the oscillations or sub-periods of declination-range,
 which, while increasing from times of minimum to times of maximum
sun-spots, do not yet increase so strikingly as the oscillations or sub-
periods of the spots themselves.
   16. If we now treat the inequalities of magnetic declination that
appear to depend on the two most available planetary configurations
 in the manner in which we have just treated sun-spot inequalities, we
might expect the observed magnetic inequalities corresponding to
times of maximum sun-spots to be greater than the calculated in
equalities, but not to the same extent as in the case of sun-spots.
    Let us make use for this purpose of the records of the three Obser
vatories, Kew, Prague, and Trevandrum.              We cannot, however, take
absolutely the same epochs that we have taken for the sun, inasmuch as
 for the first of these, March, 1835, there are no magnetic observations.
 We may, however, take the other two epochs, January, 1847, No
 vember, 1858, and an additional one at October, 1870.            Thus we shall

 periods there is (as in those of sun-spots) an exaltation of the observed
 over the calculated values during times of maximum. sun-spot fre

the magnetism of the earth, we may imagine that the increased values
not only of the average declination-range           but also of the sub-periods
of these during times of maximum sun-spots may be due to one of two
causes,  or to both of these together.           Thus we may imagine that the
sun has an increased       magnetic     influence   during such periods, or we
may imagine that there is an increase in the magnetic susceptibility of
the earth ; or, finally, we may imagine that both of these causes operate
together.     I cannot help thinking that we have some evidence of an
increase of the magnetic susceptibility of the earth on such occasions
derived from two facts discovered by Mr. Broun.              The one is that the
magnetic    influence  of  the  moon    on  the earth  shows  traces of following
the solar period, this influence being greater during times of maximum
than during times of minimum sun-spots.              The other is that at Trevan-
drum the lunar magnetic influence, without changing its type, exhibits
an increase of valne when the sun is above the horizon at that place, as
if on such occasions there were an increase of snsceptibility to the lunar
influence.     These, however, are points which can only be determined
by a further discussion of observations.
    In conclusion, I beg to record my thanks to Mr. W. Dodgson and to
Mr. Morisabro Hiraoka, who have kindly assisted me in the work of
this paper.

         Experimental Results relating to the Rhythmical and Ex
        citatory Motions of the Ventricle of the Heart of the Frog,
        and of the Electrical Phenomena which accompany them."
        By J.Burdon Sanderson, M.D., LL.D., F.R.S., and F. J. M.
        Page, B.Sc, F.C.S. Received May 6, 1878.
    The results which are shortly stated in the following paragraphs
relate to (1) the order and duration of the rhythmical and excitatoiy
motions of the heart of the frog ; (2) the normal electrical condition
of the surface of the heart and the influence thereon of mechanical,
chemical, and thermal injuries; and (3) the characters of the normal
and of the excitatory electrical variation, and the modifications of
those characters which are induced by injuries of the surface, and
under the temporary influence of radiant heat.
          Section I. — Order and Duration of the Motions of the Heart.
    1. Duration of the Ventricular Systole. — In the rhythmically contract
ing excised heart, i.e., in the heart removed by cutting across the sinu;.
which will in this paper be called " the entire heart," the frequency of
the contractions is usually, in winter frogs, a little over 30 per minute.
The systole of the ventricle lasts about one second. The contraction
attains its maximum in a little more than half a second after its
commencement, declining at first gradually, afterwards more suddenly.
The sudden relaxation occurs between 0"'7 and 0"'9 after the com
mencement.         At the close of this period the ventricle -does not become
entirely    flaccid, for a lever resting upon it continues to descend for
about a third of a second.
    In   the rhythmically contracting heart, removed by cutting through
the auricles, to be called hereafter " the ventricle preparation," th_
duration of the ventricular systole is abont l"-35. It attains its maxi
mum at 0" 8 after its commencement, and relaxes rapidly between
1"1 and 1"3.
    In these statements the word commencement is understood *o meaa
the beginning of the hardening of the ventricle.          It is preceded by a
period of partial contraction of which the duration is about 0""15, and
which we propose to call the period of prte-contraction.
    2. Relation between the Periods of Contraction of the Auricles and Ven
tricles. — In the entire heart, contracting rhythmically, the contraction
of the auricle begins about 1"'4 before that of the ventricle, and tit
maximum of the auricular systole is attained 1""2 before that of the
 ventricle.     There is an interval of not less than half a second between
the end of the auricular contraction as indicated by the movement of
a light lever resting upon it and the beginning of that of the ventricle.
It follows from this statement that when the heart is acting at its
normal frequency, the beginning of the auricular contraction nearly

 1878.]             on Rhythmical Motions         of the Heart.             411
 coincides    with the maximum of the preceding ventricular systole, and
 that their endings are synchronous.
    3. The Stannius' Heart. — In a heart of which the rhythmical action
 has been arrested by the application of a tight ligature round the line
 of junction between the wall of the sinus and of the auricles (" Stan-
 nins' ligature "), the duration of the ventricular contraction, determined
 by electrical or mechanical excitation, is much longer than in the beating
 heart. The contraction attains its maximum from l"-4 to l"-8 after the
commencement as above defined, the ventricle remaining in full con
 traction for from 0""4 to 0"-5. Accordingly the moment at which the
sudden relaxation takes place varies between l"-8 and 2"-0.
    4. Time interval between Excitation and Contraction. — When a con
 traction is produced in a heart ligatured as above described (which
                               " Stannius' heart
 may be referred to as a                            ") by the passage through
any part of its substance of a single induction shock, a sensible delay
intervenes between the excitation and the commencement of the con
traction.      If the electrodes are in contact with two points of the
surface of the ventricle at a short distance (one millim.) from each
other, and currents of small intensity, i.e., such as are just sufficient to
produce an effect, are used, the delay may amount to three-tenths of a
second.      In this case contraction of the auricle commences after that
of the ventricle, the time interval between them being from 0"'4 to
0"'5. If the seet of excitation be the posterior surface of the left
auricle near the ligature, the auricle contracts after a delay of about
one-sixth of a second, but the ventricular contraction does not com
mence until from 0"-4 to 0"'6 later.            It frequently happens that the
ventricular systole produced by         excitation   of the auricle is followed
after an interval of inaction of about l"-3 by a second contraction of
the auricles.
Section    II. — Electrical Condition of the Surface of the Uninjured and of
                                the Injured Heart.
    5. The Uninjured Heart. — It was shown by Engelmanu in 1873,
that the surface of the uninjured resting heart is isoelectric, and
further, that the slightest mechanical or chemical injnry renders the
injured part negative.        These facts we have confirmed in numerous
observations relating     both  to the heart of the toad and of the frog.
    Nature of the Injuries Investigated. — In order to investigate the
influence of a local injury on the condition of the surface of the heart,
ite rhythmical motion must be suspended.               This may be done either
by the passage     of a  rapid  succession   of  induction  shocks in opposite
directions through the inhibitory tract, by applying to the surface a
trace of a solution of muscarin', or by Stannius' ligature. A localized
injury of the surface may be produced either by the scratch of a needle,
by touching it with hot wire (preferably a platinum wire heated elec
                                                                2 E 2

412                    Messrs. Sanderson and Page                  [May    23,
trically), by creosote, or by a fine wire covered with a thin layer of
fused nitrate of silver.
    6. Comparison    of Sound with Uninjured Spots on the Surface of the
                  —
Resting Heart. -When the resting heart is connected by its base and
apex with a galvanoscopic circuit, and one of the two isoelectrical
spots on the surface of the organ by which it is led off is injured in
any of the ways above mentioned, the injured spot is found to have
become negative to the sound surface. The electrical difference between
them may amount to O03 volt, but, as Engelmann found, that
difference usually diminishes very rapidly.
    This effect is for the most part not dependent on the distance of the
sound spot from the injured spot.         Thus, if an injured spot near the
apex    is  compared (a)     with a sound    spot 2 millims. from it, and
 (6) with another near the base, i.e., about 5 millims. distant, it is
often found that the differences between the two results arc very in
considerable.      This experiment shows that the electromotive forces
developed by injury have their seat in the immediate neighbourhood
of the injured surfaces.
    7. Influence of Radiant Heat. — When two isoelectrical points, (e.g.,
at apex and base) on the surface of the heart are led off, and one of
them is warmed by the approach of a platinum coil (about 2 millims.
in diameter) heated by a voltaic current and brought into its neigh
bourhood (3 millims. distant) for a period of one second, the warmed
spot becomes positive to the other.      The amount of difference has not
been observed to exceed one-thousandth of a Daniell.          No movement
of the needle occurs until about a second after the approach of the
coil. This effect is transitory, its duration being less than five seconds.
If the distance at which the coil is placed is diminished, the warmed
surface becomes for a moment positive, then permanently negative.
A similar effect is observed when the warming is prolonged without
diminishing the distance.
 Section    III. — Characters and Modifications  of the Electrical Variation.
    As was first observed by Kolliker and H. Miiller in 1854, an         elec
 trical disturbance or variation precedes and accompanies each con
 traction of the ventricle of the heart of the frog. In the uninjured
 heart the extent of this variation is extremely small, but is at once
 increased by injury.
    8. The Normal Variation. — In the uninjured pulsating heart the
 variation consists of two phases, viz., of an initial disturbance of
 short duration, in which the apex becomes positive, and of a much
 longer second phase, in which the apex tends to negativity. This
 statement, which relates to the heart cut off through the sinus, is also
 applicable to the organ while it still forms part of the body.        In the
 entire heart the initial phase begins a quarter of a second before the

                   on Rhythmical Motions               Heart.
 1878.J                                        of the                        413
commencement       of the hardening of the ventricle, i.e., 0"'l before the
beginning     of the prm-contraction.     (Sec. I.)   The second phase ends
about 0" "9 after the beginning of the first, of which the duration is
less than a tenth of a second.         Consequently the first phase of the
variation is completed 0"'15 before the commencement of the con
traction of the ventricle, its completion being immediately followed
by the beginning of the prse-contraction.            The second phase lasts
through the period of active contraction.
    9. Time Interval between the Excitation and the Variation. — In the
Stannius' heart when the posterior surface of the auricle near the
septum is excited, the resulting contraction (as stated in 4) follows
the excitation at an interval of about two- thirds of a second.           In this
case the first phase of the variation precedes the contraction by a very
constant interval of a quarter of a second.        When the heart is excited
from the ventricle half way between the base and apex, left side, the
delay is diminished to about a third of a second, but there is no
diminution of the interval between the initial phase of the variation
and the contraction.
    10. Effect of Injury on the Variation. — If in a normal entire heart,
led off at base and at apex, the surface of the ventricle near the base
is injured, the character of the variation is changed, the second phase
 ("apex-negative") being intensified.         If the apex is then similarly
injured, the second phase is abolished, the variation being indicated by
a single large excursion       in the direction of the first phase ("apex-
positive ").
    In the ventrical preparation, the variation, provided that the surface
 of the organ be uninjured, exhibits two phases, of which the first
is identical with the      first phase in the entire heart, the second is
 represented,   when  investigated with the aid of the capillary electro
 meter, by a larger excursion in the direction                "apex-negative,."
 of   which the    amplitude is not so great as that of the single
 excursion observed after injury of the apex.           After a time the ex
 cursion diminishes     in    extent  and   duration,   so that, finally, the
 characters of the normal variation reappear.         In a similar manner, if
 now the surface of the ventricle is injured, similar phenomena to those
 already described, with reference to the entire heart, present them
 selves, according to the seat of the injury.          If it is at the apex,
 whether it be mechanical or chemical, the whole variation is repre
 sented by a single large excursion (apex-positive)       ; if it is at the base
 there is a pra-excursion, in which the apex becomes momentarily
 positive, followed by a more prolonged excursion in the opposite direc
 tion, corresponding in direction to the second phase.
    It has been already shown, in 6, that the electrical difference be
 tween a sound and an injured surface is not materially affected by
 distance.   In like manner, the excursions which present themselves

   414         Sanderson and Page on Rhythmical Motions.              [May 23,
  when two spots, 2 millims. apart, of which one has been injured, are
  led off, nearly equal in amplitude those which are observed when the
  contacts are respectively at apex and base.
      11. Decline  of Effect after Injury.
                                           — The electrical difference between
  an injured and a sound surface begins to decline from the moment of
  the infliction of the injury which produces it. This decline is not
  accompanied by a corresponding diminution of the variation, the
  eventual decline of which is often preceded by a temporary increase.
      12. Modifications observed under the Influence of Radiant Seat. — By
  warming the surface of the ventricle in the manner described in 7,
  the following changes are produced in the character of the variation.
  In the uninjured rhythmically contracting heart, in which the variation
  has the normal character, the approach of the wire for five seconds to
  a distance of 3 millims. from the surface of the auriculo-ventricular
  groove intensifies the second phase and increases its duration.           This
  effect lasts for two minutes at most.        It subsides at first rapidly — so
 that each succeeding variation differs sensibly from the preceding one
 — afterwards more gradually.
     If the apex be similarly warmed, the second phase is either oblite
 rated or reversed, according to the time of exposure and to the
 distance of the coil.       At first the variation assumes the characters
 witnessed after injury of the apex, as described in 10 ; but here, as
 when the base of the ventricle is warmed, the effects subside rapidly
 during the first five seconds, more gradually afterwards. In both cases
 the variation has, in about two minutes, resumed its normal characters.
    In the above experiments it is seen that, although the warming
 influences the potential of the surface acted on in a direction which is
 opposite to that produced by a permanent injury, its effect on the
 variation is precisely the same, with this important difference, that it
 is transitory.     These effects can be observed whether the entire heart
 or the ventricle alone is used.
     13. Modifications   dependent    on the Seat of Excitation. — If in the
 entire heart, of which the motions have been arrested, either by
faradization of the inhibitory tract or by the Stannius' ligature, a
single contraction is induced either by a mechanical or electrical
excitation of any part of the auricles or of the aaricnlo-ventricular
groove, the excursions present the same characters as in the rhythmi
cally contracting heart.         If the excitation, whether electrical or
mechanical, be at the apex, the first phase of the variation is reversed,
i.e., the apex becomes initially negative.         In other respects the ex
cursion is unaltered.      Consequently,   if at the moment of excitation the
apex is warmed in the manner previously described in 12, the large
single excursion (apex-positive) is seen to be preceded by a momentary
pr»-excursion in the opposite direction.

    The brain of Mugil cephalus consists of three pairs and one unpaired
tuberosity above, and two. below.
    The most anterior pair are the olfactory lobes. From the anterior
to posterior end they present four layers ; first, olfactory nerve
 fibres with cell-like swellings upon them ; second, coarsely granular
neuroglia, with incipient glomeruli olfactorii, and large tripolar nerve
cells ; third, small usually unipolar cells each in its own space in the
neuroglia ; the whole collected into a rounded mass ; fourth, nerve fibres
proceeding from this mass to the second pair of tuberosities, the cere-
liral lobes, which consist of finely granular neuroglia, in which small
cells are situated towards the circumference, and larger cells towards
the centre, each of the latter contained in a lymph space.
    The third pair of tuberosities, the optic lobes, corresponding with
the corpora quadrigemina, are formed of a thin layer of nervous sub
stance, enclosing a ventricle ; this layer, the tectum, consists of seven
strata : first, granular neuroglia ; second, oblique fibres with fusiform
cells; third, radiating fibres; fourth, oblique fibres; fifth, transverse
fibres ; sixth, cells of a small size ; seventh, connective tissue with an
epithelial lining to the ventricle of this lobe. Within this ventricle,
on the floor, are two tuberosities, tori semicirculares, faced with con
nective tissue, and containing small unipolar cells arranged along the
margin. Behind, the ventricle in question is closed by a process from
the unpaired tuberosity (cerebellum), which occupies the position of
the valve of Vieussens ; this is the valvula cerebelli ; it forms a fold in
the ventricle, and joins a longitudinal ridge situated along the con
tiguous inner margins of the tecta; on the side of the valvula are
processes more or less developed in different fishes.
    The unpaired tuberosity is the cerebellum ; it has a structure com
parable to that of the cerebellum of the newly -born human infant.
    The tuberosities below are the hypoaria, which receive fibres from
the ventral surface of the medulla oblongata behind, and from the
cerebral lobes in front. Between the two hypoaria is the pituitary
body, and also a saccus vasculosus.
    The medulla oblongata behind the cerebellum      has two tuberosities,
constructed in the same way      as the tori semicirculares ; they are the
vagal tuberosities.

   Ventricles : —
   The fourth ventricle consists of two parts, one part beneath the   cere
bellum, the other part, a deep fissure between the vagal tuberosities ;
they communicate with each other by means of a narrow quadrangular
passage.
   The ventricle of optic lobe is simply the remains of the ventricle of
the corpora quadrigemina in foetus, and now part of the aqueduct of
Sylvius.
   The third ventricle, between the cerebral lobes and the optic lobe,
communicates behind with the last, and below with pituitary body by
means of the infundibulum ; above, it is closed in by the stalk of the
pineal gland.
   Origins of nerves : —
   The olfactory nerve arises from the olfactory lobe.
   The optic nerve arises by three roots, first from the tectum lol i
opici, second from the torus semicircularis, third from the hypoarium.
   The motor oculi arises from a ganglion beneath the floor of the
aqua?ductus sylvii ; it partially decussates.
   The trochlearis arises from anterior part of the base of the cere
bellum.
   The trifacial arises by three roots from beneath the anterior end of
the crura cerebelli ; its deep origin is from three distinct points ; first,
from cells beneath the floor of anterior part of the fourth ventricle;
second, from the external lateral part of the spinal cord;    third, from
the central part of the vagal tuberosity.
   The abducens arises from two small ganglia in the ventral horn of
grey matter beneath the narrow part of the fourth ventricle.
   The acusticus arises from the lateral part of the medulla oblongata
in the region of the ganglion of the vagus.
   The glossopharyngeal      has a separate origin in mugil, in other
fishes it is a branch of the acusticus, in others again it is a branch of
the vagus ; here it arises from the grey matter covering the narrow
 part of the fourth ventricle.
   The vagus arises by two roots, one from a ganglion beneath the floor
of posterior end of the fourth ventricle; the other from the cere
bellum, and from the grey matter covering the narrow part of the
fourth ventricle.
   The first spinal nerve, although passing through a foramen in the
exoccipal, takes the place of the hypoglossal, rises by dorsal and
ventral roots, forms with the second spinal nerve the brachial plexus,
and supplies the region of the tongue.
   The spinal nerves have a ganglion on the dorsal root.
   The commissura ansulata, placed at the exit of the trochleares nerves,
is partly a longitudinal and partly a transverse commissure ; it first
appears on the external and lateral part of the medulla, opposite the

posterior part of the fourth ventricle, passes forward, and at the point
above-named ascends on the external edge of the medulla, and forms the
commissure of the tecta lobi optici, at the base of their longitudinal
ridges above described ; this commissure also forms a decussation         of
fibres beneath the ganglion of the trochlearis.
   The anterior commissure        of the brain is situated      between  the
cerebral lobes.
   The posterior commissure is situated on the anterior part of the
floor of the ventricle of the optic lobe behind the third ventricle.
   A  deeper commissure connects the region on each side of the third
ventricle passing through the hypoaria in front of the infundibulum.
   Two transverse commissures         exist in the spinal cord, one ventral,
one dorsal.
   The ventral longitudinal columns of the cord contain two fibres of
gigantic size, one on each side ; these decussate opposite the origin
of the   trifacial on the floor of anterior part of the fourth ventricle ;
the  longitudinal columns pass to the internal part of the floor of ven
tricle of the optic lobe, about the posterior end of the fourth ventricle.
   The lateral columns of the cord pass forward, and are lost outside
the last.

   In the year 1866 was published in the " Proceedings          of the Royal
Irish Academy" a paper        " On the Equations of Circles," which con
tained extension of many known theorems.           Thus it was proved in it
that the same forms of equation which are true for a circle inscribed
in a plane or spherical triangle hold also when the right lines in the
one case, or the great circles in the other, are replaced by any three
circles in the plane or sphere, and it was shown that the transformed
equations represented the pairs of circles which touch the three
given circles.     The results for circles on the sphere were still further
extended, namely, to conies having double contact with a given conic.
The paper contained, in addition to these fundamental investigations,
many collateral ones on allied subjects.

    The memoir, of which now give an abstract, extends the results of
the foregoing paper to a polygon of any number of sides inscribed or
circumscribed to a given circle.       It is proved for the case of circum
scribed figures, that the sides of the polygon may be replaced both on
the plane and sphere, by circles touching the given circle; and

again, these results may be still further extended to conies having
double contact with a given conic.  A very large amount of geometry
is embraced in the paper, and many subjects of much interest are dis
cussed, showing the great fertility of the methods of investigation
employed.
   The following is an outline of the extensions of known theorems
which the paper contains.
   If a polygon of n sides, whose equations are a, 0, 7, £, &<s., and whose
lengths are a, b, c, d, &c, be inscribed in a circle, the equation of the
circle is      a   factor in the equation      ?+_+-+-+ &c,                             =0, or say in
                                               a    y3        7         S
and    if it   be on the sphere       in the equation,
                                         fan
The equation 2                        when the polygon consists of n sides, will
                         ^-^=0,
denote besides the circle a residual curve of the degree (» — 3).                                       A
considerable portion of the paper is occupied with the discussion                                       of
the properties of this curve.   More especially in the particular case
11—6, where the residual curve is a cubic.  The following theorem may
be given as an instance.     " When the polygon is a hexagon the line
abode f
? + P + l+!L+L+t=0,                 which is called its axis, is the satellite with
     cubic of
respect to the                      each side of the hexagon, and also of its Pas
cal's line."
  The properties of the inscribed polygon derived from the equations
may be reciprocated,              and we get tangential equations of the form
                                        s/coyA\                   0(
giving properties of circumscribed polygons.     In this last equatio
A, B, C, &c, denote the angles of the polygon, and \, fi, v, &c., perpen
diculars from its angular points on any tangent to the circle.        The
same tangential equation holds both for the plane and sphere.
  If    a polygon whose            sides are a,    fi,   7,   £,       <fec.   ...*>,    be circumscribed
to a circle, the equation of the circle              is   a       factor in the polyzomal curve

420               Mr. G. A. Darwin on      the  Bodily Tides      [May 23,
the earth's surface, that the belief is not yet extinct that we live on a
thin shell over a sea of molten lava.       It appeared to me, therefore, to
be  of interest to investigate   the consequences which would arise from
the supposition    that the matter   constituting the earth is of a viscous
or imperfectly elastic nature.      In this paper I follow out these hypo
theses, and it will be seen that the results are fully as hostile to the
idea of any great mobility of the interior of the earth as are those of
Sir W. Thomson.
   I begin by showing that the equations of flow of an incompressible
viscous fluid have precisely the same form as those of strain of an
incompressible elastic solid, at least when inertia is neglected.    Hence,
every problem about the strains of the latter has its analogue touching
the flow of the former. This being so, the solution of Sir W. Thom
son's problem of the bodily tides of an elastic sphere may be adapted
to give the bodily tides of a viscous spheroid.        Sir W. Thomson, how
ever, introduces the effects of the mutual gravitation of the parts of
the sphere, by a synthetical method, after he has found the state of
internal strain of an elastic sphere devoid of gravitational power
 The parallel synthetical method becomes, in the case of the viscous
 spheroid, somewhat complex, and I have preferred to adapt the solution
analytically so as to include gravitation.
    The solution is only applicable when the disturbing potential is
 capable of expansion as a series of solid harmonics, and it appears
 that each harmonic term in the potential acts independently of all
 others ; it is thus only necessary to consider a typical term in the
 potential.
    It is shown finally that if />, », v, be the velocities of the fluid (at
 a point whose polar co-ordinates in the sphere are r, 0, 0,) radially,
 and along and perpendicular to the meridian ; /t the coefficient of
 viscosity; iit'S; the disturbing potential, a solid harmonic of degree i;

which satisfies the condition of expansibility as a series of solid
harmonics.
  When the disturbing potential wr'Sf is zero, and when r=a + «i is
the eqnation to the free surface initially, then the equation to the
surface at the time t is given by r=a + <r,-, where
    This gives the law of the subsidence of inequalities on the surface
of a viscous globe under the influence of simple gravitation ; and it is
suggested that some light may possibly be thrown thereby on the laws
of geological subsidence and upheaval. It appears from this formula
that inequalities of wide extent will subside much more quickly than
wrinkles.
    The rate is found at which a rotating spheroid would adjust itself
to a new form of equilibrium, when its axis of figure is not coincident
with that of rotation ; and the law is established which was assumed
in a former paper.f
    The case is next considered where Sj is a surface harmonic of the
second order, multiplied by a simple time harmonic — that is to say,
 S,= S cos (rf+i/). This is the assumption appropriate for the tidal
problem.      The forces in this case do not form a rigorously equilibrat
ing system ; but there is a couple of the second order of small
 quantities called into existence, the consideration of which is deferred
 to a future paper.

     A  comparison of the numbers in the first column with the viscosity
 of pitch at near the freezing temperature (when                        I  found by rough
 experiments that its viscosity was abont 13 X 10*), shows how enor
 mously stiff the earth must bo to resist the tidally distorting influence
 of the moon. It may be remarked that pitch at this temperature is
 hard, apparently solid and brittle ; and if the earth was not very far
 Rtiffer than pitch, it would comport itself sensibly like a perfect fluid,
 and there would be no ocean tides at all.                     It follows, therefore, that
 no very considerable portion of the interior                     of the earth can even
 distantly approach the fluid condition.
     This does not, however, seem conclusive against the existence of
 bodily tides in the earth of the kind here considered ; for, under the
 enormous pressures which must exist in the interior of the earth, even
 the solidest substances might be induced to flow to some extent like a
 fluid of great viscosity.
    The theory of the bodily tides of an " elastico- viscous " spheroid is
next developed. The kind of imperfection of elasticity considered is
where the forces requisite to maintain the body in any strained con
figuration diminish in geometrical progression, as the time increases in
arithmetical progression.                There are two constants which define the
mechanical nature of this sort of solid : .first, the coefficient of rigidity
n, at the instant immediately after the body has been strained ; and
second, " the modulus of the time of relaxation of rigidity " t, which
is the time in which the force requisite to maintain the body in its
strained position has diminished to e_1 or -368 of its initial value.                         I
am not aware that there is any experimental justification for the
assumption of such a law ; but after considering the various physical

   The equations of flow of such an ideal solid have been given (with some
assistance from Professor Maxwell) by Mr. Butcher* and they are such
that,  ifthe body be incompressible, and if inertia be neglected, they
may be written in exactly the same form as the equations of flow of                                   a
purely viscous        fluid, the! coefficient                            merely       replacing     the

that of Sir W. Thomson's problem of the purely elastic sphere.           This
hypothesis     therefore intermediate between those of pure viscosity and
                 is
pure elasticity.
  Sir William Thomson worked out numerically the bodily tides of
elastic spheres with the rigidities of glass and of iron and tables of            ;
results are here given for those rigidities, with various times of re
laxation of rigidity, for the semi-diurnal and fortnightly tides.
   It appears that      the time of relaxation of rigidity
                             if                                about one               is
quarter of the tidal period, then  the reduction of  ocean tide   does not
differ much from what        would be  it    the spheroid were perfectly
                                                           if
elastic. The acceleration of high    tide, however, still remains consider
able and
      ;      like observation may be made in the case of pure viscosity
                 a
approaching rigidity.    This leads me to think that one of the most
promising ways of detecting such tides in the earth, would be by the
determination of the periods of maximum and minimum in a tide of
long period in high latitude.

   It  is then shown that the effects of inertia, which had been neglected
in finding the laws of the tidal movements, cannot be such as to mate
rially affect the accuracy of the results.
                                     I
    In the first part of this paper followed Sir "W. Thomson in using
the equilibrium theory for the determination of the amount of reduc
tion of ocean tides. But that theory is acknowledged on all hands to
be very faulty in its explanation of tides of short period ; hence a
dynamical investigation of the effects of a bodily yielding of the earth
on a tide of short period in a shallow equatorial canal appeared likely
to be interesting.     This investigation is carried out in the second part
of the paper. The problem is simplified by supposing the circular
 canal developed into a straight canal, whose bottom is constrained to
execute a simple harmonic wave motion.
    The result shows that the height of the ocean tide relatively to the
nucleus bears the same relation to the height of tide on a rigid nucleus
 as in the equilibrium theory, and that the alteration of phase is the
same.      This seems to increase the force of Sir W. Thomson's argu
ment as to the rigidity of the earth.
    The chief practical result of this paper may be summed up by say
 ing, that it is strongly confirmatory of the view that the earth has a
 very great effective rigidity ; but its chief value is, that it forms a
necessary first chapter to the investigation of the precession of viscous
and imperfectly elastic spheroids — an investigation which I hope to
 complete very shortly.

                                  CHC1I
 preparing by two processes.
    First Process. — A quantity of iodide of ethylidene, which had been
 prepared by Gustavson's method, and heated to 160° C. but not distilled,
 was vigorously agitated for some time with a weak solution of chloride
 of iodine without the application of heat.      The excess of chloride was
 then poured off, and the product well washed with dilute potash and
 distilled. Almost the entire quantity passed over between 110 and
 150° C.     This yielded, on fractioning, a large quantity of fluid boiling
 between 116 and 120° C, most between 117 and 119.°           This was the
 body in question.      The chloride of iodine used in this process was

 1878.]          Chlor-iodide and Brom-iodide         of Ethylidene.            425
 prepared by passing washed chlorine into 4 oz. of water, holding 400
grains of iodine in suspension, till almost all the iodine was dissolved.
The vessel containing the iodine must be surrounded with cold water,
and repeatedly shaken during the passage of the gas.
    This method is quite analogous to that by which                 I  obtained its
isomer, the chlorio-dide of ethylene.*
    Second Process. — One molecule of iodide of aluminium (A12T6) was
dissolved in three times its weight of dry carbon disulphide, and
added drop by drop without exposure to air to six molecules of chlo
ride of ethylidene (C2H1C13) diluted with an equal volume of the disul
phide. The chloride of ethylidene must be surrounded with ice, and
kept in a state of continual agitation during the addition of the
aluminium iodide solution.             By mixing the reacting bodies in this
way, the chloride is always in excess, and only one atom of chlorine in
each molecule is supplanted by one of iodine.               After the addition of
the aluminium iodide, the product was filtered through asbestos,
washed with water, and heated in a water-bath to drive off the carbon
disnlphide.t       The residue, which had been previously washed with
dilute potash, on being heated above 100°, commenced to distil at
110°, and between that temperature and 155° C. about two-thirds of
it passed over.         (The liquid distilling above 155° was iodide of
ethylidene). This yielded, on fractioning, a large quantity of an oil
boiling at the same temperature, and having the same properties as
that prepared by the first process.               On submitting this body to
            I
analysis obtained        the  following   numbers   :

    Chlor-iodide of ethylidene has a sweet taste, and is almost colour
less when freshly prepared.           Its specific gravity at 19° C. is = 2-054.
It distils without decomposition between 117 and 119° C. It will be
observed that its boiling point is 20 degrees lower than that of its
isomer, the chlor-iodide of ethylene (137° C), and is intermediate
between those of the iodide (177° C.) and chloride of ethylidene
(58° C).
    Of these processes, the second is easier of execution             and yields a
larger product.

   Brom-iodide of ethylidene is nearly colourless when freshly prepared.
It has a sweet taste, and distils without decomposition between 142
and 144° C.         This is about 20 degrees lower than the boiling point of
its  isomer,    the  brom-iodide of ethylene (163° C). It refuses to become
solid even when surrounded with a mixture of ice and salt, differing
in this respect also from its isomer.                  Heated with alcoholic potash
it yielded a volatile vapour containing bromine, probably bromide of
 vinyl, and iodide of potassium.
    This body is probably identical with those obtained by Pfaundlerf
and by ReboulJ by exposing bromide of vinyl to the action of hydri-
odic acid.       The boiling points of their compounds agree pretty well
with each       other  and also with mine.
    I  am at present engaged in studying the behaviour of these com
 pounds towards several reagents.
    I   have to thank my young pupil,                Mr. Harrington, for his valuable
 assistance during the progress of this research.

to ascertain the specific gravity of vapours at a high temperature        that,
in spite of the interest which attaches to this subject, but few addi
tions have been made in our knowledge in this direction since the
researches of Deville and Troost.
   The present experiments, of which this notice contains the first
results, have been made with the object of so simplifying the process
as to render it easy to determine the specific gravity of the vapours of
bodies possessing high boiling-points with a degree of accuracy suffi
cient for the purpose of controlling their molecular weights.
   The method consists in vaporizing the substance under examina
tion in long-necked glazed porcelain globes of known capacity placed
in a muffle raised to bright redness. The temperature of the globe is
ascertained by a calorimetric determination made with heavy platinum
weights placed in the muffle, this determination being checked by the
simultaneous insertion in the muffle of a second globe containing
mercury.
   The porcelain globes having a capacity of abc-ut 300 cub. cen-
tims., and containing from 3 to 9 grams of substance, are closed by
loosely fitting stoppers of baked clay, and then gradually introduced
in the muffle. After remaining there until no further escape of vaponr
is observed, and until the temperature has become constant, the globes
are quickly withdrawn from the muffle and their contents removed
and analysed, the temperature being in each case ascertained by the
calorimetric method at the time of withdrawal of the globe. The fol
lowing determinations of the specific gravity of mercury vapour serve
to show the reliability of the method     :

   Before determining the specific gravity of the vaponr of thallium
chloride it was ascertained that this compound does not give off free
chlorine when volatilized at a red-heat, and that the sublimate contains
thallium and chlorine in the atomic ratio of equality.
   In each experiment the total amount of thallium and of chlorine
remaining in the globe was determined by analysis, and the specific
gravity calculated from their sum.

    The specific gravity of thallium chloride vapour calculated upon the
supposition that the molecular weight of the compound is 238*07, and
its formula TlCl, is 8'49.
    Four determinations of the specific gravity of mercury vapour made
simultaneously with four of the above experiments gave as a mean the
number 6'0 instead of 6' 728.
    The specific gravity of the vapour of lead chloride was made in a
similar way, but the temperature required for complete volatilization
is much higher than that needed in the case of the last compound.
The residue left in the globes was completely soluble in hot water, and
contained lead and chlorine in the proportion of one atom of the
former to 2'08 of the latter.

       Brachiopoda dredged by H.M.S. Challenger.'               By Thomas
       Da\tdson% F.R.S. Received May 8, 1878.
    At  the request of Professor Sir Wyville Thomson,        I  have under
taken the examination, description, and illustration of the Brachiopoda
                   '           '
 dredged by the Challenger Expedition.
    Very little seems to have been   known with respect to recent Brachi

 1878.J           Mr. T. Davidson.     On Brachiopoda.               429
opoda before the middle of last century ; and even during the period
extending from 1750 to 1800, the information relating to the recent
species was, with some exceptions, meagre and often unsatisfactory.
   A  Brachiopod, until within the last fifty years, was considered a
great rarity in all collections, and no one could boast of possessing
more than a very limited number of species and specimens.          Much
uncertainty was also felt as to their nature, and the position they
should occupy among the Invertebrata.         They were generally sup
posed to be referable to the genus Anomia, and were very quaintly
described by some of the earlier naturalists.     Several more serious
and better informed observers appeared soon after 17.53, such as
Linne, Pennant, Midler, Lamanon, Pallas, Grundler, and a few others,
who were able, in a measure, to prepare the way for the important
discoveries reserved for the more favoured naturalists of the present
century.
   The animal of the Brachiopod had attracted the attention of Pen
nant in 1766, Grundler in 1774, Miiller in 1776, Poli in 1791,
Lamanon and Cuvier in 1797; but no regular anatomical dissections
bad been executed, and their observations seemed, in a great mea
sure, to be limited to the labial appendages, mantle, and some other
minor details.
   This most important inquiry was, however, subsequently admira
bly followed out by such excellent zoologists and anatomists as
Cuvier, Owen, Huxley, Vogt, Macdonald, Hancock, Gratiolet, Lacaze-
Dnthiers, King, E. Deslongchamps, and others, to whose works the
reader is referred, as it would not be possible in the limited space
                                                           '             '
devoted to the description of the species dredged in the Challenger
Expedition, to write a treatise on the history of the class, nor to refer
to the fossil genera and species, which vastly outnumber those inhabit
ing the present seas.
   Restricting ourselves, therefore, to the recent species, we may ob
serve that the correct knowledge we now possess with respect to their
geographical and bathymetrical distribution is mainly due to the
numerous Governmental and private dredging expeditions carried out
during the last forty years. Before that period, very few reliable data
were in our possession; and as these dredging expeditions proceed,
the more will our knowledge become extended.
   The admirable report of Professor E. Forbes, " On the Mollusca
and Radiata of the iEgean Sea," published by the British Association
for the Advancement of Science, for 1843, shadowed forth the im
portant results that might be obtained by well conducted and equipped
Expeditions ; but even now we are wanting in information with respect
to the bathymetrical distribution of some twenty-six of the known
living species.
   In  his excellent memoir,
                              " Uber die Wohnsitze dcr

 430                   Mr. T. Davidson.            On Brachiopoda.              [May    23,
 1859, Professor E. Suess recapitulates all the then known data respecting
 the geographical distribution and depths at which Brachiopoda live ;
 since then, our knowledge has been very considerably extended ; and
 it has become evident from direct observation that the Brachiopoda are
 widely but sparingly distributed over the depths of the sea, though
 of course they are more numerous both in species and individuals at
 depths of less than 500 fathoms.               They are much localised, and prefer
 rocky, stony, and        coralline   sea  bottoms, to soft or muddy ones.
     The entire collection of Brachiopoda brought home by the ' Chal
           '
lenger Expedition, numbering several hundred specimens, was placed
 in my hands by Sir Wyville Thomson, on the 11th of August, 1877.
The specimens were in an excellent state of preservation, and had
been put into bottles of spirits, with a correct indication of the sta
tions, latitude, longitude, depth, bottom-temperature,                   and the nature
of the sea-bed whence they had been obtained.                        Thus, reliable and
invaluable data accompanied each specimen, which I have in every
instance reproduced in the pages relating to this Expedition.                       Some
times but one specimen           had    been   dredged    at   a station, while at other
times two or more species or specimens were brought to the surface.
It must, however, be noted that, in addition to the 361 dredging
stations included in the printed instructions, the naturalists of the
                 '
'
  Challenger dredged very often in shallow water.
    We learn from the " list of observing stations," recorded during
the voyage of 68,890 miles, that there were 354 of such stations, at
most of which
                       " a fair sample of the bottom fauna was collected by
means of the dredge or trawl."                  But Brachiopoda do not appear to
have been obtained more than thirty times.                   Although the number of
specimens was large, they represent                   28  or   29 species only.         The
greatest depth at which any living Brachiopod was obtained was
2,600 fathoms,          the greatest      depth    dredged     being, on one occasion,
4,575 fathoms.

by Pi-ofessor E. Saess, in 1861 by Lovell Reeve and myself, and in

1870 and 1873 by Mr. W. H. Dall.             I have in the above list given all
the ranges of depth at present known to me ; but of twenty-six species
no information is given by the original authors, and later research has
not revealed it. . It is to be hoped that future dredging expeditions
will supply the desiderata. It may also be stated that some twenty
of the recent species have also been found in the upper tertiary forma-
I ions.  No permanent list of the recent species can at present be tabu
lated; but in order that the desired result may ultimately be attain
able, it is necessary from time to time to lay before the public the
progress that has been achieved in the right direction, pointing out at
the same time the unavoidable deficiencies in our knowledge.                The
ranges in depth recorded in our list are even now sufficient to warrant
us in arriving at certain general inductions.               Thus, for the sake
of argument we will put down the number of recorded species and
named varieties at nominally 135, viz , 125 so termed species and 11
named varieties, a number which will certainly have to be hereafter
reduced.     As nothing is known respecting some 25 or 26 so called
species, and which are given in the list, the number upon which we
may venture to generalize would be about 107.                    In approximate
numbers we find,
           From shore to 500 fathoms, some                   97 species.
              Or named varieties, 12 of these range up to
              1,000 fathoms or less.

              range from 690 to 2,400 fathoms.

              Of  these  Ter. Wyvilli ranges from 1,035 to
              2,600 fathoms, the greatest depth at which
              any species has been found.

    Thus, out of 107 species or named varieties, some 57, or about half
the known species, were dredged at depths of about 100 fathoms ;
20 to 25 at low water mark, or from 5 to 10 fathoms ; the larger
number up to 50 or 60 fathoms.            These facts indicate that the greater
bulk of known species preferred to live at comparatively small or
moderate depths, but few in depths ranging up to 500 fathoms, and
that Brachiopoda are specifically rare at depths varying from 500 to
2,600 fathoms.
    It  must, however,      in fairness be noted that the number of deep
sea dredgings is small when compared with those made in seas of
moderate depths ; and, consequently,             that a proportionablj larger
n amber of species may be hereafter expected when a larger area of
oceanic abysses have been explored.             I  do not, however, anticipate
 that the general results will much alter the conclusions formulated in

             is
by 17 in width, and       in depth,

                                                is
parent, smooth, and thin.       It has a wide concave depression in the
dorsal valve, and a fold in the ventral one with        small simple loop in
                                                                         a
the interior of the dorsal valve.     It bears much external resemblance
to several species of Waldheimia of the W. carinata group, but differs
from the forms of that group by the shape of its loop. It was dredged
at four stations, lat. 42° 41' S., long. 134° 10' E., depth 2,600 fathoms                       ;

long. 82° 11' W., depth 1,450 fathoms; a small example was also got
 not far from Falkland Island, depth 1.035 fathoms.
                               2.   Terebratula Moseleyi, n. sp.
  The shell  broadly oval, semi-globose, and rather longer than wide,
                     is
white and smooth, loop short, simple; length 23, breadth 21, depth
14 millims.
  Five examples were obtained all about the same size. It seems to
be a smaller            species than T. vitrea and T. Cubensu, its nearest allies,
is   less elongated and not as convex.                It was     dredged west of Kerguelen
Island, lat.        46° 47' S., long. 51° 37'        E.   ;   depth 210 fathoms.
                              3.    Terebratulina     Wyvilli,      n. sp.
     This    is     the most remarkable          species of Brachiopod brought home

by the expedition.        The shell is large, trigonal, broadest anteriorly,
tapering posteriorly ; valves moderately convex, somewhat flattened
along the middle, and abruptly bent inwards close to the margin. The
loop is short, simple, and rendered annular by the union of the oral
processes.    The surface of valves is marked by fine radiating lines ;
length 63, width 50, depth 35 millims.
    A unique specimen of this fine species was dredged off Culebra
Island, to the north-west of St. Thomas, in the West Indies, at a depth
of 390 fathoms.
    Terebratulina Wyvilli greatly exceeds in dimensions the largest
known species of the sub-genus both recent and fossil.
              4.  Terebratula or Terebratulina   (?) Dalit, n. sp.
    Of this small shell only one dead specimen was dredged, measuring
8  millims. in length by 5j in width, and 4 in depth.           The loop was
incomplete,    but seems to have been short as in Terebratula and
Terebratulina. In shape the shell is longitudinally oval, thin, globose,
glassy, and semi-transparent, slightly depressed anteriorly. Exteriorly
the surface of valves is covered with fine radiating striae, with shorter
ones interpolated between the larger ones.         It was dredged in lat. 34°
37' W., long. 140° 32' E. ; depth 1,875 fathoms, together with Discina
Atlantica.
                      5.  Terebratulina (?) Murray!,  n. sp.
    Of this species some eleven examples were dredged.             It is a small
 shell not exceeding 4 millims. in length by 3^ in width, and 2 in depth.
 In external shape it is obscurely trigonal, about as broad as long ;
 broadest anteriorly, tapering posteriorly, white, surface marked by a
 small number of strong radiating ribs. Loop short, simple. Dredged,
 lat. 28° 33' S., long. 177° 50' W., near Kermadoc Isle, south of Fejee
 Isles, in a depth of 600 fathoms.
    This is a remarkable and puzzling species, for while its shell and
 loop partake of the character of Terebratulina, its labial appendages
 seem to differ very materially from those of the sub-genus to which it
 is provisionally referred.
                       6.  Waldheimia Kerguelensis, n.   sp.
     Of this fine species   a great number of specimens were dredged by
                    '

       '
 Isle, in a depth of 100 fathoms, and also in lat. 50° 4' S., long. 71°
 22' E., at a depth of 150 fathoms.
     The shell is elongated oval, ventricose, smooth, yellowish-white;
 ventral valve deeper than the dorsal one, and more or less prominently
  keeled by the presence of a wide, slightly convex fold, and in the
  dorsal valve by a slight mesial depression or sinus commencing about

 the middle of the valve and extending to the front, and more or less
 distinctly margined on either side by a faint raised line or ridge : beak
 incurved and truncated by a small circular foramen, loop long and
 reflected ; length 44, width 34, depth 29 millims.
                          7.   Waldheimia Wy villi,    n. up.
    Only one example         of this shell was dredged off Valparaiso; lat.
 33° 31' S., long. 74° 43' W., at a depth of 2,160 fathoms.
    The shell is longitudinally oval, very thin, semi-transparent, smooth,
light brownish-yellow ; valves moderately convex, and rather flattened
along the middle in dorsal valve.             Loop long, re9ected ; length 19,
width 14, depth 10 millims.
    In external   shape    it  somewhat approaches to Waldheimia            cranium,
but differs from it    in several respects.
                            8.  Terebratella  Frieli, n. gp.
    Shell small ovate, smooth, white; valves moderately convex, loop
doubly attached ; length 10, width 9, depth 5 millims. Two examples
were dredged off Halifax, lat. 41° 15' N., long. 65° 45' W., in 1,340
fathoms ; and two other specimens, which appear to be referable to the
same species, near the Philippine Islands in from 82 to 102 fathoms.
    I have felt much uncertainty with respect to the identification of
this species.     Dr. Gwyn Jeffreys considers it to be new, and to be
referable to the genus Terebratella.
                          9.   Megerlia (?) incerta,   n. sp.
    This is a new and very remarkable species.             I  did not like to sacri
fice one  of  the  two  or    three  specimens   in  the  attempt to develop the
loop, and therefore am unable to pronounce any decided opinion as to
the genus among the Terebratulidas, to which it should be referred.
The strong general resemblance it bears to Megerlia truncata induces
me to provisionally leaving it in that genus.               In external shape it is
semi- circular, small, somewhat broader than long, hinge-line, straight,
with obtuse cardinal angles, semi-transparent, whitish ; valves very
moderately convex, ventral valve a little deeper than the opposite one,
and slightly longitudinally depressed along the middle ; beak small
and truncated by an incomplete circular foramen laterally margined
by small deltidial plates ; beak margin very sharply defined, leaving
l>etween them and the hinge-line a sharply defined narrow area ; sur

          Electrodynamic Qualities of Metals.* Part VII. Effects
       of Stress on the Magnetization of Iron, Nickel, and Cobalt."

       Philosophy in the University of Glasgow. Received May 22,
       1878.
                                     (Abstract.)
   This paper commences with a detailed description of a series of
experiments on the effects of stress on the magnetism of soft iron, of
which some first results were described in a preliminary notice, com
municated to the Royal Society on the 10th of June, 1875, and pub
lished in the " Proceedings." A few months later, the author found
that he had been anticipated by Villarit in the most remarkable of
those results — that showing increase or diminution of magnetization
by longitudinal pull, according as the magnetizing force is less than,
or greater than, a certain critical value.
    In the first series of experiments described in this paper, the amount
of the magnetizing force is varied through a range of values from zero
to 900, on a scale on which about 12£ is the value of the vertical com
ponent of the terrestrial magnetic force at Glasgow, and the effects of
hanging on and taking off weights of 7 lbs., 14 lbs., and 21 lbs., in            J
changing the induced magnetism, are observed.                    The experiments
were made at ordinary atmospheric temperatures, and at temperature
 100° C. The results are shown in curves, of which the abscissas
represent the magnetizing forces and other ordinates, the change of
                                 " ons " and " offs " of the
magnetism produced by                                             weight while the
magnetizing torce is kept constant.              The Villari critical value was

     For other features the curves themselves    as  given in the paper may
be looked to.
     Later experiments on the effects of pull transverse to the direction
of magnetization showed correspondingly opposite effects to those of
longitudinal pull, but with a " critical value
                                                    "
                                                      of magnetizing force
nearly twice as great. That for longitudinal pull, according to the
preceding figures, was about 23 times the Glasgow vertical force ; for
the transverse pull the critical value found was about 60 times the
 Glasgow vertical force. The transverse pull was produced by water
pressure in the interior of a gun-barrel applied by a piston and lever
at one end.      Thus a pressure of about 1,000 lbs. per square inch,
applied and removed at pleasure, gave effects on the magnetism in
duced in the vertical gun-barrel by the vertical component of the
terrestrial magnetic force, and, again, by an electric current through
a coil of insulated copper wire round the gun-barrel. When the force
 magnetizing the gun-barrel was anything less than about 60 times the
 Glasgow vertical force, the magnetization was found to be less with
 the pressure on than off.   When the magnetizing force exceeded that
critical value, the magnetization was greater with the pressure on than
off.    The residual (retained) magnetism was always less with the
                                                " ons " and " offs " of the
pressure on than off (after ten or a dozen
pressure to shake out as much of the magnetization as was so loosely
 held as to be shaken out by this agitation).
    The vertical component of the terrestrial magnetic force at Glasgow
is about -43 c.-g.-s. units. Hence the critical values of the magnetiz
 ing force for longitudinal and transverse pull are approximately 10 and
 25 c.-g.-s. units.  With any magnetizing force between these limits
the effect of pull whether transverse or longitudinal must be to
 diminish the magnetization.     Hence it is to be inferred that equal pull
in all directions would diminish, and equal positive pressure in all
 directions would increase, the magnetization under the influence of
 force between these critical values, and through some range above and
 below them ; and not improbably for all amounts, however large or
 small, of the magnetizing force (?) ; but further experiment is necessary
 to answer this question.
    The opposite effects of longitudinal and transverse pull, for magne
 tizing forces not between the critical range of from 10 to 25 c.-g.-s.
 units, show an aeolotropic magnetic susceptibility in iron under aeolo-
 tropic stress [that is, any stress other than pressure (whether positive
 or negative) equal in all directions.]    Consideration of the relation of
 this result to Wiedemann's remarkable discovery of the induction of
 longitudinal magnetization by twisting an iron wire through which
 an electric current is maintained, is important and suggestive.       In the
 present paper a counter-influence is pointed out, in the aeolotropic
 change of electric conductivity probably produced in the iron by
    vol. xxvii.                                                   o

stress.*     This influence illustrated by experiments made a few days
ago for the author, by Mr. Macfarlane, in Glasgow, and Mr. Bottomley,
in the Physical Laboratory of King's College, London, by kind per
mission of Professor Adams, which" show in two very different ways
that twisting a brass tube through which a current of electricity is
maintained gives to the electric stream lines a spirality of opposite
name to that which the twist gives to longitudinal filaments of the
Bubstance, and so proves that in aeolotropically stressed brass the
electric conductivity is greatest and least in the directions of greatest
and least pressure.       The some law probably holds for iron. Wiede
mann's result is that the end of the iron wire by which the current
enters, becomes a true north or a true south pole, according as the
twist is that of a right handed or of a left handed screw.           This is the
same direction of effect as would result from the aeolotropy             of the
magnetic susceptibility produced by the stress if the tangential magne
tizing force in the outer part of the wire is less than the critical value,
for which the effect of the stress is isotropic ; but it is opposite to the
effect due to the aeolotropy of the electric conductivity.              Yet the
author in repeating Wiedemann's experiments has found his result —
 the same in direction, and greatest in amount — with the strongest
 currents he has hitherto applied — currents strong enough to heat the
 wire seriously (but not yet measured or estimated in absolute measure).
 The reconciliation of the Wiedemann result with the conflicting influ
 ence of conductive aeolotropy, and with the influence of aeolotropy
 of magnetic susceptibility, which also is conflicting when the magne
 tizing force is great enough, is a difficulty which calls for investiga
 tion.
     The paper includes a series of experiments on the effects of twist
 on magnetization of iron wire under longitudinal magnetizing force
 (the Glasgow vertical force alone in this first series).           It confirms
 results of previous experimenters, Matteucci, Wertheim, and Edmond
 Becquerel, according to which twist in either direction diminishes the
 magnetization ; and extends them to wires under different amounts of
 longitudinal pull. When the pull was great — approaching the limit of
 elasticity of the wire, the twist, even when well within the limits of
 elasticity, had much less effect in diminishing the magnetism than
 when the pull was small.        The results are recorded in curves which
 show a very remarkable lagging of effect, or residue of influence of
 previous conditions.
     The paper concludes with a description of experiments, showing in
 bars of nickel and cobalt effects of longitudinal pull opposite to those
 found    by   Viilari for iron with magnetizing force below the critical

this abstract was written ; advantage having been taken of a kind

    We have been for some time engaged in an investigation on the
mode of growth of the developing Miillerian duct in the chick, and its
possible derivation from the Wolffian duct; and, while carrying on
our investigations on this point, were struck by some remarkable
features of the abdominal opening of the Miillerian duct in its very
early condition. We did not for some time pay much attention to
these features, but finally devoted ourselves to their interpretation,
and have been led to the conclusion that they form the rudiment
of a head-kidney, " Vorniere
                                        " or "
                                                Kopfniere," identical with that
present in Amphibia, Marsipobranchii, and Teleostei.                      We purpose
first to give a short account of our observations, and then to proceed
to state the grounds on which we have been led to compare the
structures we have found with the head-kidney of the Ichthyopsida

The first trace* of the Miillerian duct -we have met with is a very-
shallow groove in the germinal epithelium some little way behind
the front end of the Wolffian body, and nearly overlying, though
slightly external to, the Wolffian duct.          This stage corresponds with,
the earliest stage described by Dr. Gasser.f                 In the next stage,
which     follows    very closely upon      the first one,  remarkable     changes
have taken place in the groove, which can best be explained by
describing       the appearance of a series of successive sections from
before backwards through the groove and its continuation.
     Anteriorly there appears in section a simple groove, which, after a
short distance, is suddenly replaced by an apparently solid thickening
of the germinal epithelium. An open groove again appears in this,
 which in its turn is succeeded by a thickening, which is next converted
into a definite ridge, projecting inwards towards the Wolffian duct,
in which, we believe, we have observed a rudimentary lumen.                   After
one or two sections, a slit-like opening appears, placing the lumen
in the ridge in communication with the body cavity, and, in fact, a
groove somewhat deeper but otherwise exactly similar to that visible
in the anterior sections has reappeared.            This groove after being con
 tinued for two or three sections again becomes closed, and its walls
 are prolonged as a nearly solid rod which cannot be traced beyond one
or two sections.         In general terms, the change which has taken place
is, that the opening of the primitive simple groove has been divided
 into three, and the three separate grooves are connected by a rod-like
 structure developed from part of the wall of the original groove, in
 which a lumen either exists from the first, or very soon appears.
     In the next stage, the anterior part of the Miillerian dnct is formed
 of a tube communicating by, at the least, three separate apertures
 with the body cavity, and the tube connecting these is perhaps slightly
 convoluted.        The hindermost opening of the duct is continuous with
 a rod-like body which may be traced backwards for some little dis
  tance.      It is hollow in front, and terminates by a solid point, in a
  manner which we propose describing in detail in a fuller paper, with
  illustrations.
      This peculiar condition of the abdominal opening of the Miillerian
  duct does not last for long, and before the Miillerian duct has nearly
  grown back to the cloaca, it opens in front by a single elongated
  groove.      At this period, its hind end, or growing point, instead of
  being conical, is rounded, and the lumen of the duct is continued into
  the rounded extremity.

  of our investigation, and it only remains for us to prove that the
  peculiarly modified anterior extremity of the Miillerian duct is in reality
  a rudimentary head-kidney.           For this purpose it is necessary for us to
  show, first, that it is in the situation where we might expect to find a
  head-kidney ; and secondly, that it resembles a head-kidney in structure.
     It will  be convenient    to reverse the logical order, and to attempt to
  prove, in the first instance, the second of these points. We will use as
  our type the head-kidney in the Amphibia.
     The head-kidney of Amphibian larvse was discovered by Johannes
 Muller.t and is often spoken of as the Miillerian body. Its develop
  ment has, in recent times, been worked out in a satisfactory manner by
 W. Muller,J G6tte,§ Spengel, ||and Fiirbringer.^f It developes from the
 anterior extremity of what becomes afterwards its duct. This duct
 is called by Fiirbringer the duct of the head-kidney, and by one of
 us** the segmental duct.
     This duct, for which we shall retain the name segmental duct, de
 velopes as a groove-like invagination of the epithelium of the body
 cavity, which soon becomes constricted into a duct, blind behind, but
 ending in front by a groove in free communication                      with the body
 cavity.     The  open groove  at first deepens, still  remaining    in communication
 with the body cavity.      It next elongates, and by process of unequal con
striction becomes converted into a horizontal canal, retaining its communi
cation with the body cavity by a number of openings, varying according to
 the species   from two to four.
     The part of the duct following on the horizontal canal next assumes
an S- shaped curvature, continuous, however, with the segmental duct
 behind, which somewhat later acquires an opening into the cloaca. We
need not follow the further development and final atrophy of the head-

 kidney in Amphibia, and consider it only necessary to call attention
to the similarity, amounting almost to identity, between our account of
the metamorphosis of the anterior part of the Mullerian duct in the
 bird and the italicised part of our description (taken from Fiirbringer)
 of the changes in the open extremity of the segmental duct in the
 Amphibia, which results in the formation of the head-kidney.
    In this connexion, there is only one point we desire to call
 attention to, and that is the presence in Amphibia of a peculiar body,
 usually spoken of as the glomerulus of the head-kidney, which is
 developed at about the same time as the head-kidney. We believe,
 though we have not fully satisfied ourselves on the point, that we have
 found an homologous body in the chick.
    In reference to the identity in the position between our head-kidney
 in the bird and that in Amphibia, we have only to say that one of ns*
 has already, on other grounds, attempted to show that the abdominal
opening of the Mullerian duct in the bird is the homologue of the
abdominal opening of the segmental duct in Amphibia, Elasmobranchii,
 &c, and that we believe that this homology will be admitted by most
anatomists.     Should thu interpretation we have given of the pecu
liarities of the abdominal opening of the Mullerian duct in birds be
accepted, a further proof of this homology will be afforded.
   We may say, in conclusion, that we trust soon to be in a position to
publish a fuller account of our observations, with illustrations.

 448              Rev. S. Haughtou on Physical Geology.          [June   20,
    My paper, of 20th December, consisted of two parts : — 1st. A dis
 cussion of the rate at which a "wabble
                                          " of the earth's axis of rotation,
 caused by a want of coincidence between the axis of figure and the
 axis of rotation, would be destroyed by the friction of the ocean
 against its bed. 2nd. Speculative inferences from the solution of this
 problem, as to the duration of geological periods, depending on hypo
 thetical geological assumptions as to the method in which Europasia
 was manufactured.
    These assumptions    were three in number,    and none   of them very
 probable, viz. : —
    (a.) An instantaneous formation of the continent ;
    (6.) Its formation by means of 69 equal convulsions, with an interval
 of time between each, sufficient to reduce the radius of the wabble
 from one mile to five feet ;
    (c.) Its formation, by a number of small shocks, each displacing the
 axis of figure by such an amount that tidal friction would be able to
 render the axes of figure and rotation again coincident in the period
 of a single wabble.
                                              I
    In discussing the two latter hypotheses, naturally timed my shocks
 so as to produce the maximum wabble. For this assumption I have, of
 course, no authority ; and I readily admit that any conclusions drawn
 from the earth's wabble can have no more value than the probability
of the hypothesis we may make as to the method of formation of
 Europasia.
    In general, let AOB, fig. 1, be a portion of the path described by
 the axis of the figure, let AO be the displacement produced by any
single shock, and let APBQ be the circle described by the axis of
 rotation in the first wabble after the occurrence of the shock.
                         />//. /
   If  the next shock which moves the axis of figure from O to B
occurs when the axis of rotation is at A, the wabble will be doubled,
and have the radius AB ; but if the second shock be so timed as to

 1878.]           Rev. S. Haughton on Physical Geology.                      449
 occur when the axis of rotation is passing through B, the wahble will
 immediately cease, for the axes of rotation and of figure will coincide.*
    If t  = 304"75   days, the wabble will be doubled if the next shock
 occurs   at an interval denoted by m, and will bo destroyed if the
 interval is (n + i)T.
    If the shocks occur at irregular intervals, at the moment of shock
 the axis of rotation may be anywhere on the circle APBQ, and
 the mean effect will be found when the axis is at P or Q, which
 would be a more probable assumption than that made by me, when                 I
placed the axis always at A.           Let us now calculate the mean effect
when shocks occurring          at  unknown      intervals take place when the
axis of rotation is at P or Q.
    Let r denote the radius AO, then we have —
                         Radius of 1st wabble = r.
                            „     of 2nd     „     =r    A
                            „     of 3rd     „     = r -/3.
                            „     of nth wabble =     r  v^w.
    If r = 5 feet (the least observable wabble), n, the number of equal
shocks required to displace the axis of figure through 69 miles, will be
                                   69 x 5280         Q„.
                              n=               =72,864,
                                        5
and                                  Vn=270.
This number should       be substituted     for A' in equation   12 (Note iii, p.
543), when we obtain, for the number of years required by tidal fric
tion to destroy the final wabble,
                                   320,380 years.
    This, as might be expected, is half the time required to destroy the
final wabble, when all the shocks were additive at a maximum and
occurred when the axis of rotation was passing through A.
   Mr. Darwin has discussed at length the case of the axis of figure
moving uniformly, and finds that the axis of rotation will move on a
cycloid. I here give an easy geometrical proof of this theorem : —

  of figure ; and let x be the position of the axis of figure at any moment,
  and y the corresponding position of the axis of rotation, then by the
  conditions of the problem, fig. 2,
                     Ax varies  as the time,
                     The angle, Axy=yzx varies as the time.
  But the angle yzx is proportional to the arc xy : therefore
                                 Ax varies    as arc yx,
  bnt they are supposed to start together from zero, at the point A.
  Therefore Ax = arc xy, and the locus of y is the common cycloid,
  whose generating circle is xyz with diameter equal to the axis of the
  cycloid PO.
     If  the axis of figure therefore travels uniformly, the axis of rotation
  will describe a cycloid, and the two axes will coincide every 152-J days,
  at the cusps, and the maximum radius of wabble will be OP, the
  diameter of the generating circle.
     Mr. Darwin, finally, discusses the following problem : *
     " I will now suppose that the geological changes begin
                                                                     suddenly
 from rest and proceed at such a rate that the variations in the position
 of the principal axis are imperceptible to astronomical observation.        I
 will suppose, therefore, that the extremity of the instantaneous axis is
 never more than 5 feet distant from the extremity of the principal
 axis."
    Mr. Darwin deduces from this that a displacement in the axis of
 figure, amounting to 69 miles, might be produced in 19,200 years,
 without ever producing an observable wabble.
    My calculation of this problem is as follows : —
     Since OP is 5 feet, the base of the cycloid, AB will be 5jt, and as
 this length is described by the axis of figure in half a wabble, we have,
 if a; be the number of years required to describe 69 miles,
                         &r  : 69 x 5280   : :

 From this    I  find —
                         69x5280x30475
                                                 =9675'7 years.
                           2  x 365-25 x  5tt
This result is half that obtained by Mr. Darwin.
    My object in publishing the latter part of my paper, was to show
that if geologists shall ever be in a position to give us exact informa
tion as to the mode of formation of a continent, under certain circum
stances, conclusions of value as to geological time might be deduced
from observations made on the wabble of the axis of rotation ; but it
is clear that, in the present state of our knowledge, such conclusions
must be regarded as hypothetical.

      End of the Spectrum." Note II. By Captain Abney, RE.,
      F.R.S.     Received June 8, 1878.
   In my first
             note on this subject it was stated that further experi
ments would be undertaken, in which sensitive films would be exposed
to the action of the spectrum in atmospheres free from oxygen.   These
Lave been carried out by means of apparatus specially designed for the
purpose, hydrogen and nitrogen being the atmospheres employed,
and in some cases hydrogen vacua.       In every case the experiments
were confirmatory of what was previously surmised, the image show
ing no signs of oxidation, and there is evidence to show that the
limit of sensibility of the compounds used is lowered towards the least
refrangible end of the spectrum.
   Exposure of films in solutions which readily combine with oxygen,
and at the same time with the halogens, have given most remarkable
results. For instance, silver bromide which by its colour should have
proved sensitive to the red end, yet when exposed in the usual manner
was insensitive below B in the spectrum, proved sensitive when exposed
in sodium sulphite (Na2S03), and arrived at M the lowest limit
(about    W.L. 12,000) which I have as yet photographed.    In the
same solution,   to quote another experiment, silver iodide proved
sensitive to a point between a and A. The experiments were carried
out in duplicate.    In one the plate was immersed in the solution,
and in another the salt was dissolved when possible in glycerine and
applied to the film.   Both methods answered equally well, but for
some purposes the    latter is more convenient.
   My experiments also prove, that what is technically known as solari-
zation is due to the oxidation of the image, accelerated by light generally,
be it the more or less refrangible end of the spectrum.       This oxidation
causes the formation of a compound which is undevelopable, as already
has been pointed out.     It has thus been found impossible to produce
solarization in solutions which have oxygen absorbents.            We may
therefore conclude that the whole spectrum exercises a reducing action
on the sensitive salt, and that this reduced compound is again capable
of being oxidized by it.
   The relative power of the two actions seems to vary according to
the part of the spectrum.      This subject is still under consideration.
                    I
   In my first note also mentioned that photography in natural colours
probably depended on the same action.         My surmise is confirmed to a
great extent. If silver sub-chloride or silver sub-bromide be produced
chemically, we have a dark compound formed which, if exposed to the
action of the spectrum whilst in an oxidizing solution (such as hy
drogen peroxide), rapidly takes the colour of the rays acting upon       it,

the yellow being the least marked.  The red, green, and blue are how
ever particularly well rendered by reflected light, and the plate shows
the colours as seen when a dull light is thrown on the slit of the spec
troscope, a simile which was suggested to me by Mr. Norman Lockyer.
   From the evidence obtained by these experiments it appears that
two or three molecular groupings are sufficient to give the necessary
colours, a subject which I only allude to, since the more general question
of molecular groupings is being considered by others.

  The present memoir, which relates to the binary quintic (*)(», y)s,
has been in hand for a considerable time ; the chief subject-matter
was intended to be the theory of a canonical form discovered by myself,
and which is briefly noticed            in " Salmon's Higher Algebra," 3rd Ed
(1876), pp. 217, 218; writing a, b, c, d, e, f, g . . . u, v, to, to denote

   But the whole plan of the memoir was changed by Sylvester's
discovery of what I term the Numerical Generating Function (N.G.F.)

of the Real Generating Function (R.G.F.) of the same covariants.
The effect of this was to enable me to establish for any given degree
in the coefficients and order in the variables, or, as it is convenient to
express  it,   for any given deg-order whatever, a selected system of
                                                                  "

                                     precisely   equal to  the number of the
independent syzygies of the same deg-order, so that these syzygies give

 segregates   of the  same deg-order.      Supposing such a system of syzy-
 gies obtained for a given deg-order, any covariant function (rational
 and integral function of covariants) is at once expressible as a linear
 function of the segregates of that deg-order ; it is in fact only neces
 sary to substitute therein, for every monomial congregate, its value as
 a linear function of the segregates.        Using the word covariant in its
 most general sense, the general conclusion thus is that every covariant
 can be expressed, and that in one way only, as a linear function of
 segregates,, or, say, in the segregate form.

    Reverting to the theory of the canonical form, and attending to the
 relation      = — a?d + a'ba — 4c3, it thereby appears that every co-
 variant multiplied by a power of the quintic itself, a, can be expressed,
 and that in one way only, as a rational and integral function of the
 covariants, a, b, e, d, e, f, linear as regards

in the     " standard

not explicitly divisible by a, may very well be really divisible by a power
of a (the expression of the quotient, of course containing one or more
of the higher covariants,       g,   h,Ac), and we say that, in this case, the
•expression    is" divisible," and has for its " divided" form the quotient
expressed as    a  rational and integral function of covariants.        Observe
that, in general, the divided form         not perfectly definite, only becom
                                          is

that this further reduction ought to be made. There              occasion, how

ever, to consider these divided forms, whether or not thus further
reduced, and moreover      it    sometimes happens that the form presents
itself or can be obtained with integer numerical coefficients, while the
coefficients of the corresponding segregate form are fractional.
    The canonical form    is    peculiarly convenient for obtaining the ex
pressions of the several derivatives (Gordan's " TJebereinanderschie-
bungen "), (a, 6)1, (a, 6)*, &c. (or, as       Ipropose to write them, abl,
ab2, &c), which can be formed with two covariants the same or
different, as rational and integral functions of the several covariants.
It will be recollected that, in Gordan's theory, these derivatives are
used in order to establish the system of the 23 covariants, but          it
                                                                          seems
preferable to have the system of covariants and, by means of them, to
obtain the theory of the derivatives.

         1878.
                                       (Abstract.)
    On a previous occasion* the author described the cranial osteology
of one of the more specialized genera of existing Ganoids, and the paper
now laid before the Society is an attempt to add to the relatively
scanty literature of this department of comparative anatomy, by giving
in detail an account of the skeletal structures of one of the most
generalized members of the group.          The following are among the
more important of the conclusions which the facts elucidated appear
to warrant.
   A comparison of Polyodon with its nearest living ally, the Sturgeon,
demonstrates the close relationship that exists between the two forms
as regards their skeletal anatomy.      In so far as Acipenser differs from
Polyodon, it approaches    the Teleostean   type, nor is the latter genus
without indications of having undergone a degree of specialization in
the same direction.      But not the least important characteristic of
Polyodon is its possession of a remarkable combination of structures^
usnally regarded as being specially distinctive of the Plagiostome
Elasmobranchii. The existence of such primitive characters, which
are also present in Acipenser, though to a less extent, suggests the
desirability of giving to such facts adequate expression in any scheme
that may be proposed for the classification of the Ganoids. After giving
a resume of the views held by various zoologists as to the position of
these genera in their order, it is suggested that J. MiiUer's two sub
orders (Chondrostei and Holostei) should be retained, though it seems
advantageous to remodel the definitions on which they were based.
The various families of recent Ganoidei may be arranged in two sub
orders of approximately equal morphological value, which are mainly
differentiated by the structure of their upper jaws.

     If tested  by the structure of their upper jaws, the Crossopterygidee,
  Lepidosteidse,   and the Palaxmiscida should be referred to the
  Teleosteoidei, while the Acanthodidae would probably belong to the
  other sub-order.      Nevertheless, the distinctness of the two groups is
  materially lessened by the existence of many annectent fossil forms.
  Acipenser    and Chondrosteus in the one division and Palseoniscus
 in the other, partially bridge over the gap which exists between the
  two when the recent forms only are considered.            The Placodermi
 and the Cephalaspidee must still be referred to as being
                                                                   " incertee
  sedis."
    A comparison       of the skull of Polyodon with the Amphibian skull
 leads to   interesting results.   Perhaps the most remarkable feature in
 which Polyodon resembles the Anura, is in the possession of a for-
 wardly directed
                      " orbitar process " associated with a suspensorium so
 much inclined backwards that the gape is extended even beyond the
 posterior limits of the skull.
    The condition of the "orbitar process," as an apparently function-
 less rudiment in Polyodon, does not throw any light on its primitive
 origin, but its position and relations in the adult Lamprey, and its
 transitory condition in the embryo Anura, Suggest that originally it
 may have acted as an anterior suspensor to the much inclined
 mandibular pier of animals possessing a suctorial mouth, prior
 to the adaptation of the pterygo- quadrate arcade to that purpose.
These facts, together with the rotation of the quadrate cartilage, which
we may infer to have taken place from the direction and relations of
the " orbitar process," are indications of the existence of a close
parallelism between the developmental history of the cranium in the
embryo Polyodon, ami in such otherwise dissimilar Anurous Amphibia
as Dactylethra       capensis,  Bufo ornatus, and Bana temporaria.        The
fenestration of the roof of the periotic capsule which exists in
Polyodon seems to correspond to the primitive auditory involution
which persists in Siren lacertina, and, as in the latter, it is situated to
the outer side of the arch of the posterior vertical semicircular canal,
and not to its inner or mesial side as is the case with the Selachians.
    The co-existence in Polyodon of so remarkable a combination of
Amphibian and Selachian features suggests an enquiry into the
phylogenetic relationship of the Ganoids, the Amphibia, and the
Elasmobranchs, or, in other words, suggests the question, is the
ancestral stem of the Ganoidei more closely related to that of the
Amphibia, or to that of the Elasmobranchs ? An analysis of the
structural features common to any two of these primary groups seems
to affirm the monophyletic origin of the two first-mentioned.              On
this assumption the relation of the three groups may be roughly and
tentatively expressed as follows : —
    It seems not improbable that a primitive ancestral stock («) very

early differentiated into the two gronps of Apnenmatocoela and Pneu-
matocoela, the former being the root-stock of the modern Elasmo-
branchii, while the latter, by acquiring rudimentary and more or less
functional lungs, became the primitive double-breathers from which
have been derived the Ganoidei and the Amphibia.        From the primi
tive Ganoidei were derived the Teleosteoid Ganoids and eventually the
Teleostei also, their originally complex swim-bladders becoming gradu
ally devoted to other functious, while the Selachoidei may be regarded
as the but little modified descendants of the original progenitors of the
order. The close correspondence that exists between Polyodon and the
Selachii is not incompatible with these views, but may be the result of
the persistence in both of structures originally possessed by their
primitive ancestor.      Two facts in the cranial anatomy of Polyodon
are not easy to explain, viz., the formation of the upper jaw and the
existence of the
                   " orbitar process."   The union of the pterygoid pro
cesses in a median symphysis may have been the primitive condition of
the jaws in the ancestral form (x), but that while persistent           in
Polyodon and in the Selachii, it was superseded by a different arrange
ment, viz., the union of the pterygoid processes with retral palatine
outgrowths in most Ganoidei, and in all Teleostei and Amphibia.
                                                       "
Neither is it easy to account for the retention of the orbitar process."
It may have been an adaptive modification correlated with a snctorial
mouth in the larval or adult forms of those Ganoids that were first
differentiated from the Amphibian stem, and independently developed ;
or it may have been possessed by, and similarly functioned in, the
primitive Pneumatoccela, but has become obsolete in all their descen
dants, except Polyodon and the Anura. Thus it would appear that the
Polyodontidce constitute a remarkably central group.      They retain not
a few of the characters which we may assume to have belonged to the
primitive stock out of which were evolved the three most important
groups of Ichthyopsida, combined, however, with a certain amount of
specialization ; nor are they altogether without indications of retro
gression.

                                 (Abstract.)
   The following peculiarities of structure presented by the anatomy
of the echinoderm above described are noteworthy : —
   1. The combination     of ophiuroid disk- and arm-structure within a
pentagonal    asteroid form  of body.

     2.  The asteroid character     of the ambulacral system   : the divisional
  plates not  only being homologous with, but resembling in the manner of
  their disposition the ambulacral plates of Asteroidea ; at the same time
  furnishing a bighly suggestive representation of their phylogenetic
  development.
     3.  The rudimentary structure of the mouth-armature,           more aste
  roid than ophinxoid in general facies.         Absence of teeth, jaw-plates,
  and jaws.
     4.  Extension of the peritoneal cavity to the extremity of the func
  tional portion of the rays, that is to say, to the margin of the pen
  tagonal body.
     5. The extremely rudimentary condition and aborted character of
  that portion of the brachial series which is prolonged beyond the body-
  disk.
     6.  The continuity of the tentacular pore-system limited to the disk
 only.
     The above characters      are clearly sufficient to stamp the peculiarity
 of this extraordinary echinoderm, and, whilst excluding it from any
 known group of genera by their remarkable nature and by the aber
 rant departure they present from all previous types, are such as would
 seem to necessitate the relegation of the form to a family apart by
 itself.
     To speak definitely as to the exact position of intermediacy which
the organism holds between the Asteroidea and Ophiuroidea would
obviously be premature, without a more detailed examination of the
 internal anatomy than the present specimen in its dry condition will
 permit, as well as some knowledge of the life-history of the form.          It
may however be safely affirmed without overstepping the bounds of
due caution, that Astrophiura bridges further over, from the ophiuroid
side, the differences which have separated the two orders, than any
previously described starfish or brittle-star.

   The mean difference of temperature is very unequal on the two sides

the right, is 01103° C. (0198° F.)              The smallest differences noted
are in the 4th district, 2nd tier, and 5th district, 2nd and 3rd tiers, all

case being 0-016° C. (0-028° P.)         The greatest difference noted is in the
3rd district, 5th tier, left side, namely, 0-264° C. (0'475° F.)             The
extreme range of difference of temperature              is therefore 0'248° C.

        Part   III. — Examination      of the Posterior Region of the Head.
    The posterior region is divided, on each side, into 6 tiers by 5 equi
 distant lines, drawn horizontally from the median line to the lateral
 limit. The tiers are numbered from 1 to 6 from below upward. There
 are 5 districts in each lateral half, formed by 4 equidistant lines drawn
 parallel to the median line.           The districts are numbered from 1 to 5
 from the median line outward.            On the median line each tier measures,
 vertically, 21-33 mm. (0'83 inch).             On a horizontal line, passing
 through the occipital protuberance, each district measures, horizontally,
 21 mm. (0F2 inch). As in the case of the anterior region, the 5th tier
 wants the 5th district, and both the 4th and 5th districts are absent
in the 6th tier.       The following are the principal results of the exami
nation of the posterior region : —
    1st. Comparison of symmetrically situated spaces of the two sides of
the head — 100 observations on each pair of spaces.
    As in the case of the two preceding regions, every space in the
posterior region may, in turn, be of higher temperature on the right
side or on the left side. The following is the distribution of tempera
ture in the majority of cases : —
                                      In favour of
            Left side.                                        Eight side.
            Districts.                                        Districts.
    1st Tier— 1st.                                 1st Tier— 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th.
    2nd    „ —1st.                                 2nd „ —2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th.
   3rd „       —1st,   2nd.                        3rd „ —3rd, 4th, 5th.

   5th „      —1st,    2nd, 3rd, 4th.
    6th „     —1st,    2nd, 3rd.
   Thus, in 27 spaces a side compared, the temperature is higher on
the left side in 16 spaces, and on the right side in 11 spaces.              Taking
the total number of observations, 2,700, and deducting 80 cases of
equality of temperature, the following are the percentages of times of

 1878.]                  the Temperature      of the Head.                   461
 occurrence of relative superiority of temperature for the right and left
 sides, respectively : Right side, 45'458.         Left side, 54-542. The fol
 lowing are the spaces in which equality of temperature             is most com
 monly found : —
              1st Tier.     2nd Tier.         3rd Tier.           4th Tier.
 Districts—   1st, 2nd.     1st, 2nd.     2nd, 3rd, 4th.      2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th.
    The following are the percentages of superiority of temperature on
 the right side, on the left side, and of equality of temperature in the
total number of observations : —
        Right side —44-112 per cent. Left side — 52'926 per cent.
                                  Equality— 2-962.
                   Quantitative comparisons of the two sides.
    The following is a summary of the mean results of 100 comparisons
of each pair of symmetrically situated spaces.
    There is a marked difference in the values representing the mean
differences of temperature         in favour of the right and left sides
respectively; thus, the mean difference of temperature for the 11
spaces which are, as a rule, in favour of the right side, is 0'186° C.
(0'334° F.) ; while the mean difference of temperature of the 10
spaces which are generally in favour of the left side, is 0 066' C.
(0-118° F.).      The greatest difference noted is in the 4th district, 3rd
tier, right side, namely, 0 386° C. (0-694° F.)                    The smallest
difference noted is      in  the 2nd district, 4th tier, left side, namely,
0-008° C. (0-0144° F.) The extreme range of difference of tempera
ture is 0-378° C. (0 68° F.) The mean difference of temperature of all
the observations taken together, irrespective           of sides, is 0-115° C.

                              (a.) Intellectual work.
   The following is a summary of the principal results : —
   1st. Intellectual work causes a rise of temperature in all three
regions of the head.
   2nd. The rapidity and degree of this rise is different in the different
regions.
   3rd. Different kinds of- work in one and the same person, produce

 1878.]                  the Temperature         of the Head.                         463
 elevations of temperatnre differing from each other both in rapidity of
 appearance and degree.
    4th. The kind of work which               affects one region in the greatest
 degree   affects all three  regions    most.
    The anterior region shows, as a rule, both the most rapid and the
highest rise of temperature.           The middle region comes next and the
posterior last. A notable exception to the above order is found, how
ever, in the 1st district (and sometimes the 2nd district) of the 3rd,
4th, and 5th tiers of the middle region.                 In these spaces, the middle
region often    shows   a greater rise of temperature than that exhibited
by a considerable part of the anterior region.                     The average rise of
temperature       for   each    region       is    as     follows  : — Anterior    region,
0-02625° C. (0-04725° F.)           Middle region, 0-02062° C. (0-03711° F.)

    5th. Intellectual work, as a rule, causes a greater rise of tempera
ture on the left side of the head than on the right side : but in a
certain number of cases the rise is either greater on the right side or
is equal on the two sides.         The following are the average percentages
of times of occurrence of greater rise of temperature on the left side
and on the right side, and of equal rise on the two sides, together with
the mean difference of rise in favour of each side : —

    In some individuals, after severe and prolonged work, or after work
of an exciting character, not very prolonged, the rise of temperature
on the left side of the head may be sufficient to cause almost the
whole of the anterior region to be of higher temperature on this side.

Alterations in the same direction, but less common and less marked,
may also occur in the middle and posterior regions.
                             (b.) Emotional Activity.
   The following results have been obtained by the recitation of poetry
or prose of an emotional character : — ¦
   1st. Emotional activity, of the kind specified, causes a rise of tem
perature in all three regions ; this rise is, moreover, more rapid and of
greater degree than that seen in intellectual work.
   2nd. Less difference exists between different regions in the rapidity
and degree of rise of temperature in emotional activity than in intel
lectual work ; but the order of the regions, as regards their compara
tive degrees of rise of temperature, is usually the same in the two
cases. The average rise of temperature for each region is as follows : —
Anterior region, • 0-036° C. (0-0648° F.) ; middle region, 0 0345° C.
(0 0621° F.) ; posterior region, 0 033° C. (0-0594° F.)                 Recitation to
oneself produces, as a rule, a greater effect than recitation aloud.
This result is in accordance with physical laws, a portion of the heat
produced being, in recitation aloud, consumed in exterior work.
   3rd. In emotional activity, as in intellectual work, the left side of
the head is generally more affected than the right side.                  The averag.'
percentages    of times  of    occurrence   of greater    rise   of   temperature on
the left side and on the right side, and of equal rise on the two sides,

follow : — . .

      Emotional activity, of the kind we have beon considering, often
   extends very decidedly the tract of superior temperature on the left
   side of all three regions.
      The effect of anger, in a moderate degree, after the intensity of
   passion has subsided, has been usually to increase the extent of the
   tract of superior temperature on the left side, in all three regions.
   Vexation and mental irritability cause a rise of temperature, most
   marked in the anterior region and in the anterior spaces of the middle
   region  ; the left side is most affected.
   VII.   " Note on the Effect of various Substances in Destroying
         the Activity of Cobra Poison." By T. Lauder Brunton,
         M.D., F.R.S., and Sir Joseph Fayrer, K.C.S.I., M.D., F.R.S.
         Received June 20, 1878.
      In a paper,   read some time ago before this Society, by Mr. Pedler,
   he mentioned his discovery of the fact that the activity of cobra
   poison was completely destroyed by admixture with perchloride of
  platinum.      This substance, however, could only be regarded as a
  chemical and not as a physiological antidote to the poison, inasmuch
  as it had no power to modify or prevent the action of the venom after
  its absorption into the blood. Mr. Pedler expressed his opinion that
  the proper method of pursuing the investigation was to investigate
  separately the action of platinum salts and of cobra poison upon the
  animal body.        In the discussion which followed we stated that the
  method proposed by Mr. Pedler was in the present instance not likely
  to lead to any results, and that as the action of the substance em
 ployed by him was in all probability due to its simply forming an
 insoluble compound with the cobra poison and not to any action of
 the platinum per se, certain other metallic salts would have a similar
 action to the perchloride of platinum. Experiments have confirmed
 the opinion we then expressed,* and we find the action of chloride of
 gold is precisely similar to that of perchloride of platinum, the cobra
 venom being rendered entirely inert by admixture with the gold salt
 before its injection into the body. Chloride of gold, however, like
 perchloride of platinum, is merely a chemical antidote, and does not
 modify the action of the venom after its absorption into the circulation.
 Permanganate of potash, which has been recommended as an anti
dote, also destroys its activity completely.         Chloride of zinc, chloride
of mercury, nitrate of silver, and carbolic acid all diminish the
activity of the poison, and prolong life when mixed with it before
its injection; but they do not prevent death, nor do they pro
long life to any great extent. Perchloride of iron has very much

February,    1877, p. 201.

                 Dr. T. L. Brunton and Sir                  J.   Fayrer                [June 20,
less action npon the poison than one would expect, and it prolongs
life to a very slight extent.  Liquor potassae impairs the activity
of the poison very considerably, and prolongs life for several hoars.
When a large dose of cobra poison is injected, none of these sub
stances prevent death even when applied immediately to the wound.
The reason of this probably is that they do not come into such perfect
contact with the poison as to destroy the whole of     and the portion     it,
which escapes destruction    sufficient to kill.
                                   is             It possible, however,
                                                                      is
that when minimum doses only are injected, the local application of one
or other substance may turn the balance between life and death, but
this point we must reserve for a future paper.
   Our first experiment was made in order to compare the action of
chlorido of platinum alone with that of cobra poison alone, and of
chloride of platinum injected after cobra poison.
                                    Experiment       I.
    February 25th, 1878. A cat weighing          lbs. had about
                                                     4             cub. centim.   1
of the chloride of platinum solution of the British Pharmacopoeia
injected into its flank.
    3.44 p.m. Injection completed.
    3.55 ,, No apparent effect.        The cat well and playful.
    No symptoms whatever were observed, but after some days a slough
formed at the point of injection.        Chloride of platinum thus appears
to have no physiological action whatever when injected subcutaneonsly
beyond its effect as  a  local irritant.
    In Experiments   II   and      III
                                    similar doses of cobra poison were sub-
cntaneously injected into two cats but in Experiment

completely destroying the cobra poison.
                                  Experiment rV.
    March 7th, 1878.       Three mgms. of cobra poison, mixed with 1
grain of chloride of gold, dissolved in 40 grain measures of water,
injected into the hip of a white guinea-pig, weighing 18 oz., at 3.50 p.m.
    4.10 p.m. Crouching quietly in corner of box.            Tremor, perhaps
fright.
    4-15 p.m. Seems uneasy; crouching in corner.           No other change.
Recovered without any bad symptoms.
                                  Experiment V.
    March 14th.      In this  experiment   a very large dose of poison was
used.
    30 mgms. of cobra poison, mixed with         \\ cub. centims. of a 10 per
cent, solution of chloride of gold, were injected into a guinea-pig
weighing 20 oz., at 3.30 p.m.
    75 cub. centims. of water was used to wash out glass, and then
injected.      The poison and the chloride form a yellow creamy precipi
tate.
    3.30  p.m.  Began to jerk and twitch immediately, excited, running
about the box.
    3.35 p.m. Crouching in corner, twitching, but not otherwise affected.

   4.20  p.m.   Much the same; active, except that hind legs            seem  rather
weak.
   4.55  p.m.   Remains the       same.    Recovered      perfectly without      any
further symptoms.
   In order to make sure that the dose of cobra poison would certainly
prove fatal if administered alone, the animal, after its recovery, was
injected with a quantity of pure cobra poison, fifteen times less than
that from which it had recovered, and, as will be seen from Experi
ment VI, death rapidly occurred.
                                   Experiment     VI.
   March 14th.        White guinea-pig that recovered from 30 mgms. of
cobra poison, mixed with chloride of gold.

dead.     Death in 41 minutes.

a physiological antidote, and does not prevent the action of the poison
after its absorption.

  Experiment VIII shows that permanganate                    of potash destroys   the
action of the venom.
                                     Experiment   VIII.
   5 mgms.   of poison were dissolved in 1 cub. centim. of water,
and mixed with 1 cub. centim. of liquor potassoe permanganatis of
the British Pharmacopoeia, and injected under the skin of a guinea-
pig. No symptoms were produced, and the animal remained quite
•unaffected.
                               Experiment IX.
    Two rabbits of the same litter, each weighing exactly 2 lbs. were
 taken.   5 centigrammes      of cobra poison dissolved in 1 cub. cen
 tim. of distilled water,    were   mixed with 1 cub. centim. of liquor
potassfe permanganatis      (B.P.), and allowed to stand for about 8
minutes.    The mixture was then injected under the skin of the flank
of one rabbit.      No symptoms whatever were produced, and the
animal though kept under observation for some weeks remained quite
unaffected by the poison.         5 mgms. of cobra poison, dissolved    in
2 cub. centims.   of water,   were  injected into the other rabbit at the
same time.     During the injection a little of the poison was lost, so
that the animal did not receive the full dose, yet it died in 30 minutes.

prevent     as appears from Experiments X and XI, in which a guinea-

   chloride of platinum, and carbolic acid locally, the method adopted
   being to inject the poison under the skin of the leg, immediately
   afterwards to apply a ligature tightly above that point, and then to
   make an incision and apply the substance in just the same manner as
   we would have done if the animal had actually been bitten. From
   the following experiments, however, it will be seen that the absorption
   of the poison is so rapid that all local applications were useless. It
   should be noted that the quantity of poison we employed was large,
   and it still remains to be seen whether these local applications may
  turn the balance between life and death when the quantity of the
  poison would be just sufficient to kill in case of no remedy being
  applied.

 VIII.    " The Life-History of Bacterium termo and Micrococcus,
        with further Observations on Bacillus."                  By -J. Cossar
        Ewart, M.D. Edin., University College, London. Com
        municated by Professor HUXLEY, Sec. R.S.                 Beceived June
        20, 1878.
                                     [Plats  10.]
    While recently studying the phases through which the now familiar
 organism Bacillus anthracis passes, my attention was often directed to
 two still more familiar organisms, Bacterium termo and Micrococcus.
 Frequently from cultivations of Bacillus both rods, spores, and fila
 ments disappeared, and in their place millions of Micrococci and the
 short-jointed rods of B. termo were found.* In the short rods of
 B.  termo,    which in the struggle for existence overcame the less active
 Bacilli, minute bright particles were often present.           These exactly re
 sembled the Micrococci in the field around and between them, and were
 evidently the remains of spores out of which the rods had just been
 developed.       The presence of Micrococcus-like      spores in the short rods
    * This disappearance of the one and appearance of the others accounts for early
investigators believing that there was a continuity of development between Bacilli
 and septic organisms.

     1878.]                Bacterium termo and Micrococcus.                            Alb
    led me to conclude        not only that B. termo had a life-history similar to
    that of Bacillus anthracis, but also that Billroth was probably right in
    believing that Micrococci were the spores of ordinary Bacteria.
       I have already      proved * that Bacillus aiithracis, like B. subtilis, and
   the Bacillus found by Dr. Klein on animals suffering from pneumo-
    enteritis (pig typhoid), is, though rarely, an active organism, the motile
   phase   appearing at irregular intervals; that the protoplasm of the long
   filaments into which the rods lengthen divides into segments, which,
   either at once or after again dividing, condense into spores ; that the
   spores before germinating may divide into sporules, and that the new
   rod is not formed, as stated by Dr. Koch,t out of the gelatinous-
   looking envelope, but out of the spore itself — the spore germinating,
   and pushing out a process from one of its ends, which carries along
   with it the thin capsule, converting it into the sheath of the rod.
       Before attempting to compare the life-history of Bacterium termo
  with what we know of the life-history of Bacillus anthracis, it was
  necessary to have B. termo isolated from all other organisms.                      After
  many     failures,   I  was fortunate enough         to  find a cultivation    in which
  the rods of B. termo were alone visible. After keeping this cultivation
  under observation for some time, others were made by infecting fresh
  drops of humor aqueus, previously placed on absolutely clean covering-
  glasses, with as small a drop of the liquid as possible on the point of a
  needle.      The covering-glasses were inverted over " cells
                                                                              " made
                                                                                         by
 fixing glass rings         to  ordinary   slides by  means    of Brunswick     black,  the
  cells having been carefully washed immediately before use with abso
 lute alcohol. A thin layer of olive oil between the edge of the glass
 ring and the covering-glass prevented evaporation and the entrance
 of moisture and solid particles from the surrounding atmosphere.
      In cultivations of B. termo prepared in this way, and kept at a tem
 perature of 30° C,           I made out that, under certain conditions, the rods,
 instead of undergoing fissiparous division, lengthened into filaments, in
 wbicb in due time spores appeared. (Plate 10. Series V, h, i.) The fila
 ments were shorter than those of B. anthracis, and they never showed any
tendency to form a network or mycelium.                      The spores were extremely
 small, bright, almost spherical bodies. In from two to three days after
their formation the spores escaped from the filaments, and either lay
isolated near the centre or formed a zooglcea (Series VI, h) at the edge of
the cultivation. Having been free for some time, they germinated into
short slender rods. (Series V, b, c.) The young rods did not at once
lengthen into another generation of spore-bearing filaments, but, be
coming active, they multiplied by transverse fission. (Series V, d, e.)
The filaments packed full of spores often resembled "Micrococcus
chains," and only differed from filaments containing spores, which I

 lately found in scum from the surface of sea-water by being motion
 less. Those in the scum, notwithstanding their length and the number
 of spores in them, were moving freely about the field.
    Having satisfied myself that, under certain conditions, the rods of
 B. iermo lengthened into filaments, and that the spores formed in them
 when set free germinated into short rods, I next directed my attention
 to Micrococcus, in order, if possible, to make out whether it was a distinct
 organism, or whether it was simply a phase in the life-history of some
 common Bacterium, e.g., Bacterium termo.              After making numerous
 preparations,   I at last succeeded     in getting a cultivation in which only
 Micrococci were present.        The cultivation was made by adding to a
 drop of humor aqueus from a fresh ox's eye a minimal quantity of pus
from a newly opened abscess on the point of a calcined needle. For
three days there was no indication of organisms, but on the fonrth,
small moving particles were visible, which, when examined with a
No. XII immersion (Hartnack), were seen to be either round, oval, or
dumbbell-shaped, and often in groups of two and four. (Series VI, g.)
    A long and careful study proved that the different forms were all
phases of the same organism ; the oval forms became dumbbell-shaped,
and then divided into two round bodies similar to, but smaller than, the
sporules of Bacillus anthracis.         The two round bodies moved actively
about till they separated from each other, when each became dumbbell-
shaped and divided as before.         Being apparently in a suitable medium
and at    a favourable     temperature,     they were extremely active and
increased so rapidly that they soon formed a large milky spot in the
centre of the cultivation liquid.         This cloud, when examined with a
low power, was seen to dip well down into the fluid, thus correspond
ing to the plug of Bccleiia found by Professor Tyndall in several of
his test-tubes.*
   Though kept under observation for three weeks, not one of the
round or oval organisms present ever germinated into a rod.             During
the fourth week three fresh drops of humor aqueus were infected with
the smallest possible number of Micrococci from the above preparation ;
also several flasks containing a sterilized turnip infusion.        Both in the
aqueous humour preparations and in the turnip infusion they rapidly
increased, but none of them germinated into rods.              This experiment
was again repeated with a like result.            Hence, having failed to find
Micrococcus developing into Bacterial rods, it may, in the meantime,
be inferred that it is a distinct form : or just as Torula may be an
arrested phase of some PeniciUium-\ike organism, so may Micrococcus
be the spore of a Bacterium            which has either altogether lost its
power to germinate, or can only do so under very peculiar conditions.
That Micrococcus closely resembles Torula will be at once apparent. •.

    If the oil be removed by blotting paper from between the glass ring
and the covering-glass of a preparation made as above described, or if
the covering-glass be fractured without being displaced, the cultivation
liquid rapidly evaporates, and the remains of what a few minutes
before were active organisms are in great part left adhering to the
under surface of the covering-glass.          Preparations treated in this way
may be either subjected to high or low temperatures ; or, when protected
by a glass cap, may be left in the ordinary atmosphere.             The result of
desiccation was ascertained by infecting flasks containing sterilized
organic infusions. Such flasks infected with rods desiccated at 20° C.
remain sterile, but flasks infected with desiccated spores soon teem with
Bacteria, and flasks infected with desiccated Micrococci soon teem with
round, oval, and dumbbell-shaped organisms, leading to the conclusion
that desiccation destroys Bacterial rods ; but that, though continued
for weeks, it has no influence on spores or Micrococci. If Micrococci
and the spores of B. termo are not destroyed by desiccation in a small
protected atmosphere, it may be further inferred that they retain their
viability when dried in the ordinary atmosphere, and, being extremely
small and light, that after they are dry they will float about along
 with other solid particles in disturbed, and settle down in quiet, atmos
 pheres, without undergoing any change until they find themselves in a
medium which admits of their growth and development.                    In all pro
 bability desiccation destroys the oval and dumbbell-shaped forms of
 Micrococcus, the round spore-like forms only retaining their vitality.
 That spores exist in our ordinary atmosphere may be easily proved by
 placing sterile organic infusions in different parts of a building. In
 such a building as University College a considerable                  number of
 different organisms may      be  found.    In  cold  rooms    the infusions    may
 remain sterile for a considerable time, but generally a scum soon
 appears on the surface, which, on examination, may contain, besides
 Bacteria, fungi, monads, and other low forms from both the animal and
 vegetable kingdom.      However readily the unprotected rods of Bacteria
 are destroyed when desiccated at a temperature of 30° C, they are not
 destroyed in the substance of a spleen or kidney when the temperature
 is raised to 40° C. Those in the onter part of the dried portion of
 spleen or kidney are destroyed, but those in the centre are protected
 by the hard outer cake, not only because this hard shell tends to keep
 the heat from them, but especially because it tends to prevent complete
 desiccation.

of B. anthracis    are destroyed -when the fluid they are suspended in is
kept for a few minutes at the point of ebullition. The same is true of
 7?. termo   and Micrococcus.       On the other hand, when they are sub
jected to a temperature of 110° C. in a dry state they are not destroyed ;
they are rendered inactive, however, by a temperature of 120* C.               The
difference between the effects of moist and dry heat is probably owing
to the gelatinous capsules of the spores and Micrococci giving way,
and thus allowing the boiling fluid to come into direct contact with
the unprotected central protoplasm.
                       Further Observations       on  Bacillus.
    On the surface of      sea water,    containing the remains of seaweeds,
Pedicellinffi and skeleton shrimps, brought from Roscoff by Mr. Geddes
last April, a few patches of scum appeared which, on examination,
were found to be made up of active and resting Bacilli, exactly
resembling in size and form Bacillus suhtilis.             Day by day the small
pellucid areas   increased    until  the  whole   surface   of the water (about 12
centimetres in diameter) was completely covered with a thick opaque
scum, which, after remaining entire for seven days, gave way in the
middle, and soon sank to the bottom, remaining there in a torn and
broken condition.
    The minute spots which first, appeared were almost entirely made
up of active Bacilli, rapidly multiplying by transverse fission. As the
patches increased in size, the Bacilli either formed zooglcea, or length
ened into filaments.        The process of lengthening was, as compared
with B. anthracis, when cultivated on the warm stage, a remarkably slow
one, and often the filaments which with the No. VIII Hartnack were
apparently 3 or 4 centimetres in length, moved in a languid way amongst
the active Bacilli.     Having increased to about forty times the length
of the original rod, the protoplasm divided and condensed into spores,
the steps of the process being similar to those already described in B.
anthracis*      The spores next, escaped from the filaments, and either
formed zoogloea, or germinated into another generation of rods.               This
increase of the rods by simple division, and by spore formation, con

the peach-coloured granular disks figured by Lankester from old culti
vations of Bacterium rubescens, in which " the nourishment had dwin
dled to its very smallest limit."
   In the zoogloea all the Bacilli were quiescent, and it is important to
observe that in none of them was there any appearance of division ;
but around the          edge   (Series I, k) some were in active motion,
whether entering or leaving the motile stage I do not know. The
close resemblance of these masses, both in form and in time of
                      the "
                                           "
appearance to                 macroplasts    of  Lankester,*     led me to watch
their development.          First, the spore divided into four sporules quite
as in Bacillus anthracisj but these sporules again divided forming a
granular mass (Series IV, d, e), division and growth going on simul
taneously till a large very finely granular sphere was produced.
(Series IV, g.)
   When one of the large spheres was broken up, round particles
(Series IV, h) spread far and wide over the field.                 These particles,
when placed in a fresh drop of sea water enlarged (Series IV, i) and
germinated into rods. (Series IV, j.)
   If then a singlo minute spore is thus capable of producing innumer
able still more minute germs, and if these, as all experiment tends to
show, resist desiccation at ordinary temperatures, Professor Huxley's
dictum may unhesitatingly be repeated and endorsed, that, consider
ing the lightness of Bacterium germs, and the wide diffusion of the
organisms which produce them, it is impossible to conceive that they
should not be suspended in the atmosphere in myriads.
                            Morphological Considerations.
   Various       investigators, notably Huxley and Lankester, have long
ago asserted the Protean nature of Bacteria, and the accompanying
plate (exclusively compiled from actual observation), is an attempt to
summarise and define what we at present know of the phases
through which three of these forms, Bacillus, Bacterium, and Micro
coccus' may pass.          Such a diagrammatic representation may be the
more    useful,    seeing that at present our knowledge is scattered through
many papers.
    Series     I  represents     the most common        phases through which
Bacillus may pass.          The spore germinates into a rod, this divides, the
portions,     if at  rest, either  falling apart or forming a jointed filament
(/). The motile stage may be assumed, during which division also goes
on   (17),  zigzag forms being produced which have often been mistaken for
Vibriones.       While division is going on, the development of the cilia is
often beautifully seen with a high immersion.                 First, the cellulose

wall gives way, and the segments as they separate slowly draw ont
a thin viscous thread of protoplasm. One segment generally fixes
itself to the cover glass, while the other wriggles about in all direc
tions, moving and resting by turns, until the almost invisible thread
gives way in the middle so as to form two cilia.             Thus the first
formed motile rods should only have one cilium, and such are occa
sionally seen, but are probably soon supplanted by their more active
biciliate progeny.    After being alternately at rest and in motion for
an indefinite period, they may rise to the surface of the fluid to form a
zooglcea (j) and after some time again become motile.
   In Series   IIthe spore immediately after germinating develops into
a long .filament or unbranched hypha, which interweaves with others
to form a mycelium.       The protoplasm of the filaments soon contracts
into rows of " chlamydospores " (/) which either escape through the
cellulose walls, or are set free by the disintegration of the hypha (i k).     j
When once free they may either form a zoogloea (tn) or germinate
immediately.
  In Series    III the spore divides into four sporules (e), which, while
separating, move very energetically.      This takes place when the nu
tritive fluid is becoming exhausted, the sporules not germinating until
more   nourishment is obtainable.    If fresh pabulum be not added
the sporules  may continue dividing (Series IV) so as to form large
                                      /
finely granular spheres (e g), compound masses resulting from the
division of several adjacent spores. These disintegrate, setting free
numerous small ronnd particles (A) which in suitable media enlarge
and germinate        (j).
   Leaving Bacillus, Series V shows the life-cycle of Bacterium termo.
The round spore germinates into a short rod (6), which either
divides into a chain (e), or into separate rods, with resting and motile
stages alternating           (/

coccus represented below in Series VI.
   Here the spore-like Micrococcus becomes dumbbell-shaped and
divides into two (c), which again divide, and so on indefinitely, a pre
paration of Micrococci kept for three months having shown no tendency
to germinate into rods.    Resting and motile stages (<?), chains (/), and
zooglcea (7i) are often observed.

  IX. "On      the   Life-History of Spirillum."             By Patrick Geddes
        and    J.   Cossar    Ewart, M.D. Edin., University             College,
        London. Communicated              by Professor Huxley,         Sec. R.S.
        Received June 20, 1878.
                                   [Platis  11, 12.]
     Notwithstanding      the numerous and fruitful researches which have
  been recently made     into the life-history of Bacteria, our knowledge of
  the common and interesting curved and spiral forms— the Vibrio* and
  Spirillum of Ehrenberg— has made little or no advance since his time,
  neither embryonic nor reproductive forms having ever been observed ;
 while even the zooglcea phase, so characteristic of Bacterium and
 Bacillus, has only once been mentioned,t and then in a different form.
     A fresh-water aquarium, which has been stagnating since last
 summer in the Physiological Laboratory of University College, con
 tained in winter vast numbers of ordinary motile Spirillum.                   On
 recently re-examining the water, one zooglcea film after another having
 in the meantime formed on the surface, thickened, broken, and sunk,
 we fonnd that these motile forms had almost disappeared, while the
 films consisted almost entirely of resting Spirillum in a gelatinous-
 looking matrix, similar to that of Bacterium and Bacillus.               Among
 these were two or three apparently distinct kinds of filaments, some
 resting and colourless, others motile, and filled with highly refracting
 bright yellowish-brown spheres. Such a field is represented in fig. 1.
     The gloea had, even to the naked eye, a brownish tint, which under
 the microscope was distinctly traceable to the Spirilla, the matrix
 being also faintly tinged. When a fragment was mounted, water
 very rapidly revived the perfectly quiescent organisms at the torn
 edges.    These, after some efforts, succeeded in disengaging them
 selves, and in a few seconds were darting to and fro, fully motile.
 The rapidity and extent of this change from the resting to the motile
 condition, which we have witnessed again and again, was of extra
 ordinary interest and beauty.          When crowded into a narrow space,
 the motile Spirilla showed their bright brown madder tint very
 intensely — a single one, unless very carefully examined, appearing
 colourless    (fig. 1).
     The resting Spirilla are of very various shapes, some singly bont,
 others slightly curved at one or both ends, and others coiled like
corkscrews of two or more turns (fig. 1). We were much astonished
     • We   are very strongly  of the opinion  that the forms described by various
authors as Vibrio are merely either — (1.) Zigzag dividing BaiMut ; (2.) Slightly
waved Bacillus ; or (3.) Undeveloped Spirillum, and hence that Vibrio should no
longer be used as a generic term,

to note that amongst these lay short, comma-shaped forms (fig. 11),
the head of the
                     " comma "
                                 exactly resembling in size and colour the
yellowish-brown spheres contained in the long motile filaments above
mentioned.       Every possible gradation in size and curvature existing
between the smallest comma and the longest spiral, the explanation at
once suggested itself that here we had the germination of spores into
Spirilla.    The adult resting forms might often easily be mistaken for
germinating spores ; but, by careful focussing, the apparent spore is
resolved into a mere twist or upturned end, and we have therefore
specially studied and carefully figured such possible sources of fallacy
(fig. 12).
    The spore-bearing hyphee, to the study of which we were thus led,
may be next described. They were of enormous length and constantly
in motion, the shorter progressing with a strange, unsteady, forward
movement ; the longer, like intertwisting snakes, convolnting into
loops, knots, and spirals, to form a motile mycelium (fig. 1).               After
remaining     entire  for  a considerable    time    they break   up  into  longer
and shorter, still motile, segments which may again divide (fig. 7). We
have repeatedly observed a filament, as it crept along, sowing its own
spores, which either escaped at the end or through the walls, leaving
slightly smaller clear vacuoles in the cellulose, to show where they
had lain (fig. 7a). In all other cases in the vegetable kingdom, so far
as we know, save two other Bacterial forms,* the spores or seeds may
have the means of active or passive locomotion, but the parent or
ganism, at least, is always quiescent ; here the reverse holds good, but
the same end is gained — the parent being locomotive and the spores
quiescent.
    The development of the filaments and their relation to the resting
and motile spirals we next endeavoured to ascertain.                   In various
preparations, especially     in those   kept   at  a  temperature   of  25° C, we
found some long irregularly-curved Spirilla (fig. 2), and associated
with these, and often scarcely distinguishable from them, were delicate
wavy filaments, which were slowly changing their form (fig. 3),
sometimes straightening, sometimes looping, but often recurring to
the Fiirto-like type (fig. 3). These increased in length and thickness,
and became motionless (fig. 41), and their protoplasm gradually con
densed into clear round spheres, which were at first almost colourless,
but became tinged with yellow, which deepened into the characteristic
brown, the filament then returning to the motile condition. The
young spores were at first arranged with some regularity (fig. 4c), but
this disappeared as they ripened and divided.           The process of division is
very   remarkable,      dumbbell-shaped,      triradiate,  and budding masses
occurring together in the same filament, the resulting spores being

often unequal in size (fig. 6).           Such irregularity of division very
often also takes place outside the filaments (fig. 14).
   When naturally sown in the glcea, in the way above described, the
spores encapsulate themselves, and very often, if not always, divide
into two or more sporules (fig. 8a).              The capsules may remain
isolated or also divide, forming patches of two or three (fig. 8b),
or along with others, uniting into large irregularly cohering masses
(fig. 13c).    Sometimes, also, many may be enclosed in a definite
cellulose envelope (fig. 8(2); this last perhaps arising, like a colony
of Oloeocapsa, from the division of a single spore. When old, the
capsules may lose their pale blue colour, and even become suffused
with dingy brown.
    The sporules may either desert the capsules (fig. 8e), leaving
vacuoles, as in the ripe filaments, such empty capsules being found in
great numbers ; or may cause them to become actively motile, their
motion being either corkscrew-like or direct without revolution ; in
the former case resembling a Spirillum, in the latter a monad.                  On
escaping   from the   capsule,  the   sporules appear generally     to rise to  the
surface, forming large dark granular masses (fig. 10).
   A nutritive fluid, prepared by boiling a piece of zooglcea in some
water taken fron the aquarium, was inoculated with these surface
sporules and placed on the warm stage.                Twenty-four hours after,
many of the brown sporules were sending out a small curved hypha,
at first slightly tinged, while later, distinct " commas," and even
young Spirilla, were developed.
   It is of great interest that we occasionally found a large, very finely
granular sphere of the characteristic colonr (fig. 9), while smaller and
coarser masses were more abundant (fig. 96), affording a transition to
the common sporule        cyst.    These   correspond to the smaller
                                                                         " macro-
        "
plasts    figured by Lankester,*        in his Bacterium rubescens,        and to
the finely granular colourless spheres, figured by one of us in the
preceding papert from a species of Bacillus.           These probably result, as
in Bacillus, from the long-continued subdivision of a single spore or
sporule.
   The division of the spores inside and outside the filaments is of
great interest, and goes far to prove the unspecialised and Protean
nature of Bacterial forms, almost all possible modes of division being
found in the same field. Some divide transversely into two equal
parts, others bud like Torulce, others again lengthen into rod-like
and FYfrrio-like forms, and then break up into three or four portions
(figs. 13 and 14).
   The life-history of Spirillum, so far as we at present know, may be
thus summarised.       The well-known motile corkscrew may alternate

between the active and resting states, and ultimately lengthen ont into
a small filament, which loses its definite twist and may freely bend or
straighten.      This thread grows into a much larger and longer motion
less filament, in which spores appear.                   These rapidly divide and
acquire a bright brown colour, the filament reassuming the motile
condition,    and sooner or later breaking up.               The freed spores encyst
and divide, forming capsules, which after a period of quiescence them
selves become motile, the sporules contained in them escape and germi
nate into " commas," which become Vibrio-like, and soon grow into
the common motile Spirillum.
    The resemblance of all this to the life-history of Bacterium termo
and Bacillus described in the preceding paper is at once apparent.
Not only is there the same alternation of a resting with a motile
phase, bat there is a lengthening into filaments the protoplasm of
which condenses into spores which divide and germinate.                       Moreover,
there are also moving filaments, and finely granular spheres, while
the resemblance to B. rubescens is even more striking.                         That the

         termining the Ratio of the Dispersions of Glasses intended
         for Objectives." By Professor G. G. Stokes, M.A., Sec. R.S.
         Received June 18, 1878.
      In examining       the dispersive powers        of a great variety of glasses
  prepared by the late Rev. W. Vernon                  Harcourt,   I  had occasion to
  examine several prisms which were ioo               much striated to show clearly
  even the boldest dark lines of the solar           spectrum.     I found that I was
  able to get a fair measure of the dispersive powers even of these by a
  method depending on the achromatizing of one prism by another.                        If
  the method succeeded even with such prisms, it stands to reason that
  it would be still more successful with prisms of good glass.
      For the construction of an objective we require but one datum as
  regards the dispersions, namely, the ratio of the dispersions, or rather,
  the ratio which on being treated as if it were the ratio of the disper
  sions gives the best results in practice.
      If it were not for irrationality, the matter would be comparatively
  simple. The ratio of the dispersions would then be the same for
  whatever interval of the spectrum it were taken ; and we should
  merely have to take two well-defined lines, bright or dark, situated as
  nearly as may be at the extremities of the spectrum, so that any errors
  of observation should be divided by as large a quantity as practicable,
 to measure the refractive indices of the two glasses for each of those
                                                                                           '
 two lines, and to take the ratio of the increments in passing from one
 line to the other.           But in consequence of irrationality we get a
 different ratio according to the particular interval we choose ; we are
 obliged, unless we adopt some different method altogether, to observe
 more than two' lines in each glass; and when we have got the results,

that is to say, the indices for several fixed lines in each glass, it still
becomes a question what it is best to do with them so as to produce
the best result.
    Fraunhofer proposed an empirical rule for combining the results.*
 but remarked that the number thus obtained was not exactly that
 which answered best in practice.         I
                                       have elsewhere shown reason to
 think that the rule may be taken to be simply that the ratio of dis-
¦persions to be chosen is that for an infinitely  small portion of the
 spectrum at its brightest part ;     f
                                     or in other words, that the focal
 length  of the combination of two glasses must be made a maximum or
 minimum (it is practically a minimum) at the brightest part of the
spectrum.
  The refractive  index of one glass may be expressed in terms of that
of another, or of some standard glass, by an interpolation formula
with three, or at most four, terms. The most accurate observations
with prisms are only just sufficient to show that a fourth term is
needed, and for the practical purpose of the construction of object-
glasses, where in consequence of irrationality the ends of the spectrum
aro sure to be a good deal out of focus, it will be amply sufficient to
confine ourselves to three terms.   The three coefficients in the inter
polation formula may be determined by observing in each glass tbe
indices of refraction for three selected lines, though it is well to
observe more than three lines, and combine the results.
   The angular extent of the spectrum being but small in practical
cases, the necessity of determining three constants by observations
made in it requires great delicacy of measurement.       Small errors of
observation would easily produce an error in the dednced ratio which
would be sensible, or even material, in practice.
   For the actual construction of an object-glass we require, as has
been already remarked, the knowledge of only a single constant relat
ing to the dispersion, not of two ; and if we can find some test whereby
to know when the required condition is satisfied, we may dispense with
such extreme accuracy in the angular measurements.
   Such a test is afforded by the secondary tints, which change with
extreme rapidity when the refracting angle of one of the mutually
achromatizing prisms, or the position of one of them in azimuth, is
altered.   If a moderately narrow object with vertical sides, black on a
white ground, or white on a black ground, be viewed through opposed
prisms, one of crown and one of flint glass, with a small telescope,
and the prisms be set to achromatize each other as nearly as may
be, it will be found that the slightest touch altering one of the prisms
in azimuth alters notably the secondary tints.
   The secondary tints in an objective are readily shown by directiflff

the telescope to a vertical line separating light from dark, such as the
edge of a chimney seen in the shade against the sky, and covering
half the object-glass with a screen having a vertical edge.       So delicate
is this test that on testing different telescopes by well-known opticians,
a difference in the mode of achromatism may be detected.            The best
results are said to be obtained when the secondary        green is interme
diate   between   green and yellow.       This corresponds to making the
focal length a minimum for the brightest part of the spectrum.
    To enable me to form a judgment as to the sharpness of the test
furnished by the tint of the secondary green, as compared with the
performance of an object-glass, I tried the following experiment.
    A 6et of parallel lines of increasing fineness was ruled with ink on
a sheet of white paper, and a broader black object was laid on it as
well, parallel to the lines.   The paper was placed, with the black lines
vertical, at a considerable distance in a lawn, and was viewed through
two opposed prisms, one of crown glass and the other of flint, of such
angles as nearly to achromatize each other in the positions of minimum
deviation, and then through a small telescope.             The achromatism
was now effected, and varied in character, by moving one of the
prisms slightly in azimuth, and after each alteration the telescope was
focused afresh, to get the sharpest vision that could be had.         I found
that the azimuth of the prism was fixed within decidedly narrower
limits by the condition that the secondary green should be of such or
such a tint, even though no attempt was made to determine the tint
otherwise than by memory, than by the condition that the vision of
the fine lines should be as sharp as possible.      Now a small element of
a double object-glass may be regarded, so far as chromatic compensa
tion is concerned, as a pair of opposed prisms ; and therefore we may
infer that the tint of the secondary green ought to be at the very
least as sharp a test of the goodness of the chromatic compensation as
the actual performance        of the telescope. And such Mr. Thomas
Grubb, to whom      I mentioned the test, found to be actually the case in
the progress of the construction of the 15-inch refractor for the Royal
 Society, the instrument at present in the hands of Mr. Huggins.
    It follows therefore that two opposed prisms, representing the
 glasses to be employed in an objective, are to be deemed to achromatize
each other when one of the two secondary colours is about midway
between yellow and green.
    The condition of achromatism of two opposed prisms is given in the
 ordinary treatises on optics, but, so far as     I  have seen, rather as an
optical curiosity than as a matter of practical utility.           Sir David
 Brewster in his treatise on " New Philosophical Instruments," p. 292,
 alludes to it as furnishing a conceivable mode of determining disper
 sive powers, but mentions it only to condemn it. I cannot imagine
 why, for at least with the modifications which I have been led to in

troduce in putting       it in practice,   I find it   to be no less excellent       than
easy.
     The experimental arrangements are a good deal simplified by making
the prisma to be compared  achromatize   successively one and the same
prism chosen arbitrarily, and retained in a fixed position, instead of
making them directly achromatize each other.                   I
                                                      will first describe
the method as       I used   it,
                         premising that as the prisms for which   was           it
primarily designed  were  not of good glass,    was  content
                                                        I    with less
perfect arrangements than would have been desirable for really good
glasses.  Nevertheless the apparatus when used with good prisms
gave very good results.   The object observed was a vertical slit, so
wide   that when viewed through the opposed prisms a broad white
stripe was seen, merely fringed at the two edges with the secondary
green and purple. The slit was fixed at one end of a horizontal plank,
near the other end of which was fixed a vertical lens of about four
feet focus.    The slit was in the principal focus of the lens.           The
plank   rested  on  three knobs,  one  under  the slit, the   other  two near
the other end.     This mode of support prevented torsion of the plank,
which would have produced a lateral derangement of the slit. The
rays from the slit, rendered parallel by the lens, fell upon a prism,
which will call the primary prism.

   The beam refracted and dispersed in contrary directions by the two
prisms     received on the object-glass of an achromatic telescope un
          is
connected with the graduation, with which the image of the slit, if so
wide an aperture may so be called,    viewed.

the aperture are seen coloured blue and red, which colours, on turning
the prism through its azimuth of achromatism, are changed into red
and blue       by

edge of the slit at which the green  seen  alone attended to, and

purple as well,     would be proper to use an aperture of the form

right and left along a common edge, and therefore at the same angle
of incidence, or rather at angles of incidence having the same hori

zontal projection.             I    do not know that anything would be gained by
this ;I have found             it   sufficient to attend to the green.
   The light employed had best be that of the sky, reflected horizon
tally by a looking-glass. It should be fairly bright, but not approach
ing to dazzling.    Thus the light reflected from the sky near the sun
would be too bright. The room need not be darkened ; in fact, it is
better that the eye should be kept fresh for the appreciation of colour
by habitually looking about on ordinary objects. A simple collimating
lens such as    Ihave described is sufficient, though doubtless an achro
matic would theoretically be an improvement.       It should be of longish
focus, at least in the case of a simple lens, lest any slight displacement
right or left of the middle of the incident beam should introduce a
minute dispersion due to the lens acting as a prism. If the middle of
the beam be not quite central, that does not signify, provided the
eccentricity be constant ; for then the minute dispersion is merely
added to that of the primary prism, which is arbitrary.          To ensure
constancy of incidence ou the lens, it is well to limit it by an aperture
with vertical sides, and to take care that the beam employed is wide
enough to fill the aperture.   Similarly it is well to take care that the
beam falls centrically, or pretty fairly so, on the achromatic viewing
telescope.   But what is of much more consequence is that the ray
passing through the optical centre of the object-glass should pass
centrically through the eye-piece, as otherwise the dispersion of the
eye-piece for eccentrical pencils would alter the secondary tint.      It is
well, therefore, that the viewing telescope should be furnished with
cross wires. The telescope is then moved a little till the fiducial edge
is on the cross wires when the tint is observed.
   The determination of the azimuth of achromatism is the capital
observation on which the accuracy of the result depends ; in com
parison with    the rest of the measurements required may be deemed
                    it,
exact. Accordingly     number of observations of this azimuth should
                                    a
be taken, and the mean adopted. The mean error will vary with cir
cumstances, but    may be taken ordinarily as few minutes.

  The mean reading for achromatism by itself alone gives nothing,
and must be combined with another determination in order to be avail

make was that of the angle of incidence of a particular part of the
spectrum on the second prism for a known azimuth of this prism.

     the brightest part    of the spectrum were marked by a definite line,
we should choose that.       As it is,the line D, though not exactly at the
brightest part, lies sufficiently near     for our purpose, as will be better

because we are using an aperture, and not   mere slit. But

be illuminated by a soda flame instead of daylight, a well-defined
yellow image of the aperture will be seen, the fiducial edge of which
can be pointed at with precision.
   To determine the angle of incidence       have employed two methods,

the less direct, and involves  alittle subsequent calculation, but has the
advantage of not requiring any additional apparatus beyond what                 is
wanted for the determination       of the azimuth of achromatism.       In
carrying out the first, and in applying either,      suppose the angle of

telescope to the fiducial edge when the aperture          illuminated by a

known and by applying with its proper sign the difference of mean

readings for achromatism with daylight and for minimum deviation
with     soda flame, we get the angle of incidence for achromatism.

   This method   is  mentioned merely as naturally leading up to that
actually employed.      It must be rejected as too slovenly, since the
uncertainty of the determination of the azimuth of minimum deviation
is liable to be greater than that of the azimuth of achromatism.
   If we place the wire of the viewing telescope some way off the sta
tionary position of the fiducial edge, there are two azimuths of the
prism at which the edge will be on the wire, across which          will move
                                                                     it

azimuth could be determined with accuracy, and              they were equi

distant from the azimuth of minimum deviation, the latter could be
determined at once. This, however,          not the case, but nevertheless

give equal deviations, the angles of incidence and emergence are simply
interchanged.   Hence when the prism is turned from one to the other
of two azimuths for which the image of the fiducial edge is on the wire
of the viewing telescope, the angle moved through is equal to the
difference between the angles of incidence and emergence in either
position.  Both azimuths, and therefore their difference, can be deter
mined with accuracy, provided the azimuths be sufficiently remote from
that of minimum deviation.
   The process of observation, then, is this.   Set the prism a good way,
such as 10° or 15°, from the azimuth of minimum deviation, and read
the graduation.    Turn the viewing telescope till the fiducial edge is on
its wire. Taking care to keep the telescope fixed, turn the prism
through the position of minimum deviation till the edge is again on
the wire, and read again.

    prisms  would achromatize  each  other,  as is supposed in the deduction of
    the above formula in treatises on optics, under the same circumstances
    in which they would achromatize, in succession, the same spectrum.
    In the application of the formula, it is to be remembered that, of the
    two angles 0, yjr, the former is that which lies on the side of the white
    light, and is, therefore, the angle of incidence for the first, but of
    emergence for the second, of two prisms which mutually achromatize
    each other.
      In   the   application of the formula (2) the angles 0', i!r belong,
    strictly speaking, to the brightest part of the spectrum, which for
    shortness I will call M, for which the value of the differential co
    efficient dfil : dfi is supposed to be sought.            But the distance of
    M from D is so small that it will hardly make any sensible error if we
    use the values of the angles belonging to D, for not only is the cor
    rection to the product cos 0' cos            for either prism very small, but

    the two corrections are in the same direction, and therefpre tend to
    neutralise each other in the ratio of the products, with which alone we
    are concerned. If, however, we care to introduce the correction, it can
    be done at the expense of         little additional calculation.

    glass the index for M may be taken             as greater by O'OOl than that
    for D, and in a flint glass as greater by O'OOl multiplied by a
    rough value of d/i, d/i. The angle of emergence

    tion of the index,         a maximum or minimum for M and D being so

be a compound      prism formed of two prisms of crown and flint glass
respectively,   with  their angles turned the same way), so as to fall
about midway between the glasses to be compared, and thereby divide
between them the irrationality which has to be encountered in the
observation.    The observation of the azimuth of achromatism is most
accurate when there is little or no irrationality ; and, if preferred, the
crown glasses might be compared with a standard crown, and the
flint glasses with a standard flint, the primary prism being in the one
case any crown glass prism that happens to be at hand, and in the
other case a flint glass prism. The crown glass to be measnred being
compared with the standard crown by using them in succession to
achromatize the same primary crown in the same position, and similarly
for the flint glass to be measured and the standard flint, we can
deduce the ratio of the dispersions of the crown and flint glasses to
 be measured if we know, once for all, the ratio of the dispersions
of the standard crown and flint glasses. This may be determined by
a specially careful series of observations of the kind above described,
 made once for all, or, if preferred, by the method of indices.
    The direct comparison of a crown and flint glass        is,  however, so
accurate, especiallyif    a glass of intermediate quality    be used for the
primary prism, that  I      feel satisfied
                                        it   will suffice for practical pur
poses. It  is   hardly necessary to observe that,    if the primary prism be
of intermediate quality to the two compared, the right hand edge of
 the aperture will be the fiducial edge in the one case, and the left
 hand edge in the other.        In saying this, assume that we have not
                                             I
 extravagant inclinations or differences of angles to deal with, for there
is  a jufwi-irrationality   observed even when two prisms of the same
 glass, but of different angles, achromatize each other, which is, how
ever, ordinarily so small that it     may be neglected in comparison with
the real irrationality of the media.
    By turning the primary prism into a different azimuth, or substi
tuting a different primary prism, and repeating the observation, an
estimate may be formed of the degree of reliance that may be placed
on the results.
   To give an idea of the degree of accuracy of which the results are
susceptible,
           I    subjoin a few numbers extracted from my note-book.
The prisms designated H 74, H 88, H 98, were experimental prisms,
of phosphatic glass of different compositions.   They were more or less
striated, but were good enough to show the principal fixed lines of the

the primary prism was set at different azimuths.     In the calculation

    It will be seen that, even with prisms such as these, by taking the
 mean of different determinations,     the uncertainty can hardly be as
 great as one half per cent.
    Extremely small prisms are quite sufficient for the determination of
 the ratio of the dispersions of the glasses by the above method.       It
 may, however, happen that an optician cannot afford to remove even
 so small a piece of glass from a disk intended for an objective, and has
 not a specimen of glass on the identity of which with the glass of his
 disk he can thoroughly rely.      In such a case it is necessary to de
termine the optical constants of the disk by means of facets cut on the
disk itself. A heavy and costly disk cannot be treated like a small
prism, and mounted on a small graduated instrument in the manner
I have supposed a small prism treated. To compare the ratio of the
 dispersions of two such disks, one of crown glass and the other of
flint, the most convenient way would seem to be to leave the disk
fixed, let the light pass through it first, and then achromatize it by a
small prism of very low flint glass, mounted on a small graduated in
strument in the manner already explained. The dispersions of the disks
would be compared with each other by comparing them in succession
with the same intermediate prism.
    This, however, demands an additional determination beyond what
was required in the other process, since the prism through which the
light first passes is not the same in the two cases.  The element which
best lends itself to measurement is the angle of incidence on the first
surface. The most convenient mode of measuring this must depend on
the general disposition of the apparatus adopted to take the measure
ments for the angle of the disk and the deviation of some one line,
which must be made in any case ; it is accordingly best left to the
choice-of   the observer.

    In our last communication to the Royal Society we described cer
tain absorption lines, which we had observed to be produced by the
vapour of magnesium in the presence of hydrogen, and certain other
lines which were observed when potassium, and others when sodium,
was present, in addition to magnesium and hydrogen.           These lines
 correspond to no known emission lines of those elements ; but, inas
 much as they appeared to be regularly produced by the mixtures

 1878.]       on the Reversal    of the Lines of Metallic Vapours.           495
 described, and not otherwise,       we could only ascribe their origin to the
 mixtures    as distinct from the separate elements. It became a question
 of interest, then, whether we could find the conditions under which the
 same mixtures would give luminous spectra, consisting of the lines
 which we had seen reversed.          On observing sparks from an induction
 coil taken between magnesium points in an atmosphere of hydrogen,
 we soon found that a bright line regularly appeared, with a wave
 length about 5,210, in the same position as one of the most con
 spicuous of the dark lines we had observed to be produced by vapour
 of magnesium with hydrogen in our iron tubes. This line is best
 seen, i.e. is most steady, when no Leyden jar is used, and the rheotome
  (the coil we used has an ordinary self-acting one) is screwed back, so
 that it will but just work. It may, however, be seen when the coil is
 in its ordinary state, and when a small Leyden jar is interposed ;
 but it disappears (except in flashes) when a larger Leyden jar is used,
 if the hydrogen be at the atmospheric pressure. This line does not
 usually extend across the whole interval between the electrodes, and is
 sometimes only seen near the negative electrode.            Its, presence seems
 to depend on the temperature, as it is not seen continuously when a
 large Leyden jar is employed, until the pressure of the hydrogen and
 its resistance is very much reduced.            When well dried nitrogen or
 carbonic oxide is substituted for hydrogen, this line disappears entirely ;
 but if any hydrogen or traces of moisture be present it comes out
 when the pressure is much reduced.            In such cases the hydrogen lines
 C and F are always visible as well.               Sometimes several fine lines
 appear on the more refrangible side of this line, between it and the
 b group, which give it the appearance of being a narrow band, shaded on
that side.     We have used various samples of magnesium as electrodes,
and they all give the same results.           We have also used hydrogen pre
pared   and   purified  in different  ways  :  hydrogen prepared by the action
of zinc on dilute sulphuric acid, purified by an acid solution of bichro
mate or permanganate, and by potash, and dried by sulphuric acid ;
 electrolytic hydrogen ; hydrogen from dry formiate of soda and soda
lime ; hydrogen occluded by sodium and expelled by heat ; and hydro
gen occluded by palladium and expelled by heat. In the last two cases
the whole apparatus was connected by fusion, and a Sprengel pump,
also connected by fusion, employed to remove the air. In all cases
the phenomena were the same.
    In addition to the above-mentioned            line, we observed that there
is also produced     a series  of fine  lines,  commencing close to the most
refrangible line of the b group, and extending with gradually dimi
nishing intensity towards the blue.                These lines are so close to
one another, that in a small spectroscope they appear like a broad
shaded band.         We have little doubt that the dark absorption line,
with wave-length about 5,140, shading towards the blue, which

496            R. T. Glazebrook on Velocities of Normal                 [June   20,
we previously observed in our iron tubes, and described in our last
communication, was a reversal of part of these lines, though the latter
extend    much    further towards     the blue   than we had observed the
absorption to extend.      In fact, the bright lines extend somewhat more
than half the distance       between   6  and F, from 45 to 50 being visible,
and placed at nearly equal distances from each other.                    They also
commence close to the 6 group, i.e., with a wave-length nearly 5,164,
but the first two or three lines at that end are not so bright as those
which immediately succeed them.           The light giving these lines does
not extend to more than a short distance from the electrodes, and is
generally most conspicuous at the negative electrode.                  There is a
difficulty in consequence of the flickering character of the discharge in
getting any accurate measures of them, though they are bright
enough, especially at the less refrangible end, to be easily seen.             The
comparative    faintness  of the light   from  the  iron   tubes   appears   to  us
almost sufficient to account for our not having seen the reversed lines
so completely as the bright ones ; nevertheless, it is quite in accord
ance with what we in other cases observed, to suppose that some of
these lines may be more easily reversed at the temperature of the iron
tubes than others.

went the theory developed by Lord Rayleigh (Phil. Mag., vol. xli,
Series iv, 1871) leads to exactly the same equations to determine the
velocity of propagation as were used by Fresnel, so that his results
form equally a verification of Lord Rayleigh's theory.

     The work was carried out on two pieces of aragonite supplied by
  A. Hilger, Tottenham Court Road. In both cases two of the faces
  marked m m (Miller's " Mineralogy," p. 567) gave the best reflexions,
  and were therefore reserved to afford means for the determination of
 the position of the artificial faces. We will consider the two separately.
     The first crystal was cut at Professor Stokes' suggestion, so as to
 form two prisms.
     The edge of one of these was nearly parallel to the axis b of the
  crystal, the mean axis of elasticity, so that the principal plane of the
 prism almost coincided with the principal plane AOC of the wave
 surface, and I was able to show that the error arising from supposing
 the coincidence to be exact would never amonnt to as much as '00001.
     The axis OA of the crystal almost bisected the angle of the prism,
 which was 42° 50' 30". The observations of deviation and incidence
 were made with a goniometer by Grubb, lent me by Professor Stokes.
 The circle, about a foot in diameter, was graduated on silver, and was
 read to 10" by verniers.
     Each observation was repeated two or three times on different occa
 sions, and the mean of the results taken.           It was rarely that two
 measures of the same quantity differed by 20".
     Careful . precautions were taken to ensure the light        passing  in a
 principal plane of the prism.
     The observations with this prism extended from about 8° on one
 side of the axis OC to 16° ou the other, passing almost through the
extremity of an optic axis. Observations were taken at angles of in
cidence,    increasing uniformly by 2°, thus forming an arithmetical
progression.
    The values of /t for one wave were nearly constant, and varied but
little from                           ,
                                     1-68125.
    Let a, b, c, be the principal refractive indices. The series of values
given above corresponds to the circle of radius b. So that
                                  6 = 1-68125.
    The values corresponding to the other wave varied considerably.
According to Fresnel they ought to be radii vectores to an ellipse
axes a and     c.
    a was determined       by passing light along the axis OC, which wa
possible,  the    crystal having been cut with this object in view.   I found
                                a = 1-68580.
    To find c recourse was had to the second prism, which had its edge
nearly parallel to the axis of c.     I found
                                  c = 1-53013.

 on the other, theory and experiment agree closely.         The difference
 only  in two cases amounts to '0001, and       sometimes positive, some
                                                         is
 times negative.    [The  error in  experiment    certainly not so great as

     But for the next  through which the observations extended, the

                                          /t
theoretical.
   So that the results of observation would be represented by a circle
of radius L68125, and an oval curve with the same axes as Fresnel's
ellipse, viz.,
                                   a    = 1-68580
                                   c    = 1-53013
 which agrees closely with the ellipse for 10° on either side of the
axis a, and for the rest of the arc observed lies outside            it,
                                                          the difference
between the radii vectores of the two curves increasing as we recede
from a.
   The differences between experiment and Lord Rayleigh's theory
increase much more rapidly, and amount, at the end of the arc of 16°
observed, to "00202, or about ten times as much as on Fresnel's theory.
Thus Lord Eayleigh's theory differs from the truth by considerably
more than Fresnel's.
   The second prism was cut so as to have its edge nearly parallel to
 OC.
   The parallelism, however, was not sufficiently exact to enable me to
treat the principal plane of the prism as coincident with a principal
section AOB of the surface of wave slowness.            It was necessary,
therefore, to determine the values of Vi v2, the velocities of normal pro-
pagation, from Fresnel's construction. Let the optic axes meet        unit        a
sphere  centre at the centre of the surface in 00'  respectively  let   be    ;   P

The work extended over an arc of about            19°,    with the following
results : —
   For one wave the agreement was close throughout.              This section
differed but slightly from the circular section of radius 1'53013.
   For the other the differences were much greater.
   The results of experiment were represented by a curve, which in
the neighbourhood      of the lesser axis of Fresnel's section lies within
that section, cutting it at about the middle of the arc considered, and
afterwards lying without it.
   The excess of experiment over theory changes in the arc considered
from
                            -•0002 to +-0005.
This agrees with the result for the first prism in lying outside Fresnel's
surface as we approach the major axis.
   I then proceeded to estimate the effect of any possible errors made
in the determination of a, I, c, or the position of the plane, and showed
that no change at all within the limits of experimental error would
reconcile theory and experiment more closely.          As a test of the accu
racy of the experimental work, it may be stated that a series of obser
vations, taken at an interval of some three months previously to those
described above, gave results which rarely differed from those results
by more than
                                  •00004.
   To proceed now to the second crystal.          The measurements on it
were made at an interval of nearly a year after those already described.
The crystal was in the form of a hexagonal prism, the base of the
prism being nearly perpendicular to c. This base was polished.            The
other end was cut so as to be inclined to the base at an angle of
35° 2' 56", the line of intersection of the faces of tbe prism thus
formed being nearly parallel to that of m and c. One of the faces, m,
was cut so as to be inclined to the oblique section at about 37°, the
line of junction being again nearly parallel to that of m and c. So that
I thus formed two prisms whose principal planes were nearly coincident,
having one face in common.
    By this means I was able to work over an arc which extended from
 the neighbourhood of the principal section AOC to more than 70° on
 the other side of it.
    The planes cut the principal plane, AOC, in two points, L L', such
 that—

    The values used for a, b, c, were —
                              a   =    1-68560
                               6  =    1-68115
                              c   =   1-53013
    These values differ slightly from those used in the first part of the
paper, though not by nearly so large amounts as Rudberg found be
tween the values for two different specimens of aragonite.          He had
differences of more than     -0004 (" Pogg.    Annalen," xvii, 1).  For the
outer sheet, which differs least from a sphere, the results of theory and
experiment agree fairly closely. But for the inner sheet the curve
given by theory agreeing With that given by experiment at the ex
tremity of an axis, lies outside of it throughout the whole of its course
away from that axis. The difference is greatest at about 35° away
from the principal section, AOC being there as great      as -0009.
    From this point the differences decrease, and at the end of the arc
 considered, or 74° away from the same axis, the value is
                                    •0003.
    I found  also that no changes in the values of a, b, c, would produce
 closer agreement, but that if we suppose the arcs LP, L'P, to be in
 creased by 17', and the angles ALP, AL'P, by about 1°, the differences
 between theory and experiment were reduced about -00006, taken
 throughout the arc, being sometimes positive, sometimes negative.
     I have shown, however, that this change in the position of P in
 volves alterations in the measures by which its position relative to the
 faces mm was determined, which are far in excess of any possible expe
 rimental error, and that the only way of accounting for them is by
 supposing the axes of elasticity of aragonite to be slightly variable in
 position relatively to the faces of the crystal.

   On tbe whole, however,       I prefer to regard Fresnel'a theory as a close
first approximation to the truth, and to look to the phenomena of
dispersion to explain the variation from it.
   I may perhaps be allowed to close with a suggestion, which, judging
from the results of a few experiments I have already made, appears to
have some basis of truth.

slowness, and can therefore be calculated, and suppose we neglect             the
terms   —
          y, &c.   Observing the values of fi in this direction for different
rays, we get

 " On the Theimo-Electric Properties of Liquids."           By G. Gore,
   LL.D., F.R.S. Received March 12, 1878.* Read March 28.
    In  the " Philosophical Magazine," January, 1857, 1 published an ac
 count of an investigation on the "Development of Dynamic Electricity
by the Immersion of unequally-heated Metals in Liquids," and observed
that, if we heat the upper end of a column of an electrically conduct
ing liquid, the two ends of the column being bounded by plates of the
same metal, an upward current of electricity is usually produced if the
liquid has an acid reaction, and a downward one if it is alkaline ; and
I  showed, in a brief manner, that this statement was true in various
instances, provided chemical action was excluded.        This latter con
dition was, in many cases, largely secured by employing platinum
plates, and avoiding the use of such liquids as corrode that metal.      I
also stated that the currents thus produced did not appear to arise from
any action of heat or other force in the mass of the liquid.
   I  have recently investigated this phenomenon more extensively, em
ploying, in the first series of experiments, a similar apparatus to the
one described in that paper, but of a much larger and more effective
size, as shown below.     The circular disks of metal which bounded the
ends of the glass cylinder were 4f inches in diameter, and the column
                               • Soo ante, p. 272.

of liquid was 4 inches in diameter and 1£ inch high, and consisted of
about 12 ounces by measure.           The metals employed in this apparatus
were in nearly all cases either platinum, gold, or palladium.*
    The apparatus was made water-tight, by the aid of vulcanized india-
rubber washers ; but, as those washers affected the electric currents,
they were covered on each side by others of pure india-rubber, some
what wider than themselves, secured to them by means of spirit-
varnish. In some cases, especially for the lower end of the cylinder,
where the heat did not affect them, washers of the pure rubber alone
were employed; and, for use with strongly alkaline solutions, the
vulcanized washers were, in certain instances, previously immersed
during five or six hours in a hot or boding and strong solution of
caustic soda, to remove sulphur, and then thoroughly washed. Nearly
all the liquids were, previous to using, boiled, to expel dissolved air,
  * Messrs. Johnson and            were kind enough to lend me a valuable pair of
                           Matthey
palladium plates for these experiments.

                  the Thermo-Electric Properties    of Liquids.            515
 cooled and filtered    ; the presence of air in the liquid was, however,
  found to interfere but little with the chief results, except with certain
 solutions, or unless the air was large in amount.        It is necessary that
 the liquids be clear, for if a solid deposit settles upon the lower plate,
  it interferes with the current.
     In using    the apparatus it was essential to screw it together very
 tightly     before each experiment,      otherwise   it became somewhat
 loosened by the influence of the heat upon the upper washers and the
 screws, and the currents were thereby greatly increased in magnitude.
 The quantity of water put into the cistern above the upper plate before
 each experiment was two ounces, and the current of steam passed into
 it raised its temperature from 60° to 210° F. in about seven or eight
 minutes.     It was necessary to take the apparatus asunder, and wash the
 plates   and  washers thoroughly before each experiment, and to remove
 from them every particle of extraneous substance. In many cases the
 gold or platinum plates (but never the palladium ones, because they
oxidize) were heated to redness before an experiment.            The galvano
 meter employed was in nearly all cases an astatic one, with a coil
offering a resistance of 100 ohms, and was found to be more suitable
 than others which offered less resistance.
     I examined, by means of this apparatus, a large number of conduct-
ing solutions, in order to include conspicuous instances of the pheno
mena and exceptional cases, as well as to more completely ascertain
any sources of interference, and the proper conditions for obtaining
the most reliable results.     Metals or liquids which chemically affected
each other were usually avoided, and base metals, and even silver,
were rarely used.      Plates of palladium were found to be much more fre
quently corroded than those of platinum or gold, and were therefore
much less suitable for these experiments ; they were thus acted upon
in hot or cold ones of chloride of chromium or perchloride of iron,
in hot solutions of either chloride of manganese, acidulated ones of
nitrate or chlorido of copper, and in one of iodate of potassium.
Those of copper were corroded in a hot solution of carbonate of sodium.
 With different liquids, also, different circumstances occurred, which
interfered with the currents ; in some cases the liquid corroded both
plates, as with palladium in chloride of chromium or perchloride of
iron ; in others it corroded the hot plate only. In some instances the
liquids were chemically changed by contact either with the hot plate
or the washers, and deposited oxide or basic salt upon them ; for
instance, perchloride of iron in contact with hot palladium, platinum,
or gold ; or permanganate of potassium in contact with hot platinum
or with the washers. With strongly alkaline solutions, the prepared
washers, and even those formed of pure rubber only, were acted upon,
the upper stratum of liquid became slightly yellow, and therefore
altered in chemical composition, and the currents were greatly altered

 516                           Mr. G. Gore on
 in magnitude,    especially if the heat was continued until bubbles of
 steam   formed  against the upper plate.
    During an examination, by means of this apparatus, of nearly all the
 liquids named in this paper,   I gradually ascertained the extent of this
 interference   of the washers, and found that even the most carefully-
 prepared ones affected, more or less, the magnitude of the currents on
 all solutions which were not neutral, or nearly so, to test-paper ; they,
 however, rarely reversed the direction of the current.     The degree of
 tightness, also, to which the apparatus was screwed up largely affected
 the quantity of the current in such liquids.
    In consequence of these circumstances,      I devised and constructed
 the apparatus here represented, and employed it for the purpose of
 checking the results obtained with strongly alkaline or acid solutions,
 in the one with circular plates   ; those obtained with the more neutral
 liquids less required checking.
   The chief part of this apparatus consists of a
                                                    bent glass-tube (fig. 1),
with   open cup-shaped ends, B and C, and
                                               an open exit-tube, D. This

glass vessel, when first constructed, was straight, and the narrow part
of it, A,afterwards bent by means of a row of Bunsen's burners. Each
of the cnps contained a ribbon of sheet platinum, B, welded to the
lower end of a thin platinum tube, F, and coiled into a spiral form, the
coil resting upon a triangle of glass rod or platinum wire, G, placed
inside each cup ; each ribbon employed was 48 inches long and 1 inch
wide, and weighed two troy ounces ; shorter and somewhat wider
ones would be more convenient, and for the cold electrode a much
smaller one would probably suffice, but only for use with such liquids
as offer but little electric conduction-resistance ; the hot electrode
must, however, be large, in all cases, in order to obtain conspicuous
results.   Each of the platinum tubes was tightly fixed in a hole in the
centre of a bung of cork, which fitted the mouth of the cup, by which
the electrode might be lifted out ; each bung also had a hole in     for        it,
the insertion of a thermometer, and small one, also, for escape of air.

tained about five ounces of solution, and the cistern required about
three ounces of water.       All the sketches are about one-fourth the
actual linear dimensions.
   In using the apparatus the electrodes were first well cleaned, wash 3d,

 518                          Mr.   (Jr.  Gore on
 and drained    as completely  as possible,   heated to redness, coiled, and
placed in position ; the galvanometer connected ; the vessel charged
with the clear and cold solution by means of the funnel, until
the electrodes were quite submerged;            and the deflection of the
 galvanometer    needles was also noted.      The cistern was then charged
 with water; and as soon as the needles of the galvanometer settled
at or near zero, a Bunsen's burner (previously placed beneath the
 projecting chamber K) provided with a regulating tap, was lighted,
the water heated to boiling, and boiled until the temperature of the
 solution ceased to rise, the deflections of the needles during the
 process of heating being noted.         The hot water was then ran out,
the apparatus allowed to cool, then discharged of its solution, and
 thoroughly washed by ponring abundance of cold water through
 each limb.     It usually required about three or four minutes to
raise the water in the cistern to 212° F.; the liquid in the cup C
usually acquiring a temperature of nearly 150° F. by that time ; and
it required the water in the cistern to be kept boiling about six or
eight minutes longer in order to raise the temperature of the inner
liquid to 200° F., and that was nearly the highest temperature it would
acquire.
    This apparatus   acted very satisfactorily, and enabled me to more
accurately  examine the influence      of heat in such actions.  The results
obtained with this form of thermo-electric liquid examiner, confirmed
in nearly every case, where the currents were feeble, those obtained
with the other one, and confirmed also so far as regards the chief
results (viz., the existence and direction of the current) those obtained
with strongly acid or alkaline liquids, but less frequently confirmed
with such solutions the relative magnitudes of the currents in diffe
rent cases ; the large cylinder apparatus may therefore be satisfactorily
employed with neutral solutions, but is not suitable for purposes of
accurate measurement of the currents, especially of those obtained
with strongly acid or alkaline liquids.
   Although the experiments made with the cylinder apparatus were
liable to interferences caused by the washers, as nearly all of them
gave substantially reliable results, it was desirable to record them in
the following pages 'for the purpose of comparison.             A sufficient
number of liquids was examined by means of each apparatus so as to
include apparently exceptional cases as well as conspicuous and extreme
instances of the phenomenon ; and the following is an abbreviated
statement of the results obtained, with occasional remarks upon them.
                 Behaviour of Different Liquids and Metals.
                       A. —In the  Cylinder Apparatus.
   In all the experiments with this apparatus, the water in contact
with the upper plate was raised to a temperature of about 210* F.,

and the lower plate was at the atmospheric temperature, varying from
55° to 65° F. In all instances where the temperature is not specified,
the upper plate was at 210° F. Distilled water was used in making
all the various solutions, unless otherwise stated.
     Erperiment No. 1. 14 oz. by measure of water and 1 oz. of a satu
rated solution of pure sodic carbonate. Platinum plates. Galvanometer
of 25 ohms resistance.        Current J, hot plate positive, deflection -25°.
    No. 2. 7 oz. of water and 7 oz. of the same saturated solution. Pla
tinum plates.      Current \ 7'5.
    No. 3. 1 oz. of water and 14 oz. of the same saturated solution.

    No. 5. The same mixture. Silver plates.              Current | 15' 75.
    Remark*. No sign of corrosion of the plates appeared in either of
these five experiments.        The current increased in magnitude with the
strength    of the  solution.
    No. 6. The same mixture. Copper plates.                Current J 65'5. The
npper plate      was   found   corroded    after   this  experiment.     (Compare
No. 164.)
    No. 7. Upwards of forty different experiments were made with pure
dilute sulphuric acid of seven different degrees of strength, varying
from 12 oz. of water and 3 oz. of the acid to 14 oz. of water, and
-Jg- oz. of the acid ; and all the mixtures were tried with plates of pla
tinum, gold, and palladium.          The current was upward in every case,
and the amount of deflection varied from 1£° to 45°. (Compare Nos.
115, 116, and 117.)        The currents were reverse in direction to those
which would have been produced by chemical action ; and were
strongest with that metal which was the least likely to be chemically
affected, viz., platinum.
    No. 8. 14 oz. of water and J oz. of sulphuric acid.              Silver plates.
Current \ 20-5.

    No. 10. 14 oz. of water and 3 oz. of glacial acetic acid, or 14 oz. of
water, and either £ oz. or          oz. of the acid ; each mixture being used
with palladium plates gave very feeble current J ; and then, on suddenly
applying much cold water to the hot plate, a less feeble \ current was
produced.      Platinum and gold plates gave similar effects with a mix
ture of 14 oz. of water and       \ oz. of the acid.
    No. 11. 14 oz. of water and       i oz. of thick syrupy solution of ordi
nary phosphoric acid.         Platinum,    gold, and palladium plates. Cur

190°   F., and   36  at  210°  F.   Cold  water  produced a very strong J cur
rent, and the upper plate was found corroded after the experiment.
Remarks.     These circumstances show that the downward current was
due to the chemical action excited by the higher temperature.                 This
experiment     also   illustrates  the utility  of  subsequently applying cold
water to reveal the true effect of heat in cases where chemical action
interferes. (Compare Nos. 32, 60, and 125.)

Remarks. A comparison of the last eight experiments shows that a
mixture of an aqueous solution of cupric nitrate with one of nitric
acid yields stronger currents than either solution alone.
    No. 30. A strong aqueous solution of chloride of chromium.            Gold
plates.    Current \ 44 at 200° F., and 42 at 210° F. This liquid had

528                            Mr. G. Gore on
    No.   110. In order to ascertain   the effect of entire  absence of the
washers with a strongly alkaline solution,    I took the solution of caustic
soda used in experiments No. 86, 87, and 88, and put it into a large
\/-shaped glass tube of 1-inch internal diameter, containing two large
platinum electrodes wholly submerged, and suspended by thin plati
num wires, the ends of the tube being nearly closed by corks, and
heated one limb of the tube.         The hot platinum became positive 5|J
at 210° F.      By allowing the liquid in the heated limb to come into
contact with a bung of vulcanized india-rubber, the deflection was
increased to 40, thus further proving that vulcanized washers were
liable to interfere with the results.
    Conclusions and Remarks. On classifying and comparing in different
ways the foregoing results obtained with the large cylinder apparatus,
we find 1st, that in nearly all cases where the liquid is strongly acid,
and chemical action is absent, the cold metal is positive to the hot one,
and the electric current flows upwards.         And 2nd, that in nearly all
those where the liquid is strongly alkaline, and chemical action does
not occur, the hot metal is positive to the cold one, and the current
flows downwards ; thus affording additional evidence in support of
 the conclusions I drew in my former investigation already referred to
 (see p. 513).
    The nearest approach to exceptions to the above conclusions are in
 the instance of dilute acetic acid (see No. 10) ; solution of boracic
acid (No. 14) ; acid chromate of potassium (Nos. 33, 34, and 35) ;
 acid sulphate of potassium (No. 47); chloride of potassium (Nos. 65,
 66); (compare No. 130); and potassium alum (No. 97); (compare
No. 130) ; but in each of these cases the electric currents were very
feeble, ar.d may have been due to the influence of the washers.
    Nos. 1 8, 32, and 60, exhibit rather anomalous results, but in the
t wo first of these corrosion of the metal occurred ; and in each case
the metal plates were of palladium, and the solution contained a
chloride.
    It is  important to notice that, provided chemical action is excluded,
the direction of the current in all the experiments was scarcely at all
dependent upon the kind of metal, but almost entirely upon that of
 liquid ; the only exception to this were Nos. 85, 96, and 102, and
 these were but feeble ones.     In the exceptional cases, Nos. 18 and 32,
chemical action occurred.      I  therefore conclude that it is the nature of
the liquid, and not that of the metal, which most determines the existence
ond direction of the current.    The magnitude of the current, however,
is largely affected in many cases by a variation in the kind of metal
employed, even when no chemical change takes place.
    In some cases, especially with strongly alkaline liquids, the current
due to the heat is greatly increased by keeping the hot plate at 210°
 V. for some time ; for instance, with palladium in an aqueous solution

                the  T/iermo-Electric Properties     of Liquids.         529
of acid chromate of potassium acidified with chromic acid (see No.
35); with platinum, gold or palladium, in solution of carbonate of

potassium (Nos. 71, 72) ; also with platinum in potassic hydrate (No.
108.     See also No. 112).
                        B. — In the Bent-tube Apparatus.
   In   the experiments with this apparatus, the solution in the cup B
was at the atmospheric temperature, viz., from 55° to 65° F., and that
in cup C was raised to between 190° and 200° F., rarely beyond, by
keeping the water in the outer cistern at a boiling temperature.         The
solutions were not deprived of dissolved air previous to the experi
ments, because the presence of air had been found to have very little
effect.

perfectly   clean  and   bright, one of iron and the other of pure gold,
twisted them together, and immersed them in a solution of potassic
cyanide in a closed bottle kept at ordinary atmospheric temperature.
After a few weeks the gold had entirely dissolved and disappeared, but
the iron remained unaltered in appearance.          I also found iron to be
electro-negative to gold in such a solution.      Iron employed also as an
anode in such a liquid offers a much greater degree of resistance
 than gold to the passage of an electric current.
    Remarks and conclusions. A review of the results obtained with the
 improved apparatus confirms, in nearly all cases, the general conclu
 sions (see p. 528) arrived at by means of experiments with the cylinder
 one. The most conspicuous exceptions yet met with have been obtained
 with a solution of sulphate of manganese (No. 148), chrome alum
 (No. 156), sulphate of nickel (No. 155), and argentic nitrate (No.
 J 47), probably also of sulphate of iron (No. 159); cupric sulphate also
 (Nos.   15 and   113) appears to be a feeble exception.      In some acid
 solutions,  also, hot platinum is feebly positive, for instance, dilute
 selenious acid (No. 157), an alcoholic solution of chloride of chromium
  (No. 129), and an aqueous one of amnionic alum (Nos. 96 and 136).
 No instance, however, has yet been met with in which, in the absence

 534                              Mr. G. Gore on
 of chemical change, hot platinum is strongly positive in a 6trongly
 acid solution, or strongly negative in a very alkaline one ; the nearest
 approach to this was in the case of aqueous selenious acid.                A law
 without an apparent exception           is an   unusual  phenomenon,    and,  as a
 single real exception will invalidate a general law, if the above ex
 ceptions are real ones, they prove that the theory that acids are
 thermo-electro-positive,     and alkalies thermo-electro-negative,      is not an
 exact one.
    Some strongly acid solutions give only feeble currents; for instance,
 acid sulphate of potassium (Nos. 48 and 128), and some strongly
alkaline ones behave similarly, except when persistently heated ; for
 example, potassic hydrate (No. 112), Bodic hydrate (No. 142), and
 carbonate of rubidium (No. 149).            On the other hand, some neutral
solutions yield currents stronger than the chemical theory would lead
us to expect ; for instance, chloride of potassium (Nos. 66 and 130).
    One rather common effect observed has been a very great increase
in the magnitude of the current by continuance of the heat without
increased rise of temperature, as if molecular inertia or some other
slowly yielding resistance had to be overcome.                 This occurred in
nearly all solutions which were strongly alkaline, and was at one time
suspected by me to be wholly due to the action of the liquid upon the
washers ; it occurred freely, however, in experiments with the bent
tube apparatus in which no washers were employed.                  The following
                                        —
are examples of such an effect : with carbonate of sodium (Nos. 39,
40, and 41), carbonate of potassium (Nos. 70, 71, 72, and 121), caustic
potash (Nos. 108 and 112), iodide of potassium (No. 132), sodic hypo
sulphite (No. 135), cyanide of potassium (No. 145 ), carbonate of
rubidium (No. 149), fluoride of potassium (No 151), and fluoride of
rubidium (No. 153). It also took place, though less frequently and to
a less degree, in liquids of acid reaction ; for instance, an acidified
solution of acid chromate of potassium (No. 38), iodate of potassium
(No. 131), an acidified solution of cupric nitrate (No. 138), bromide
of cobalt (No. 140), argentic nitrate (No. 147), and sulphate of man
ganese (No. 148).        In some other cases the quantity of the current
diminished by continuance of heat.
    The whole of the results obtained with this apparatus further con
firm the conclusion obtained from the results of the experiments made
with the cylinder one, viz., that, provided chemical action is not present,
it is the nature of the liquid, and not so much that of the metal of the
electrodes, which determines the existence and direction of the cur
rent.* If also we class under the heads of their respective acids all the
salts employed in the experiments, and then class them similarly under
their respective bases, we find that both the direction and the magni-
   • No. 109 is not a real exception to this statement.

tude of the current varies with each different base and acid ; but in the
few   casesin which electrodes of different metal were employed with the
same liquid, as with platinum, copper, and iron in solution of sodic
carbonate in Nos. 118-164 and 165 ; with platinum and iron in solution
of sodic hydrate of Nos. 142 and ] 66, and with iron and platinum in
solution of potassic cyanide of Nos. 145 and 167, the quantity only, and
not tho direction, of the current was affected. This agrees with the
results obtained with the cylinder apparatus, in which a greater variety
of metals was employed. The only apparent exception to this state
ment was with iron in solution of potassic cyanide of No. 109 ; but
the contradictory result obtained in that case was evidently due to
the liquid acting upon the washers.
                                   Cause of the Currents.
  The heat applied to one of the plates must either act as the real
cause of the currents, or merely as an exciting cause, by liberating from
a potential state another force which produces them. If it acts as the
real cause, the effect will be proportional to the heat applied, except in
those cases where some condition (such as conduction resistance, or a
reversal of electric polarity) exists to prevent or diminish it.  If, how
ever, it operates merely as an exciting cause, the current would either
be large in proportion to the amount of heat applied, or vary in a
different ratio to the temperature, because the liberated force would
probably obey a different and higher law of increase than that of the
temperature.    The substances also, having evolved a portion of their
stored-up power, would be in a different potential condition after an
experiment to what they were before it. If, however, we examine all
the results, we find that in nearly the whole of the instances the cur
rents increased in magnitude (usually in approximate proportion) with
the temperature, and the metals and liquids after an experiment were
in precisely the same physical and chemical state as they were before               it,
and might therefore be used again for the same experiment any number
of times without loss of efficiency.
  Heat alone, or chemical affinity excited by heat, appears to be the only
probable cause of the currents. That chemical action, started by heat,
did not produce them, appears certain — 1st, because no corrosive effect
(shown by loss of brightness) was manifested upon the plates, even
after many experiments, except in certain cases, and this was quite a
delicate test  nor in the great bulk of the instances did any other

chemical change occur; and, 2nd, because when chemical action of anr
kind did take place, it either produced no electric currents, or it pro
duced currents either in a reverse direction, or greater in amount than
those due to the heat.      It also in nearly all such cases either caused the
plates  to  lose  their lustre,  produced a deposit upon them, or made the
liquids change in colour or become cloudy.             In consequence of these
different effects, the apparatus and method of experiment may be em
ployed for detecting some of the chemical (as well as the electrical)
effects of heat upon electrically conducting liquids.          No signs of elec
trolytic action, or deposition of metal, even in the most suitable solu
tions, such as those of copper, were observed ; and there was no reason
to suppose that the metal plates contained occluded gases.           The pheno
mena were also inconsistent with the supposition that the heat operated
by temporarily dissociating the constituents of the liquid. (Compare
Nos. 77, 94, 159, 160, and 161.)         The fact also that the currents pro
duced    in  acid  liquids  were   opposite in direction to those which would
have been produced by chemical action, is very strong evidence against
the cause being chemical.        From these various circumstances it is clear
that, except in those cases where signs of chemical change were
detected, heat was the true and only cause of the currents, and not
merely an exciting cause of chemical action producing them.
    Although heat is the true and only cause of the currents,            it may
operate either in a direct manner in producing them, or through the
agency of some intermediate force.          If it operates through some other
force, then an action of that force must form an essential part of the
phenomena.        As the currents are not confined         to magnetic liquids,
magnetic action cannot be an essential condition.           Light also does not
manifestly influence the results, and chemical         action can be excluded :
 and the only forces likely to be active in the circumstances of the case
 are those of cohesion and adhesion.          We know that rise of tempera
 ture usually diminishes both these powers, expands both solids and
 liquids, and rearranges their molecules ; it usually diminishes the adhe
 sion of liquids to solids ; and in certain cases it even disassociates the
 elements of a compound.         As the action, however, which produces the
 current always requires       two substances, viz., a liquid and a metaL and
 evidently occurs either wholly or chiefly at their immediate surfaces of
 mutual contact, we may conclude that it is not an effect of heat upon
 the force of cohesion in the mass of liquid or of metal.
    Although various effects of heat upon cohesion and adhesion must
 occur in the metals and liquids employed in these experiments, and
 cannot be excluded, they may still not necessarily form an essential
 part of the phenomena, but be only concomitant circumstances, and the
 existence of the electric currents may be in no degree dependent upon
 them. As also the currents continue not only during the rise and fall of
 temperature, but likewise during a stationary and prolonged difference

                the Thermo- Electric Properties  of Liquids.            537
of it, and are not reversed in direction during the cooling, it is evident
that they cannot be due to the act of diminution of cohesion or adhe
sion produced by the heat. As, further, all the substances employed
are in precisely the same physical and chemical states after an experi
ment as they were before it, and as the portion of heat expended in
raising the temperature, expanding the substances, and diminishing
their cohesion and adhesion, must have been given out again on the
cooling and contracting of those bodies, that portion cannot have been
expended in producing the currents.      From these considerations    I con
clude that neither the force of cohesion, nor that of adhesion, acts as
an intermediate cause of the currents, and that the latter are, in an
ordinary sense of the word, direct effects of the heat. (It may be
further remarked that if a change of the force of cohesion, or of that
of adhesion, gave rise to the currents, then such a change when pro
duced by other means than heat (such as enormous pressure) must be
capable of causing similar effects.)
    As heat was the true, immediate, and only cause of the currents, the
action may, in accordance with usage in similar cases, be properly
termed thermo-electric ; and as heat was the only force expended, we
may also, in accordance with the great law of conservation of energy,
safely conclude that heat disappeared in the process. And as it is the
nature of the liquid which most determines both the existence of the
current and its direction, it is true thermo-electric action of liquids,
and liquids possess true thermo-electric properties.
    The heat must, however, be subject in its operation to some guiding
condition which determines the kind of effect to be produced, and both
the cause, heat, and the effect, electricity, must be essentially related
to that condition. Such a condition appears to be the acid or alkaline
nature of the liquid ; as, however, chemical action is not necessary, and
different liquids of acid reaction (or of alkaline reaction) give a reverse
direction of current, the chemical conditions of acidity or alkalinity
are probably only concomitant circumstances, and do not really, but
only apparently, determine the kind of effect ; and as those conditions
are usually of an opposite kind in liquids which yield an opposite
direction of current, and are in most cases stronger as the currents are
more powerful, they are probably themselves dependent upon some
more general condition which itself determines the direction of the
currents.
    A single clear exception invalidates a general inference, and indi
cates the existence probably of the action of a second law, or of a more
general cause or condition. That the thermo-electric-negative pro
 perty of a liquid is separable from and may exist without the alka
 line property, is clearly proved by the exceptional direction of the

538                             Mr. G. Gore   on
pliatoof manganese (No. 148), and probably also sulphate of iron
(No. 159);  and in a less conspicuous degree in solutions of sulphate of
copper (Nor. 15 and 113), sulphate of didymium (No. 154), and other
substances.
   These anomalous results indicate the existence of a deeper seated
condition of the currents than that of the acid or alkaline nature of
the liquid, because the currents in those instances are not merely
altered in quantity but actually reversed.  And this deeper condition
must also affect the quantity of the current in different cases, because
a diminution of quantity is a step towards a reversal of direction, and
an actual reversal is probably only an extreme degree of the same
change.
   This more abstruse condition consists probably of the structural
arrangement of the molecules of the liquid ; for we know as a matter
of course that tridimensional geometrical, as well as mechanical condi
tions of the molecules must be fundamentally involved in the action.
It is also probable that as the chemical and electrical phenomena in
these experiments are usually coincident in their changes, this hidden
condition is of a more general kind than either, and determines not
only the acid or alkaline reaction of the solution, but also the produc
tion and direction of the currents (t.e., it determines whether the heat
shall produce a current at all, and also the direction of the current pro
duced) ; and that these two effects, the chemical and electrical, are but
concomitant ones.       Itis,  however, evident that heat acting upon a
saline conducting liquid in the manner described         not alone sufficient
to cause a current, but that another condition       is is
                                                          necessary, because
with some good conducting solutions, such as were used in Nos. 47,
49, 51, 57, 67, 69, 75, 90, 122, and especially No. 146, little or no cur
rent was produced.
   The heat then acts as the real cause of the currents, and a par
ticular molecular state of the liquid probably determines the kind and
direction of effect the heat shall produce, and as we also know that the
molecular structure of all bodies     is  profoundly altered by change of
temperature,    wo  may reasonably conclude that whilst a portion of the
heat     absorbed in temporarily changing the molecular structure, and
         is
is  again set free when the structure returns to its original state during
the process of cooling, another portion       is expended and lost in pro
ducing the current.
    According to this interpretation the phenomenon of the current       is a
product   of three   circumstances, viz., 1st, a particular molecular struc
 ture of the liquid
                  ;    2nd, a change of the latter by alteration of tempe
rature; and 3rd, a direct conversion of heat into dynamic electricity;
such conversion being dependent upon the two prior conditions. The
 second circumstance also agrees with the fact that in certain liquids,
 for instance, Nos. 130, 139, 155, 156, 157, and 162, the current does

               the Thermo-Electric Properties   of Liquids.       539
not increase    uniformly with the temperature, but in some cases
diminishes, and in others, for instance, Nos. 155 and 156, is actually
reversed.
   The following table and diagram represent the change which
occurred with the solution composed of 14 oz. of water and 2 oz. of
chrome alum (No. 156); (those of sulphate of nickel (No. 155), and
bromide of nickel (Nos. 106 and 139), are also shown for three tempe
ratures each in the diagram). The dotted lines represent the elec
trical states of the heated platinum.

    These diminutions of current and reversals of its direction by rise of
temperature indicate irregular molecular changes in the layer of liquid
next to the heated plate ; and the examination of electrically conduct
ing solutions by this apparatus and process constitutes a new mode of
 discovering snch alterations in them. By obtaining also a sufficient
 variety and number of instances of such change, for comparison, classi
 fication and generalization, we may probably be enabled to infer and
 discover some general truths respecting molecular action, or gain some
 knowledge of the molecular conditions necessary for the conversion of
 heat into dynamic electricity.      As also molecular change is a funda
 mental action in bodies, and many of the secondary properties of sub
 stances depend upon molecular state, an alteration of the former is
 usually attended by more than one of the latter ; and we may there
 fore reasonably infer that the foregoing change in the electrical pro
 perties of a solution of chrome alum and other liquids is attended by
 other coincident physical changes, such, for instance, as that of expan
 sion, or of specific heat capacity.
     According to the contact theory of voltaic action, a metal touching
 another metal, or touching a liquid, tends to produce an electric cur

                the Tkermo-JElectric Properties      of Liquids.           541
rent by the mere contact alone, and when this contact effect of a
metal with a liquid differs in strength with two different metals, such
metals, each at the same temperature, and immersed in a liquid of that
temperature (whether cold or hot, and without the aid of chemical
action), generates a current, provided the contact effect of the metals
themselves does not neutralise      that of the metals and liquid.
    Such an effect has been already obtained.         Becquerel, for instance,
immersed pure platinum and gold in various acids, ammonia, and
neutral saline solution, and obtained very feeble currents.          He con
cluded that the state of the surface of the metals had great influence,
and that consequently capillary affinity played a very important part
in producing the effects.             " Comptes Rendus Acad. Sci," Paris,
                                (See
1870, pp. 480, 961, 1313; also "Chemical News," vol. xxii, p. 21,
and vol. xxiii, p. 222.)     As neither gold nor platinum is perceptibty
corroded by dilute acids, nor usually by saline liquids, at ordinary
atmospheric temperatures, any electric current produced by such a
combination can only be due to contact, either of the metals with each
other or with the liquid.
   According to these facts, as in the thermo-electric apparatus there
is no contact of dissimilar metals, both the contact of the cold metal
(as well as that of the hot one) with the liquid, tends to generate a
current, and rise of temperature makes the warmer metal only more or
less electro-positive than it was previously. Another reason also for
concluding that both the cold and the hot piece of metal, at each
different temperature, tends to generate a current, is, that with two
pieces of the same metal at 60° F. in the apparatus, if one was made
colder, a current was produced in the same direction as when the other
was heated.      The electrical effect, therefore, is a result of a difference
of action at the surfaces of contact of the two pieces of metal with the
liquid ; and the apparatus and method may be employed for detecting
differences of electric potential between metals and liquids at different
temperatures.
   In addition to Volta and Becquerel, others, viz., Pfaff, Fechner, Peclet,
Matteucci, Kohlrausch, Marianini, Hankel, Zamboni, Buff, and Thom
son, have investigated the contact theory of voltaic action, and Clifton
has examined the difference of electric potential produced by the
contact of metals and liquids (see
                                            " Proc. Roy. Soc," 1877, vol.
xxvi, p. 299), but the metals he employed were easily corrodible ones,
viz., zinc, iron, and copper.
   As in my experiments the origin of the current appears to lie in a
conversion of heat into electricity, and heat probably disappears in the
process, it is a reasonable inference that, in the above experiments of
Becquerel' s, &c, heat also disappears and produces the currents ; and,
if this be correct, then it is also likely that, when a piece of metal is
simply immersed in a suitable liquid, the temperature is altered ; and

542                              Mr. G. Gore on
this would be a parallel fact in the science of heat to that of the pro
duction of electricity by contact action in electrical science.
   This research throws some light upon the origin of the voltaic cur
rent, and the results accord with the original contact theory of Volta (of
late years revived in this country), that electric currents may be pro
duced between metals and liquids, by mutual contact, without the aid of
chemical action.
   I   should   much like to determine, by actnal experiment, various
points suggested by this research : — 1st. Whether, by the mere contact
of a metal and liquid, an alteration of temperature is produced.     2nd.
To make a model thermo-electromotor, composed of iron and a solution
of sodic carbonate ; and ascertain its electromotive power, and whether
a series of several such cells will electrolyse a liquid.   3rd.   To test
the effect of rough and smooth surfaces of the plates.        4th. To en
deavour to obtain an electric current with iron plates nnder the in
fluence of magnetism.     5th. To search for other instances of molecular
change, also for other physical changes (such as that of irregular
absorption of heat) coincident with the molecular ones. 6th. To com
pare the electromotive power of a platinum pair against one of iron,
gold, silver, &c, and to settle other questions which have occurred to
my mind.
                             (Added March 17, 1878.)
   The thermo-electric        properties of liquids appear to be related to the
statical   electric   effects of the contact of metals with liquids.     Peclet
found that platinum and gold exhibited, by contact with acidulated
water, electric signs contrary to those which would have been pro
duced had those metals been oxidised or chemically corroded ; also,
that they gave opposite electric signs with solutions of potash, am
monia, or hydrosulphate of potassium, to those which they gave with
dilute nitric, hydrochloric, or sulphuric acid. (See " Annal de Chim.,"
1841, vol.   ii,pp. 233-255; "Arch, de l'Elect.," 1841, vol.       pp. 621-
                                                                      i,
650; and De la Rive's "Treatise on Electricity," English edition, vol.          ii,
p. 849.)     Pfaff, also, found those metals exhibit opposite electric signs
by  contact   with solutions of caustic potash, soda, or ammonia, to those
obtained by contact with strong nitric, hydrochloric, or sulphuric
acids.    (See Poggendorff's "Annalen," 1840, vol.             pp. 110-124,

similar results to the above, with platinum in contact with solution of
potash, dilute nitric or sulphuric acid, commercial nitric acid, and in
fully concentrated nitric acid.       (See Liebig's "Ann. de Chem. and
Pharm." 1842, vol. xlii, pp. 5-14; "Archives de l'Elect.," 1843,

positive electricity by contact with acids, and with negative by contact
with alkalies ; and its electrical condition in acids to be the opposite of
that which would have been produced by chemical corrosion. All these
results agree with mine. The statical electric effects which Pfaff
obtained with other liquids, such as solutions of argentic nitrate, cupric
sulphate, ferrous and ferric sulphates, and other salts, also agree in the
main with the dynamic ones obtained with my apparatus.             Rise of
temperature, therefore, usually only increased and sustained the differ
ence of electric condition between metals and liquids which contact
produced ; and this effect was the same in acid and alkaline solutions.
As also the direction of the current agreed usually with that of electric
polarity produced by contact, if we know that of the one at a particular
temperature, that of the other may be predicted from it. These con
siderations also indicate the existence of a zero of temperature for each
pair of substances, below which contact would not develop electricity
in thern.

   Since writing the above, have met with a paper by M. Pouillet on
"  New Phenomena of the Production of Heat,"* in which the author
stated, that at the instant a liquid wets a solid, or is absorbed by                      it,
there     is disengagement of heat, and proved this statement by nu
               a
merous experiments, made with a variety of substances, in such                            a
manner as was likely to secure trustworthy results.            The liquids
employed were confined to water, oil, alcohol, and acetic ether only                       ;
but the solids were very various, chiefly organic substances, but in
cluding also (in     state of fine division) porcelain, glass, clay, carbon,
                          a
sulphur, silica, alumina, magnesia, oxides of chromium, the peroxides
of iron and of manganese also finely-powdered metals, viz., iron, zinc,
                                        ;
tin, antimony, and copper. The rise of temperature found with in
organic bodies varied from        to   of a C. degree, and lasted from two
                                            -2   '5
to four minutes, and then the temperature returned to its former state.
Regnault has confirmed the general result.f
   As the mere contact of metals and liquids develops heat, and as
 (without the aid of chemical action) heat excites an electric current,
and the direction of the current produced by heating platinum in con
 tact with either acid or alkaline solutions, agrees with the signs of
 static electric polarity excited by the contact of that metal with those
liquids, we may reasonably conclude that the heat and free electricity,
excited by such contact, are related to each other, either as cause and
effect, or as coincident effects of some other cause contained in the act
of contact.

         Edward       L. Moss, M.D., R.N., late of H.M.S. "Alert."
         Communicated by Sir George Nares, Captain, R.N., K.C.B.,
         F.R.S. Received May 3, 1878. Read May 23.*
     In   order that observations on the specific gravity of sea-water
shonld be made in the Arctic Expedition of 1875, by the method
successfully     used on board       Her Majesty's ship " Challenger,       "f Sir
 George Nares, when he left that ship to take command of the expe
dition, brought with him one of Mr. Buchanan's hydrometers.
     Professor Hartley superintended the construction of its graduated
 weights, and suggested the supply of apparatus for the volumetric
 estimation of chlorine ; and, on the departure of the expedition, both
 sets of observations were allotted to me.
      Storms interfered with observations in the Atlantic, but they were
 begun on entering Baffin's Sea, and continued till the ships finally
 rounded Cape Farewell.             Most of the samples of water examined
 were from the surface, or from close beneath the floes ; but whenever
 the exigencies of ice navigation permitted, samples were obtained from
 various depths by means of
                                    " Buchanan's bottle." The " bottle " was
 also used in winter quarters, at first through holes made in the new
 ice, and afterwards of greater depths, when tidal fissures formed wide
 enough to let it pass down between the heavy floes.                  In very cold
 weather, or     when    surface  fresh water lay over a salt stratum with a
  temperature below the freezing point, it was found necessary to be
  specially careful to prevent the addition or withdrawal of ice by the
  cold brass of the bottle ; and during winter, water, however obtained,
  had to be re-mixed after it had acquired the temperature of my cabin,
  for ice formed in transit from the floes to the ship, melted, and lay in a
  differently refracting layer on the surface.              The temperatures were
  ordinarily taken with an open scaled centigrade thermometer, verified
  at its zero.       Its readings were constantly checked by observations
  with the Miller-Casella and Negretti and Zambra instruments, by
  which all the temperatures away from the surface were obtained.
       In the reduction of the specific gravities to a common temperature,
  Hubbard's coefficients were at first used, but all the observations on
   sea-water in the subjoined tables have been re-calculated by the
   formulae published during the absence of the expedition by Professors
   Thorpe and Rucker.J In the few instances in which the observations
   were made at minus temperatures, the reductions have been arrived at

  by extrapolation; but taking Hubbard's curve as an extreme, the
  error possible in the small range of temperature involved cannot
  extend beyond the fifth place of decimals.             The uncertainty of the
  process has, however, induced me to discard a column in which the
  specific gravities were expressed at the natural temperatures.        In both
  tables Stampfer's coefficients have been used for the waters from
  melted ice.
     But that an Oertling balance and a reserve of pure nitrate of silver
  were supplied, the chlorine estimations must have been omitted, for
  the standard silver solutions were destroyed by freezing — a disaster
  which considerably curtailed the number of experiments.
     The water of the polar basin, to such depths as we reached, had
  already acquired   the low specific gravity characteristic of outflowing
  polar currents.    This low specific gravity was maintained during
  winter and spring, after nine months' perpetual freezing. It is to be
 remembered, however, that the samples were from no great depth, and
 from a zone of the Polar Sea that annually receives, not only its own
 precipitation, but also the precipitation of the neighbouring shores,
 and that, too, at a comparatively high temperature.
     The channels between the Polar Sea and Smith's Sound contain two
 strata of sea- water, not owing their temperatures to local causes — an
 upper stratum of polar water overlies a warmer northward flowing
 extension of the Atlantic.      The specific gravity observations show that
 the relative position of the layers is due to salinity influencing their
 density more than temperature.            To overlie the polar water, the
 denser stratum would require a temperature above 10° C. The highest
 deep temperature obtained was below the freezing point, but there is
 sufficient range between the specific gravities of the deepest samples
 obtained and of Atlantic water to permit warmer Atlantic water to
 exist at a greater depth.
    In places where the deep water yet retains some temperature above
the freezing point, direct dilution at its own depth, with fresh water
from deep icebergs or subglacial streams, may so far reduco its salinity
as to let  it carry warmth to the surface, and thus help to occasion the
well known " rottenness " of floes in the neighbourhood of icebergs and
glacier cliffs.
    In addition to low specific gravity and temperature, the waters of
outflowing polar currents possess a third characteristic in the disturbed
proportion between their chlorides and sulphates, pointed out by
Forchhammer.* His great range of observations gives an oceanic pro
portion of 1T87 of sulphuric acid to 100 of chlorine; while his polar
currents show an average increase in the proportion of sulphates
amounting to -52. The sealed samples of water brought home by me

for verifications yielded 1T21 of sulphuric acid* (S03) to 100 of
chlorine in the deep warm water of Smith's Sound, and ll-59 in the
polar water, showing an excess of "38 in the latter.
   Forchhammer attributes this disturbed proportion either to a scarcity
of fucoidal plants or to the vicinity of volcanoes.
   If it be assumed that the dilution of outflowing polar currents is due
rather to shore precipitation than to transference of polar precipita
tion through the perennial floes, the littoral character of the current
will alone account for the increase of sulphates.
   On quitting Robeson Channel, Her Majesty's ship "Alert" found
herself on the shores of a sea covered exclusively with the heavy ice
before met with only in outlying fragments.    The pack edge ground
ing along the shore in fourteen fathoms, and forced upwards towards
the beach, formed      abarrier reef, inside which the ship found shelter.

As soon as new floe consolidated             was found that the grounded

masses, resembling icebergs in their size and stratification, differed
from them in being salt, and the first chlorine estimations were madt
in search of ice fit for the ship's use during winter.
    On the return of daylight, further observations both on the comp
sition and structure of the ice were begun, in the hope that they would
throw some light on the place and mode of growth of the stupendous
floes.
   All butthe surface of the floating ice was out of reach, bnt plenty                 of
sections were afforded by the great fragments forced upwards on the
beach.
   A floe grounded   quarter of a mile ahead of the ship had split into
                       a
several rectangular segments.   Its largest masses were separated                     by

narrow cleft passing vertically through the ice and exposing fresh               a
section, measuring 47 feet at right angles to the plane of stratifica

previous to its last upheaval.   The cleft intersected this tide-mar's
11 feet from its top surface.   The floe sides under the mark were
grooved with the vertical channellings of last season's snbaqneoos
thaw, but neither the tide mark nor the groovings passed into the cleft
and the sharp edges of the latter had evidently not been exposed                  to the
warmth of last summer.
   Dr. Rae has pointed outf how readily salt ice may lose its en

to infer that this fragment of floe had lost little of its saltness, cer
tainly none of its salt ice by drainage ; moreover, it afforded decided
facilities for obtaining samples of ice from every height of a consider
able section, and accordingly serial chlorine estimations were made
from top to bottom of it.
    The lowest part of this section was probably not the bottom of the
floe, but samples of deep ice were obtained from an almost overturned
mass, exhibiting the mammillary elevations common on the under side
of the floes, and in one part studded with stones and grooved by
motion against the bottom.            Our watering berg offered a section
where 30 inches of snow-formed ice lay over what had once been a
                                                             "
superglacial pool in the hollows of a " blue-domed             floe.  It will be
seen, on reference to the tabulated chlorine estimations, that, while the
annual floe of one winter's quarters held one-sixth the chlorine of
sea water, the most salt parts of the polar floe held but one-fifteenth.
The chlorine, however, does not represent all the salts, and water from
such ice is quite too brackish to drink.
    If the salinity of the polar floes leaves their mode of growth doubt
 ful, evidence much more to the point is supplied by their structure.
 The upper ice of upheaved segments, not only at Floeberg Beach,
 but along the shore as far as my sledge journeys extended, displayed
 more or less distinct horizontal stratification, like that of glacier neve.
 The stratification was strikingly regular and parallel, decreasing in
 width from above downwards, sometimes ending abruptly, but gene
 rally becoming indistinct and gradually disappearing 20 feet or
 more from the top.           Each stratum consisted of an upper white,
 merging into a lower blue part, the difference-in colour depending on
 the greater or less number and size of the air-cells in the ice. The
 lower blue passed abruptly, but without break in structure, into the
 spongy white of the layer beneath. After spring, when all exposed
 ice-surfaces became white and granular, the stratification was to be
 detected only by the unequal disintegration of the white and blue
 parts, causing in well-marked floebergs a crenulated outline in the
 profile of a section ; the blue, hard and unchanged, lying in the angle,
 and the white, granular and swollen, in the convexity.           This unequal
 disintegration    is to  be  attributed  to the  lesser transparency of the
 white parts to solar radiation rather than to any difference in salinity
 represented by the trifling and possibly experimental difference in
 specific gravity, shown by estimations Nos. 106 and 107.               The in
 distinctness   of  stratification  produced  by  summer    is not   permanent.
 The old floebergs worn into "blue domes," and "pie" shapes were well
 marked in early spring, though they had evidently borne the thaws of
 many seasons.       The stratification was most readily seen from a little
 distance.    I have   marked it in a sketch of a floeberg at Cape Joseph
 Henry, made quite a quarter of a mile off, but frequently tho limits of

 the layers could not be decided upon at arm's length, and in getting
 samples and measurements the easiest method of procedure was to
 stick on pieces of paper and adjust them to the layers, by retiring to a
 distance of 2(J or 30 yards.  The thinnest strata observed occurred in
 the sides of a water- worn ravine in a flocberg off Cape Bawson; in the
 middle of the bank, where the sections were nearly vertical, they
 measured     7   inches.  An iceberg off Cape Napoleon had strata only
 4 inches wide.       The widest I have any notes of were in the top of
the cleft floeberg already described. Here they were 3 feet deep ; but,
28 feet lower down, the lowest distinguishable strata were 18 inches
deep. Although the extremes differed so widely, the great majority of
the stratiti cations showed layers between 10 and 15 inches wide.  In
instances where stratification ceased abruptly, the ice immediately
 beneath was a sort of conglomerate               formed     of   masses         broken     from
older floes cemented together by frozen sea-water,* with differently
inclined lines of air-cells, and occasionally enclosing aggregations of
bright-yellow Diatomacece.     One such aggregation     from a floeberg
grounded on an island in Black Cliffs Bay, has been submitted to
  Rev. Eugene O'Meara. He has identified the Dixtomacem in               and              it,
 informs me that they are all of decidedly marine growth. Stratifica
 tion was not distinguishable in the masses of which the conglomerates
 were composed       ;indeed, submersion appears to play an important
 part in its obliteration.
     On the 28th March, 1876,     cut a pit through the snow on the top of
                                   I
 our watering berg and filled       in with minute-crystalled snow from a
                                      it
 little under  the surface.   On the 8th of May, the lower crystals were
 adherent to the ice beneath, and had become distinctly larger and
 granular, differing little from those in the undisturbed snow beside
 them, which were by this time like small transparent hailstones, often
 already grown together into rods and groups.       The temperature of the
 air in the meantime, though rising, had never reached 0° C, while the
 ice yet retained much of the cold of early spring.
    A similar growth towards the cold, but upwards instead of down
 wards, takes place while the temperature of the air       below that of the
                                                                  is
floes or the earth, and helps the wind to harden and crust the upper
snow.     With a hope of testing this growth, two cubes were cut out of
the same block of snow, and made to weigh exactly 50 grms. each.

    Admiral Wrangell, in describing the heavy ice grounded                 along the
northern shores of Siberia, accounts for both its thickness and its
stratification by the sliding one upon another of thinner floes.*
Admiral Belcher referred some of the great ice mases in Wellington
Channel to the same cause,t but the stratification of the floes met with
by our expedition cannot be thus accounted for. The behaviour of
strata overlying an old surface-dome, best shown in the accompanying
little diagram (fig. 1) — a copy of a pencil sketch made from nature —
is utterly inconsistent with the sliding-up hypothesis.
                                        Fig. 1.
    The subject of this sketch afforded the only instance of stratifica
tion overlying a " blue dome " seen by me. Any deviations from the
horizontal      and parallel were in fact extremely rare, and one of the
first    convictions forced upon me by the facts of the stratification was
that    the floes which showed it could not have been formed in such a
region of chaotic disturbance        as lay about us.
    Massive floes drifted from the westward into the channels of the
Parry group, or floating southward in Spitzbergen seas, have made

 often occurring in miniature mountain ranges on heavy floes are not to
 be confounded with " bine domes." They occur along ancient lines of
 fissure, and are simply old hummocks rounded off by snowdrift.

 floe ice has been frequently recorded ; sometimes                it is clearly traceable
 to neighbouring land, at others, as in the case                 of the kryokonite of
 Professor Nordenskiold,* and the dust of the East Greenland, f and
 Spitzbergen ice-fields,J its source is more or less conjectural.
     At Floeberg Beach every breeze strewed the ice with dnst from
 shore, consisting of fine sand from the neighbouring hills (effervescing
 with acid), and organic debris of all sorts, bits of saxifrage and moss
 and lemming pellets predominating.              Such dust was generally confined
 to the surface       of  the   ice, but  a  fragment from a bud of Saxifraga
oppositifolia, recognised by its claw, was found in a dust-line 45 feet
                                                   " south ravine," and a dust-line

of three successive " super-glacial lakes,"§ yielded a lemming hair and

described in connexion with the chlorine estimations.                   The walls of the

of the pool was marked with a dust-line.                  A similar, but fainter, bine
passing through the whole berg, lay 8 feet deeper down without any
appearance of a pool over it.             In these and other dust-lines observed
in the floes the line consisted of scattered black points in the ice, some
times two or three in a cubic inch, oftener only the same number
in a cubic foot.            Each spot consisted of a single air-cell, rarely
more than           inch in diameter, with its lower half lined with impal
pable dust, but otherwise like the air-cells around it. The spot was

chipping out lumps of ice holding granules or freighted cells, washing
them in their own surface-melting, and putting them into clean bottles

often retaining its shape till shaken.             As the surface of a wasting floe

    A very much worn floe to seaward of the ship supplied a large
quantity of dnst with precisely similar inorganic contents, but enor
mously magnified in apparent quantity and converted into a slimy,
granular, sour-smelling mud by a growth of a phycochromaceous Alga.*
Some of the granules deep in ice were altogether inorganic, others
held another Alga com posed of groups of dark brown spheres -j^o inch
in diameter, associated with spined hemispherical caps t „\,0 inch
diameter, apparently the skins of zygospores.                  In dust-spots under
lying distinctly salt ice Diatomacece naturally attached t were not
uncommon.
    The inorganic part of the dust consists of                a  reddish impalpable
sand of even-sized particles, rarely reaching                  inch in diameter, but
averaging one-tenth of that size.               Placed in    a Sonstadt's       solution,
specific  gravity 2-72,        it separates into a red part that floats, and             a
much smaller dark green part that sinks.                   The former consists of
angular and rounded transparent quartz and rounded red quartz.
The fraction that sinks contains rounded grains of hornblende, angular
and rounded augite, brown scales of mica, and numerous crystals of
magnetite, sharply angular and often imbedded in augite or quartz.
    The dust becomes bright red on incineration, but some of the par
ticles still remain magnetic.          I searched carefully for, but never found,
a magnetic particle capable of reducing sulphate of copper.
    Two samples of ice-dust were obtained from icebergs, the one at Cape
Frazer, the other at Cape Louis Napoleon.                In both instances the dnst
was in granules imbedded 20 feet or more from the top surface of the
berg.    Neither contained any organic matter.                One remained on the
filter-paper aggregated in the granules or oolite-like grains.                      Both
effervesced with hydrochloric acid, but otherwise possessed the same
mineral characters as the floeberg dnst.
    During winter at Floeberg Beach an attempt was made to collect
atmospheric dust by means of an extemporised Maddox aereoscope,
but it invariably got blocked with snow when there was any wind, and
was of course useless when there was none.                A sheet of glass, exposed

melted, a very small, but quite distinct, sediment formed, consisting
of quartose particles, a few red grains, and very minute opaque
nodules ; thus fairly representing the chief constituents of the ice-dast.
    I  have to regret the incompleteness and absence of pre-arranged
order in the observations that were made, but most of the subjects
were altogether unforeseen, and it was necessary to take them up and
make the best of them just as they presented themselves.
   My notes have perhaps little bearing on the place of growth of the
so-called
           " polar floes ;" any hypothesis on that subject must give full
weight to their wide distribution on both the oceanic and littoral con
fines of the unknown area ; but the stratification of the floes nnmis-
takeably indicates that the precipitation of the region where they form
accumulates where it falls. The "conglomerate" sometimes under
lying it tells of slow lateral removal by fission and intermediate freezing,
while the " blue-topped " floes and the wasting grounded ice mark a
region where temperature gathered in summer by the naked land
releases the precipitation and restores it to the sea in the shape of out
flowing arctic currents of low specific gravity.

      OBITUARY NOTICES OF FELLOWS DECEASED.
    Karl Ernst   von Baer, one of the ten children of Magnus von Baer,
•was born at the family estate of Piep, in Esthonia, on the 28th of
February, 1792. The first seven years of his life were spent in the
house of his childless uncle,  Karl von Baer, who seems to have had a
¦wholesome dread    of premature teaching, for when the young nephew
returned in his eighth year to his father's house in order to be educated
with his sisters, he did not so much as know his letters, though he had
so far grown in mind as to be heartily ashamed of his backwardness.
He speedily, however, made up for lost time, and in 1807 was entered
at the High School of Reval, which he left in 1810 to join the Uni
versity of Dorpat.      Already drawn towards natural history, and
especially towards botany, he became a student of medicine, and on
the 29th of August, 1814, took his degree of doctor.         The medical
teaching at Dorpat was at that time far from satisfactory ; from none
of his masters save from Burdach, the physiologist, can Baer be said
to have learnt anything, and when he became doctor he felt that his
medical training had yet to begin. He accordingly moved to Vienna ;
but the more he tried to throw himself into purely medical studies, the
more he felt that fate had not destined him for an active professional
life.    In the spring of 1815, happening to make with a friend a visit
to the neighbouring Schneeberg, the Alpine flora he there found so
powerfully revived his repressed love of botanical studies, that he
determined at all risks to devote himself as far as possible to science.
 An accidental interview with von Martius determined him to place
 himself in the same summer under Dollinger, at Wurzburg, and the
 merit of having made von Baer an anatomist must be reckoned to the
 credit of that worthy teacher. Thither also came Baer's friend and
 countryman, Pander, to begin under Dollinger those studies on the
 development of the chick in which Baer was destined afterwards to
 take so great a part.    At Wurzburg, however, Baer showed nothing
 more than a friendly interest in these investigations, and when in 1817
 he moved to Konigsberg to become prosector to Burdach, who had in
 1814 been transferred thither from Dorpat, he threw himself with
 zeal into the ordinary anatomical and zoological studies.        He had
 spent the previous winter in Berlin in order to fit himself more fully
 for his new post. His activity soon made itself felt ; besides his purely
 anatomical lectures and demonstrations he found time to deliver an
 anthropological course, thus early indicating the tendencies to which
 lie gave up so many of his later years, and in 1819 to establish a new
    vol. xxvn.                                                 a

                                           11
 zoological museum.       In the same year he was made Professor Extra-
ordinarius,    and, looking upon himself as now settled at Konigsberg,
 married Friiulein von Modem.            In 1822 he became Professor Ordi-
 narius, and in 182G succeeded Burdach as Professor of Anatomy and
 Director of the Anatomical Institute.
    Ever since his arrival at Konigsberg           he had devoted    himself with
 great energy to zootomy, and published several zoological and ana
tomical papers, notable among which is one containing the first
exposition of his views on animal types. In 1818, however, he received
from his friend Pander a copy of the monograph on the development
of the chick, the study of which led him in the spring of 1819 to
commence those embryological investigations with which his name will
ever be connected.       These were carried on with unwearied diligence
for seven years, and it was not until 1827 that he made his results
known in the form of a contribution to Burdach's Physiology.                    In
his capacity as editor, however, Burdach saw fit to make so many
changes and omissions as greatly to dissatisfy Baer, who determined
to publish his researches in an independent form. This he did in 1828
under the title of " Ueber Entwickelungsgeschichte der Thiere, Beo-
bachtung und Reflexion."           Meanwhile, in the spring of 1827, he had
made the important discovery of the existence of the mammalian ovary
in the ovum.
   The " Entwickelungsgeschichte
                                          " consists, in the first
                                                                   place, of a de
tailed chronological description of the development of the chick in the
egg ; and, in the second place, of general deductions and reflexions in
the form of scholia and corollaries.            Almost immediately afterwards
Baer began a more general and systematic aecount of development
under the title of " Vorlesungen iiber Zeuguug und Entwicklung der
organischen Korper."          The first sheets of this were printed in 1829,
but the work was then interrupted for several years, and was finally pub
lished without the author's permission in 1834 as the second part of
the  " Entwickelungsgeschichte."
   In  1827 Baer received         an invitation to become a member of the
Academy     of  Sciences  at  St.  Petersburgh. This he did not immediately
accept ; but in 1829, without resigning his professorahip at Konigsberg,
made a journey to St. Petersburgh to see whether it would be possible
for him to carry on his investigations in that city.             He found, how
ever,  the hindrances    to  work   so many     and  great, that he declined the
call and returned to his old post, throwing himself with renewed
vigour into his studies.          A few years later these incessant labours
began to tell upon his health.         He grew enfeebled, his nights became
sleepless,  and  he  began   to fear  that   his work was ended.      Just at this
juncture his elder brother, who was in possession of the family estate,
died, and his sisters strongly pressed him to undertake the charge of
the property which would eventually pass to his own son.                    These

                                     iii
seignorial duties would be perfectly compatible with a residence at
St. Petersburgh, and accordingly in the summer of 1834 he bade
good-bye to the scene of his labours and triumphs, and at the end of
the year entered npon his new duties at St. Petersburgh as zoological
member of the Academy of Sciences.           He soon afterwards became
one of the librarians of the Academy's library, and in 1841 was
appointed Professor of Comparative Anatomy and Physiology in the
Medico-Chirurgical Academy; this latter post, however, he resigned
after a few years.
   With his departure from Konigsberg Baer's labours as an embryo-
logist may be said to have closed ; the rest of his life he devoted to an
thropology, using that word in its widest   sense.  He took advantage of
his position in the Academy to employ the resources of the Russian Em
pire in collecting materials for the study of the natural history of man.
"  Das Studium der Bildungsgeschichte des menschlichen Geschlechtes,
die hochste aller Wissenschaften." Not content with setting out others
on travels of inquiry, with drawing up instructions as to what they
should observe and collect, with directing and superintending the
publication of their results, he must needs himself undertake long
voyages ; and these were at intervals continued until he had reached
an advanced age.       In 1837 he journeyed, not without dangers and
hardships,  to  Nova Zembla, and again in 1840 to the North Cape.
In 1851 he began with the assistance of the Imperial Government a
series of voyages in order to investigate the conditions of the fisheries
of the Russian Empire. Besides shorter visits to the northern seas he
spent nearly the whole of four years, from 1853 to 1857, in the neigh
bourhood of the Caspian Sea, returning to St. Petersburgh twice only
during the interval. And in 1860 he again journeyed south, this
time to the Sea of Azov. In all these wanderings he had in view the
solution of problems not only of national economy but of the distribu
tion and conditions of life of animals, plants, and man, of natural
history, in fact, in its widest sense.   It was chiefly in the interests of
anthropology that in 1858-61 he visited the museums of the Continent
and of London.
   In 1864 he celebrated the jubilee of his doctorate, on which occasion
was published, in a handsome volume, an account of his life, written
by himself, at the request of the Ritterschaft of his native province.
The same year, however, brought sorrow as well as joy, for it took
from him his wife ; and feeling himself now weighted with the burden
of years, he resigned his post as ordinary member of the Academy,
becoming an honorary member instead, and in 1866 removed to
Dorpat, where he could live more quietly than in the imperial city,
and where he was nearer to the family estate. But not even here did
he altogether rest, devoting much time in these later years to an
exposition of his general views, and especially to a criticism of

                                       iv
 Darwinism, of which       he remained to the end an opponent.           His
activity  was  at last broken    by the   increasing infirmities of old age,
and on the 28th November, 1876, at five in the afternoon, he passed
away.     Only ten days before his death had he prepared for publica
tion  a communication    to the " Archiv. fur Anthropologic."
   In 1854 he was elected a foreign member of the Society, and in
1867 he received the Copley medal.
   Thus, as with so many other great men, Baer's intellectual life
passed through two phases : an embryological            phase to which the
strength of his manhood was devoted, and an anthropological phase
which absorbed the energy of his later years. And, as with other
great men, it is by virtue of the earlier phase that his name is destined
never to be forgotten.      It is no disrespect to his later labours to say
that they cannot, in importance, be for one moment compared to the
work of those seven years which produced the " Entwickelungsge-
schichte." When, in 1819, Baer put his hand to the plough, sixty
years had passed since Wolff published his
                                               " Theoria Generationis," and
during the whole of that long interval there had been no worthy em
bryological work, save Pander's tract, which, though admirable, was
but a fragment ; the skeleton which Wolff had put together had as
yet to be clothed, and the views to which Wolff's genius had by in
stinct led him, needed still to be made sure by detailed proofs. When
in 1828 Baer sent his sheets to the press, the story of the growth of
the chick was in its main features complete.           The varied manifold
labours of embryologists since that day have filled up gaps and
rounded off angles in Baer's edifice, but they have hardly touched the
structure itself.
   But it is almost the least of Baor's merits to have made known a
mass of new facts touching the formation of the bird and other animals.
Facts were to him useless, save as bricks wherewith to build up true
views of nature.     All through his slow toilsome study of the folds
and twists, the thickenings and thinnings of the growing chick, he
was supported by the sure hope that in the flitting shadows of em
bryonic forms was to be found the key to the laws of animal organisa
tion.   He wrote to Pander, " Gleich einem leuchtendeu Strahle sehoss
es mir durch die Seele, dass der Typus im Ban der Wirbelthiere sich
allmiihlig im Embryo ausbildet." It is not on account of the extent
and accuracy of his work, for others, such as Rathke, have been as
laborious and accurate, that Baer's inquiries mark an epoch. It is
because he was the first, if not actually to see (for Merkel had some
twenty years before laid hold of the same truth), at least clearly to
enunciate, and indeed to demonstrate, the important law that the
embryonic phases of the individual are tokens of the relations of kind
and race.
   Working    as we do now    in the light of the doctrine of natural selec

                                     V
tion, we can see that Biier stopped short when he ought to have gone
on.   He was satisfied when he had applied his law of " progress from
the general to the special," so far as to make it clear that the manifold
forms of animal life were educts of a few general types. He did not
see, and to the end refused to admit,   that these types were themselves
the educts of an evolution.    And the antagonism which in his later
years  he manifested   towards  modern views of evolution and recent
embryology was based on the feeling that the new doctrine swept
away the necessity for ultimate abstract types.        Like the theory of
epicycles in the old astronomy, Baer's views have succumbed before
a simpler conception, of tho truth of which the results of his own
labours afford some of the strongest supports.       Like the epicyclists,
Baer largely prepared the way for the wider doctrine which has
swallowed up his own.
